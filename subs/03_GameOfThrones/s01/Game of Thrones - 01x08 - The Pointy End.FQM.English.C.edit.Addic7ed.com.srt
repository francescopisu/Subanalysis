3
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,125
Yah!
Left high, left low.

4
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,779
Right low, lunge right.

5
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:24,650
You break anything,
the Septa will have my head.

6
00:02:24,684 --> 00:02:26,485
What is--

7
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:40,330
Your sister knew perfectly
well we were to leave today.

8
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:42,532
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.

9
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:45,268
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

10
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:47,838
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

11
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:49,773
Hush!

12
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:52,009
Go back to your room.

13
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,346
Bar the doors

14
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,581
and do not open them for anyone
you do not know.

15
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:59,284
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

16
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,120
Run!

17
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:06,525
<i>This way!</i>

18
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:22,205
Left, right.
Rah!

19
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,940
Now you are dead.

20
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:25,942
You said right,

21
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,844
but you went left.

22
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:30,079
And now you are a dead girl.

23
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:31,714
Only 'cause you lied.

24
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:34,383
My tongue lied.
My eyes

25
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:37,620
shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.

26
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:40,156
I was so.
I watched, but you--

27
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,660
Watching is not seeing,
dead girl.

28
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,366
The seeing, the true seeing,

29
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,836
that is the heart of swordplay.

30
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:58,844
Arya Stark, come with us.

31
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:01,614
Your father wants to see you.

32
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:04,016
And why is it

33
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,485
that Lord Eddard is
sending Lannister men

34
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,721
in place of his own?
I am wondering.

35
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:11,824
Mind your place,
dancing master.

36
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:14,393
<i>This is no concern of yours.</i>

37
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:16,262
My father wouldn't send you.

38
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,501
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

39
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:24,870
Take her.

40
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:28,874
Are you men or snakes, that you
would threaten a child?

41
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:31,043
Get out of my way, little man.

44
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:43,021
...And you will be speaking
to me with more respect.

45
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:45,657
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.

46
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:49,929
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

47
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:52,598
Run to your father.

48
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,822
Bloody oafs.

49
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,724
Be gone now, Arya.

50
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,328
Come with me.
Run.

51
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:24,966
The First Sword of Braavos
does not run.

52
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:39,013
What do we say

53
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,982
to the God of Death?

54
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,884
Not today.

55
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,853
Go.

56
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,513
Not today.
Not today.

57
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:24,858
Stay away from me.

58
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,559
I'll tell my father.

59
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,562
I'll-- I'll tell the Queen.

60
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:33,299
Who do you think sent me?

61
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:47,680
Needle.

62
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:52,952
There she is.

63
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:55,254
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

64
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,990
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

65
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:59,091
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.

66
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,693
<i>She'll</i> reward me--
the Queen!

67
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:02,895
Stay away!

68
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,629
Lord Stark,
you must be thirsty.

69
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:39,233
Varys.

70
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:43,337
I promise you
it isn't poisoned.

71
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,309
Why is it no one ever
trusts the eunuch?

72
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,620
Not so much, My Lord.

73
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,689
I would save the rest,
if I were you.

74
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:03,593
Hide it. Men have been known to die
of thirst in these cells.

75
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,965
What about my daughters?

76
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,534
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

77
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,770
Even my little birds
cannot find her.

78
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:16,340
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

79
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:19,944
Cersei will keep her close. The rest
of your household though--

80
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:22,146
all dead, it grieves me to say.

81
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,448
I do so hate
the sight of blood.

82
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,819
You watched my men being
slaughtered and did nothing.

83
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,155
And would again, My Lord.

84
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,592
I was unarmed, unarmored and
surrounded by Lannister swords.

85
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:37,961
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

86
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:46,269
What madness led you
to tell the Queen

87
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:49,106
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

88
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,443
The madness of mercy.

89
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:57,881
That she might
save her children.

90
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,749
<i>Ah, the children.</i>

91
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:02,653
It is always
the innocents who suffer.

92
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:05,588
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert,
nor the boar.

93
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:09,092
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

94
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:12,361
but it was your mercy
that killed the King.

95
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:19,301
I trust you know you are
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

96
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,607
The Queen can't kill me.

97
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:29,110
Cat holds her brother.

98
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:31,846
The wrong brother sadly.

99
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:33,615
And lost to her.

100
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,584
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

101
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,858
If that's true,

102
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:46,428
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

103
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:49,031
Not today, My Lord.

104
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,904
Tell me something, Varys.

105
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,441
Who do you truly serve?

106
00:09:58,677 --> 00:10:01,345
The Realm, My Lord.

107
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,647
Someone must.

108
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:25,368
It's Othor, without a doubt.

109
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:28,304
The other one is
Jafer Flowers, My Lord,

110
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,107
<i>less the hand</i>
<i>the wolf tore off.</i>

111
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:34,144
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

112
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:37,047
Just these two, My Lord.

113
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:39,083
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

114
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:41,853
- Mmm.
- The smell.

115
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:46,859
What smell?

116
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:49,929
There is none.

117
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:53,699
If they'd be dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

118
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:56,435
We should burn them.

119
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:59,505
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.

120
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:01,707
The wildling way.

121
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:04,477
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

122
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:07,680
You may be a coward, Tarly,

123
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:09,849
<i>but you're not stupid.</i>

124
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:13,919
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

125
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,423
Lord Commander,

126
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:19,959
Maester Aemon awaits you
in his chambers--

127
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:23,829
A raven from King's Landing.

128
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,731
Come on, move 'em out.

129
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:40,309
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

130
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:43,279
<i>and pour one for yourself.</i>

131
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,658
The King is dead.

132
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,304
Is there any word of my father?

133
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,573
Sit.

134
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:19,612
Lord Stark has been

135
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:22,248
charged with treason.

136
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,684
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

137
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:27,454
to deny the throne
to Prince Joffrey.

138
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:43,440
<i>I hope you're not thinking</i>
<i>of doing anything stupid.</i>

139
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:46,910
Your duty lies here now.

140
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:50,013
My sisters were
in King's Landing too.

141
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,451
I'm sure they'll be

142
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:56,286
treated gently.

143
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:02,559
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

144
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:06,063
King Robert's body
was still warm

145
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:10,367
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

146
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:12,770
He wouldn't do that.

147
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:15,673
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.

148
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,810
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

149
00:13:18,844 --> 00:13:22,481
Send for my father. He'll tell you--
the King was his friend.

150
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:25,584
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of
any wrong. We know that.

151
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:29,120
<i>Yet you are the daughter</i>
<i>of a traitor.</i>

152
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:31,322
How can I allow you
to marry my son?

153
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:34,525
<i>A child born</i>
<i>of a traitor's seed</i>

154
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,893
is no fit consort for our King.

155
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:39,562
<i>She is a sweet thing now,</i>
<i>Your Grace,</i>

156
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:42,064
but in 10 years who knows

157
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:44,066
what treasons she may hatch?

158
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:47,169
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife
to him, you'll see.

159
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:51,774
I'll be a Queen just like you,
I promise. I won't hatch anything.

160
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:55,778
The girl is innocent,
Your Grace.

161
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:59,615
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

162
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:08,825
Little dove, you must
write to Lady Catelyn

163
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,194
and your brother,
the eldest, what's his name?

164
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:12,963
Robb.

165
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:15,766
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

166
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:18,202
Best it comes from you.

167
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,605
If you would help your father,

168
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,075
urge your brother
to keep the King's peace.

169
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:27,012
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

170
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:36,654
If-- if I could see my father,
talk to him about--

171
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:42,626
You disappoint me, child.

172
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,961
We have told you
of your father's treason.

173
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:47,163
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

174
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,465
I only meant that--

175
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:53,503
What will happen to him?

176
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:58,907
- That depends.
- On-- on what?

177
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,809
On your brother.

178
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:06,181
And on you.

179
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:16,693
Treason?

180
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:18,862
Sansa wrote this?

181
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:21,265
It is your sister's hand,
but the Queen's words.

182
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:25,402
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

183
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:28,539
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his ass kissed?

184
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:32,076
This is a royal
command, My Lord.

185
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,579
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.

186
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:38,382
His Grace summons me
to King's Landing,

187
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,851
I'll go to King's Landing.

188
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:43,620
But not alone.

189
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:47,457
Call the banners.

190
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,826
All of them, My Lord?

191
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:52,732
They've all sworn to defend
my father, have they not?

192
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:53,957
They have.

193
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:57,133
Now we see what
their words are worth.

194
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:00,403
Yeah.

195
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:11,047
Are you afraid?

196
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:15,585
I must be.

197
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,788
Good.

198
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:19,856
Why is that good?

199
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:22,192
It means you're not stupid.

200
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,484
You've had this since dawn?

201
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,087
He sent it to me, not you.

202
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:53,556
I've only shown it
to you as a courtesy.

203
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:55,458
A courtesy?!

204
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:57,494
My husband has been
taken prisoner.

205
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,162
My son intends to declare war.

206
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:01,064
A war?

207
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:03,500
Your son against
the Lannisters?

208
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:07,904
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

209
00:17:07,938 --> 00:17:11,107
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

210
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:13,844
He is your brother by law!

211
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:16,747
Does family mean
nothing to you?

212
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:19,650
Family means everything to me.

213
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:22,119
And I will not
risk Robin's life

214
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:24,622
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

215
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:27,558
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

216
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:29,793
You just ate.

217
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:32,663
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?

218
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:36,533
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

219
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,871
You're always
welcome here, sister.

220
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:43,907
But if you're asking me to send men
from the Vale to fight--

221
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:46,143
That is what I ask.

222
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:50,981
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.

223
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,617
I'll feed you after.

224
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,292
If you fear for the safety
of your son--

225
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:03,994
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

226
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:06,530
Are you an idiot?

227
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:08,966
They killed my husband.

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,435
<i>You say they shoved</i>
<i>your boy from a window.</i>

229
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:14,004
These people will do anything.

230
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:16,105
And that is why
we have to stop them.

231
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,678
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

232
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:26,448
where they belong,
to protect their Lord.

233
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:43,267
Will you shut up?

234
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,405
There's hill tribes
all around here.

235
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,908
If I'm going to die,

236
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:52,277
it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

237
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:55,548
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

238
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:58,851
Eh? What would
you do then?

239
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:01,721
Starve, most likely.

240
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:03,589
You don't think
I'd do it, do you?

241
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:08,127
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

242
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:11,064
Golden women?

243
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:13,300
Stick with me
and you'll have them all,

244
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:16,168
for as long as I'm around
and not for a moment longer.

245
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:19,471
But you knew that.

246
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:23,074
That is why you so valiantly took
up arms to defend my honor.

247
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,279
Fair enough.

248
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:29,849
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

249
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:32,452
and "My Lord" you
every time you take a shit.

250
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:35,755
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

251
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:38,993
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

252
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,629
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

253
00:19:41,664 --> 00:19:45,067
And if the day ever comes when
you're tempted to sell me out,

254
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,835
remember this:

255
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,738
Whatever their price,
I'll beat it.

256
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,873
I like living.

257
00:19:56,479 --> 00:20:00,315
<i>Tyrion.</i>

258
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:03,151
Tyrion.

259
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:09,191
Tyrion.

260
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:33,583
Come, share our fire.

261
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:36,385
Help yourselves to our goat.

262
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,660
When you meet your Gods,
you tell them

263
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,629
Shagga Son of Dolf

264
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,032
of the Stone Crows sent you.

265
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:54,470
I am Tyrion son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

266
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:57,539
How would you like to die,
Tyrion son of Tywin?

267
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:01,710
In my own bed, at the age of 80

268
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:04,612
with a bellyful of wine and
a girl's mouth around my cock.

269
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:13,021
Take the half man.

270
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:15,823
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

271
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,959
No no no no no!

272
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:21,062
My-- my House is rich
and powerful.

273
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:23,764
If you see us
through these mountains,

274
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,767
my father will
shower you with gold.

275
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,836
We have no use
for a half man's promises.

276
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,441
Half a man maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

277
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:34,076
What do the Stone Crows do?

278
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,345
Hide behind rocks and shiver

279
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,348
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

280
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,017
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

281
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,254
Good enough for killing sheep,

282
00:21:45,288 --> 00:21:47,022
if the sheep don't fight back.

283
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,258
Lannister smiths
shit better steel.

284
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:58,333
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

285
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:12,615
That trinket is worth more than
everything your tribe owns.

286
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:17,889
But if you help us,
Shagga Son of Dolf,

287
00:22:17,923 --> 00:22:20,592
I will not give you trinkets.

288
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:23,095
I will give you this.

289
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:25,598
What is "this"?

290
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,301
The Vale of Arryn.

291
00:22:29,336 --> 00:22:32,638
The Lords of the Vale have always
spat upon the hill tribes.

292
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:36,876
The Lords of the Vale
want me dead.

293
00:22:38,578 --> 00:22:41,680
I believe it is time
for new Lords of the Vale.

294
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:51,422
<i>Now there's a rare sight--</i>

295
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:54,959
not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

296
00:23:05,904 --> 00:23:08,706
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

297
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:14,044
Blood will always tell.

298
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:17,215
You'll hang for this, bastard.

299
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:39,735
I told you not to do
anything stupid.

300
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,405
You're confined
to quarters. Go.

301
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,100
Ghost, what's wrong?

302
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:13,338
Is something out there?

303
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:47,471
Commander?

304
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:53,511
Stay.

305
00:25:04,824 --> 00:25:07,059
Hello?

306
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:17,003
Who's there?

307
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:26,746
Lord Commander?

308
00:25:53,242 --> 00:25:55,076
<i>Snow?</i>

309
00:25:55,111 --> 00:25:56,711
Commander!

310
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:12,626
Move move!

311
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:33,714
What did they do?

312
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,169
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

313
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:57,106
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

314
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,976
ships to sail to Westeros.

315
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,227
Jorah, make them stop.

316
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,495
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

317
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,032
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

318
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:37,247
Princess, you have
a gentle heart,

319
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,283
<i>but this is how</i>
<i>it's always been.</i>

320
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:42,286
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.

321
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:57,200
<i>Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.</i>
<i>Me qorasokh anni!</i>

322
00:27:57,234 --> 00:28:01,370
- Come.
- <i>Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!</i>

323
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,477
What do you want
done with them?

324
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:11,079
Bring her to me.
And those women there.

325
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:15,383
You cannot claim
them all, Princess.

326
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,452
I can,

327
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:20,188
and I will.

328
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:22,190
Me fati!

329
00:28:22,224 --> 00:28:25,694
Khaleesi vazha

330
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,063
ch'anha afichak

00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:30,933
Me vastoe hatif anni;

332
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,669
<i>ahhazaan yer nemo vacchaki.</i>

333
00:29:59,722 --> 00:30:02,624
<i>Ohos.</i>

334
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:05,793
<i>Ohos.</i>

335
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,545
Thank you, silver lady.

336
00:31:37,782 --> 00:31:40,249
Who are you?

337
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:43,219
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.

338
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:47,624
My mother was godswife
here before me.

339
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:50,093
She taught me how to make
healing smokes and ointments.

340
00:31:50,127 --> 00:31:53,130
<i>All men are of one flock,</i>
<i>so my people believe.</i>

341
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:55,266
The Great Shepherd sent me
to Earth to heal his--

342
00:32:00,907 --> 00:32:02,908
Lamb or lion,

343
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:05,611
his wound must be
washed and sewn

344
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:07,912
<i>or it will fester.</i>

345
00:32:36,507 --> 00:32:39,810
For 30 years
I've been making corpses

346
00:32:39,844 --> 00:32:41,678
out of men, boy.

347
00:32:41,713 --> 00:32:44,447
I'm the man you want
leading the vanguard.

348
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:47,983
Galbart Glover
will lead the van.

349
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:50,685
The bloody Wall will melt

350
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,788
before an Umber marches
behind a Glover.

351
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:56,858
<i>I</i> will lead the van

352
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,193
or I will take my men

353
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,328
and march them home.

354
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:08,936
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

355
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:12,040
And when I am done
with the Lannisters

356
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,375
I will march back north,

357
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,877
root you out of your keep

358
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,581
and hang you
for an oathbreaker.

359
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:20,616
Oathbreaker, is it?!

360
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:24,754
I'll not sit here
and swallow insults

361
00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:27,323
from a boy so green
he pisses grass.

362
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:43,805
My Lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

363
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,907
<i>against your liege lord.</i>

364
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:50,245
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant
to cut my meat for me.

365
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:54,717
Your meat...

366
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:02,526
is bloody tough.

367
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,129
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

368
00:34:40,602 --> 00:34:44,171
- Where are you going?
- South. For father.

369
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:45,907
But it's the middle
of the night.

370
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:48,075
The Lannisters have
spies everywhere.

371
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,677
I don't want them
to know we're coming.

372
00:34:50,712 --> 00:34:53,414
They have more men than we do.

373
00:34:53,448 --> 00:34:55,649
Aye, they do.

374
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:57,751
Can't I come with you?

375
00:34:57,786 --> 00:35:00,287
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.

376
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:02,423
And I won't get
in the way, I--

377
00:35:02,457 --> 00:35:04,992
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

378
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:07,161
Until I return
that will be you.

379
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:12,900
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

380
00:35:15,538 --> 00:35:18,907
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

381
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:21,077
I will.

382
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:23,179
I'll send letters
whenever I can,

383
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:25,449
but if you don't hear from me,

384
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:27,384
don't be scared.

385
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:34,692
Until I return.

386
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:57,983
How long have you been
hiding out there?

387
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:01,487
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

388
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:04,757
They've all gone away.

389
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:07,727
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father

390
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:09,963
and they'll come back
with mother.

391
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:14,134
No, they won't.

392
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:20,908
<i>Please watch</i>
<i>over Robb.</i>

393
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:23,410
And watch over all the
other men from Winterfell.

394
00:36:23,444 --> 00:36:26,613
And Theon too, I suppose.

395
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,088
You hear them, boy?

396
00:36:35,123 --> 00:36:37,724
The Old Gods are answering you.

397
00:36:37,758 --> 00:36:39,659
What are you doing here?

398
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:42,562
They're my Gods too.

399
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,668
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only Gods.

400
00:36:49,037 --> 00:36:51,339
Even slaves
are allowed to pray.

401
00:36:51,373 --> 00:36:53,741
You're not a slave.

402
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:58,780
Well, your friend did
put a knife to my throat.

403
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:02,517
I'm not complaining,
little lord,

404
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:05,286
just telling truths.

405
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:09,390
What did you mean
about hearing the Gods?

406
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:11,759
You asked them,

407
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:13,427
they're answering you.

408
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:16,431
Shh.

409
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:18,132
Open your ears.

410
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:25,806
It's only the wind.

411
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:28,843
Who do you think sends the wind

412
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:30,845
if not the Gods?

413
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,581
They see you, boy.

414
00:37:32,615 --> 00:37:35,017
<i>They hear you.</i>

415
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:39,489
Your brother will get no help
from them where he's going.

416
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,325
The Old Gods have
no power in the South.

417
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,029
The weirwoods there were
all cut down a long time ago.

418
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,833
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

419
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,739
Well, there's a big man.

420
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,942
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the Queen.

421
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,344
Go back and find
your clothes, Hodor.

422
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:03,212
<i>Go dress.</i>

423
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,780
Hodor.

424
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,119
Are there really giants
beyond the Wall?

425
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:14,457
Giants and worse than giants.

426
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:17,460
I tried telling your brother,

427
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:19,295
he's marching the wrong way.

428
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:22,832
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

429
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:25,034
North, not south!

430
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,173
The cold winds are rising.

431
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,493
They were touched
by White Walkers.

432
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:51,997
That's why they came back.

433
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:54,900
That's why their eyes
turned blue.

434
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:58,069
Only fire will stop them.

435
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,773
How do you know that?

436
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:03,542
I read about it
in a book--

437
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:06,645
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

438
00:39:09,182 --> 00:39:11,316
What else did the book say?

439
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,251
The White Walkers

440
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:16,054
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

441
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:18,624
And when they wake up--

442
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:23,462
And when they wake up, what?

443
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:28,934
I hope the Wall is high enough.

444
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,766
Summer snows, My Lady.

445
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,836
Robb's brought
the North with him.

446
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,911
The river lords
are falling back

447
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,780
with Jaime Lannister
at their heels.

448
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:20,217
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a
second Lannister army from the south.

449
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:23,021
Our scouts confirm it's even larger
than the Kingslayer's.

450
00:40:23,055 --> 00:40:26,325
One army or two,
the Kings in the North

451
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:30,162
threw back hosts
10 times as large.

452
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,333
Mother!

453
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:40,971
You look well.

454
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:46,243
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome
sight in these troubled times.

455
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,746
We had not thought
to meet you here, My Lady.

456
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:52,283
I had not thought to be here.

457
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,385
I would speak
with my son alone.

458
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,721
I know you will
forgive me, My Lords.

459
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:58,990
You heard her!
Move your asses!

460
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:01,360
Come on, out.

461
00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:04,030
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

462
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:05,966
Have no fear, My Lady.

463
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,768
<i>We'll shove our swords</i>
<i>up Tywin Lannister's bunghole</i>

464
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:11,571
and then it's on to the Red Keep
to free Ned.

465
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:14,539
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

466
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:16,908
You're not
wasting away, are you?

467
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,988
I remember the day
you came into this world

468
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:34,058
red-faced and squalling.

469
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,229
And now I find you
leading a host to war.

470
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:41,666
- There was no one else.
- No one?

471
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,435
Who were those men I saw here?

472
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,539
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

473
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:50,609
If you think you can send me back
to Winterfell--

474
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:52,911
Oh, would that I could.

475
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:57,950
There was...

476
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:00,419
a letter.

477
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,291
From Sansa.

478
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:07,560
From the Queen, you mean.

479
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:18,636
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

480
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,581
How many men do you have?

481
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,017
18,000.

482
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,519
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey--

483
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:39,622
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.

484
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:42,425
Our best hope--
our only hope--

485
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,762
is that you can defeat
them in the field.

486
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,830
And if I lose?

487
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:50,399
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

488
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,437
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

489
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:56,173
On the orders
of Tywin Lannister.

490
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,910
And the years have
not made him kinder.

491
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:04,183
If you lose,

492
00:43:04,217 --> 00:43:06,919
your father dies,

493
00:43:06,953 --> 00:43:08,487
your sisters die,

494
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:10,755
<i>we</i> die.

495
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:15,359
Well, that makes it
simple then.

496
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,695
I suppose it does.

497
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:44,952
From here it might be best if
Bronn and I continue alone.

498
00:43:44,987 --> 00:43:47,556
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.

499
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,591
Not best for me.

500
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:52,795
If the half man betrays us,

501
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:56,265
Shagga Son of Dolf
will cut off his manhood--

502
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,835
And feed it to the goats, yes.

503
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,907
All right then.

504
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,143
Time to meet my father.

505
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:41,278
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

506
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:43,180
Father.

507
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:47,684
The rumors of your demise
were unfounded.

508
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:51,120
Sorry to disappoint you.

509
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,690
And who are these...

510
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,958
<i>companions</i> of yours?

511
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,461
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

512
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,864
<i>Chieftain of the Stone Crows.</i>

513
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:07,268
<i>Timett Son of Timett,</i>
<i>ruler of the Burned Men.</i>

514
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:12,040
<i>This fair maid is</i>
<i>Chella daughter of Cheyk,</i>

515
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:14,443
<i>leader of the Black Ears.</i>

516
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:17,846
And here we have
Bronn son of...

517
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,483
You wouldn't know him.

518
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,055
May I present my lord father,

519
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,724
Tywin son of Tytos
of House Lannister,

520
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:30,827
<i>Lord of Casterly Rock</i>
<i>and Warden of the West?</i>

521
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:35,433
Kind of you
to go to war for me.

522
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,404
You left us no choice.

523
00:45:40,439 --> 00:45:42,506
The honor of the House
was at stake.

524
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:47,178
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

525
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:49,747
We have our differences,
Jaime and I.

526
00:45:49,782 --> 00:45:51,950
He's braver.
I'm better looking.

527
00:45:51,984 --> 00:45:54,319
He's been covering himself
in glory.

528
00:45:54,354 --> 00:45:57,590
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

529
00:45:57,624 --> 00:46:01,293
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

530
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:03,428
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?

531
00:46:03,462 --> 00:46:07,532
Is our hostage. He will lead
no armies from his dungeon cell.

532
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:09,601
How did my sweet sister
persuade the King

533
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:11,503
to imprison
his dear friend Ned?

534
00:46:11,538 --> 00:46:15,508
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

535
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:20,481
My sister rules, you mean.

536
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:23,984
Stark's son has
called his banners.

537
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:27,455
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

538
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:29,256
One taste of battle
and he'll run

539
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:31,860
back to Winterfell
with his tail between his legs.

540
00:46:33,062 --> 00:46:34,562
Maybe.

541
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:37,165
Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

542
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:39,701
You'd like him.

543
00:46:39,735 --> 00:46:43,772
While we're on
the subject of war,

544
00:46:43,806 --> 00:46:46,508
I made promises
to my friends here

545
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:48,910
and a Lannister
always pays his debts.

546
00:46:48,944 --> 00:46:52,013
<i>We shall require</i>
<i>3,000 helms and shields,</i>

547
00:46:52,048 --> 00:46:54,282
plus swords, pikes,

548
00:46:54,316 --> 00:46:56,117
gorgets, maces--

549
00:46:56,151 --> 00:46:58,719
If it please My Lord,

550
00:46:58,753 --> 00:47:00,821
Ser Addam bids me report
that the Northmen

551
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:02,255
have crossed the Neck.

552
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:06,726
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws.

553
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,997
So be it. Kevan, command the
drummers beat assembly.

554
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,636
And send word to Jaime that
I am moving against Robb Stark.

555
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,638
At once, My Lord.

556
00:47:30,587 --> 00:47:33,555
It is said that the men of the
mountain clans are great warriors.

557
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,324
Ride with me against my enemies

558
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,394
and you shall have all
my son promised you and more.

559
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:40,663
Only if the half man
fights with us.

560
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:44,134
Until we hold the steel
he pledged us,

561
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:46,570
the little lion's life is ours.

562
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:54,812
<i>The scouts report</i>
<i>Lord Tywin moves north.</i>

563
00:47:54,846 --> 00:47:56,680
We need to get him
on broken ground,

564
00:47:56,715 --> 00:47:58,382
put his knights
at a disadvantage.

565
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:00,518
No, we need to get around him

566
00:48:00,552 --> 00:48:03,454
and break Jaime Lannister's
siege of Riverrun.

567
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:06,324
Do that and the river lords
will join us.

568
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:08,226
To do either we need to cross
the river

569
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,927
and the only crossing
is at the Twins.

570
00:48:09,961 --> 00:48:11,996
<i>Lord Frey controls</i>
<i>that bridge.</i>

571
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,597
Your father's bannerman.

572
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:16,867
"The late Lord Frey"
my father calls him.

573
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:20,404
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

574
00:48:20,438 --> 00:48:24,475
Some men takes their oaths
more seriously than others.

575
00:48:31,883 --> 00:48:34,618
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

576
00:48:34,652 --> 00:48:36,753
So what's it going to be?

577
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:40,190
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

578
00:48:44,362 --> 00:48:45,896
Your pardon, my lords.

579
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,599
<i>We've captured</i>
<i>a Lannister scout.</i>

580
00:48:50,502 --> 00:48:53,838
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
leaving this tent with his head.

581
00:48:55,174 --> 00:48:56,841
Where did you find him?

582
00:48:56,876 --> 00:48:59,010
In the brush above
the encampment.

583
00:48:59,044 --> 00:49:00,912
<i>He looked to be counting.</i>

584
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:13,158
How high did you get?

585
00:49:15,528 --> 00:49:17,529
20,000.
Maybe more.

586
00:49:18,564 --> 00:49:20,298
You don't have
to do this yourself.

587
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,899
Your father
would understand--

588
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:25,970
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

589
00:49:27,372 --> 00:49:29,206
And he understands honor...

590
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,278
and courage.

591
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,015
Let him go.

592
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:41,385
Robb.

593
00:49:53,397 --> 00:49:56,365
Tell Lord Tywin
Winter is coming for him.

594
00:49:56,399 --> 00:50:01,336
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

595
00:50:03,406 --> 00:50:04,906
Yes, My Lord.

596
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,742
Thank you, My Lord.

597
00:50:16,186 --> 00:50:19,888
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

598
00:50:19,923 --> 00:50:21,958
You call me boy again.

599
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,094
Go on.

600
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:45,312
Oi.

601
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:53,053
<i>It is also the wish</i>
<i>of His Grace</i>

602
00:50:53,088 --> 00:50:58,393
<i>that his loyal servant</i>
<i>Janos Slynt,</i>

603
00:50:58,427 --> 00:51:01,530
- <i>Commander of the City Watch...</i>
- Ser Aron.

604
00:51:01,564 --> 00:51:05,134
<i>...Be at once raised</i>
<i>to the rank of Lord...</i>

605
00:51:05,168 --> 00:51:10,639
- Lord Gyles.
- <i>And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal,</i>

606
00:51:10,673 --> 00:51:14,509
<i>and that his sons and grandsons</i>
<i>shall hold this honor</i>

607
00:51:14,543 --> 00:51:19,647
<i>after him</i>
<i>until the end of time.</i>

608
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:26,819
In the place of the traitor
Eddard Stark,

609
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:31,524
<i>it is the wish of His Grace</i>
<i>that Tywin Lannister,</i>

610
00:51:31,558 --> 00:51:35,361
<i>Lord of Casterly Rock</i>
<i>and Warden of the West,</i>

611
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:39,499
<i>be appointed Hand of the King.</i>

612
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:41,434
Lastly,

613
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:44,303
in these times
of treason and turmoil,

614
00:51:44,337 --> 00:51:47,573
<i>it is the view of the Council</i>

615
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:50,142
that the life and safety

616
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:52,845
of King Joffrey

617
00:51:52,879 --> 00:51:57,116
be of paramount importance.

618
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:01,253
Ser Barristan Selmy.

619
00:52:07,594 --> 00:52:11,097
Your Grace, I am
yours to command.

620
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,233
Rise, Ser Barristan.

621
00:52:14,102 --> 00:52:16,203
You may remove your helm.

622
00:52:21,144 --> 00:52:23,746
<i>You have served the Realm</i>
<i>long and faithfully.</i>

623
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,750
<i>Every man and woman in the</i>
<i>Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.</i>

624
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:31,053
But it is time to put aside
your armor and your sword.

625
00:52:31,087 --> 00:52:33,990
<i>It is time to rest</i>
<i>and look back with pride</i>

626
00:52:34,024 --> 00:52:35,658
on your many years of service.

627
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:40,296
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

628
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:42,498
<i>Our vows are taken for life.</i>

629
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:45,035
Only death relieves us
of our sacred trust.

630
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:48,772
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?

631
00:52:48,806 --> 00:52:51,675
<i>You let my father die.</i>

632
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:54,645
You're too old
to protect anybody.

633
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:59,684
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined

634
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,153
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

635
00:53:02,188 --> 00:53:04,456
<i>as Lord Commander</i>
<i>of the Kingsguard.</i>

636
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,024
The man who profaned his blade

637
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,260
with the blood of the King
he had sworn to defend!

638
00:53:08,294 --> 00:53:10,228
Careful, Ser.

639
00:53:10,262 --> 00:53:11,963
We have nothing but gratitude

640
00:53:11,997 --> 00:53:14,466
for your long service,
good Ser.

641
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,968
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

642
00:53:17,002 --> 00:53:19,337
with servants
to look after your every need.

643
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:21,572
A hall to die in

644
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:24,008
<i>and men to bury me.</i>

645
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,646
I am a knight.

646
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,716
I shall die a knight.

647
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:39,791
A naked knight, apparently.

648
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,372
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

649
00:53:58,544 --> 00:54:01,078
Here, boy!

650
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,548
Melt it down and add it
to the others.

651
00:54:20,064 --> 00:54:22,399
If any man in this hall
has other matters

652
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:25,568
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

653
00:54:25,603 --> 00:54:28,839
or go forth and hold
his silence.

654
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,645
Your Grace.

655
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:36,048
Come forward, My Lady.

656
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:40,553
<i>The Lady Sansa</i>
<i>of House Stark.</i>

657
00:54:42,089 --> 00:54:45,491
Do you have some business for
the King and the Council, Sansa?

658
00:54:45,526 --> 00:54:47,360
I do.

659
00:54:52,232 --> 00:54:55,334
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

660
00:54:55,368 --> 00:54:58,838
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

661
00:54:58,872 --> 00:55:01,740
Treason is a noxious weed.

662
00:55:01,775 --> 00:55:05,945
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.

663
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,682
I want to hear what she says.

664
00:55:08,716 --> 00:55:10,851
Thank you, Your Grace.

665
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:13,488
Do you deny
your father's crime?

666
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:17,993
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.

667
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:20,028
All I ask is mercy.

668
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,932
<i>I know My Lord father</i>
<i>must regret what he did.</i>

669
00:55:22,966 --> 00:55:25,268
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

670
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:27,503
You all know he loved him.

671
00:55:27,538 --> 00:55:31,140
He never wanted to be Hand
until the King asked him.

672
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:34,576
They must have lied to him--
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis

673
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:37,412
or somebody.
They must have lied!

674
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:39,915
He said I wasn't the King.

675
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:42,016
Why did he say that?

676
00:55:42,051 --> 00:55:44,319
He was badly hurt.

677
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:47,221
Maester Pycelle was giving
him milk of the poppy.

678
00:55:47,255 --> 00:55:51,425
He wasn't himself. Otherwise he
never would have said it.

679
00:55:53,761 --> 00:55:57,631
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.

680
00:55:57,665 --> 00:56:01,335
<i>And yet they say</i>
<i>wisdom oft comes</i>

681
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:03,204
from the mouths of babes.

682
00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:07,375
Treason is treason!

683
00:56:10,513 --> 00:56:12,680
Anything else?

684
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,652
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

685
00:56:17,686 --> 00:56:21,188
please do me
this kindness, Your Grace.

686
00:56:30,765 --> 00:56:33,032
Your sweet words have moved me.

687
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:38,003
But your father has to confess.

688
00:56:38,038 --> 00:56:41,640
He has to confess
and say that I'm the King...

689
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,678
Or there'll be
no mercy for him.

690
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,251
He will.
