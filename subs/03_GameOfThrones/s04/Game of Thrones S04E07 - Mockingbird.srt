1
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,526
I made a deal for you
to keep your ungrateful head

2
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:57,495
on your ungrateful neck
a little while longer.

3
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:59,364
<i>I'm sorry,
what am I grateful for?</i>

4
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:01,165
The opportunity to live
and die at the Wall

5
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,167
as punishment for a crime
I did not commit?

6
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:05,403
You threw your life away.
You threw it away.

7
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:08,139
It's not a joke.
You understand that, don't you?

8
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:10,875
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

9
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,580
I couldn't...

10
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:17,515
I couldn't listen to her

11
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:19,951
standing there
telling her lies.

12
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:21,352
I couldn't do it.

13
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:23,955
You fell in love
with a whore.

14
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,057
Yes, I fell in love
with a whore.

15
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:29,827
And I was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

16
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,234
That deal you made,

17
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:39,037
it was everything
Father wanted.

18
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,371
<i>You do see that?</i>

19
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:42,273
<i>He gets you back
as his heir.</i>

20
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:44,509
<i>The future
Lord of the Rock.</i>

21
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:47,211
And he ships me off
to Castle Black,

22
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:49,047
out of sight at last.

23
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:52,517
All so perfect.

24
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,988
It felt good
to take that from him.

25
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,427
He knows I'm innocent and he's
willing to sacrifice me anyway.

26
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:04,395
He's willing
to sacrifice any of us.

27
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,164
Not you.

28
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:08,332
You're the golden son.

29
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,701
You could kill a king,
lose a hand,

30
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,970
fuck your own sister,
you'll always be the golden son.

31
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:14,439
Careful.

32
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:16,841
I'm the last friend
you've got.

33
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,881
At least I got to tell
them what they really are.

34
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,050
Yes, brilliant speech.

35
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,419
They'll be talking
about it for days to come.

36
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:30,855
<i>I thought you were
a realist.</i>

37
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:33,524
Didn't realize
you'd die for pride.

38
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:36,294
Don't give up on me
just yet.

39
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:38,863
I survived one
trial by combat,

40
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,965
even though you weren't
there to save me.

41
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,468
I can't save you
this time either.

42
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:47,171
<i>My training has proved</i>

43
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:50,041
that I can't beat
a stable boy with my left hand.

44
00:03:50,075 --> 00:03:53,177
Where's your sense
of adventure?

45
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:56,447
Even if you lose,
imagine the look

46
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:57,715
on Father's face
when you fall.

47
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:00,084
Our family name snuffed out

48
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,854
with a single swing
of the sword.

49
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:04,489
It is tempting.

50
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,206
Well...

51
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:25,143
Bronn fought for me once,
he'll do it again.

52
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:28,646
If he wins,

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,681
I expect I'll be
in his debt

54
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:32,550
for the rest
of my life.

55
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,252
If he wins.

56
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:35,686
Will you find him for me?

57
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:41,659
Who does Cersei plan
on naming as a champion?

58
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:44,428
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.

59
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:47,932
I'd enjoy watching Bronn
disembowel that pompous child beater.

60
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,834
No.

61
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:52,403
Not Ser Meryn.

62
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:04,148
<i>Go on, move it.</i>

63
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:06,551
And you.

64
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:08,419
Come on.

65
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:20,598
Mercy.

66
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:22,233
Please.

67
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,202
Please, mercy.

68
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,615
Ser Gregor.
Welcome to the capital.

69
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:41,485
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

70
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,458
You seem to be
in good form.

71
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,460
Who am I fighting?

72
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:51,662
Does it matter?

73
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:16,954
Could be food.

74
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:19,023
Could be soldiers.

75
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:46,083
You shouldn't be sitting
out here like this.

76
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:48,519
Where else to sit?

77
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:51,355
Tried to walk back
to my hut,

78
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,858
hurt too much.

79
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:57,295
Then I remembered
they burned my hut down.

80
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,397
Who were "they"?

81
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:01,966
I stopped asking
a while ago.

82
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:08,706
That's not gonna
get better.

83
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,007
Doesn't seem so.

84
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:12,076
A bad way to go.

85
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:15,646
Haven't you had enough?

86
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,415
Of what?

87
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:22,486
I know.

88
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,722
Time to go.

89
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:27,591
Take matters into
my own hands.

90
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:32,396
The thought
has occurred to me.

91
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,902
So why go on?

92
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:40,771
Habit.

93
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,409
Nothing could
be worse than this.

94
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:48,979
Maybe nothing is
worse than this.

95
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:54,752
Nothing isn't better
or worse than anything.

96
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:59,623
Nothing is just nothing.

97
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:06,030
Who are you?

98
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,267
My name is Arya.

99
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:12,570
Arya Stark.

100
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:17,842
You her father?

101
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,677
Her captor.

102
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,813
Bringing her to her aunt
for ransom.

103
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:26,717
A fair exchange,
that is.

104
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:32,289
Always held to the notion
of fair exchange

105
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:34,925
in all my dealings.

106
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,362
You give me,
I give you.

107
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,332
<i>Fair.</i>

108
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,834
A balance.

109
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:48,072
No balance anymore.

110
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:55,813
Could I have
a drink?

111
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:58,149
Dying is thirsty work.

112
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:09,894
Wish it were wine.

113
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:12,997
So do I.

114
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,051
That's where the heart is.

115
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:39,657
That's how you kill a man.

116
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:48,933
The fuck you doing?

117
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:52,803
<i>There's a price
on your head.</i>

118
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:55,606
Guess that's what the king does
when you tell him to fuck off.

119
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,007
The king's dead.

120
00:09:57,042 --> 00:10:00,177
<i>He drank poisoned wine
at his own wedding.</i>

121
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:03,214
The bounty on you is for
killing Lannister soldiers.

122
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:04,648
100 silver stags.

123
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:06,550
And you thought you
were going to collect it?

124
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,687
<i>Didn't think very hard,
did you?</i>

125
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:13,324
You were Yoren's prisoners when
he was taking me to the Wall.

126
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:16,627
He told me he'd fuck
me bloody with a stick.

127
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:20,564
This day's really not working out
the way you planned.

128
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,733
He on your little list?

129
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:25,135
He can't be.

130
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,571
I don't know his name.

131
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:30,374
What's your name?

132
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:33,911
- Rorge.
- Thank you.

133
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,753
You're learning.

134
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:50,628
<i>Rangers returning!</i>

135
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:54,965
<i>They return!</i>

136
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,868
- <i>Rangers returning!</i>
- Greetings.

137
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:00,070
<i>Didn't think I'd see
you again.</i>

138
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:01,705
All right, Jon?

139
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,374
Welcome back, brother.

140
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:14,418
Lord Snow.

141
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:21,959
<i>This is no place
for wild beasts.</i>

142
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,928
Lock him away

143
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:26,096
or I'll let Hobb throw him
in tonight's stew.

144
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:39,009
Come on, Ghost.

145
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,282
Mance's army was closing in
on Craster's Keep when we left.

146
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:48,118
We saw their campfires
from Osric's Hill.

147
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:49,954
They'll reach the Wall
before the next full moon.

148
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:52,323
I'm surprised you didn't
ride over and say hello.

149
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:54,558
The King-beyond-the-Wall
is your old friend, isn't he?

150
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:56,126
We need to prepare.

151
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:57,528
We've been preparing.

152
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:58,929
We should seal the tunnel.

153
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,232
Plug it with rocks
and ice.

154
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,701
Flood it
and let it freeze.

155
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:05,169
<i>And how would we
range north?</i>

156
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:07,237
- We wouldn't.
<i>- Coward.</i>

157
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:09,073
You would cut off
our legs,

158
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,708
pluck out our eyes,

159
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:12,643
leave us cowering
behind the Wall

160
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,545
hoping for the storm
to pass?

161
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,147
We can't defend the gate
against 100,000 men.

162
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:19,650
This castle has stood
for thousands of years.

163
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:23,020
The Night's Watch has defended
her for thousands of years.

164
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:26,156
And in all those centuries, we have
never sealed the tunnel.

165
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:28,459
Have you ever seen
a giant, Ser Alliser?

166
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,661
<i>I have.</i>

167
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:32,630
The tunnel's gate
won't stop them.

168
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,732
The bars on those gates
are four inches thick.

169
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:36,467
Cold-rolled steel.

170
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,702
They won't stop them.

171
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:43,040
Remind me which order
you belong to, Lord Snow.

172
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:45,042
The stewards.

173
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:48,012
Are the stewards responsible
for maintaining the tunnel?

174
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:50,447
No.

175
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:52,149
Who would that be?

176
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,919
- The builders.
- Ah, the builders.

177
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:58,155
First Builder Yarwyck,

178
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:01,158
Lord Snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel,

179
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,861
leaving us unable
to carry out our duties

180
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:06,697
as sworn brothers
of the Night's Watch.

181
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:08,866
Do you agree with him?

182
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,109
No.

183
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:23,781
<i>Given your deep knowledge of
the wildling army, Lord Snow,</i>

184
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:27,184
you and Tarly will take
night duties atop the Wall

185
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:29,086
until the full moon.

186
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,890
<i>Moving on.</i>

187
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:36,794
<i>First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels
of pitch brought atop the wall.</i>

188
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:38,395
<i>Aye.</i>

189
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,221
My lord.

190
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:08,192
You have new clothes.

191
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:10,527
Do you like 'em?
Eh?

192
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,931
Gloves are doeskin.

193
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:15,399
Softer than
a virgin's thighs.

194
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,834
<i>I sent for you
days ago.</i>

195
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:19,703
- I've been a bit busy.
- Doing what?

196
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,342
My lonesome
bachelor days are over.

197
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:29,213
I'm to wed
Lollys Stokeworth.

198
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,449
Lollys Stokeworth?

199
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:36,053
<i>She doesn't strike me
as your sort of girl.</i>

200
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:39,089
I wouldn't say I had
a single sort of girl.

201
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:40,691
She's dim-witted.

202
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:42,126
If I wanted wits,
I'd marry you.

203
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,095
When my sister arranged
this love match,

204
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,265
did she mention that Lollys
has an older sister?

205
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:49,700
Falyse.

206
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,102
Aye, I did know
about the older sister.

207
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:54,171
And you understand
the rules of inheritance?

208
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,506
Falyse is 40
and barren.

209
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,742
<i>She still gets Castle Stokeworth
when her father dies.</i>

210
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,210
She does.

211
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:02,479
Unless she happens
to perish before her father.

212
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:04,381
Then Lollys gets the castle.

213
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:08,452
What? Ladies fall
from their horses

214
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:10,587
and snap their pretty
necks all the time.

215
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:13,056
You and my sister
deserve each other.

216
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:15,893
<i>Why did you bother
to come here?</i>

217
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,636
You once said if anyone ever asked
me to sell you out,

218
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,237
you'd double their price.

219
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:29,606
Is it two wives you want
or two castles?

220
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:31,341
One of each will do.

221
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:34,912
But if you want me
to kill the Mountain for you,

222
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,713
it'd better be
a damn big castle.

223
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:39,116
I'm bit short
on castles at the moment.

224
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,951
But I can offer you
gold and gratitude.

225
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:42,653
I have gold.

226
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:44,121
What can I buy
with gratitude?

227
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:45,689
You might be surprised.

228
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:48,559
A Lannister always
pays his debts.

229
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,394
Your sister's
a Lannister, too.

230
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:52,162
My wife is heir
to Winterfell.

231
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:56,033
<i>If I emerge from this
with my head still on my shoulders,</i>

232
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:59,837
<i>I may one day rule
the North in her name.</i>

233
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,973
I could carve you out
a big piece of it.

234
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,975
If and may and could.

235
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,511
It's bloody
cold up north.

236
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:09,980
Lollys is soft and warm.

237
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:11,782
And close.

238
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:14,484
If I gave you the choice
between fucking Lollys

239
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,486
and fighting the Mountain,
you'd have your britches down

240
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,855
and your cock out
before I could blink.

241
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,690
Does he frighten
you so much?

242
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:21,925
I'd be a bloody fool
if he didn't frighten me.

243
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,827
He's freakish big
and freakish strong.

244
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:26,663
And quicker than
you'd expect for a man of that size.

245
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,300
Maybe I could take him,

246
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,569
dance around
until he's so tired

247
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:34,338
of hacking at me,
he dropped his sword,

248
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:36,406
get him off
his feet somehow.

249
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,375
But one misstep...

250
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,110
and I'm dead.

251
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:42,379
Why should I risk it?

252
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:44,915
Because you're my friend.

253
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,084
Aye, I'm your friend.

254
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:50,520
And when have you ever
risked your life for me?

255
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,698
I like you,

256
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:04,167
pampered little shit
that you are.

257
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:06,536
I just like myself more.

258
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:08,171
I understand.

259
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,873
I'm sorry it has
to be this way.

260
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:11,541
Why are you sorry?

261
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:13,610
Because you're
an evil bastard

262
00:17:13,645 --> 00:17:15,579
with no conscience
and no heart?

263
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:18,315
<i>That's what I liked about
you in the first place.</i>

264
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:26,790
We had some
good days together.

265
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:28,659
Yes, we did.

266
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:44,875
What will you do?

267
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:48,378
I suppose I'll have to kill
the Mountain myself.

268
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:52,316
Won't that make
for a great song?

269
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:58,155
I hope to hear
them sing it one day.

270
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,941
How did you get in here?

271
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:19,609
Your door is well guarded,

272
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:21,778
but your window is not.

273
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:31,121
I swam to an island
a mile offshore for these.

274
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:33,657
Don't do that again.

275
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:37,627
Never met a woman who
didn't like wildflowers.

276
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:40,097
These are my
private quarters.

277
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:42,666
If I want you here,
I will summon you.

278
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:47,104
Forgive me, my queen.
I live to serve you.

279
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:55,412
<i>Tell me why you're here.</i>

280
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,284
I came to ask a favor.

281
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:03,653
I only have two talents
in this world...

282
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:06,023
war and women.

283
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,725
<i>You are staying here
in Meereen to rule.</i>

284
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,961
<i>That is a wise decision.
I respect it.</i>

285
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,875
But here in Meereen,
I cannot pursue my talents.

286
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:15,532
I've ordered the Second Sons
to patrol the streets

287
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,300
to stop
the revenge killing.

288
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:18,602
You've ordered us
to be night watchmen.

289
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:20,570
And as for women,

290
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:24,341
there are thousands
in Meereen you can pursue.

291
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:27,144
There is only one,

292
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:29,813
and she does not
want me.

293
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:32,649
You swore me your sword.

294
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:35,252
My sword is yours
till the day I die.

295
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:37,454
So if I command you
to stay in Meereen

296
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:38,922
and patrol the streets?

297
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,658
I'll stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets.

298
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:44,161
Send me to kill
your enemies.

299
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,496
Any enemy anywhere.

300
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:50,067
Let me do
what I do best.

301
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:53,270
Very well.

302
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:01,311
Do what you do best.

303
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:14,357
Take off your clothes.

304
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:45,088
Oh.

305
00:20:46,324 --> 00:20:48,358
Come in, my queen.
Please.

306
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:50,327
I didn't mean
to disturb you, my lady.

307
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:51,862
You could never
disturb me.

308
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:54,264
I just wanted to speak
with you before we left.

309
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:57,134
Could you bring me
that vial over there?

310
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:01,605
The blue one.

311
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,143
<i>No, no, no.
Not that one.</i>

312
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,378
You don't even want
to touch that one.

313
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:10,580
<i>Next to it.</i>

314
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,616
<i>That's the one.</i>

315
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,303
When I looked into
the flames this morning,

316
00:21:33,337 --> 00:21:35,572
the Lord spoke to me.

317
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:37,474
He said,

318
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:41,978
"Tonight, you will have your
last good bath in a long while.

319
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:44,247
Make it count."

320
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:48,852
A joke.

321
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,656
Not a very good one,
I'm afraid.

322
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,524
It was. I...

323
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,160
humor isn't my strength.

324
00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:58,828
That's because
st jokes are lies

325
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:01,565
and you're devoted
to the truth.

326
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,834
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

327
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,337
Not always.

328
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:18,915
Most of these powders
and potions

329
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,550
are lies.

330
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:25,121
<i>Deceptions to make men
think they witnessed our Lord's power.</i>

331
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:28,625
Once they step into his light,
they will see the lie for what it was...

332
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:31,962
a trick that led them
to the truth.

333
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:34,764
<i>A pinch of this powder
in a bonfire</i>

334
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,034
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

335
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:40,837
And this one creates
a black smoke

336
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,306
that will make the bravest
man piss himself with fear.

337
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:46,776
And a drop of this
in any man's wine

338
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:49,112
will drive him
wild with lust.

339
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,551
Did you use it
with Stannis?

340
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:55,952
No.

341
00:22:58,656 --> 00:23:00,223
Don't be upset.

342
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:03,460
Men never crave
what they already have.

343
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,230
It's only flesh.

344
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:09,899
It needs
what it needs.

345
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,106
No act done in service
of the Lord

346
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,942
can ever be called a sin.

347
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:22,412
I thank God every day
for bringing you to us.

348
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:25,015
And Stannis to you.

349
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,552
He wants to bring
Shireen with us.

350
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:34,024
I think that would be
ill-advised.

351
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:37,694
<i>My daughter has heretical tendencies,
as you're well aware.</i>

352
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,531
I don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

353
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:44,968
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

354
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,274
I understand
how you feel.

355
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:52,676
Hmm.

356
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,911
But that
is impossible.

357
00:23:57,715 --> 00:23:59,749
Why?

358
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:03,620
You don't need powders
and potions, my queen.

359
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,789
You don't need lies.

360
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:09,292
You are strong enough to look into
the Lord's light

361
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:11,661
and see his truth
for yourself.

362
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,602
However harsh it is.

363
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:22,138
However hard for us
to understand.

364
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,208
<i>You don't need my help,</i>

365
00:24:25,242 --> 00:24:28,044
<i>but I will need yours soon.</i>

366
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,114
When we set sail,
your daughter must be with us.

367
00:24:34,652 --> 00:24:36,820
The Lord needs her.

368
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:46,529
Jorah the Andal.

369
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:49,866
Are you here
to see our queen?

370
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:53,703
She's in a good mood.

371
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,653
Khaleesi.

372
00:25:10,688 --> 00:25:13,089
- You're here early.
- Later than some.

373
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:16,860
You don't approve?

374
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:19,295
It's not a question of approval,
it's a question of trust.

375
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,664
You neither
approve nor trust.

376
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:23,299
Why would I?
The man's a sellsword.

377
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:24,868
Didn't you fight for
the Golden Company

378
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:26,436
before pledging
your sword to my brother?

379
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,138
I did.

380
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:29,606
I trust you.

381
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,108
Daario Naharis
killed his captains

382
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:35,311
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

383
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:37,847
How could you ever have
faith in a man like that?

384
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:41,251
I could never have faith
in a man like Daario.

385
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:45,422
That's why I've sent him and
the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

386
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:49,659
- You have?
- I have.

387
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:51,761
Without you there
to rule, Khaleesi,

388
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:54,063
I fear the masters
will simply bide their time,

389
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:56,332
wait for the invaders
to leave and reassert control.

390
00:25:56,367 --> 00:26:00,503
That is why I've ordered Daario
to execute every master in Yunkai.

391
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:04,507
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

392
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:07,010
They mutilate little boys
by the thousands.

393
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:09,446
They train little girls
in the art of pleasuring old men.

394
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,582
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

395
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:16,152
Herding the masters into pens
and slaughtering them by the thousands

396
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:18,188
is also treating men
like beasts.

397
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:20,390
The slaves you freed,

398
00:26:20,424 --> 00:26:22,525
brutality is all
they've ever known.

399
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,661
If you want them to know
something else,

400
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,062
you'll have
to show it to them.

401
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:28,164
And repay the slavers
with what? Kindness?

402
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,699
A fine?
A stern warning?

403
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:32,869
It's tempting to see
your enemies as evil, all of them,

404
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:35,638
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every war ever fought.

405
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:38,141
Let the priests argue
over good and evil.

406
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:39,709
Slavery is real.

407
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:41,978
I can end it.
I will end it.

408
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:44,314
<i>And I will end
those behind it.</i>

409
00:26:44,348 --> 00:26:46,549
I sold men
into slavery, Khaleesi.

410
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:51,421
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

411
00:26:51,455 --> 00:26:54,824
I wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

412
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:57,694
what you want to do
to the masters of Yunkai.

413
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:05,134
The man who came to me
the other day about burying his father.

414
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:07,237
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

415
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:09,973
He will accompany
the Second Sons

416
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,941
and serve as my ambassador
to Yunkai.

417
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:14,944
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

418
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:18,548
He will explain the choice
they have before them.

419
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:20,517
They can live
in my new world

420
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,586
or they can die
in their old one.

421
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:30,193
Well, go and catch Daario
before he leaves.

422
00:27:30,227 --> 00:27:32,095
Tell him
I changed my mind.

423
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:34,497
Yes, Khaleesi.

424
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:41,471
No.

425
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:47,043
Tell him <i>you</i>
changed my mind.

426
00:27:57,788 --> 00:28:00,690
Rat cunts.

427
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:04,427
Fucking whore.

428
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:07,964
<i>You're doing it wrong.</i>

429
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:10,934
You need to burn away
that horrible bit there.

430
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:13,703
<i>Otherwise it's gonna
get infected and fester.</i>

431
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:19,142
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right...

432
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:21,110
No fire.

433
00:28:22,212 --> 00:28:24,414
It'll only take a second.

434
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,849
- It won't hurt that much.
- No fire!

435
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:43,533
Shut up about it.

436
00:28:46,236 --> 00:28:48,271
Shut up about everything.

437
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:50,974
Thanks to you,
I'm a walking bag of silver

438
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:53,276
anywhere the Lannisters
hold sway.

439
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:56,813
Which is everywhere
between where we are now

440
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:58,848
and where we're going.

441
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:04,520
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

442
00:29:04,555 --> 00:29:08,725
getting myself cut
and stabbed and bitten.

443
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:13,630
No reward is worth
this much trouble.

444
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:16,599
<i>Wish I'd never
laid eyes on you.</i>

445
00:29:26,844 --> 00:29:29,846
You say your brother
gave you that sword.

446
00:29:32,216 --> 00:29:34,283
My brother gave me this.

447
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:38,521
It was just like you said
a while back.

448
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:40,356
<i>Pressed me to the fire</i>

449
00:29:40,391 --> 00:29:43,292
like I was a nice
juicy mutton chop.

450
00:29:46,363 --> 00:29:48,064
Why?

451
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:49,966
Thought I stole
one of his toys.

452
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,568
I didn't steal it.
I was just playing with it.

453
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:59,442
The pain was bad.

454
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:01,511
The smell was worse.

455
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:08,851
But the worst thing
was that it was my brother who did it.

456
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,925
My father,
who protected him...

457
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:20,596
told everyone my bedding
caught fire.

458
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:35,712
You think
you're on your own?

459
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:40,316
Let me wash it out

460
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,585
and help you
sew it up at least.

461
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:11,481
Bit of comfort
never hurt anyone.

462
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:13,716
We've been sleeping in
ditches the last few weeks.

463
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,586
I think we can treat
ourselves to a featherbed for the night

464
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,489
and a hot meal
not cooked by you.

465
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:20,990
Couldn't agree
more, my lady.

466
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:22,925
Just don't start expecting
silk underclothes.

467
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,194
Not working for your
former lord any longer.

468
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:27,530
- Yes, my lady.
- Don't get drunk.

469
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:30,333
No, my lady.

470
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:31,834
<i>Can I get you
anything else?</i>

471
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:33,636
No, this will do
nicely, thank you.

472
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,204
Kidney pie is wonderful.

473
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:37,173
Thanks.

474
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:39,408
I do my best.

475
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:43,613
A good kidney pie is all
about the ingredients.

476
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:46,616
<i>Flour, lard, water,
eggs, milk.</i>

477
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,451
Easy enough.
But the meat,

478
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:51,454
peacetime or not, getting your hands on
a good bottom round steak

479
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:53,156
and calves' kidneys
is not easy.

480
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,758
I mean, some people settle
for plain old beef kidneys.

481
00:31:55,793 --> 00:31:58,060
Got no right to cook
anything, them.

482
00:31:58,095 --> 00:31:59,662
Oh, and the gravy.

483
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:01,531
Don't get me started
on the gravy.

484
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:02,932
<i>Very difficult
to get right.</i>

485
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:04,767
<i>See, a lot of people
give up on the gravy.</i>

486
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:07,003
You cannot give up
on the gravy.

487
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:08,604
No gravy, no pie.

488
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,040
Simple as that.

489
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:14,410
That's nice armor.
Are you a knight?

490
00:32:16,513 --> 00:32:17,980
No.

491
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:21,150
Oh, it's just people with
armor are usually knights.

492
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:23,853
<i>Generally speaking.
From King's Landing, though, aren't you?</i>

493
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:26,722
<i>From there myself originally.
Flea Bottom born and bred.</i>

494
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,558
<i>What brings you
to these parts?</i>

495
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:30,593
We're looking
for someone.

496
00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:33,062
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

497
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:35,456
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17...

498
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:37,400
A girl, tall, red hair,
very pretty.

499
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:40,937
Her name is Sansa Stark,
but she may be using a different name.

500
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:42,905
Starks?

501
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:48,911
What, like them lot
from "Winterhell"?

502
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:54,483
No, ain't seen
anyone like that.

503
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:56,252
I heard they was
all traitors.

504
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:58,588
Don't need
no traitors in here.

505
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:01,958
<i>I pledged my life to
their mother Catelyn Stark.</i>

506
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,193
I swore to her I'd bring
her daughters home.

507
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:11,167
Sure I can't get you
a bit more kidney pie?

508
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:26,449
What?

509
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:28,084
It's nothing, my lady.

510
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:31,454
You wouldn't be screwing
your face up like that if it was nothing.

511
00:33:31,488 --> 00:33:33,956
Don't want to offend, my lady.
Truly, I don't.

512
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,792
You're not interesting
enough to be offensive.

513
00:33:37,594 --> 00:33:39,896
The Lannisters
want Lady Sansa.

514
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,598
The Lannisters
have money.

515
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:44,433
People kill for money.

516
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:47,536
I don't think we should
be telling people

517
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,138
we're searching
for Lady Sansa.

518
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:01,851
My lady. My lord.
Could I have a word?

519
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:03,819
What about?
Not kidney pie.

520
00:34:03,854 --> 00:34:05,421
<i>You seem
like a proper lady.</i>

521
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:07,890
<i>Someone who could
be trusted.</i>

522
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:12,028
I never met no Sansa Stark.

523
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:14,130
But I know her sister...

524
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:15,998
Arya.

525
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:21,771
No one's seen Arya Stark
since her father was beheaded.

526
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,607
She's presumed dead.

527
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:26,575
She weren't when I last
spoke to her.

528
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,433
When was that?

529
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,011
<i>Heading up north with
the Night's Watch.</i>

530
00:34:29,012 --> 00:34:30,513
She was all dressed up
as a boy.

531
00:34:30,547 --> 00:34:33,382
Like your ladyship,
only without the armor.

532
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:35,251
<i>Going by the name Arry.</i>

533
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,053
- So what happened to her?
- Well...

534
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:39,255
The quick version.

535
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:41,123
The Lannisters
took us prisoner.

536
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:42,992
We escaped.

537
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:45,227
The Brotherhood took
us prisoner.

538
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:46,729
They sold me
to the innkeep.

539
00:34:46,763 --> 00:34:49,332
<i>They were gonna sell Arya
to her mother at Riverrun</i>

540
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:50,666
<i>along with another prisoner.</i>

541
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:52,601
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth

542
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,637
and a face like
a half-burnt ham.

543
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:56,605
- <i>Not friendly.</i>
- The Hound.

544
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,407
That's the one.

545
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:01,744
If you find her,
could you give her this?

546
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:03,579
She liked the last one
I gave her,

547
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:05,948
but, well, this one
turned out better.

548
00:35:15,525 --> 00:35:18,260
Um, you were saying?

549
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:25,001
<i>Her mother's dead,
grandfather's dead,</i>

550
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:27,403
Walder Frey is
the new lord of Riverrun.

551
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:29,305
The Brotherhood
isn't going to Riverrun.

552
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,273
They'll take her
to the Eyrie, my lady.

553
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:33,109
Why the Eyrie?

554
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:35,611
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

555
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:37,713
Catelyn Stark's sister.

556
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:40,783
She's Arya's last living
relative with money.

557
00:35:40,817 --> 00:35:43,552
She hates the Lannisters.

558
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:47,857
Lord Tyrion
made sure I knew

559
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:50,993
which house married which
and who hated who.

560
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:52,728
Sansa could
be there, too.

561
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:55,231
Aye, my lady.

562
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:56,966
Could be.

563
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:05,274
You sure about this?

564
00:36:08,578 --> 00:36:10,179
No.

565
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:44,113
I imagined you'd be back
at the brothel at this hour.

566
00:36:44,147 --> 00:36:47,414
I did spend some time
with an absolutely stunning

567
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,918
blonde the other day.

568
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:51,720
Mm, do tell.

569
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:55,157
I've got every kind
of filth down here

570
00:36:55,192 --> 00:36:56,725
except the kind I like.

571
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,761
Your sister.

572
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:00,996
Oh.

573
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:09,605
Cersei approached me.

574
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:12,942
<i>We spoke a great deal
about her daughter.</i>

575
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:16,078
How worried your sister
is about her.

576
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:19,014
<i>She was trying
very hard to pretend</i>

577
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:21,050
<i>she had not come
to sway me against you.</i>

578
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:23,385
<i>I think she may have even
believed it herself.</i>

579
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,455
Making honest feelings
do dishonest work

580
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,924
is one of her many gifts.

581
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,961
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

582
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,765
It is rare
to meet a Lannister

583
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,803
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

584
00:37:43,273 --> 00:37:45,374
She desperately wants
to see you killed.

585
00:37:45,408 --> 00:37:47,610
She didn't need
to bother you.

586
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:51,447
It looks as though
I've taken care of that myself.

587
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:54,049
<i>The joy she will feel</i>

588
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:56,652
<i>when my head
leaves my neck.</i>

589
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,922
She's wanted this
for a long time.

590
00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:02,758
Yes, I know.

591
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:05,794
<i>We met, you and I.</i>

592
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:07,429
Many years ago.

593
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:10,399
I think I would
have remembered that.

594
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:13,769
Unlikely.
You had just been born.

595
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:18,707
Our father brought me
and my sister Elia with him

596
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:20,442
on a visit
to Casterly Rock.

597
00:38:20,477 --> 00:38:22,444
<i>My first time
away from Dorne.</i>

598
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:24,847
I didn't like anything
about the Rock.

599
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:28,817
Not the food,
not the weather,

600
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:30,519
not your accents.

601
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,188
Nothing.

602
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,125
But the biggest
disappointment...

603
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,460
you.

604
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:43,265
You and my family have more
in common than you might admit.

605
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,501
<i>The whole way from Dorne</i>

606
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:48,370
all anyone talked about
was the monster

607
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:51,373
that had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

608
00:38:51,408 --> 00:38:54,276
<i>A head twice
the size of his body,</i>

609
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:56,212
<i>a tail between his legs,</i>

610
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:58,347
claws, one red eye,

611
00:38:58,381 --> 00:39:01,283
the privates of both
a girl and a boy.

612
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:03,252
That would have made
things so much easier.

613
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:07,156
<i>When we met your sister, she promised
she would show you to us.</i>

614
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,824
Every day we would ask.

615
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:11,293
Every day she would
say, "Soon."

616
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:14,630
Then she and your brother

617
00:39:14,664 --> 00:39:18,033
took us
to your nursery and...

618
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:22,404
she unveiled the freak.

619
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:26,442
<i>Your head
was a bit large.</i>

620
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:28,377
<i>Your arms and legs
were a bit small,</i>

621
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:30,079
but no claw.

622
00:39:30,113 --> 00:39:33,415
No red eye.
No tail between your legs.

623
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,784
Just a tiny pink cock.

624
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:38,587
<i>We didn't try to hide
our disappointment.</i>

625
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:41,056
<i>"That's not a monster,"
I told Cersei.</i>

626
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:44,093
"That's just a baby."

627
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,230
<i>And she said,
"He killed my mother."</i>

628
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:50,766
<i>And she pinched
your little cock so hard,</i>

629
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,801
<i>I thought she might
pull it off.</i>

630
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:54,937
<i>Until your brother
made her stop.</i>

631
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:57,039
<i>"It doesn't matter,"
she told us.</i>

632
00:39:57,073 --> 00:40:00,042
<i>"Everyone says
he will die soon."</i>

633
00:40:00,076 --> 00:40:01,710
<i>I hope they are right.</i>

634
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,413
<i>"He should not
have lived this long."</i>

635
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:09,618
Well...

636
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:16,892
sooner or later, Cersei always gets
what she wants.

637
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:21,930
And what about
what I want?

638
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,502
Justice

639
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:30,139
for my sister
and her children.

640
00:40:30,173 --> 00:40:32,174
If you want justice,

641
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,110
you've come
to the wrong place.

642
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:37,379
I disagree.

643
00:40:44,888 --> 00:40:47,923
I've come to
the perfect place.

644
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,994
I want to bring those
who have wronged me to justice.

645
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:55,130
And all those who have
wronged me are right here.

646
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:59,668
I will begin with
Ser Gregor Clegane,

647
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:02,471
<i>who killed
my sister's children</i>

648
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:05,874
and then raped her
with their blood still on his hands

649
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:08,644
before killing her, too.

650
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:19,421
I will be your champion.

651
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:15,477
Hello, Robin.

652
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,381
What are you doing?

653
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:21,350
I'm building my home,
Winterfell.

654
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:23,419
At least I think I am.

655
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:26,121
I haven't been back there
in a very long time.

656
00:42:26,156 --> 00:42:28,524
Why did you leave?

657
00:42:28,558 --> 00:42:30,926
It's a long story.

658
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:34,163
I stay here in the Eyrie.

659
00:42:34,197 --> 00:42:36,965
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads
and I have to keep myself safe

660
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,634
because I'm the Lord
of the Vale

661
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:40,969
and the Lord of the Vale
is a very important person.

662
00:42:41,004 --> 00:42:43,305
Yes, you certainly are.

663
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:45,574
When will you go back?

664
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:48,310
Probably never.

665
00:42:48,344 --> 00:42:50,446
My family doesn't
live there anymore

666
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,948
and someone
burned it down.

667
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,818
Oh.

668
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:58,620
Does Winterfell
have a Moon Door?

669
00:42:58,655 --> 00:43:00,422
No, I'm afraid not.

670
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:02,591
It's not high up in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

671
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,460
That sounds dangerous.</font>

672
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,296
- How do you make people fly?
- We don't.

673
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,730
What do you do with
all the bad people

674
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:11,233
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

675
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:12,801
I never did anything
with them at all.

676
00:43:12,836 --> 00:43:15,471
Girls didn't take part
in that where I came from.

677
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:18,807
Well, I'm Lord
of the Vale.

678
00:43:18,842 --> 00:43:22,144
When I grow up, I'll be able to fly
anybody who bothers me.

679
00:43:22,178 --> 00:43:24,513
Or you.
When we get married,

680
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:26,315
you can tell me
if you don't like somebody

681
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,617
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

682
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:30,486
Right through
the Moon Door.

683
00:43:32,188 --> 00:43:34,122
I like the sound of that.

684
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:35,891
Let's put a Moon Door
in your Winterfell.

685
00:43:35,925 --> 00:43:37,359
All right.

686
00:43:37,393 --> 00:43:39,361
It can go in here
in this big tower.

687
00:43:39,395 --> 00:43:41,463
Careful.
You've ruined it.

688
00:43:41,498 --> 00:43:42,931
Now I'm going to have
to rebuild the whole thing.

689
00:43:42,966 --> 00:43:44,500
- I didn't ruin it.
- You did.

690
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:46,502
It was already ruined
because it didn't have a Moon Door.

691
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:47,870
I was fixing it.

692
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:49,238
Knocking things down
isn't fixing them.

693
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:51,039
- It's ruining them.
- I didn't ruin it!

694
00:43:51,074 --> 00:43:53,542
- You're being stupid.
- I didn't ruin it!

695
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,655
Robin, I'm sorry, I...

696
00:44:07,624 --> 00:44:09,291
<i>Children.</i>

697
00:44:11,828 --> 00:44:15,264
- <i>I hit him.</i>
- Yes, I saw.

698
00:44:15,298 --> 00:44:16,632
I shouldn't have done that.

699
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:19,768
No, his mother
should have

700
00:44:19,802 --> 00:44:22,104
a long time ago.

701
00:44:22,138 --> 00:44:25,507
Consider it a step
in the right direction.

702
00:44:26,976 --> 00:44:28,677
If he tells Aunt Lysa...

703
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:31,079
Let me worry about
Aunt Lysa.

704
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:35,217
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

705
00:44:36,486 --> 00:44:38,520
I'll never see it again.

706
00:44:40,256 --> 00:44:43,325
A lot can happen
between now and never.

707
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:47,629
If you want to build
a better home,

708
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:50,499
first you must
demolish the old one.

709
00:44:52,468 --> 00:44:55,537
Why did you really
kill Joffrey?

710
00:44:59,642 --> 00:45:01,743
Tell me why.

711
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:09,585
I loved your mother more
than you could ever know.

712
00:45:12,221 --> 00:45:14,923
Given the opportunity,
what do we do to those

713
00:45:14,991 --> 00:45:16,992
who've hurt
the ones we love?

714
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:26,735
In a better world,

715
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:29,137
one where love

716
00:45:29,172 --> 00:45:33,108
could overcome
strength and duty,

717
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:36,878
you might have been
my child.

718
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:42,417
But we don't live
in that world.

719
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:56,431
You're more beautiful
than she ever was.

720
00:45:58,267 --> 00:45:59,835
Lord Baelish...

721
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:01,837
Call me Petyr.

722
00:46:28,765 --> 00:46:31,233
<i>You wanted
to see me, Aunt Lysa?</i>

723
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:34,836
Come here, Sansa.

724
00:46:48,885 --> 00:46:51,353
Do you know how far
the fall is?

725
00:46:53,222 --> 00:46:54,356
No.

726
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,591
<i>Neither do I, precisely.</i>

727
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:59,161
<i>Hundreds of feet.</i>

728
00:46:59,195 --> 00:47:01,329
It's fascinating

729
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:05,233
what happens to bodies when they
hit the rocks from such a height.

730
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:07,302
The impact breaks them
right apart.

731
00:47:07,336 --> 00:47:10,772
Like eggs dropped
on the floor.

732
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:13,208
Sometimes pieces
remain intact.

733
00:47:13,276 --> 00:47:15,911
You'll find the head
sitting on its own.

734
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:18,046
Every hair in place.

735
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:20,982
Blue eyes staring
at nothing.

736
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:32,527
I know what you did.

737
00:47:34,731 --> 00:47:36,531
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

738
00:47:36,566 --> 00:47:39,401
I never should have hit Robin,
I know it. I promise it won't happen...

739
00:47:39,435 --> 00:47:41,169
Don't be coy with me,
you little whore.

740
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:43,638
You kissed him.
You kissed Petyr.

741
00:47:43,673 --> 00:47:45,874
- I didn't. You don't understand.
- I saw you.

742
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:49,211
You can't lie to me because
I saw it with my own eyes.

743
00:47:49,245 --> 00:47:51,079
- He kissed me. I pulled away.
- Liar!

744
00:47:51,114 --> 00:47:54,015
Whore! He is mine!

745
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,551
My father, my husband,
my sister,

746
00:47:56,586 --> 00:47:58,720
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

747
00:47:58,755 --> 00:48:02,824
That's what happens to people
who stand between Petyr and me.

748
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:04,526
Look down!

749
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,962
Look down!
Look down! Look down!

750
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:09,865
<i>Lysa!</i>

751
00:48:09,899 --> 00:48:12,534
Let her go.

752
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:17,572
You want her?

753
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:21,243
This empty-headed child?

754
00:48:21,277 --> 00:48:22,778
Let her go.

755
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:25,614
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

756
00:48:25,648 --> 00:48:28,183
I lied for you.

757
00:48:28,217 --> 00:48:30,218
<i>I killed for you.</i>

758
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:32,587
Why did you bring
her here? Why?

759
00:48:32,622 --> 00:48:34,556
I'll send her away.

760
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:38,426
I swear on my life.

761
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:41,930
I swear to all the gods.

762
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:44,833
Let her go, Lysa.

763
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:05,253
Oh, my sweet wife.

764
00:49:07,523 --> 00:49:10,992
My sweet, silly wife.

765
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:20,769
I have only loved
one woman...

766
00:49:21,704 --> 00:49:23,538
only one,

767
00:49:23,573 --> 00:49:25,974
my entire life.

768
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:32,747
Your sister.
