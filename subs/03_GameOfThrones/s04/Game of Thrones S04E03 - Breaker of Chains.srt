1
00:01:57,697 --> 00:02:00,575
You did this. You did this!

2
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,869
- We have to leave.
<i>- Take him! Take him!</i>

3
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:08,617
Where is his wife?

4
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,185
Where's Sansa?

5
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,554
Find her. Bar the gates
of the city.

6
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:16,057
<i>Seize every ship in the harbor.</i>

7
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:18,593
- Where is she?!
- No one leaves the capital!

8
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:20,662
<i>No one!</i>

9
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:51,193
- Get in.
- Where are we going?

10
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:52,985
Somewhere safe.

11
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,165
Up you go, my lady.

12
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:44,446
You'll be fine.

13
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,338
You're stronger than you know.

14
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,068
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

15
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:09,161
Are you hurt, my lady?

16
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,939
Good. Good.

17
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:13,808
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

18
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,777
- The worst is past.
<i>- Lord Baelish.</i>

19
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,076
<i>I promised I'd get
her to you safely.</i>

20
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,404
Softly, my friend.

21
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:21,049
Voices carry over water.

22
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:24,119
I should get back before someone
thinks to look for me.

23
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:26,154
First you'll want your pay.

24
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,981
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

25
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,932
Wait!</font>

26
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,335
<i>Shh.</i>

27
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,237
You don't want the queen
to hear, do you?

28
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,906
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

29
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,808
And if they found you,

30
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,512
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

31
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:53,882
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

32
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:55,150
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

33
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,252
The king who executed
your father,

34
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,521
who tormented you for years,

35
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:02,290
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

36
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,492
Why did you kill him?

37
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:07,262
Because he was a drunk
and a fool

38
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:10,131
and I don't trust drunk fools.

39
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:12,400
He saved me.

40
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:15,403
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

41
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:19,808
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

42
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,510
<i>Money buys a man's silence
for a time.</i>

43
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:25,871
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

44
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:31,052
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

45
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:35,190
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

46
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:38,293
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

47
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:41,387
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

48
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:52,197
I had it made a few weeks ago.

49
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:56,444
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

50
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,138
We're all liars here.

51
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,884
Come, my lady.

52
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,553
I know you've had
a difficult day.

53
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,689
But you're safe now.

54
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:09,858
I promise you that.

55
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,060
You're safe with me

56
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,687
and sailing home.

57
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:23,438
So am I the queen?

58
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,240
More than you were with Renly.

59
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:28,343
Less than you would have been if Joffrey
had done you the courtesy

60
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:31,312
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

61
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:34,582
In any case, this would not
be an opportune moment

62
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:36,484
to press the issue.

63
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:38,353
Clawing at his own throat,

64
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:41,256
looking to his mother to make it stop...
it was horrible.

65
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,792
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

66
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:46,085
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

67
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,832
They brought me your grandfather's body
when he died, you know?

68
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:52,667
Made me look at it.

69
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:54,235
What was it like?

70
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,439
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

71
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,307
The man I'd married

72
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:02,577
and suffered to father
my children.

73
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:04,846
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

74
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:08,283
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

75
00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:10,876
There he was...

76
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,313
lying on a table.

77
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,728
One of my husbands preferred
the company of men

78
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,429
and was stabbed
through the heart.

79
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:23,832
Another was happiest
torturing animals

80
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:26,101
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

81
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:28,103
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

82
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,029
Your circumstances have
improved markedly.

83
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,677
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

84
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:37,545
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

85
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,547
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

86
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:41,683
But I would have been the queen.

87
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,585
Our alliance with the Lannisters

88
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,221
remains every bit
as necessary to them

89
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,723
as it is unpleasant for us.

90
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,726
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

91
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:54,820
The next one should be easier.

92
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:06,431
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

93
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,836
Do you know what that means?

94
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:16,441
I'm not trying to trick you.

95
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,621
It means I'll become king.

96
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:22,056
Yes, you will become king.

97
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:25,350
What kind of king do
you think you'll be?

98
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,129
A good king?

99
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:30,489
Mm, I think so as well.

100
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:35,069
You've got the right
temperament for it.

101
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:38,873
<i>But what makes a good king?
Hmm?</i>

102
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,310
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

103
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,512
This is hardly
the place or the time.

104
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,481
Holiness?

105
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:48,683
Hmm.

106
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,020
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

107
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,255
And pious.

108
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,891
He built this sept.

109
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,228
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

110
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:03,555
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

111
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:07,635
He ended up fasting himself
into an early grave

112
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,771
because food was of this world

113
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:12,030
and this world was sinful.

114
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:15,977
Justice.

115
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:17,745
Yeah.

116
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,072
A good king must be just.

117
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,951
Orys I was just.

118
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:26,454
Everyone applauded his reforms.

119
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,489
Nobles and commoners alike.

120
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,658
But he wasn't just for long.

121
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:32,727
He was murdered in his sleep

122
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:34,996
after less than a year
by his own brother.

123
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:38,266
Was that truly just of him?

124
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,535
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

125
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,737
that he was too
gullible to recognize?

126
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,097
- No.
- No.

127
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:50,345
- What about strength?
- Yes.

128
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,714
Strength.

129
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,916
King Robert was strong.

130
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:57,452
He won the rebellion

131
00:09:57,477 --> 00:10:01,089
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

132
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:03,992
And he attended three small
council meetings

133
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,860
in 17 years.

134
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:10,398
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

135
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:12,925
until the last two killed him.

136
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:17,405
<i>So, we have a man who starves
himself to death,</i>

137
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,942
a man who lets
his own brother murder him,

138
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:24,603
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

139
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:29,641
What do they all lack?

140
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,957
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

141
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:38,026
Wisdom is what makes
a good king.

142
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,661
Yes.

143
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:42,387
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

144
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,268
<i>A house with great
wealth and fertile lands</i>

145
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,070
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

146
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:52,073
against another house
with a strong Navy

147
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:54,509
that could one day oppose you.

148
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:58,012
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

149
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,983
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

150
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,085
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

151
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,155
- No.
- <i>No. Of course not.</i>

152
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,658
A wise king knows what he knows
and what he doesn't.

153
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,393
You're young.

154
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:15,897
<i>A wise young king listens
to his counselors</i>

155
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:19,567
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

156
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:21,469
And the wisest kings

157
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:25,397
continue to listen
to them long afterwards.

158
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,109
Your brother was not
a wise king.

159
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:30,645
<i>Your brother was not
a good king.</i>

160
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,547
<i>If he had been,</i>

161
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:35,416
perhaps he'd still be alive.

162
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:38,586
Now, as the king, you
will have to marry.

163
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:40,855
Do you understand why?

164
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,623
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

165
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:44,492
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

166
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:48,196
To further the family line.

167
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:51,499
- <i>Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

168
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:55,370
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

169
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,971
I don't think so.

170
00:11:56,996 --> 00:12:00,375
It's all relatively
straightforward.

171
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,710
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

172
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:04,946
You are. You will be.

173
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,205
I'll see to that.

174
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,489
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

175
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,524
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

176
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,955
It was Tyrion.

177
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,982
He killed him.

178
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,920
He told me he would.

179
00:12:56,422 --> 00:13:00,101
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

180
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:03,795
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

181
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,900
That's what he said to me.

182
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:14,949
You saw it.

183
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:17,652
You saw Joff point
at him just before he...

184
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,678
I don't know what I saw.

185
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,659
Avenge him.

186
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:27,185
Avenge our son.

187
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:30,122
Kill Tyrion.

188
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,936
Tyrion's my brother.

189
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,838
<i>Our brother.</i>

190
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,340
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

191
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,843
I don't want a trial.

192
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:45,346
He'll squirm his way
to freedom given the chance.

193
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,105
I want him dead.

194
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,019
<font color=#808080>Please, Jaime.

195
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:54,379
You have to.

196
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,992
He was our son.

197
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,352
Our baby boy.

198
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,903
You're a hateful woman.

199
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:45,197
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

200
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,583
Jaime, not here, please.

201
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,118
Please.

202
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,153
<font color=#808080>Stop it.

203
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:02,290
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

204
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:04,783
Stop it. Stop.

205
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,389
Stop.

206
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:21,609
Stop. It's not right.</font>

207
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:24,478
It's not right. It's not right.

208
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:26,414
I don't care.</font>

209
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,516
- Don't.
- I don't care.

210
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,818
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

211
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,056
Gonna rain soon.

212
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,451
Where are we?

213
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:44,498
Near Fairmarket, I think.

214
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,000
You think?

215
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,401
You don't have a map?

216
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:50,638
- <i>No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

217
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:53,774
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

218
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,667
How far is it to the Eyrie?

219
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:56,555
Far.

220
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,533
And you're sure we're
going the right way?

221
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:01,849
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

222
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:04,685
Get my gold, be on my way.

223
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,679
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

224
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:17,298
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

225
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:19,567
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

226
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:24,238
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

227
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:25,806
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

228
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,142
Why Braavos?

229
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,810
I have friends there.

230
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:32,013
<font color=#808080>I doubt it.

231
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:34,348
Seven blessings to you.

232
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,750
What do you want?

233
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:39,957
What do I want?
This is my land.

234
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,156
If I'm standing
on it, it's my land.

235
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,784
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

236
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:51,432
Forgive my father.

237
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:54,001
<i>He was wounded
fighting in the war.</i>

238
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:57,362
Our cottage burned down while he was gone
and my mother with it.

239
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,701
He's never been the same.

240
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,141
Which house did he fight for?

241
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,815
The Tullys of Riverrun.

242
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,396
There's a storm coming.

243
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:23,931
<i>You'll be wanting
a roof tonight.</i>

244
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:26,167
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

245
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:29,361
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

246
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,641
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

247
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,834
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

248
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:43,651
<i>We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

249
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,653
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

250
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:47,621
<i>We ask the Mother
to bless our crops</i>

251
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:50,725
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

252
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,960
<i>We ask the Warrior
to give us courage</i>

253
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,162
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

254
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:57,465
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

255
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,170
to keep her from the clutches
of depravity.

256
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,068
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

257
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,428
Father!

258
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,976
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

259
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:12,079
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

260
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:16,317
We ask the Crone to guide us
on our journey from darkness to darkness.

261
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:18,586
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

262
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:21,112
in our beds tonight for no
damn reason at all.

263
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,887
I'm so sorry.

264
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,884
Really good.

265
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:52,052
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

266
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,488
Slaughtering
livestock more like.

267
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:56,724
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

268
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,593
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

269
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:03,130
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

270
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:05,332
Guest right don't
mean much anymore.

271
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:08,002
It means something to me.

272
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,538
The gods will have
their vengeance.

273
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:13,607
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

274
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,944
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

275
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,747
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

276
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:22,616
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

277
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:26,720
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

278
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,756
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

279
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:31,950
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

280
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,852
You got any ale?

281
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,988
Afraid not.

282
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,627
How can a man not
keep ale in his home?

283
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:47,374
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

284
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:49,934
<i>A real warrior
with proper training.</i>

285
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,848
Those raiders wouldn't stand
a chance against you.

286
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:56,517
<i>How would it be if you
stayed on till the new moon?</i>

287
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:59,286
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

288
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,822
Sally does what she can,

289
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:03,991
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

290
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,160
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

291
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:09,354
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

292
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,690
Meaning no offense.

293
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:20,841
What'll you pay?

294
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,877
I don't have much.

295
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:26,538
But I have hidden a bit
of silver from the bandits.

296
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,543
Fair wages for fair work?

297
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:39,083
Fair wages for fair work.

298
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,894
- What did you do?!
- <i>Get your horse saddled.</i>

299
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,964
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

300
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:19,733
He took us in.
He fed us and you...

301
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,535
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

302
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,170
and his daughter
makes a nice stew.

303
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,939
And they'll both be
dead come winter.

304
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,541
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

305
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:30,244
He's weak. He can't
protect himself.

306
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:32,880
They'll both be
dead come winter.

307
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:34,748
Dead men don't need silver.

308
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:38,843
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

309
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:42,089
There's plenty worse than me.

310
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,458
I just understand
the way things are.

311
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:48,119
How many Starks they got to behead
before you figure it out?

312
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:54,935
Raper. Raper.

313
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,737
Horse thief.

314
00:21:56,762 --> 00:21:59,030
Ninth born son.

315
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:01,008
Raper.

316
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:03,310
Thief. Thief and raper.

317
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:07,014
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

318
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,749
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

319
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:10,942
- She's not a whore.
- No?

320
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,444
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

321
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:20,561
They all think I'm lying.

322
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,262
About what?

323
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,565
Killing the white Walker.

324
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,501
You're not lying.

325
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,594
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

326
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:33,507
But you're
the only one that saw it.

327
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,209
And they all think
you're just a...

328
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:36,477
A what?

329
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:39,537
Well, a wildling.

330
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:42,483
My father hated that word.

331
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:45,886
It's not a very nice
word, I suppose.

332
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,721
I don't know.

333
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:51,816
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

334
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:05,305
So...

335
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,041
are you all right?

336
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,643
No one bothering you?

337
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:11,278
I get a lot of looks.

338
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:13,414
I hear them making their jokes.

339
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:16,417
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

340
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:19,653
I worry about it sometimes.

341
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:21,955
All the time.

342
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,992
Why do you worry about it?

343
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:28,062
100 men, one woman.

344
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:30,431
They've got other
things to think about.

345
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:33,000
That's the only thing
they think about.

346
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:35,569
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

347
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:39,697
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

348
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,701
What about you?

349
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:47,004
What about me?

350
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,110
Gilly?

351
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:58,883
I worry about you.

352
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:05,632
Thank you.

353
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:06,900
For what?

354
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,293
For worrying about me.

355
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:16,267
I don't know
if you're safe here.

356
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:18,445
They're my brothers,

357
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,881
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

358
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,516
Some of them were rapers.

359
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,352
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

360
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:28,780
So what are you saying?

361
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:36,220
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

362
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,103
Are you bored of me?

363
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:45,906
Bored of you?

364
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,366
I...

365
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,838
I want to protect you.

366
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,189
I'll get these to Hobb.

367
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,582
Keep an eye on little Sam.

368
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,190
Your Grace.

369
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:39,350
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

370
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:53,106
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

371
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:56,476
<i>I said those words when
I tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

372
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:59,279
A leech filled
with bastard blood.

373
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:01,682
A bastard you set free.

374
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:04,318
I am now faced
with a great opportunity

375
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:06,153
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

376
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:07,955
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

377
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,490
- I've been working day and night...
- What progress have you made?

378
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,526
I've rallied House
Peasebury to your 'cause.

379
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,228
House Peasebury.

380
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:17,531
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

381
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,900
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

382
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:27,899
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

383
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:31,478
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

384
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:33,280
We need to look east
for ships and men.

385
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:36,617
10,000 skilled soldiers fight
for the Golden Company.

386
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:38,652
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

387
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:40,087
They're sellswords.

388
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:41,822
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

389
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:43,624
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

390
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:46,059
Now the Red
Woman's magic is real.

391
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:48,295
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

392
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,164
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

393
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:53,533
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

394
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:54,868
It's dirty on the ground.

395
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,770
We don't have any gold.

396
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:57,995
Not yet.

397
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,077
If I do not press my claim,

398
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:06,179
my claim will be forgotten.

399
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:09,750
I will not become a page
in someone else's history book.

400
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,986
I'm running
out of time, Ser Davos.

401
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:16,147
Which means you're
running out of time.

402
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:22,763
You're late.

403
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:24,331
I'm sorry, Princess.

404
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,133
I thought you weren't coming.

405
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:28,802
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

406
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,551
You won't be a very good
Hand if you see the word

407
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:32,496
knight and say "ka-nigit."

408
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:33,941
That happened once, weeks ago.

409
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:36,009
You're your father's daughter,
no mistake.

410
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,011
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

411
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:40,647
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

412
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,873
But I think you can manage.

413
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,154
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

414
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:49,380
That's how children do it.

415
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:58,565
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas.

416
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,934
First Sword of Braavos."

417
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,936
<font color=#808080>Thank you very much.

418
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:06,273
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

419
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,008
You were a pirate once.

420
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,910
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

421
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,144
What's the difference?

422
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:13,146
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

423
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:14,815
you're not doing it right.

424
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,616
My father says a criminal
is a criminal.

425
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,352
Your father lacks
an appreciation

426
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:20,620
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

427
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:22,823
So do the Braavosi.

428
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:24,524
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

429
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:27,361
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

430
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,900
I tried to explain to him

431
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,405
the difference between pirates
and smugglers,

432
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:35,535
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

433
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,270
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

434
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,773
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

435
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:43,768
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction...

436
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,598
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

437
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:06,767
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

438
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,335
It's too important for me.

439
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,571
I need a smart person to do it.
Go on.

440
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:15,675
To the offices of the Iron
Bank of Braavos

441
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,446
from Stannis Baratheon
the one true king of Westeros.

442
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:20,981
But that's not you.

443
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:22,749
I need to get their attention.

444
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:25,476
Go on. Write.

445
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,755
He's seen some adventures,
hasn't he?

446
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:00,454
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

447
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:03,323
- What's his name?
- Sam.

448
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:05,025
Lovely.

449
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,860
That the daddy?

450
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:08,028
No.

451
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:09,587
Where's the daddy?

452
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:12,132
He's dead.

453
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:15,092
Oh. Where you from?

454
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:18,772
North of here.

455
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,031
North of here?

456
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:27,080
You a fucking wildling?

457
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:29,950
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

458
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,652
She'll clean and cook

459
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:34,197
and look after the other
girls' babies.

460
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:37,057
Could find other
work for her, too.

461
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:39,659
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

462
00:30:39,684 --> 00:30:41,328
Give you a piece of it.

463
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:43,821
No other work.

464
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:08,145
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

465
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,693
You'll be safer here.

466
00:31:13,718 --> 00:31:15,853
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

467
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:18,999
You protected me
north of the Wall.

468
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,901
This is different.

469
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:22,369
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

470
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,204
and I can't just stab
them in the back

471
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:27,374
and I can't run away,
which is what we did at Craster's.

472
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:32,412
You have to trust me.

473
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:34,071
It's for the best.

474
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:40,654
Best for you.

475
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,214
Oh, Gilly.

476
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,459
Please don't.

477
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:21,485
Greedy.

478
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,769
No?

479
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,629
I'm sorry. You're lovely,

480
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,607
I just never acquired the taste.

481
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:36,243
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

482
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:39,937
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

483
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:45,075
Your loss.

484
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:52,716
You like them both the same?

485
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:54,961
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

486
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:56,663
Everyone has a preference.

487
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:59,456
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

488
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:04,404
<i>The gods made that and it
delights me.</i>

489
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:06,239
The gods made this

490
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:08,208
and it delights me.

491
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:11,244
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

492
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:15,048
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

493
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:17,417
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

494
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,119
What are you, 25?

495
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:22,355
Children.</font>

496
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,824
Someday, if you're lucky,

497
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,626
you will wake
up and realize you are old.

498
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,662
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

499
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:32,098
Your belly will grow soft
and your back will ache in the night

500
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:36,202
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

501
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:38,605
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

502
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,832
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

503
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,844
Did you?

504
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,947
He is a prince of Dorne.

505
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:50,884
Girls and boys will line up

506
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,844
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

507
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:59,526
They will all have
to line up behind you.

508
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:07,734
- <i>Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

509
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,027
May we have the room?

510
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:15,799
Call my name if you
need me, lover.

511
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,212
Would you like to sit?

512
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:30,590
No, thank you.

513
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:32,192
Some wine?

514
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,227
<i>No, thank you.</i>

515
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:38,732
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

516
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:42,802
I don't believe that a child
is responsible for the sins of his father.

517
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:45,505
Or his grandfather.

518
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,774
An awful way to die.

519
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,009
Which way is that?

520
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:53,246
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

521
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:54,781
Some believe the king choked.

522
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,283
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

523
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:59,877
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

524
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,090
The king was poisoned.

525
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:07,193
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

526
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:09,596
I did. This is why I know.

527
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:13,099
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

528
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:16,136
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

529
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:19,939
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

530
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:21,307
Rather suspicious.

531
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,243
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

532
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:25,745
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

533
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,014
on the day that you arrived.

534
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,315
What did you discuss?

535
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,384
You think we conspired together?

536
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:32,786
What did you discuss?

537
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:36,189
The death of my sister.

538
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:37,857
For which you blame me.

539
00:35:37,882 --> 00:35:40,059
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

540
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:42,929
The Mountain follows
your orders.

541
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:44,564
Of course I blame you.

542
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,033
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

543
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:48,668
Should I be concerned?

544
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:52,305
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

545
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,874
I am a man of reason.

546
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,876
If I cut your throat today,

547
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,569
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

548
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:00,647
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

549
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:02,482
without their superiors'
knowledge.

550
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:05,018
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

551
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:07,778
Categorically.

552
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:19,365
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

553
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,202
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

554
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:25,095
He might not enjoy it as much
as he thinks he would.

555
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:29,676
I could arrange
for this meeting.

556
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:33,480
But you want
something in return.

557
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:36,082
There will be
a trial for my son.

558
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:38,184
And as custom dictates,

559
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:41,120
three judges
will render a verdict.

560
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:42,555
I will preside.

561
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,758
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

562
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:48,094
I would like you
to be the third.

563
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,996
Why?

564
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:53,533
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

565
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:56,460
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

566
00:36:56,528 --> 00:36:58,638
Now they are our strongest
allies.

567
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,874
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

568
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:04,644
Asking me to judge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

569
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:08,505
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

570
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:12,175
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

571
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:22,586
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

572
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:26,232
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

573
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:30,036
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

574
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:33,306
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

575
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:37,768
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

576
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:42,882
Before long, she will turn
her eyes to Westeros.

577
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:45,785
Only the Dornish
managed to resist.

578
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,655
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

579
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,548
You're saying you need us?

580
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,695
That must be hard
for you to admit.

581
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,665
We need each other.

582
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,402
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

583
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:05,395
and I will help you serve
justice to Elia's.

584
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:26,116
Podrick.

585
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:28,995
Apologies for the stench.

586
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,464
I brought you some wine, my lord,
but they took it from me.

587
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,266
A noble effort.

588
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,602
They didn't find
the candles, though.

589
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,904
A quill, some parchment,

590
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:40,740
duck sausage, almonds,

591
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:43,843
and some hard cheese.

592
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,645
You're a good lad.

593
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,747
Any word of Shae?

594
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:49,382
I've heard nothing, my lord.

595
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:52,142
I suppose that's a good thing.

596
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:56,055
What are they saying
about me out there?

597
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,125
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

598
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,927
for murdering the king.

599
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:03,129
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

600
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:04,998
No, my lord.

601
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:06,866
You didn't?

602
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:09,602
No. Gods, no.

603
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:11,804
The world is a better
place without him,

604
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,073
but I had nothing to do with it.

605
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:16,142
I would like to think

606
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,277
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

607
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:20,813
I'd plan it in such a way
that I wouldn't be standing there

608
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:23,940
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

609
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,054
Trial in a fortnight.

610
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,514
<i>Have they announced
the judges yet?</i>

611
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:35,962
- Your father.
- Of course.

612
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,531
Mace Tyrell.

613
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:41,834
Who will vote exactly
as my father tells him to vote.

614
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:44,294
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

615
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:46,239
Oberyn?

616
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:48,608
Give it to my father.

617
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:51,377
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

618
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:54,681
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

619
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:57,717
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

620
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,186
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

621
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:01,754
<i>How generous of them.</i>

622
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:03,756
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

623
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:05,458
My lord, she's gone.

624
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:06,663
Gone?

625
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:08,549
<i>No one's seen her
since the wedding.</i>

626
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:14,324
You don't think she...

627
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:21,307
<i>No one had more 'cause
to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

628
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:23,242
but the girl is no assassin.

629
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:26,512
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

630
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:30,216
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

631
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,919
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

632
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:34,587
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

633
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:37,423
I don't know. They. They.
The ominous they.

634
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:40,393
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

635
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:43,830
Maybe Joffrey was too
much work for him.

636
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:46,799
Sweet Tommen will be so
much easier to handle.

637
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:49,635
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

638
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,071
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

639
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:54,674
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

640
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,342
she loves her children.

641
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:57,811
She is the only one

642
00:40:57,836 --> 00:41:00,175
I'm certain had nothing
to do with this murder.

643
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:02,448
Which makes it unique

644
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:04,851
as King's Landing murders go.

645
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,820
Any other witnesses, my lord?

646
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:09,956
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

647
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:12,191
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

648
00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:14,594
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

649
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:15,962
I've already asked, my lord.

650
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:17,396
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

651
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:20,500
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

652
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:21,934
He's under investigation
himself.

653
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:22,959
And my brother?

654
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:25,462
Will they at least
allow me to see Jaime?

655
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:28,031
I'll ask, my lord.

656
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:43,823
There's something else, my lord.

657
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:47,627
A man, I didn't know his face,

658
00:41:47,652 --> 00:41:50,263
he came to ask
if I'd testify against you.

659
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:53,166
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

660
00:41:53,191 --> 00:41:56,702
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

661
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:58,838
Ser Podrick Payne?

662
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:01,507
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

663
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:03,400
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

664
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:06,646
Are you going to accept
their offer?

665
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:08,514
My lord.

666
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,616
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

667
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,118
If they can't tempt
you with honey,

668
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:13,920
they'll choose
something less sweet.

669
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:15,288
You've been good to me, my lord.

670
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:17,824
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

671
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:19,525
They'll want an answer
before that.

672
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,818
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

673
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:25,932
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

674
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:28,034
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

675
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,869
that long walk
to the executioner's block,

676
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:32,405
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

677
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,465
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

678
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:40,012
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

679
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:42,448
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

680
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:44,417
before it's too late.

681
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,052
Pod!

682
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:47,978
This is farewell.

683
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:53,083
Farewell, my lord.

684
00:42:57,588 --> 00:43:00,223
Pod.

685
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:05,962
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

686
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:31,731
Mother says
it's time to eat.

687
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:35,034
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

688
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:36,969
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

689
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:40,039
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

690
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:41,707
Has she got...

691
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:44,410
<i>The wildlings!</i>

692
00:43:44,435 --> 00:43:45,835
Guymon!

693
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:48,915
Hide.

694
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,974
Hide!

695
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:43,936
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

696
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:45,829
Yes. Yes.

697
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,405
Those your parents?

698
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:58,942
Open your eyes.

699
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:01,921
I'm going to eat them.

700
00:45:01,946 --> 00:45:03,723
Do you hear me?

701
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:06,425
I'm going to eat your dead mama

702
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,029
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

703
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:13,623
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

704
00:45:21,864 --> 00:45:24,944
<i>We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

705
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:26,245
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

706
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,030
<i>Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

707
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:30,182
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

708
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:31,351
Seems like that would be
a good lesson.

709
00:45:31,376 --> 00:45:32,342
Aye!

710
00:45:32,343 --> 00:45:35,087
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

711
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:37,289
They want to draw us out,

712
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:39,625
pick us off a few at a time.

713
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:42,395
We have just over 100 men.

714
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,165
And that's including stewards
and builders.

715
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,702
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

716
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:53,739
We must remember our first
responsibility.

717
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:57,143
We are the watchers on the Wall.

718
00:45:57,168 --> 00:46:00,136
There's got to be a way
to protect them.

719
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,283
You're a champion of the common
people, Lord Snow.

720
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:07,243
<i>What do you say to Brother
Pyp's proposition?</i>

721
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:13,683
Mance Rayder is coming.

722
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:17,730
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

723
00:46:17,755 --> 00:46:20,633
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 Miles

724
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:22,725
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

725
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:29,108
We need to shore up Castle Black

726
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:32,578
and we need to defend the Wall.

727
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:35,038
<i>That is our job.</i>

728
00:46:41,345 --> 00:46:43,012
Rangers returning.

729
00:46:49,153 --> 00:46:50,987
Help him.

730
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:56,092
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

731
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:01,707
What took you so long?

732
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:03,642
- We were held up.
- By what?

733
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,010
Chains.

734
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:08,747
We were guests of the mutineers
at Craster's Keep.

735
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:11,517
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

736
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:13,986
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

737
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:16,422
<i>Poor girls.</i>

738
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:18,524
Never thought they'd miss
their daddy.

739
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:20,059
Karl's running things now.

740
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:22,595
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

741
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,396
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

742
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:25,931
We just went over this, boy.

743
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:28,458
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

744
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:34,497
I told the wildlings we had
over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

745
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:40,012
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

746
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:42,548
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

747
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:46,018
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

748
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:49,688
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

749
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:53,092
As soon as he gets his hands
on them, he will.

750
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:55,694
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

751
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:59,131
And even if every one of us
kills 100 wildlings,

752
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:02,091
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

753
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:06,596
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

754
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,903
<i>Are they attacking?</i>

755
00:49:10,928 --> 00:49:14,173
<i>A single rider.</i>

756
00:49:14,198 --> 00:49:17,343
<i>A champion of Meereen.</i>

757
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:20,479
<i>They want you to send
your own champion against him.</i>

758
00:49:46,297 --> 00:49:48,374
What is he doing?

759
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:50,576
I believe he means to...

760
00:49:58,242 --> 00:50:01,854
He says that we're an army
of men without man parts.

761
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:05,057
He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

762
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:07,993
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

763
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:10,996
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

764
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:12,276
They're not meaningless

765
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,490
if half the city you intend
to take is listening to them.

766
00:50:18,395 --> 00:50:21,464
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

767
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:26,011
First, I will need
this one to be quiet.

768
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:27,770
Do I have a champion?

769
00:50:37,648 --> 00:50:41,493
Your Grace, I've won more single
combats than any man alive.

770
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:44,363
Which is why you must
remain by my side.

771
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:47,833
I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

772
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:49,501
Let me stand for you
today as well.

773
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:51,470
You are my most trusted advisor,

774
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:54,506
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

775
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:56,375
I will not gamble
with your life.

776
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,744
I was the last
to join your army.

777
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:01,146
I'm not your general or a member
of your Queensguard

778
00:51:01,171 --> 00:51:02,414
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

779
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:05,451
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

780
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:08,111
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

781
00:51:09,513 --> 00:51:11,981
Let me kill this man for you.

782
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,226
Very well.

783
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:15,728
You have quite an audience.

784
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:18,488
Make it worth their while.

785
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,967
He is very brave, Your Grace.

786
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:23,836
Yes, win or lose,

787
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:25,762
<i>as long as the whole
city is watching.</i>

788
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:39,151
You sure you don't want a horse?

789
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:40,919
<i>Why would I want a horse?</i>

790
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:43,489
Horses are faster than men.

791
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:46,416
Horses are dumber than men.
