1
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:08,035
Clegane, look into the flames.

2
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:09,577
What do you see?

3
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,368
A wall of ice.

4
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:13,784
The Wall.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,076
The only thing standing
between us

6
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:18,743
and the army of the dead
is the Wall,

7
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:21,535
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

8
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:23,327
Last time we saw
The Night King,

9
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:24,368
it was at Hardhome.

10
00:00:24,784 --> 00:00:27,618
Closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch by the sea.

11
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:29,368
And that's where I'll go.

12
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:32,201
Looks like we're
the Nightswatch now.

13
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:38,577
This suits you, Lady Stark.

14
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:41,993
-Jon left you in charge?
-He did.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,035
-Lord Tarly.
-I believe you know my son.

16
00:00:55,243 --> 00:00:56,701
Do you fight with us...

17
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:59,659
or with the fallen savages
and eunuchs?

18
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:03,035
What do you think I should do?

19
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:05,784
If you use them to melt castles
and burn cities,

20
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:07,201
you're not different.

21
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,285
You're just more of the same.

22
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:12,452
Listen.

23
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:50,826
You could've killed me.

24
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,285
The fuck were you doing
back there?

25
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:03,577
Ending the war.

26
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,784
Killing her.

27
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:08,201
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

28
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:14,201
- And?

29
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,784
Listen to me, cunt.

30
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,327
Till I get
what I'm owed,

31
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:26,160
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

32
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,035
you don't
get to kill you,

33
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,493
only I get
to kill you.

34
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:35,493
That was only
one of them.

35
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:38,327
She has two more.

36
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:41,410
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

37
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,035
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

38
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,035
No, I do not.

39
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,201
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

40
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,826
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

41
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:52,577
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

42
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:56,076
I have to tell
Cersei.

43
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,868
May as well jump
back in that river.

44
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:39,470

45
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:18,201
I know what Cersei
has told you.

46
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:22,951
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

47
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:24,201
burn down your homes,

48
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,951
murder you,
and orphan your children.

49
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:32,577
That's Cersei Lannister,
not me.

50
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:34,784
I'm not here
to murder,

51
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:36,535
and all I want
to destroy

52
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:39,618
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

53
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:43,826
to the benefit of no one
but the Cersei Lannisters
of the world.

54
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:47,285
I offer you a choice--

55
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:49,618
bend the knee
and join me.

56
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,784
Together, we will leave
the world a better place
than we found it.

57
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:56,784
Or refuse...

58
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,285
and die.

59
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:28,826
Step forward,
my lord.

60
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:39,951
You will not kneel?

61
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:41,327
I already have
a queen.

62
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:44,035
My sister.

63
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,243
She wasn't your queen

64
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,285
until recently,
though, was she?

65
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:49,618
When she murdered
your rightful queen

66
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:52,243
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

67
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:55,535
So it appears
your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

68
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,577
There are
no easy choices in war.

69
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,951
Say what you will
about your sister,

70
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:04,452
she was born
in Westeros.

71
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:06,701
She's lived here
all her life.

72
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:11,535
You, on the other hand,

73
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:14,285
murdered your own father

74
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,410
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

75
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,243
One with no ties
to this land...

76
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,243
with an army of savages
at her back.

77
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:27,909
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

78
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,368
I respect that.

79
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:34,410
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

80
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,826
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

81
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:39,076
He'd be invaluable
at the Wall.

82
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:41,410
You cannot send me
to the Wall.

83
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:44,410
You are not my queen.

84
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,201
You will have
to kill me, too.

85
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:01,076
Step back
and shut your mouth.

86
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:04,035
Who are you?

87
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:05,285
A stupid boy.

88
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,618
I am Dickon Tarly,

89
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,035
son of Randyll Tarly.

90
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:12,243
You are the future
of your house.

91
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:15,618
This war has already
wiped one great house
from the world.

92
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:17,493
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

93
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,618
I will not.

94
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:34,659
Your Grace,
nothing scrubs bold notions
from a man's head

95
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,243
like a few weeks
in a dark cell.

96
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,909
I meant what I said.

97
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,452
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

98
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:42,784
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

99
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:44,160
I gave them a choice.

100
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:46,993
They made it.

101
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:50,160
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families--

102
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,327
I'm not beheading
anyone.

103
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:59,160
Your Grace.

104
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:27,035
Lord Randyll Tarly,
Dickon Tarly,

105
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:29,701
I, Daenerys
of House Targaryen,
First of My Name,

106
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,826
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

107
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:34,659
sentence you to die.

108
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:39,410
Dracarys.

109
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:58,826
-

110
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,951
My-- my lord...

111
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,452
How many men
did we lose?

112
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,076
We haven't done
a full accounting.

113
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:50,243
It's not only armies
that win wars.

114
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,743
We have the Tyrell gold,
we have the Iron Bank
behind us.

115
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,410
We can buy
mercenaries.

116
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:58,201
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

117
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,410
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

118
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,868
I just saw
the Dothraki fight.

119
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:05,493
They'll beat
any mercenary army.

120
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,577
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

121
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:10,452
Killing our men
wasn't war for them,
it was sport.

122
00:12:10,452 --> 00:12:12,659
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

123
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,909
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

124
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,452
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

125
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,410
This isn't a war
we can win.

126
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,784
So, what do we do?

127
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,452
Sue for peace?

128
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:28,368
I sit on
her father's throne,

129
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:31,035
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

130
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:33,868
And in her mind,
she's winning.

131
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,951
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

132
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,826
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

133
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,201
by way of apology for
murdering our father
and son.

134
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,452
He didn't.

135
00:12:47,452 --> 00:12:49,452
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

136
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:51,327
I'm not talking
about Father.

137
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,868
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

138
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:58,160
- After all this time,
it still amazes me that you--
- It was Olenna.

139
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,868
She confessed
before she died.

140
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,410
And this was
before or after

141
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,493
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

142
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:12,118
After.

143
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:13,618
And you believed her?

144
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:16,368
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

145
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:19,035
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

146
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,784
Which one would Margaery
have been better able
to control?

147
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,327
Which one would have
made Olenna

148
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:28,035
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

149
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:29,909
She was telling
the truth.

150
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,493
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

151
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,076
She should have
died screaming.

152
00:13:43,076 --> 00:13:44,368
She's dead,
like her son,

153
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:46,452
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

154
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:50,035
And if we don't find
a way out of this war,
we'll follow them.

155
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:52,577
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

156
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,743
I know my choice.

157
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:57,243
A soldier
should know his.

158
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:06,535
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

159
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:09,327
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

160
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:13,327
but, yes, they are.

161
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:14,826
Gorgeous beasts.

162
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:16,743
They're not
beasts to me.

163
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,577
No matter
how big they get

164
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,743
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

165
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:22,368
they're my children.

166
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,368
You weren't gone long.

167
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:31,535
No.

168
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:33,535
And?

169
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,243
And I have
fewer enemies today
than I did yesterday.

170
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:40,993
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

171
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:42,701
No, I'm not.

172
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:46,076
How many men
did your army kill

173
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:48,076
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

174
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,618
Thousands.

175
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,743
We both want
to help people.

176
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:56,452
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

177
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,535
Sometimes
strength is terrible.

178
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,410
When you first
came here,

179
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,160
Ser Davos said you took
a knife in the heart
for your people.

180
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,784
Ser Davos
gets carried away.

181
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:13,243
So, it was
a figure of speech?

182
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:34,618
Your Grace.

183
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,201
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

184
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:46,452
an old friend.

185
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:47,951
I served
with your father.

186
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:50,118
He was a great man.

187
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,327
You look strong.

188
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,493
You found a cure?

189
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,452
I wouldn't be here
if I hadn't.

190
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,951
I return
to your service,
my queen,

191
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,743
if you'll have me.

192
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:07,118
It would be my honor.

193
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:48,035
Ravens.

194
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:49,868
We need to send ravens.

195
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:55,076
I put very little stock
in it myself.

196
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:57,535
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

197
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:59,743
especially
when winter comes.

198
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:02,076
I remember Wolkan.

199
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,452
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

200
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:07,951
Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

201
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:10,160
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

202
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,951
- or the company.
-

203
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:14,118
A crippled boy
claims to have seen

204
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:16,243
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

205
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:19,410
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

206
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,076
Yes, it is a bit much.

207
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:23,784
- Still, we ought
to write back--
-Brandon Stark.

208
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:30,452
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

209
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:33,784
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

210
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:36,951
I saw him go
beyond the Wall.

211
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:38,535
And?

212
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:41,452
Somehow,
a crippled boy

213
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:43,535
survived for years
beyond the Wall when
no one else could.

214
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:47,285
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

215
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:50,993
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

216
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:54,118
Perhaps you need
more scribing work
to discipline your mind.

217
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:57,535
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

218
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

219
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,327
If you tell people
the threat is real,
they'll believe it.

220
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:18,701
If you advise
all the lords to
send their men north

221
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:20,659
to hold the Wall,
they'll do it.

222
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,160
And if you
tell every maester
in the Citadel

223
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,493
to search every word
of every faded scroll

224
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,285
about the Long Night,

225
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:30,118
they may find something
that lets us defeat

226
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:32,035
the Army of the Dead
for good.

227
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:38,327
It could be done.

228
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:42,535
And this news
could be authentic.

229
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,201
It's possible.

230
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:49,035
It's also possible
that this message

231
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:51,327
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

232
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:54,285
to lure southern armies away
from the lands they are
currently defending

233
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:56,327
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

234
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:58,035
That does seem
far more likely

235
00:21:58,035 --> 00:21:59,993
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

236
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:02,535
Archmaester, please.

237
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:03,701
It's real.

238
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:06,701
I've seen it.

239
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:11,035
We will write
to Maester Wolkan

240
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:13,410
at Winterfell
for clarification.

241
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,285
I promise you we will
get to the truth of it
one way or another.

242
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:18,993
- Archmaester, please--
- That will be all, Tarly.

243
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:21,493
It brings to mind the work
of Jenny of Oldstones,

244
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:24,118
the charlatan
who claimed descent from
the children of the forest.

245
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:26,909
-
-Don't forget
the prophet Lodos,

246
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:30,577
who promised that
the Drowned God would rise up
and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

247
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:32,868
-
- Ah, Lodos.

248
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,701
Is he the one
whose father and brother
were just burnt alive?

249
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:42,659
I'm afraid so.

250
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:43,909
Horrible business.

251
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:46,535
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

252
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:48,577
He's a good lad.

253
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,327
Right.

254
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,243
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

255
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:01,076
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

256
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:02,285
That's why
they're rulers.

257
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,410
She gave Tarly
a choice,

258
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,243
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

259
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:11,993
What else
could she do?

260
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:15,118
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

261
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:17,452
I am her Hand,
not her head.

262
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:19,701
I can't make
her decisions for her.

263
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:22,993
That's what I used
to tell myself about
her father.

264
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:27,368
I found the traitors,
but I wasn't the one
burning them alive.

265
00:23:27,368 --> 00:23:30,118
I was only a purveyor
of information.

266
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:39,327
It's what I told myself
when I watched them
beg for mercy--

267
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:41,909
I'm not the one
doing it.

268
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:44,368
When the pitch
of their screams
rose higher--

269
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:46,410
I'm not the one
doing it.

270
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,993
When their hair
caught fire

271
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,868
and the smell
of their burning flesh
filled the throne room--

272
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:52,493
I'm not the one
doing it.

273
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,368
Daenerys is not
her father.

274
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:05,784
And she never will be

275
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:07,826
with the right counsel.

276
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,493
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

277
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:19,327
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

278
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:20,868
Did you read it?

279
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:23,909
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

280
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,493
What's it say?

281
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:34,160
Nothing good.

282
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:44,035
I thought
Arya was dead.

283
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:47,118
I thought Bran
was dead.

284
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,535
I'm happy for you.

285
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:52,327
You don't look happy.

286
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:54,701
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

287
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,701
marching towards
Eastwatch.

288
00:24:58,285 --> 00:25:00,285
If they make it
past the Wall...

289
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:02,993
The Wall has kept them out
for thousands of years,
presumably.

290
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:04,659
I need to go home.

291
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:06,368
You said you don't
have enough men.

292
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:08,951
We'll fight
with the men we have.

293
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:10,577
Unless you'll join us.

294
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:12,743
And give the country
to Cersei?

295
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:16,577
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

296
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:18,909
Perhaps not.

297
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:22,327
Cersei thinks
the Army of the Dead
is nothing but a story

298
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:25,577
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

299
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:27,327
What if we
prove her wrong?

300
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:30,743
I don't think
she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

301
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:34,076
So bring
the dead to her.

302
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,410
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

303
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,784
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

304
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:41,826
Only one soldier.

305
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:43,743
Is that possible?

306
00:25:47,577 --> 00:25:49,285
The first wight
I ever saw

307
00:25:49,285 --> 00:25:52,118
was brought
into Castle Black
from beyond the Wall.

308
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:54,452
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

309
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,743
and show her the truth.

310
00:25:56,743 --> 00:25:58,784
Anything you bring back
will be useless

311
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,618
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

312
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:03,160
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

313
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,410
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

314
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,993
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

315
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:10,826
He might listen to me.

316
00:26:14,826 --> 00:26:16,659
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

317
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:24,659
I can smuggle you in,

318
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,285
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

319
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,493
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

320
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:31,909
Well, it will all
be for nothing

321
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:33,701
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

322
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:35,076
Fair point.

323
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:36,368
How do you propose
to find one?

324
00:26:39,784 --> 00:26:42,993
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

325
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:48,035
You asked me
to find a cure
so I could serve you.

326
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:49,659
Allow me
to serve you.

327
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,160
The Free Folk
will help us.

328
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,909
They know the real north
better than anyone.

329
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,452
They won't follow
Ser Jorah.

330
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,659
They won't have to.

331
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:10,118
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

332
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:12,743
You're not in
the Night's Watch anymore,
you're King in the North.

333
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:15,327
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

334
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:17,701
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

335
00:27:19,076 --> 00:27:21,076
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

336
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,285
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

337
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:28,493
I am a king.

338
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:31,535
And I came here

339
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,368
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

340
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:36,577
or your dragons
burn me alive.

341
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:40,993
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

342
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,993
because I knew it was
the best chance
for my people,

343
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:46,160
for all our people.

344
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:52,035
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

345
00:27:53,743 --> 00:27:56,243
because it's
our best chance.

346
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:18,577
The King in the North
should stay in the North.

347
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:25,493
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

348
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:28,327
- But perhaps
we should have.
-

349
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:35,618
The Knights of the Vale
came here for you,
Lady Stark.

350
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:37,076
Aye.

351
00:28:41,535 --> 00:28:44,951
You are very kind,
my lords.

352
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:46,993
But Jon is our king.

353
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:49,535
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

354
00:28:59,452 --> 00:29:01,493
I warned Jon
this would happen.

355
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:03,160
That he couldn't
leave the North

356
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,993
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

357
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:08,368
He didn't.
He trusted you
to hold it for him.

358
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:11,160
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

359
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:18,118
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

360
00:29:18,118 --> 00:29:19,659
And?

361
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:24,701
Nothing.

362
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:27,493
Don't do that.

363
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:29,993
- What?
- Say what you mean.

364
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:34,118
You always liked
nice things.

365
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:37,826
They made you feel
better than everyone.

366
00:29:42,743 --> 00:29:44,327
Are you angry with me?

367
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:46,659
They were insulting Jon,

368
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,035
and you sat there
and listened.

369
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:49,535
I listened
to their complaints,

370
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:52,577
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

371
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:55,535
Their opinions
are important to you.

372
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:58,243
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

373
00:29:58,243 --> 00:30:01,201
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

374
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:03,201
Not if they lose
their heads first.

375
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,826
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

376
00:30:09,826 --> 00:30:11,701
We took it back,

377
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:13,659
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

378
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:15,118
and the wildlings
and the Vale.

379
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:16,659
All of us,
working together.

380
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:20,993
Now, I'm sure
cutting off heads
is very satisfying,

381
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:24,535
but that's not the way
you get people to
work together.

382
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,993
And if Jon
doesn't come back,

383
00:30:29,993 --> 00:30:31,951
you'll need
their support...

384
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:34,076
so you can
work together

385
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:36,035
to give you
what you really want.

386
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:38,618
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

387
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:43,368
You're thinking it
right now.

388
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:48,327
You don't want to be,

389
00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:50,618
but the thought
just won't go away.

390
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:58,410
I have work to do.

391
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:03,368
My lady.

392
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,659
Last time I was here,
I killed my father
with a crossbow.

393
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,618
Last time I was here,
you killed my son
with wildfire.

394
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:27,618
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

395
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:30,285
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

396
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:31,659
Too many steps.

397
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:37,826
You're not
staying here?

398
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:41,327
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

399
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,160
What if someone
takes the boat?

400
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,452
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

401
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,285
We don't have time
for this.

402
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,452
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

403
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:55,618
The Dothraki
are coming.

404
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:57,743
All the more reason
for you to train.

405
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:59,743
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

406
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:02,285
Well, I seem to recall them
giving you a bit of
trouble as well.

407
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:04,285
And here I am,
ready to train.

408
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:06,243
Why down here?

409
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:08,076
I don't think
you want people to see

410
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,993
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

411
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:13,784
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

412
00:32:13,784 --> 00:32:16,327
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

413
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:26,201
I'll leave you
to it.

414
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:31,327
I needed to see you.

415
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,618
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

416
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,118
You made me look
like a complete fool.

417
00:32:41,118 --> 00:32:43,410
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

418
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,368
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

419
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:48,951
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

420
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:50,452
Father would have
been proud.

421
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:52,201
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me--

422
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:53,701
I once told Bronn

423
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:56,535
that if I ever
saw you again,
I'd cut you in half.

424
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:02,035
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

425
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:13,118
He was going
to execute me.

426
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:15,826
He knew
I was innocent.

427
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:18,160
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

428
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,535
he hated me
because of what I am.

429
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:23,701
A little monster
sent to punish him.

430
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:27,784
Did he--
did he think--

431
00:33:27,784 --> 00:33:29,577
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

432
00:33:29,577 --> 00:33:31,452
- Did he think I chose it--
- What do you want?!

433
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:39,535
Daenerys will
win this war.

434
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:43,327
You're
a military man.

435
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:46,076
You must know
there's no way
around that.

436
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:49,701
Daenerys
is not her father.

437
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:52,577
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

438
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:55,076
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

439
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,618
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

440
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,076
you can ask her
yourself.

441
00:33:59,076 --> 00:34:01,452
I-- I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

442
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:04,577
Not right now,
anyway.

443
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:08,993
She has a more
important request.

444
00:34:48,493 --> 00:34:50,701
I wasn't sure
I'd find you.

445
00:34:57,993 --> 00:34:59,993
Thought you might
still be rowing.

446
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,701
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

447
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:09,993
Should have known
to come straight to
the Street of Steel.

448
00:35:09,993 --> 00:35:12,493
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

449
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:13,909
Haven't been here
in years.

450
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:16,327
Why should
they recognize me?

451
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:18,993
Sometimes I hardly do.

452
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,826
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

453
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:29,701
Anybody give you
any trouble?

454
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:32,160
Here I am,
arming Lannisters,

455
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,035
and I never get
a second look.

456
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:35,535
But you were right.

457
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:38,076
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

458
00:35:38,076 --> 00:35:39,577
Don't be so sure.

459
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:42,493
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

460
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:46,243
Bad things are coming.

461
00:35:48,743 --> 00:35:51,701
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

462
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:53,826
- Well, the thing you need
to understand is--
- I'm ready.

463
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:55,285
- You--
- Let's go.

464
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:57,201
You should know
what you're heading into.

465
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:59,201
What do you think
I've been thinking about

466
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,577
with every swing
of the hammer?

467
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:03,035
How happy I am
making weapons

468
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,493
for the family
that killed my father?

469
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:07,201
The family that
tried to kill me?

470
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:11,577
I've been getting ready.

471
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:13,035
I never knew what for,

472
00:36:13,035 --> 00:36:15,577
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

473
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:20,327
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

474
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:22,243
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

475
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:25,076
But this...

476
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:28,243
this I know.

477
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:38,743
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

478
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:41,535
Situation's complicated
enough already.

479
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,577
Well, who should
I say I am?

480
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,826
I told you, Clovis,
if we don't get out
of here soon,

481
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:52,327
- someone's going to--
-You there!

482
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:57,285
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

483
00:36:58,493 --> 00:36:59,951
What can I do
for you?

484
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,452
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

485
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:04,868
-
The docks are that way.
-That they are.

486
00:37:04,868 --> 00:37:06,368
I try to stay
away from them

487
00:37:06,368 --> 00:37:08,618
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

488
00:37:11,243 --> 00:37:14,618
- Still five gold dragons?
-  Are you joking?

489
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:16,868
You must be even older
than you look.

490
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,784
- 15.
- 15?!

491
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:19,909
Apiece.

492
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,951
-

493
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:30,452
I can't say
it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

494
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,327
Gold cloak #
What's in the boat?

495
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:41,035
Not more gold.

496
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:42,784
- Wine?
- Mm.

497
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,784
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

498
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:47,826
Come have a look.

499
00:37:56,368 --> 00:37:58,285
- Fermented crab.
- What?

500
00:37:58,285 --> 00:38:00,160
Fermented crab.

501
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,160
One bucket of this
triples a brothel's
earnings for the week.

502
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,118
A man thinks
he's done.

503
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,701
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

504
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:09,618
But before he gets
his breeches up,

505
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:12,993
his lady of the hour pops
a tiny spoon of that
into his mouth.

506
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:16,535
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

507
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:19,035
Here, have a taste.

508
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:33,577
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

509
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:36,076
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

510
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:05,076
Oi, dwarf!

511
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,951
I really wouldn't
try any more

512
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:09,993
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

513
00:39:09,993 --> 00:39:11,868
That dwarf...

514
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:13,493
Where'd you get
that scar?

515
00:39:13,493 --> 00:39:16,035
Fish hook.
Some men you just
can't teach.

516
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:19,118
We was looking
for a dwarf with a scar
like that a while back.

517
00:39:19,118 --> 00:39:21,160
Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

518
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:25,535
Arrangement?

519
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:28,743
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei--

520
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:38,285
-
- This is Gendry.

521
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:39,784
He'll do.

522
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:43,493
Go, go, go.

523
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:47,784
I could give you something.

524
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:49,285
That won't
be necessary.

525
00:39:57,951 --> 00:39:58,826
Ser Jaime.

526
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:04,452
-
- Why was Qyburn here?

527
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:08,118
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

528
00:40:12,784 --> 00:40:15,327
I met with Tyrion.

529
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,951
What did our brother
have to say?

530
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:30,993
Daenerys
wants to meet.

531
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,618
To discuss
her surrender?

532
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:35,452
To discuss
an armistice.

533
00:40:35,452 --> 00:40:38,243
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

534
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:39,993
Because an army
of dead men

535
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:42,535
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

536
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:46,868
Tyrion claims
he'll have proof.

537
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:53,118
- Are you going
to punish him?
- Tyrion?

538
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,618
Bronn.

539
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,535
He betrayed you.

540
00:40:59,535 --> 00:41:01,909
He set up a meeting
without your knowledge
or consent.

541
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:07,035
Do you think
anything of importance

542
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:09,535
happens in this city
without me knowing?

543
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:12,784
You let it happen.
Why?

544
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:15,452
I've come
to believe that

545
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:18,160
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

546
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,701
could be in our
immediate interest.

547
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:24,035
She has the numbers.
If we want to beat her,
we have to be clever.

548
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:26,201
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

549
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:32,826
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

550
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,868
Whatever stands
in our way,

551
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:39,618
we will defeat it.

552
00:41:39,618 --> 00:41:42,410
For ourselves,
for our house,

553
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,410
for this.

554
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:58,618
Who will you say
is the father?

555
00:41:58,618 --> 00:41:59,909
You.

556
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:07,076
People won't like that.

557
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:15,118
Do you remember
what Father used
to say about people?

558
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:19,076
The lion does not
concern himself with
the opinions of the sheep.

559
00:42:32,993 --> 00:42:34,951
Never betray me again.

560
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:41,951
We're leaving today.

561
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:45,535
- The king's got
a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

562
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:48,118
He doesn't need to be
thinking about harboring
the bastard of a dead king.

563
00:42:48,118 --> 00:42:50,577
- You don't
have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

564
00:42:50,577 --> 00:42:52,909
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

565
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:55,909
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

566
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,909
Understood.

567
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,368
-

568
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,535
Begging your pardon,
Your Grace.

569
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:02,993
You survived
King's Landing.

570
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:05,993
Yet again.
Your Grace,
this is Clo--

571
00:43:05,993 --> 00:43:08,410
Name's Gendry,
Your Grace.

572
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,993
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

573
00:43:09,993 --> 00:43:11,118
Bastard son.

574
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:16,659
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

575
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:18,493
Our fathers
trusted each other.

576
00:43:18,493 --> 00:43:19,826
Why shouldn't we?

577
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:24,618
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

578
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:27,826
I met yours
in my shop.

579
00:43:29,535 --> 00:43:31,868
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

580
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,743
I grew up on
stories about them.

581
00:43:45,743 --> 00:43:48,743
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

582
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:53,285
Ser Davos told me
where you're going,
Your Grace, and why.

583
00:43:53,285 --> 00:43:55,076
Let me come
with you.

584
00:43:55,076 --> 00:43:56,951
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

585
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:58,784
No,
but I'm a fighter.

586
00:43:58,784 --> 00:44:01,868
And he won't be
needing a smith
with a sword like that.

587
00:44:04,285 --> 00:44:05,784
You know
how to use one?

588
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:08,160
Well,
that's a problem.

589
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,701
I prefer a hammer.

590
00:44:12,701 --> 00:44:14,410
He can handle himself.

591
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:18,285
We could use the help.

592
00:44:18,285 --> 00:44:20,160
As my father
used to say,

593
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,243
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

594
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,493
than dead for
the rest of your life."

595
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:26,909
I owe you my life.

596
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:28,701
Twice over.

597
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:31,951
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

598
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:34,410
I can't wait out
this war.

599
00:44:38,201 --> 00:44:40,118
Yeah, nobody mind me.

600
00:44:40,118 --> 00:44:44,160
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

601
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,076
All right, come on.

602
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,909
You may not believe it,

603
00:44:57,909 --> 00:45:00,618
but I've missed you,
Mormont.

604
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:03,743
Nobody glowers
quite like you.

605
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,035
Not even Grey Worm.

606
00:45:10,826 --> 00:45:12,784
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

607
00:45:12,784 --> 00:45:15,784
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

608
00:45:15,784 --> 00:45:19,618
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

609
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:25,452
Take it with you.

610
00:45:28,118 --> 00:45:29,618
But bring it back.

611
00:45:29,618 --> 00:45:30,784
Our queen needs you.

612
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,618
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

613
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:45,784
Your Grace, I...

614
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:05,452
If I don't return,
at least you won't
have to deal

615
00:46:05,452 --> 00:46:06,784
with the King
in the North anymore.

616
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:10,993
I've grown used to him.

617
00:46:13,076 --> 00:46:15,701
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come,
Your Grace.

618
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:26,452
Heave!

619
00:46:49,577 --> 00:46:54,035
Do you know
how many steps there are
in the Citadel?

620
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:55,243
No.

621
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:58,201
15,782.

622
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:06,201
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

623
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:10,868
None anymore.

624
00:47:10,868 --> 00:47:12,535
That's true.

625
00:47:12,535 --> 00:47:16,868
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

626
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:19,076
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

627
00:47:22,618 --> 00:47:25,826
What does
"annulment" mean?

628
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:29,701
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

629
00:47:29,701 --> 00:47:35,076
Maynard says here that
he issued an annulment
for a Prince "Ragger"

630
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:38,577
and remarried him
to someone else
at the same time

631
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:41,118
in a secret ceremony
in Dorne.

632
00:47:41,118 --> 00:47:43,035
Is that a common thing
in the south or--?

633
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:44,410
These maesters...

634
00:47:46,285 --> 00:47:49,868
they set me to the task
of preserving that man's
window counting

635
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:52,160
and annulments
and bowel movements
for all eternity,

636
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,951
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

637
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:56,618
probably sitting on
some dusty shelf somewhere,
completely ignored.

638
00:47:56,618 --> 00:47:58,535
But that's all right,
isn't it?

639
00:47:58,535 --> 00:48:02,618
We can all become
slavering, murderous imbeciles
in thrall to evil incarnate

640
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:04,243
as long as we can have access
to the full records

641
00:48:04,243 --> 00:48:08,285
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

642
00:48:10,618 --> 00:48:12,243
Steps.

643
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:17,410
That number
was the steps.

644
00:49:39,368 --> 00:49:41,951
Are you sure
you want to do this?

645
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:44,368
You always wanted
to be a maester.

646
00:49:45,993 --> 00:49:50,160
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

647
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,535
-

648
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,118
I found it, my lord.

649
00:51:24,826 --> 00:51:26,535
It, uh, took
some searching.

650
00:51:26,535 --> 00:51:28,618
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

651
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:35,951
You're sure
this is the only copy
in Winterfell?

652
00:51:35,951 --> 00:51:37,826
Uh, yes, my lord.

653
00:51:42,618 --> 00:51:44,535
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

654
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:18,535
Isn't it your job
to talk him out

655
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:20,535
of stupid
fucking ideas
like this?

656
00:54:20,535 --> 00:54:23,327
I've been failing
at that job of late.

657
00:54:24,951 --> 00:54:26,993
How many queens
are there now?

658
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:28,327
Two.

659
00:54:28,327 --> 00:54:31,493
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

660
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:33,327
or the one who
fucks her brother?

661
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,160
Both.

662
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,201
How many men
did you bring?

663
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:42,826
Not enough.

664
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:44,452
The big woman?

665
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,577
We were hoping
some of your men
could help.

666
00:54:50,577 --> 00:54:53,410
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

667
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:56,535
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

668
00:54:56,535 --> 00:54:57,535
You are.

669
00:55:00,327 --> 00:55:03,535
You really want
to go out there?
Again?

670
00:55:09,826 --> 00:55:11,577
You're not
the only ones.

671
00:55:15,201 --> 00:55:18,701
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

672
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:20,577
Said they were
on their way here.

673
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,868
You're the Hound.

674
00:55:30,868 --> 00:55:32,701
I saw you once
at Winterfell.

675
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,577
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

676
00:55:40,577 --> 00:55:43,868
We don't want to go
beyond the Wall,
we have to.

677
00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:46,035
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming--

678
00:55:46,035 --> 00:55:48,243
Don't trust him.

679
00:55:48,243 --> 00:55:50,201
Don't trust
any of them.

680
00:55:55,826 --> 00:55:57,452
They're the Brotherhood.

681
00:55:57,452 --> 00:56:00,035
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

682
00:56:00,035 --> 00:56:02,410
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

683
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:04,118
Thoros?

684
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,243
I hardly
recognized you.

685
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:13,452
Ser Jorah Mormont.

686
00:56:13,452 --> 00:56:16,410
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

687
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,452
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

688
00:56:19,452 --> 00:56:22,285
You're a fucking Mormont?

689
00:56:22,285 --> 00:56:24,410
Like the last
Lord Commander?

690
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,618
He was my father.

691
00:56:26,618 --> 00:56:29,618
He hunted us
like animals.

692
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:32,659
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

693
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:36,951
Here we all are

694
00:56:36,951 --> 00:56:38,535
at the edge
of the world

695
00:56:38,535 --> 00:56:40,118
at the same moment,

696
00:56:40,118 --> 00:56:42,618
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

697
00:56:44,452 --> 00:56:46,701
Our reasons
aren't your reasons.

698
00:56:46,701 --> 00:56:49,076
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

699
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:53,076
There's a greater
purpose at work.

700
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,368
And we serve it
together,

701
00:56:56,368 --> 00:56:58,659
whether we
know it or not.

702
00:56:58,659 --> 00:57:01,577
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light--

703
00:57:01,577 --> 00:57:04,951
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

704
00:57:04,951 --> 00:57:07,743
Are we coming
with you or not?

705
00:57:07,743 --> 00:57:09,951
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

706
00:57:09,951 --> 00:57:14,368
Is it worse than sitting
in a freezing cell, waiting to die?

707
00:57:14,368 --> 00:57:16,368
He's right.

708
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:18,368
We're all
on the same side.

709
00:57:20,868 --> 00:57:21,993
How can we be?

710
00:57:23,618 --> 00:57:25,701
We're all breathing.

711
00:59:58,493 --> 01:00:00,201
Death is the enemy.

712
01:00:05,285 --> 01:00:07,618
The first enemy and the last.

713
01:00:11,826 --> 01:00:13,410
The enemy always wins.

714
01:00:16,452 --> 01:00:17,868
And we still need to fight him.

715
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,493
You're scared, aren't you?

716
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:27,327
What are you scared of?
