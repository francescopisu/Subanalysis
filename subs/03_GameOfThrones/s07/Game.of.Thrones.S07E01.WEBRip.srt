1
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,491
The war is over.
Winter has come.

2
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:26,199
The war is not over.

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,490
The true enemy won't
wait out the storm.

4
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:33,490
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

5
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,575
Our uncle Euron returned
home after a long absence.

6
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,574
He murdered our father,
and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

7
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:49,175
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

8
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:53,200
Build me a thousand ships,
and I will give you this world.

9
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:56,532
There's a storm coming.

10
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,075
You'll be wanting
a roof tonight.

11
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:01,365
I don't have much, but I have
hidden a bit of silver

12
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,491
from the bandits.

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,033
What did you do?!

14
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:06,491
They'll both be dead
come winter.

15
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:09,532
Cold winds
are rising in the North.

16
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,199
We need good men to help us.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,407
You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.

18
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,034
It's not too late for you.

19
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:18,741
Send me to Oldtown.

20
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:20,450
I'm to be the new maester.

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,116
The Citadel has the world's
greatest library.

22
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,574
I'll learn about things
that all help when...

23
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:29,365
...when they come.

24
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,575
Let go of me!

25
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:44,825
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,159
I'm the three-eyed raven.
I have to be ready for this.

27
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:54,034
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

28
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:55,242
Aegon Targaryen.

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,824
Aegon used to live here, and the
Targaryens built this castle.

30
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:00,105
Aye. So they did.

31
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,575
I want us both to go home.
But they took it from us.

32
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:05,242
How do we go home?

33
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:07,707
You're in the great game now,

34
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:11,575
and the great game's
terrifying. Are you afraid?

35
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,824
My name is Arya Stark.
I want you to know that.

36
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:52,824

37
00:02:57,616 --> 00:03:01,407
You're wondering why
I brought you all here.

38
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:04,866
After all, we just had a feast.

39
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:07,824
Since when does old Walder

40
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:10,824
give us two feasts
in a single fortnight?

41
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:16,283
Well, it's no good being
Lord of the Riverlands

42
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:18,657
if you can't celebrate
with your family.

43
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,158
That's what I say!

44
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,574
Yes!

45
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,324
I've gathered every Frey
who means a damn thing

46
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:36,657
so I can tell you my plans
for this great house

47
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:39,532
now that winter has come.

48
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:42,700
But first, a toast!

49
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:47,949
No more of that
Dornish horse piss!

50
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,907
This is the finest Arbor gold!

51
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:53,907
Proper wine for proper heroes!

52
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:01,283
Stand together!

53
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,533
Stand together!

54
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:13,699
Not you.

55
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,616
I'm not wasting good wine
on a damn woman.

56
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:24,657
Maybe I'm not
the most pleasant man.

57
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:28,074
I'll admit it.
But I'm proud of you lot.

58
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:31,199
You're my family,
the men who helped me

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,241
slaughter the Starks
at the Red Wedding.

60
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:38,365
Yes, yes.

61
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:41,033
Cheer.

62
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,365
Brave men, all of you.

63
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:47,949
Butchered a woman
pregnant with her babe.

64
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,782
Cut the throat
of a mother of five.

65
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:56,907
Slaughtered your guests
after inviting them

66
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:58,658
into your home.

67
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:05,949
But you didn't slaughter
every one of the Starks.

68
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,699
No, no, that was your mistake.

69
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,574
You should have ripped them
all out, root and stem.

70
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:23,449
Leave one wolf alive

71
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,117
and the sheep are never safe.

72
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:54,034
When people ask you
what happened here...

73
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,325
tell them the North remembers.

74
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,658
Tell them winter came
for House Frey.

75
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:26,866
You wildlings?

76
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:29,783
I'm Meera Reed,
daughter of Howland Reed.

77
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:33,283
This is Brandon Stark,

78
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:35,491
son of Ned Stark.

79
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,325
How do I know that's true?

80
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:47,824
You were at
the Fist of the First Men.

81
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:49,284
You were at Hardhome.

82
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,159
You've seen
the Army of the Dead.

83
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:56,408
You've seen the Night King.

84
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,491
He's coming for us.

85
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:01,825
For all of us.

86
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,574
Okay, come on.

87
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,658
Let's get them inside.

88
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:45,949
I want every northern
maester to scour their records

89
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,116
for any mention of dragonglass.

90
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:51,199
Dragonglass kills white walkers.

91
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,866
It's more valuable
to us now than gold.

92
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,532
We need to find it,
we need to mine it,

93
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,242
we need to make weapons from it.

94
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:01,574
Everyone aged 10 to 60

95
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:04,824
will drill daily with spears,
pikes, bow and arrow.

96
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:08,033
It's about time we taught these
boys of summer how to fight.

97
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:10,324
Not just the boys.

98
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:12,824
We can't defend the North

99
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:14,991
if only half the
population is fighting.

100
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:19,699
You expect me to put a spear
in my granddaughter's hand?

101
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,365
I don't plan on knitting by the
fire while men fight for me.

102
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:26,449
I might be small, Lord Glover,
and I might be a girl,

103
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,907
but I am every bit as much
a Northerner as you.

104
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:30,782
Indeed you are, my lady.
No one has questioned...

105
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,908
And I don't need your
permission to defend the North.

106
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:40,657
We'll begin training every man,
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

107
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:42,741
Aye!

108
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:44,241
While we're
preparing for attack,

109
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:46,574
we need to shore up
our defenses.

110
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:50,074
The only thing standing between us and
the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

111
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:53,991
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

112
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:56,408
I'm not the king
of the Free Folk.

113
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,283
But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

114
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:04,490
You want us to man
the castles for you?

115
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:06,074
Aye.

116
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:08,907
Last time we saw the Night
King was at Hardhome.

117
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:12,241
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

118
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:13,782
Then that's where I'll go.

119
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:16,949
Looks like we're
the Night's Watch now.

120
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:20,824
If they breach the Wall,

121
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:22,365
the first two castles
in their path

122
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,907
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

123
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:28,574
The Umbers and the Karstarks
betrayed the North.

124
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,199
Their castles
should be torn down

125
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,949
with not a stone left standing.

126
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,532
The castles committed no crimes.

127
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:37,949
And we need every fortress
we have for the war to come.

128
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,283
We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

129
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:43,824
loyal families who supported
us against Ramsay.

130
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:47,033
Aye!

131
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,324
The Umbers and the Karstarks

132
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,824
have fought beside
the Starks for centuries.

133
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:55,991
- They've kept faith for generation after generation.
- And then they broke faith.

134
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:59,074
I'm not going to strip these
families of their ancestral homes

135
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:01,657
because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

136
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,324
So there's no
punishment for treason

137
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:05,825
and no reward for loyalty?

138
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:13,657
The punishment
for treason is death.

139
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:16,490
Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

140
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:19,324
Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

141
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,741
They died fighting for Ramsay.

142
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:23,324
Give the castles to the families

143
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,699
of the men who died
fighting for you.

144
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:41,825
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

145
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:45,657
I executed men who betrayed me.

146
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:49,907
I executed men who
refused to follow orders.

147
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,699
My father always said,

148
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,283
"The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword,"

149
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:57,574
and I have tried
to live by those words.

150
00:14:57,575 --> 00:15:01,033
But I will not punish a son
for his father's sins,

151
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,490
and I will not take
a family home away

152
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:06,866
from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

153
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:09,449
That is my decision,

154
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,034
and my decision is final.

155
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:19,242
Ned Umber.

156
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:28,575
Alys Karstark.

157
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,407
For centuries,
our families fought

158
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:48,241
side by side on the battlefield.

159
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:53,241
I ask you to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

160
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:55,782
to serve as our bannermen

161
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:58,491
and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

162
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:08,408
Stand.

163
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:14,907
Yesterday's wars
don't matter anymore.

164
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,907
The North needs
to band together,

165
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:19,284
all the living north.

166
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:22,949
Will you stand beside me,
Ned and Alys,

167
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,199
now and always?

168
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,657
Now and always!

169
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:49,033
You are my sister,
but I am king now.

170
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,657
Will you start wearing a crown?

171
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:52,283
When you question my decisions

172
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:54,449
in front of the other lords
and ladies, you undermine me.

173
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,158
- So I can't question your decisions anymore?
- Of course you can, but...

174
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,490
Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

175
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:01,491
You think he was a good king?

176
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,117
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

177
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:11,657
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

178
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:13,159
Thank you.

179
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,866
You're good at this, you know.

180
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:19,324
- At what?
- At ruling.

181
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:21,158
No.

182
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:22,159
You are.

183
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,658
You are.

184
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:28,449
They respect you,
they really do,

185
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,615
but you have to...

186
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,033
Why are you laughing?

187
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,199
What did father used to say?

188
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,532
Everything before the
word "but" is horse shit.

189
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:39,033
He never said that to me.

190
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,741
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

191
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:44,824
Because he was
trying to protect us.

192
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:47,824
He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

193
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,532
but Father couldn't protect
me and neither can you.

194
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:53,241
- Stop trying.
- All right, I'll stop trying to protect you

195
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:54,615
and you stop trying
to undermine me.

196
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,825
I'm not trying to undermine you!

197
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:01,407
You have to be
smarter than Father.

198
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:04,074
You need to be
smarter than Robb.

199
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:07,199
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

200
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,241
and they both
lost their heads for it.

201
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:11,449
And how should I be smarter?

202
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,908
By listening to you?

203
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:18,241
Would that be so terrible?

204
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:21,200
A raven from King's
Landing, Your Grace.

205
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,241
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

206
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,158
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

207
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,782
Protector of
the Seven Kingdoms..."

208
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,242
What does she want?

209
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:42,283
Come to King's Landing.

210
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:46,116
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

211
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:48,241
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

212
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:50,074
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

213
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:53,116
I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

214
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:55,741
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

215
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:57,449
We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

216
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,283
There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

217
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:02,199
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

218
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,991
Winter is here. The Lannisters
are a southern army.

219
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,449
They've never ranged
this far north.

220
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,782
You're the military man,
but I know her.

221
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:13,116
If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

222
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:16,284
Everyone who's ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

223
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,450
You almost sound
as if you admire her.

224
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:27,284
I learned a great deal from her.

225
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,991
What is this?

226
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:08,657
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

227
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:11,449
It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

228
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,949
He knew it.

229
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,907
Made me memorize
every damn city, town,

230
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:16,490
lake, forest, and mountain.

231
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:18,658
It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

232
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,532
You've been quiet
since you came home.

233
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,991
Are you angry with me?

234
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:26,242
No, not angry.

235
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:28,366
Are you afraid of me?

236
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:31,491
Should I be?

237
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:39,199
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
Tyrion to be her Hand.

238
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,991
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

239
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:44,991
hoping to take back
her father's throne.

240
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:47,407
Our little brother,

241
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:49,574
the one you love so much,

242
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:51,407
the one you set free,

243
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:54,699
the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

244
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,034
now he stands beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

245
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:05,741
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

246
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,450
Where will they land?

247
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:11,574
Dragonstone.

248
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:14,365
They have deep-water
ports for the ships.

249
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:16,365
Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

250
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:17,824
and that's where she was born.

251
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:20,116
Enemies to the east.

252
00:21:20,117 --> 00:21:21,907
Enemies to the south...

253
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:24,907
Ellaria Sand
and her brood of bitches.

254
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,741
Enemies to the west...

255
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:28,574
Olenna, the old cunt.

256
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:31,782
Another traitor.

257
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,949
Enemies to the north.

258
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,074
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

259
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:40,074
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

260
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:42,741
Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

261
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:44,449
You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

262
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,574
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

263
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:50,866
We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

264
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:55,033
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

265
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:57,074
Will the Tyrell bannermen
stand alongside

266
00:21:57,075 --> 00:22:00,365
a Dothraki horde
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

267
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:03,033
If they think Daenerys will win.

268
00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:04,991
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

269
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:08,117
Right now, we look
like the losing side.

270
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,241
I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

271
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:13,991
Three kingdoms, at best.

272
00:22:13,992 --> 00:22:16,532
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

273
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,324
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

274
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,365
I understand whoever loses dies.

275
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:23,657
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

276
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:25,241
that lasts a thousand years.

277
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:27,824
A dynasty for whom?

278
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:30,824
Our children are dead.

279
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:32,283
We're the last of us.

280
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,325
A dynasty for us, then.

281
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,034
We never talked about Tommen.

282
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,991
There's nothing to say.

283
00:22:43,992 --> 00:22:45,949
Our baby boy killed himself.

284
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,490
He betrayed me.

285
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,991
He betrayed us both.

286
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,824
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead...

287
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:52,241
Mother, father,
and all our children?

288
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:54,824
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

289
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:58,033
But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

290
00:22:58,034 --> 00:23:01,034
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

291
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:09,532
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

292
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,699
Where are our allies now?

293
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,907
You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

294
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:16,574
I heard.

295
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:19,116
- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

296
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:21,116
He was a useless, old coward,

297
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:22,949
but the Freys supported us.

298
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,324
Now they're all dead.

299
00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:26,033
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

300
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:27,574
We need allies.

301
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:29,365
Stronger, better allies.

302
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,491
We can't win this war alone.

303
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:37,117
You think I listened to Father for
40 years and learned nothing?

304
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:15,615
The Greyjoys?

305
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,199
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

306
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,033
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

307
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:22,615
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

308
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:25,116
the new King
of the Iron Islands.

309
00:24:25,117 --> 00:24:27,824
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

310
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:30,949
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

311
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,365
How are they different
from the Freys?

312
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:34,949
They both broke their promises

313
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,241
and murdered their former friends
as soon as it suited them.

314
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,241
So does everyone
when it suits them.

315
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:42,866
Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

316
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:45,490
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

317
00:24:45,491 --> 00:24:48,907
I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

318
00:24:48,908 --> 00:24:52,116
All they know how to do is steal things
they can't build or grow themselves.

319
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,241
Euron Greyjoy didn't
come here for that.

320
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,283
Oh, what did
he come here for, then?

321
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:57,950
A queen.

322
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:13,866
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

323
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:16,241
they turned on me.

324
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:17,490
Their own uncle.

325
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:20,116
They stole
my best ships and ran.

326
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:22,283
Sailed them
right across the world

327
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:24,574
and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

328
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:28,033
so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

329
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:31,490
It's nothing compared
to the treason you suffered

330
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:35,158
at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

331
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,867
But still, it bothers me.

332
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:42,532
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

333
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:46,699
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

334
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,615
are fighting for the same side,

335
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:51,158
I thought we rightful monarchs

336
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,742
could murder them together.

337
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:02,533
You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

338
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:09,657
The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

339
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:13,699
but as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

340
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,532
Come to mention it,

341
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,907
weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

342
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:22,116
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

343
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:23,824
You certainly caught us there.

344
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:26,657
Very smart move on your part.

345
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:30,907
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

346
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:32,116
I was there.

347
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:33,949
I remember very well.

348
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,490
I saw you.

349
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:37,782
I heard so much talk.

350
00:26:37,783 --> 00:26:41,407
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

351
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:43,116
I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

352
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:46,407
But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

353
00:26:46,408 --> 00:26:48,575
and started
cutting people down...

354
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:53,782
it was glorious.

355
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:55,199
Like a dance.

356
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,407
The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

357
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,741
The place was getting crowded.

358
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:03,324
I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

359
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:05,532
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

360
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:07,991
A good thing for me.

361
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:11,615
If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

362
00:27:11,616 --> 00:27:13,532
If I hadn't done that,

363
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:17,117
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

364
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,992
If not the most humble.

365
00:27:21,284 --> 00:27:22,284
You're not humble.

366
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,242
You're the queen
of a great nation.

367
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,199
You don't care about
the Iron Islands.

368
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,866
They're nothing but rocks
and bird shit and...

369
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:36,741
And a lot of very
unattractive people.

370
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,365
The Iron Fleet,
on the other hand,

371
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,490
that's something else entirely.

372
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:45,782
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

373
00:27:45,783 --> 00:27:50,365
With the Iron Fleet,
you own the seas.

374
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:53,199
You can defeat
the invaders of the east

375
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,158
and the pretenders
of the north and south.

376
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,783
What do you want in return?

377
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:02,907
Ever since I was a little boy,

378
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:04,824
I wanted to grow up and marry

379
00:28:04,825 --> 00:28:06,949
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

380
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,657
So here I am,

381
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:12,116
with a thousand ships

382
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:13,658
and two good hands.

383
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:20,658
I decline your proposal.

384
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,199
Why?

385
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,867
You're not trustworthy.

386
00:28:27,284 --> 00:28:29,365
You've broken promises
to allies before

387
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:31,824
and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

388
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:33,366
You murdered your own brother.

389
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,033
You should try it.
Feels wonderful.

390
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:40,699
I don't expect you
to trust me outright.

391
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,074
You need proof
of my honest intentions.

392
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:44,532
In my experience,

393
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:47,532
the surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

394
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,824
A priceless gift.

395
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:51,699
I won't return to King's Landing

396
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,742
until I have that for you.

397
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:02,574
Ah, Maester Weyland.

398
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:06,075
A drinker's
liver if ever I saw one.

399
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,325
Weigh that.

400
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:12,782
The triumph
of transitory pleasures.

401
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:14,699
Mankind's curse.

402
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,782
Archmaester, I was wondering...

403
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:19,741
What's the weight?

404
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:22,700
Um, 147.

405
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:28,699
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

406
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,782
I don't remember
your proposition.

407
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,074
I asked you if, in light of
what I've seen in the North,

408
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:38,241
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

409
00:32:38,242 --> 00:32:39,949
That area is reserved
for maesters.

410
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,449
- Are you a maester?
- No.

411
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,575
Not a very strong
proposition, is it?

412
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:56,532
Archmaester, with respect,

413
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:58,365
I've seen them...

414
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:00,615
The Army of the Dead.

415
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:02,991
The white walkers.

416
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:05,490
I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

417
00:33:05,491 --> 00:33:08,033
but everyone in the Citadel,

418
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:10,199
those who will even talk to me,

419
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,033
they all doubt the walkers ever
existed in the first place.

420
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,574
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

421
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:16,658
It's their job.

422
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,491
But the tales of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

423
00:33:27,325 --> 00:33:30,241
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

424
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,824
Sources in the restricted area?

425
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,450
The very same.

426
00:33:35,742 --> 00:33:37,199
And the simplest explanation

427
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,158
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

428
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,657
is that you're telling the truth

429
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:44,782
and that you saw
what you say you saw.

430
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:47,658
So, you believe me.

431
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:50,490
I do.

432
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:52,200
You'll finish
weighing that heart?

433
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,325
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

434
00:34:00,366 --> 00:34:03,199
We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

435
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,408
And we're not like the
people north of the Twins.

436
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:11,658
In the Citadel, we lead different
lives for different reasons.

437
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:16,324
We are this world's memory,
Samwell Tarly.

438
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:19,283
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

439
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:21,449
Don't remember
any meal but the last,

440
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,116
can't see forward
to any but the next.

441
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:26,283
And every time you leave the
house and shut the door,

442
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:29,199
they howl like
you're gone forever.

443
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,199
When Robert's Rebellion
was raging,

444
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,033
people thought the end was near.

445
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:37,116
The end of the Targaryen dynasty.
"How will we survive?"

446
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,574
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

447
00:34:40,575 --> 00:34:42,532
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush...

448
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,574
"The end is near!
How will we survive?"

449
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:47,449
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

450
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,574
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

451
00:34:49,575 --> 00:34:52,284
But it wasn't.
None of it was.

452
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,616
The Wall has stood
through it all.

453
00:34:57,908 --> 00:35:00,867
And every winter
that ever came has ended.

454
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:11,242
Be a good lad.
Clean this up.

455
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,742
Nope.

456
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:14,867
Nope.

457
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:29,325
You're a lucky man.

458
00:36:33,783 --> 00:36:36,658
I've heard she
beat the Hound in single combat.

459
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,950
She's a very impressive woman.

460
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:46,491
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

461
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:51,866
I want you to be happy.

462
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:54,241
I want you to be safe.

463
00:36:54,242 --> 00:36:55,532
I am safe.

464
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:58,699
I'm at home,
surrounded by friends.

465
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,075
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

466
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,742
What about happy?

467
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,241
Why aren't you happy?

468
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:14,199
What do you want
that you do not have?

469
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,949
At the moment, peace and quiet.

470
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:25,241
No need to seize the
last word, Lord Baelish.

471
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,616
I'll assume it was
something clever.

472
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:31,449
My lady.

473
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,242
My lady.

474
00:37:43,742 --> 00:37:45,283
Why is he still here?

475
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:48,033
We need his men.

476
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:51,616
Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton
would still hold this castle.

477
00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:54,616
Littlefinger saved us.

478
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:00,408
He wants something.

479
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,533
I know exactly what he wants.

480
00:38:09,658 --> 00:38:13,283
♪ He rode through the
streets of the city ♪

481
00:38:13,284 --> 00:38:16,324
♪ Down from
his hill on high ♪

482
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:19,907
♪ O'er the winds and the steps
and the cobbles ♪

483
00:38:19,908 --> 00:38:23,407
♪ He rode
to a woman's sigh ♪

484
00:38:23,408 --> 00:38:26,615
♪ For she was
his secret treasure ♪

485
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:30,033
♪ She was his shame
and his bliss ♪

486
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:32,949
♪ And a chain and a keep
are nothing ♪

487
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,615
♪ Compared to
a woman's kiss ♪

488
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:39,116
♪ For hands of
gold are always cold ♪

489
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,782
♪ But a woman's hands
are warm ♪

490
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:45,615
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

491
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:48,616
♪ But a woman's hands are... ♪

492
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:51,365
That's a pretty song.

493
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:52,449
I've never heard it before.

494
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,907
It's a new one.

495
00:38:53,908 --> 00:38:56,907
Are you hungry?
We've got some rabbit.

496
00:38:56,908 --> 00:38:58,365
I don't want to steal your food.

497
00:38:58,366 --> 00:39:00,741
You're not stealing,
we're offering.

498
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:03,117
Come on, it's gonna
be a cold night.

499
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:33,116
You heading south?

500
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:35,199
King's Landing.

501
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,283
Poor girl.

502
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:39,949
Not so bad, is it?

503
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,074
Depends on your taste, I guess.

504
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:45,365
If you like your streets covered in shit
and pig's blood, it's the town for you.

505
00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:48,199
All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep,

506
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,365
the Sept of Baelor,
the Dragonpit.

507
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:52,324
Then when I finally make it,

508
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:54,532
they wouldn't let me within
a mile of the Red Keep,

509
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:56,490
the Sept of Baelor's
blown to hell,

510
00:39:56,491 --> 00:39:58,449
and the Dragonpit
is a damn ruin.

511
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,324
The people who live there,

512
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:03,033
they'd skin you alive if they could
make two coppers off your hide.

513
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,158
Worst place in the world.

514
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:07,532
What are you doing
in the Riverlands?

515
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,116
There's been some trouble with
the Freys up at the Twins,

516
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,450
so we're part of the army that's
been sent to keep the peace.

517
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:19,365
Here you go.
Guests first.

518
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:21,490
Oh, no, I couldn't.
You don't have enough.

519
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:23,949
My mother always told me
to be kind to strangers.

520
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,908
Strangers will be kind to you.

521
00:40:38,408 --> 00:40:40,490
You're a long way from home.

522
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:42,574
I'm sure you've had
some adventures, though.

523
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:45,407
Yeah, endless adventures.

524
00:40:45,408 --> 00:40:48,074
They'll be singing about us for a thousand years.

525
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:51,741
The truth is when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

526
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:54,074
But now we've been gone a while,
we can't wait to get home.

527
00:40:54,075 --> 00:40:58,116
I just think about my dad out
there on his boat all alone.

528
00:40:58,117 --> 00:40:59,491
I ought to be
out there with him.

529
00:41:01,616 --> 00:41:03,449
My wife just had our first baby.

530
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,741
- Boy or girl?
- Oh, who knows?

531
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:07,907
You think soldiers get
ravens with news from home?

532
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,365
- I hope it's a girl.
- Why?

533
00:41:14,366 --> 00:41:17,324
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

534
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:19,325
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

535
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,908
Are you old
enough to drink?

536
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:41,241
It's blackberry wine.

537
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:42,533
I made it myself.

538
00:41:43,992 --> 00:41:45,117
It's really good.

539
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:50,616
So, why is a nice girl on her
own heading to King's Landing?

540
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,159
I'm going to kill the queen.

541
00:42:21,616 --> 00:42:23,532
Bad night
to be outdoors.

542
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:26,365
You've got real
powerful magic to figure that out.

543
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:30,449
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

544
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,615
"It's snowing, Thoros.
It's windy.

545
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:36,574
It's gonna be
a cold night."

546
00:42:36,575 --> 00:42:40,449
You're a grouchy old bear,
aren't you, Clegane?

547
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,116
You want some rum?

548
00:42:42,117 --> 00:42:45,199
Don't like that shit.
It's too sweet.

549
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,242
Why are you always
in such a foul mood?

550
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:51,533
Experience.

551
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,992
This seems like a good
place to spend the night.

552
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:03,074
These people don't want us here.

553
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:05,991
Seems deserted to me.
No livestock.

554
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:07,950
No smoke coming
from the chimney.

555
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:28,907
I don't like the look of it.

556
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:31,907
For a big, hard man,
you scare easy.

557
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:34,532
I'll tell you
what doesn't scare me...

558
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:36,532
Bald cocksuckers like you.

559
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:39,407
You think you're fooling
anyone with that top knot?

560
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,200
Bald cunt.

561
00:43:43,284 --> 00:43:44,824
Come on.

562
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,658
Maybe they've got
some ale hidden away.

563
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,782
They don't.

564
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,365
See if there's a larder.

565
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,075
They always leave
something behind.

566
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,102
How do you think
it ended for them?

567
00:44:40,658 --> 00:44:41,866
With death.

568
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:44,824
Girl died in her father's arms.

569
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:47,658
Both of them covered in blood
and a knife at their feet.

570
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,782
I'd say they were starving.

571
00:44:51,783 --> 00:44:53,699
And rather than
let his little girl suffer,

572
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,657
he ended it for both of them.

573
00:44:55,658 --> 00:44:57,907
Doesn't matter now.

574
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:00,700
No, doesn't matter now.

575
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,866
I've known you
a long time, Dondarrion.

576
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:18,365
Aye.

577
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:22,449
I think the first time we met
was at that tournament...

578
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,699
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

579
00:45:27,034 --> 00:45:28,782
You're not bad.

580
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:30,158
I don't hate you.

581
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:32,532
Don't like you,
but you're not bad.

582
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,365
Thank you, Clegane.

583
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:35,699
That warms the heart.

584
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,365
But there's nothing
special about you.

585
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:40,199
You're right about that.

586
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,658
So why does the Lord of Light
keep bringing you back?

587
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,033
I've met better men than you,

588
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:51,949
and they've been hanged from
crossbeams, or beheaded,

589
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:56,824
or just shat themselves to
death in a field somewhere.

590
00:45:56,825 --> 00:45:59,907
None of them came back.

591
00:45:59,908 --> 00:46:01,490
So, why you?

592
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:04,407
You think I don't
ask myself that?

593
00:46:04,408 --> 00:46:07,574
Every hour of every day?

594
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:09,242
Why am I here?

595
00:46:10,616 --> 00:46:12,407
What am I supposed to do?

596
00:46:12,408 --> 00:46:14,200
What does the Lord see in me?

597
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,533
And?

598
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:21,907
I don't know.

599
00:46:21,908 --> 00:46:23,907
I don't understand our Lord.

600
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:25,741
Your Lord.

601
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:27,532
I don't know
what He wants from me.

602
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:32,033
I only know that
He wants me alive.

603
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:36,325
If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he
just tell you what the fuck he wants?

604
00:46:38,408 --> 00:46:40,199
Clegane.

605
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,575
Come over here.

606
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:45,950
Don't worry.
The fire won't bite.

607
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:50,241
I want to show you something.

608
00:46:50,242 --> 00:46:53,450
It's my fucking luck I end up
with a band of fire worshippers.

609
00:46:54,616 --> 00:46:55,949
Aye.

610
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,283
Almost seems like
divine justice.

611
00:46:58,284 --> 00:47:00,824
There's no divine justice,
you dumb cunt.

612
00:47:00,825 --> 00:47:03,949
If there was, you'd be dead...

613
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,117
and that girl would be alive.

614
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:15,324
- What do you want?
- Look into the flames.

615
00:47:15,325 --> 00:47:17,449
I don't want to look
in the damn flames.

616
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:20,992
You saw me bring him back from
the dead after you cut him down.

617
00:47:22,616 --> 00:47:24,866
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

618
00:47:24,867 --> 00:47:28,324
I keep asking and no
one wants to tell me.

619
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:29,824
We can't tell you.

620
00:47:29,825 --> 00:47:31,992
Only the fire can tell you.

621
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:46,034
What do you see?

622
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:49,241
Logs burning.

623
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,325
Keep looking.

624
00:47:56,992 --> 00:47:58,200
What do you see?

625
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,407
Ice.

626
00:48:10,408 --> 00:48:12,325
A wall of ice.

627
00:48:14,742 --> 00:48:15,742
The Wall.

628
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:19,782
What else?

629
00:48:19,783 --> 00:48:23,992
It's where the Wall
meets the sea.

630
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,408
There's a castle there.

631
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:36,324
There's a mountain.

632
00:48:36,325 --> 00:48:39,783
Looks like an arrowhead.

633
00:48:42,408 --> 00:48:44,575
The dead are marching past.

634
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:51,366
Thousands of them.

635
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:58,908
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

636
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:02,533
Do you believe
we're here for a reason?

637
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,783
What the hell
are you doing, Clegane?

638
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,783
Burying the dead.

639
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:55,991
You knew these people.

640
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,491
Not really.

641
00:50:57,992 --> 00:51:01,824
We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy.

642
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,867
We ask the Mother to...

643
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,867
Fuck it, I don't
remember the rest.

644
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:19,365
I'm sorry you're dead.

645
00:51:19,366 --> 00:51:22,283
You deserved better.

646
00:51:22,284 --> 00:51:23,284
Both of you.

647
00:51:47,242 --> 00:51:48,907
Hey.

648
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:55,490
Mom.

649
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:57,242
You should really sleep, Sam.

650
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,242
The dead don't.

651
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,616
"Legends of the Long Night."

652
00:52:14,366 --> 00:52:17,615
The Targaryens used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons

653
00:52:17,616 --> 00:52:20,159
without even knowing what
the First Men used it for.

654
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,450
What is it?

655
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:42,199
It's a map of Dragonstone.

656
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,490
The Targaryens built
their first stronghold there

657
00:52:44,491 --> 00:52:46,284
when they invaded Westeros.

658
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:50,741
That's dragonglass?

659
00:52:50,742 --> 00:52:52,490
A mountain of it.

660
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:53,657
Beneath the ground.

661
00:52:53,658 --> 00:52:55,991
Stannis told me,
but I didn't think...

662
00:52:55,992 --> 00:52:59,491
This is important.
Jon needs to know.

663
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:54,866
Has she come yet?

664
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:56,490
Who?

665
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:58,699
The Dragon Queen.

666
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,658
Daenerys Stormborn.

667
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:03,575
Haven't heard anything.

668

669
00:59:43,658 --> 00:59:45,574
Shall we begin?

670
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:08,658
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

671
01:01:09,825 --> 01:01:12,407
The Mad King's
daughter will destroy the realm.

672
01:01:12,408 --> 01:01:15,159
We have an army
of fleets and three dragons.

673
01:01:15,783 --> 01:01:17,658
We should hit
King's Landing now.
