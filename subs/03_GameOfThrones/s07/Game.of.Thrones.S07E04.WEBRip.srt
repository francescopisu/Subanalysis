1
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:12,542
I lost this DAGGER.

2
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:13,876
To whom?

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,667
Tyrion Lannister.

4
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:19,458
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

5
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:20,459
with a possible ally.

6
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,666
I will allow you to mine
the dragonglass

7
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:23,916
and forge weapons from it.

8
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:24,917
Thank you.

9
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:28,792
She has three
full-grown dragons, Your Grace.

10
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,125
How do you propose to stop them?

11
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:34,042
We are currently at work
on a solution.

12
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,667
I thought
you'd be heading for Winterfell.

13
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,416
Jon Snow came down
from Castle Black

14
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,617
with a wildling army and won
the Battle of the Bastards.

15
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:46,876
He's King of the North now.

16
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:50,493
Your sister's dead.

17
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:52,082
Euron has her.

18
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,709
I couldn't save her.
I tried.

19
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:57,208
You wouldn't be here
if you'd tried.

20
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:59,876
What about Casterly Rock?

21
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,042
We both know
how expensive war can be.

22
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,542
Your vaults are empty.

23
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:14,375
My debt will be paid in full.

24
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,374
How will it happen?

25
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,458
Will there be pain?

26
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:18,876
No, I'll make sure of that.

27
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:20,834
I'd hate to die like your son.

28
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:23,417
Not at all what I intended.

29
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:24,959
Tell Cersei.

30
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,792
I want her to know it was me.

31
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:35,792

32
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Hold that wagon!

33
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,916
You've just won the biggest
prize in the world.

34
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:58,167
What could you possibly
have to be upset about?

35
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,374
Come on,
you can tell me.

36
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,916
Queen of Thorns give you one
last prick in the balls

37
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,249
before saying goodbye?

38
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,833
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

39
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,041
There is no more
High Septon.

40
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,291
No, there isn't,
is there?

41
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:16,584
There is still
the question of my prize.

42
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:21,249
That's a lot of money
I just gave you.

43
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,584
It's not a castle.

44
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,416
How about that one?
It's available.

45
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,791
You don't want
Highgarden.

46
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,583
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

47
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:33,792
Daenerys Targaryen could come and take
it back the day after you move in.

48
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,041
Besides,
think of the upkeep.

49
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:40,082
The more you owe,
the more it weighs you down.

50
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,666
Oh, is that why
you're so fucking glum, eh?

51
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,584
All your new riches
weighing you down?

52
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,124
- Move out!
- They're not mine.

53
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,875
This all belongs
to the Iron Bank.

54
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:54,124
See?
We pay our debts.

55
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,959
Right,
just not to me.

56
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:00,624
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of...

57
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,082
whatever nameless
shit heap you're from

58
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,000
with a saddlebag
full of gold,

59
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:07,458
complaining about
not getting paid.

60
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,249
When we win this war,

61
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,124
all the castles
in the Seven Kingdoms

62
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,583
will be yours
to choose from,

63
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:14,000
with no one left
to take them away from you.

64
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:15,875
Yes, I'm sure
Queen Cersei's reign

65
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:17,332
will be quiet
and peaceable.

66
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,916
Ah, stranger things
have happened.

67
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:19,959
Like what?

68
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,958
The granaries are being emptied
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

69
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,791
- The current harvest?
- We have teams of men collecting it

70
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,458
from all the farms
in the Reach.

71
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,791
Ser Bronn, will you
accompany the Tarlys

72
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,958
and help them
accelerate this process?

73
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,958
I'm not much
for shoveling wheat.

74
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:41,124
No, but motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over their harvest...

75
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,167
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

76
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,000
My lord.

77
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:48,125
My lord.

78
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,333
My lord.

79
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,249
I must say,
I don't think the Iron Bank

80
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,000
has ever had a debt of this magnitude
repaid in a single installment.

81
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:13,207
I always considered your father a
very effective and efficient man,

82
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,833
but you appear to be redefining
those terms entirely.

83
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,041
You're too kind,
my lord.

84
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:22,207
I am neither kind
nor a lord, Your Grace.

85
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,374
I am merely an instrument of
the institution I represent.

86
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,124
Its well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

87
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,208
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

88
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:35,499
- Uh, the gold...
- Is on its way.

89
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,499
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,416
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

91
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,166
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

92
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:48,416
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

93
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,875
Yes, perhaps we could
be of assistance

94
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,666
in some
current venture.

95
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,624
My only venture
at this moment

96
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,291
is reestablishing control
over this continent

97
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,583
and every person on it.

98
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:03,416
I see a great deal
of potential in that venture.

99
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:07,374
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

100
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,624
It will, indeed.

101
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,583
I need to expand
my armies, my navies.

102
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:15,291
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures
to the Golden Company in Essos.

103
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:16,499
I know them well.

104
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,958
They have helped us
recover significant sums

105
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,916
from parties who had
fallen into deep arrears.

106
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,624
That's good to hear.

107
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,042
I, too, would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

108
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,750
Rest assured,
Your Grace,

109
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,666
you can count on
the Iron Bank's support.

110
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:36,709
- Hmm.
- As soon as the gold arrives.

111
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,792
This is for you.

112
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:49,291
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

113
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,125
but your mother
fought him off.

114
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,958
The other dagger,

115
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,624
the one that
took her life,

116
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,833
I would have stopped that
dagger with my own heart

117
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,250
if I could have.

118
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,959
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

119
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,666
But I am here
for her now

120
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,374
to do what she would have done,

121
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,333
to protect her children.

122
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:29,833
Anything I can do
for you, Brandon,

123
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:32,167
you need only ask.

124
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,374
Do you know
who this belonged to?

125
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,082
No.

126
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,916
That very question was what started
the War of the Five Kings.

127
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:48,332
In a way, that dagger made
you what you are today.

128
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,207
Forced from your home,

129
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,708
driven out to the wilds
beyond the Wall.

130
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:57,459
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

131
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:10,041
To go through all of that
and make your way home again

132
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:14,666
only to find such chaos
in the world,

133
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:15,708
I can only imagine...

134
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,667
Chaos is a ladder.

135
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,958
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, Lord Stark.

136
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,375
I'm not Lord Stark.

137
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,875
What's that?

138
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:49,875
Maester Wolkan built it for me

139
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:51,416
so I can move around
more easily.

140
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,250
It's a very good idea.

141
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,959
You're leaving.

142
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,916
I don't want
to leave you,

143
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:03,916
but when...
when they come,

144
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,625
I need to be
with my family.

145
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,708
And you're safe.

146
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,584
Well, as safe
as anyone can be now.

147
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,917
You don't
need me anymore.

148
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:16,542
No, I don't.

149
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,121
That's all
you've got to say?

150
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,167
Thank you.

151
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,624
Thank you?

152
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,292
For helping me.

153
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,416
My brother
died for you.

154
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:37,124
Hodor and Summer
died for you.

155
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,459
I almost died for you.

156
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:46,292
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

157
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,791
Not anymore.

158
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,249
I remember what it felt
like to be Brandon Stark,

159
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,751
but I remember
so much else now.

160
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:07,459
You died in that cave.

161
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,249
I did.

162
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,666
The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

163
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:54,332
The only thing in the kitchen that
you've put your cock in is the liver.

164
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,666
'Ey up.
Where you going?

165
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,207
In there.
I live here.

166
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,916
Fuck off.

167
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,001
I'm Arya Stark.
This is my home.

168
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,500
Arya Stark's dead.

169
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,332
Send for Maester Luwin
or Ser Rodrick.

170
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,374
- They'll tell you who I am.
- There's no Rodrick here.

171
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,207
Maester's named Wolkan.

172
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,374
Go ask Jon Snow, then,
the King in the North.

173
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,916
- He's my brother.
- He's a thousand miles away.

174
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,708
Look, it's cold
and we're busy,

175
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:31,082
- so, you know, best fuck off.
- Mm.

176
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,959
If Jon's gone, who's in
charge of Winterfell?

177
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:39,124
The Lady of Winterfell.
Lady Stark.

178
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,833
- Which Lady Stark?
- You tell us.

179
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,584
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

180
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,416
Tell Sansa
her sister's home.

181
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:52,750
Lady Sansa is too busy to waste
her breath on you, just like us.

182
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,082
So, for the last time,
fuck off.

183
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,207
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

184
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,708
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

185
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,751
But if I am and Sansa finds
out you turned me away...

186
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,958
Right, you sit there.

187
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,166
Right there.

188
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,167
Don't move.

189
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,124
Right, go tell Lady Stark.
I'll watch her.

190
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,458
I ain't telling Lady Stark.
You can tell her.

191
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:32,834
Why me?

192
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,082
- You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

193
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,000
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit
you right in the fucking face

194
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,375
as hard as I can.

195
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,124
We told her to wait.

196
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,875
We were standing
right next to her, and...

197
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:19,000
And... and when we turned
around, she'd gone, my lady.

198
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:20,875
She... she was nothing.
Some winter town girl.

199
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:23,666
She comes in asking
for, uh, Ser Rodrick...

200
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,166
- Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah.
- ...and Maester Luwin.

201
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,583
And don't
trouble yourself over it, my lady.

202
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:31,791
- We'll... we'll find her.
- You don't have to.

203
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,291
I know where she is.

204
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,834
Do I have to call you
Lady Stark now?

205
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,542
Yes.

206
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,958
You shouldn't have run
from the guards.

207
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,000
I didn't run.

208
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,375
You need better guards.

209
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,208
It suits you...
Lady Stark.

210
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,249
Jon left you
in charge?

211
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,625
He did.

212
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,541
I hope
he comes back soon.

213
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,374
I remember how happy
he was to see me.

214
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,708
When he sees you, his
heart will probably stop.

215
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,791
It doesn't look
like him.

216
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:57,082
Should've been carved
by someone who knew his face.

217
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,083
Everyone who knew
his face is dead.

218
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:03,584
We're not.

219
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,332
They say
you killed Joffrey.

220
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,624
Did you?

221
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,291
I wish I had.

222
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:18,332
Hmm.
Me, too.

223
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,959
I was angry when I heard
someone else had done it.

224
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,624
However long my list got,
he was always first.

225
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,541
Your list?

226
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,751
Of people
I'm going to kill.

227
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,374
How did you get back
to Winterfell?

228
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,207
It's a long story.

229
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,291
I imagine
yours is, too.

230
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:48,249
Yes.

231
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,374
Not a very
pleasant one.

232
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,375
Mine neither.

233
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:58,124
But our stories
aren't over yet.

234
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,001
No, they're not.

235
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,500
Arya...

236
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,208
Bran's home, too.

237
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:53,876
You came home.

238
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:09,751
I saw you
at the crossroads.

239
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:12,916
You saw me?

240
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,416
I see quite a lot now.

241
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:20,249
Bran has... visions.

242
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,416
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

243
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,666
So did I.

244
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,541
Why would you
go back there?

245
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:29,125
Cersei's on
her list of names.

246
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,541
Who else
is on your list?

247
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:44,292
Most of them
are dead already.

248
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,750
Where did
you get this?

249
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,167
Littlefinger
gave it to me.

250
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:02,708
Littlefinger?
He's here?

251
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,583
He has declared
for House Stark.

252
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:06,458
Why would he
give you a dagger?

253
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:08,958
- He thought I'd want it.
- Why?

254
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,666
Because it was
meant to kill me.

255
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:15,541
The cutthroat...
after your fall?

256
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:18,416
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

257
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,458
Someone very wealthy
wanted me dead.

258
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:22,624
He's not
a generous man.

259
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,000
He wouldn't
give you anything

260
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:25,917
unless he thought he was
getting something back.

261
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,291
- It doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

262
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:33,208
I don't want it.

263
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,542
Are you sure?

264
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,249
It's Valyrian steel.

265
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,625
It's wasted
on a cripple.

266
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,916
Catelyn Stark
would be proud.

267
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,291
You kept your vow.

268
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,708
I did
next to nothing.

269
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,624
You're too hard
on yourself, my lady.

270
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,208
I'm not a...

271
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,001
Thank you, Podrick.

272
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,249
Your Grace, there's still
no word from the Unsullied.

273
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,916
Soon.

274
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,751
He will
come back to you.

275
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,959
He'd better.

276
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,916
What happened?

277
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,250
Many things.

278
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:13,792
Many things?

279
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,375
Your Grace.

280
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,708
I wanted you
to see it

281
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:49,459
before we start
hacking it to bits.

282
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:29,375
Well, this is it.
All we'll ever need.

283
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:38,876
There is something else I
want to show you, Your Grace.

284
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:06,082
The children of the
forest made these.

285
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,917
When?

286
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,709
A very long time ago.

287
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:21,332
They were right here,

288
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,750
standing where
we're standing.

289
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:28,916
Before there were Targaryens
or Starks or Lannisters.

290
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:31,001
Maybe even before
there were men.

291
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,333
No.

292
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:48,583
They were here together,
the children and the First Men.

293
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:50,792
Doing what?
Fighting each other?

294
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:06,374
They fought together
against their common enemy.

295
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:10,250
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

296
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,417
Together.

297
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,333
We need to do the same
if we're going to survive.

298
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:24,167
Because the enemy
is real.

299
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,417
It's always been real.

300
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,708
And you say
you can't defeat them

301
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:43,624
without my armies
and my dragons?

302
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,250
No, I don't think I can.

303
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,750
I will fight for you.

304
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:58,625
I will fight
for the North.

305
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,876
When you
bend the knee.

306
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,042
My people...

307
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,750
won't accept
a southern ruler.

308
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:18,292
Not after everything
they've suffered.

309
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:24,333
They will
if their king does.

310
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:29,000
They chose you
to lead them.

311
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:31,167
They chose you
to protect them.

312
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:36,001
Isn't their survival more
important than your pride?

313
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,458
What is it?

314
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:01,207
We took
Casterly Rock.

315
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,208
That's very good
to hear.

316
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:08,876
Isn't it?

317
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:19,207
You'll want to discuss
this amongst yourselves.

318
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,876
- Perhaps...
- You will stay.

319
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,958
All my allies are gone.

320
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,374
They've been taken from me while I've
been sitting here on this island.

321
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,916
- You still have the largest armies.
- Who won't be able to eat

322
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:31,000
because Cersei has taken
all the food from the Reach.

323
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:33,000
Call Grey Worm
and the Unsullied back.

324
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:35,791
We still have enough ships to carry
the Dothraki to the mainland.

325
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:38,041
Commit to the blockade
of King's Landing.

326
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:41,082
- We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
- The right plan!

327
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:45,875
Your strategy has lost us Dorne,
the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

328
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:49,291
- If I have underestimated our enemies...
- Our enemies?

329
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,541
Your family, you mean.

330
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,416
Perhaps you don't want
to hurt them after all.

331
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,332
Enough with
the clever plans.

332
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,000
I have three
large dragons.

333
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,708
I'm going to fly them
to the Red Keep.

334
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:10,041
We've discussed this.

335
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:13,291
My enemies
are in the Red Keep.

336
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:16,666
What kind of a queen am I if I'm not
willing to risk my life to fight them?

337
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,417
A smart one.

338
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,792
What do you think
I should do?

339
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,374
- I would never presume to...
- I'm at war.

340
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:30,417
I'm losing.

341
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,959
What do you think
I should do?

342
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,000
I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

343
00:27:43,001 --> 00:27:44,001
No one did.

344
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:48,124
The people
who follow you

345
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,292
know that you made
something impossible happen.

346
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,166
Maybe that
helps them believe

347
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:57,332
that you can make other
impossible things happen.

348
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,291
Build a world
that's different

349
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:01,709
from the shit one
they've always known.

350
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:08,332
But if you use them to melt
castles and burn cities,

351
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,959
you're not different.

352
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,667
You're just
more of the same.

353
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,167
Don't lunge.

354
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:45,001
Don't go where
your enemy leads you.

355
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,042
Up.

356
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:56,001
- And don't...
- Don't fight someone
like her in the first place.

357
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:06,208
Nice sword.
Very nice dagger.

358
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:17,166
If they haven't contributed the right
amount of grain to the stores,

359
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,583
then I'm afraid they'll have to
make due with what they've brought.

360
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:20,876
We can't...

361
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,750
It's been a while
since I trained.

362
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:29,374
I can go and find the master
of arms for you, my lady.

363
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,249
He didn't beat
the Hound.

364
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,291
You did.

365
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:35,792
I want to train
with you.

366
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,166
You swore to serve
both my mother's daughters,

367
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,292
didn't you?

368
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,584
Move aside, Podrick.

369
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,541
You can't use that, my lady.
It's too small.

370
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:00,751
I won't cut you.
Don't worry.

371
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,125
I'll try not to.

372
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,708
Who taught you
how to do that?

373
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:23,375
No one.

374
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,666
- What do you think of her?
- Who?

375
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:05,124
I believe you
know of whom I speak.

376
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,458
I think she has
a good heart.

377
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,249
A good heart?

378
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,916
I've noticed you staring
at her good heart.

379
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,750
There's no time
for that.

380
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:17,584
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

381
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,499
How many men do we have
in the North to fight him?

382
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,041
10,000? Less?

383
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,166
- Fewer.
- What?

384
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:28,709
Speaking of good hearts...
Missandei of Naath.

385
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:32,708
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

386
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,249
King Snow, isn't it?

387
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,624
No, that doesn't
sound right.

388
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,499
- King Jon?
- It doesn't matter.

389
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,332
Forgive me, but may
I ask a question?

390
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,291
Of course.

391
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:46,166
Your name is Jon Snow, but your
father's name was Ned Stark?

392
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,333
I'm a bastard.

393
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,291
My mother and father
weren't married.

394
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:54,249
Is the custom
different in Naath?

395
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,166
We don't have
marriage in Naath,

396
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:59,124
so the concept of a
bastard doesn't exist.

397
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:02,625
That sounds...
liberating.

398
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,833
Why did you leave
your homeland?

399
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:09,458
I was stolen away by slavers.

400
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:10,958
I'm sorry.

401
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:14,082
If I may,
how did a slave girl

402
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:16,332
come to advise
Daenerys Targaryen?

403
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:20,207
She bought me from my
master and set me free.

404
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,000
That was good of her.

405
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,958
Of course, you're serving
her now, aren't you?

406
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:30,124
I serve my queen because I
want to serve my queen.

407
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,875
Because
I believe in her.

408
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,833
And if you wanted to sail
home to Naath tomorrow?

409
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:38,167
Then she would give me a ship
and wish me good fortune.

410
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,333
You believe that?

411
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,166
I know it.

412
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:46,166
All of us who came
with her from Essos,

413
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:47,875
we believe in her.

414
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:50,541
She's not our queen
because she's the daughter

415
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:53,666
of some king
we never knew.

416
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,459
She's the queen
we chose.

417
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:00,333
Will you forgive me
if I switch sides?

418
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:07,500
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

419
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:26,375
Halt!

420
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,584
Jon.

421
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:57,083
I didn't know
you were here.

422
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,417
S-Sansa...

423
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,417
is she all right?

424
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,584
What you did for her...

425
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:16,917
is the only reason
I'm not killing you.

426
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,958
We heard your uncle
attacked your fleet.

427
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,791
We thought
you were dead.

428
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,416
I should be.

429
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:33,792
Your sister?

430
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,916
Euron has her.

431
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:40,625
I came to ask the queen
to help me get her back.

432
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:44,917
The queen is gone.

433
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:49,249
Where did she go?

434
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,834
Get the horses watered!

435
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,499
All the gold's safely through
the gates of King's Landing.

436
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,666
Good.

437
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,000
We need to get
the last of these wagons

438
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:16,082
over the Blackwater Rush
before nightfall.

439
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,791
The head of the line
is ambushed,

440
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,082
the tail will never be able
to reinforce in time.

441
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:21,708
Well, we are stretched
a bit thin.

442
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:23,166
With your permission,

443
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:26,333
flogging stragglers has a
marked effect on mobility.

444
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,791
Let's give them
fair warning first.

445
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,709
These men fought well
at Highgarden.

446
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:46,082
Now, get it on this thing.

447
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,333
Lift!

448
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,332
- Ser Jaime.
- Rickon.

449
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,751
Dickon.

450
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:00,833
I hear you fought bravely
at Highgarden.

451
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,042
Your first battle?

452
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:06,249
And?

453
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,499
It was glorious.

454
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,042
Come on,
your father's
not here.

455
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:14,458
All my life, we've been
pledged to House Tyrell.

456
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:17,708
I knew some of those men.
I hunted with them.

457
00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:20,458
They didn't
deserve to die.

458
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:22,624
But Lady Olenna
chose to betray her queen

459
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,750
and support
the Targaryen girl.

460
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:27,708
So here we are.

461
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:29,875
I didn't expect it
to smell like that.

462
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,958
Men shit themselves
when they die.

463
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:34,042
Didn't they teach you that
at fancy lad school?

464
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:38,083
Well, I learned it
when I was five.

465
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,291
What?

466
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:49,249
Listen.

467
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,708
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

468
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,249
- What is it?
- Get in line!

469
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,250
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

470
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:13,750
Get in line now!

471
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:15,958
Form up!
Come on, lads!

472
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,541
Guard those wagons!

473
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:20,001
Form a line!
Form a line!

474
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,125
Round those spears!

475
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,125
Shield wall!

476
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:37,124
Fill the gaps!

477
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:40,458
- Archers, steady!
- Hold together!

478
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:42,499
- Archers!
- Look alive!

479
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,291
Get tight!

480
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:46,124
Get in line, boys!

481
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,541
- Ready!
- Here they come!

482
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:15,875
Courage, lads!
Courage!

483
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:18,791
Wait! Wait for it!

484
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,958
Spears out!

485
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:28,542
- Spears out!
- Steady! Hold the line!

486
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,833
- Get back to King's Landing.
- I'm not abandoning my army.

487
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,166
You're the commander,
not a damn infantryman.

488
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:45,208
Those fuckers are
about to swamp us.

489
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,374
We can hold them off.

490
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,875
Dracarys!

491
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,041
Hold the line!

492
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:49,417
Hold!

493
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:52,959
- Hold it, lads!
- Hold the line!

494
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:59,292
Throw it!

495
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,584
Hold!

496
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,458
Draw!

497
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:28,459
Loose!

498
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,583
- Archers!
- Archers!

499
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:07,332
Archers, with me!

500
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:10,292
- Archers, to the line!
- To the line!

501
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,666
- Nock!
- Nock!

502
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:20,167
Draw!

503
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,876
- Loose!
- Loose!

504
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:39,208
Run!

505
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:52,332
Qyburn's scorpion
is over there.

506
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,374
Go get it, then.

507
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:54,876
I can't shoot
with one hand.

508
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,876
Come on!

509
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:14,292
Need help!

510
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,001
Where are you?

511
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,083
Take cover!

512
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,875
Come on, you fucker.

513
00:47:27,876 --> 00:47:29,042
Dracarys.

514
00:48:42,459 --> 00:48:43,459
Flee, you idiot.

515
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:47,083
Come on, boy. Come on!

516
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:58,959
You idiot.
You fucking idiot.

I'm not here to murder.

519
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,208
Bend the knee and join me.

520
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:58,208
Or refuse... and die.

521
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:03,167
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

522
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:06,048
Whatever stands in our way...

523
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,375
we will defeat.

524
00:51:09,709 --> 00:51:12,499
Bran saw the Night King
and his army marching

525
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,709
towards Eastwatch.

526
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,667
Bad things are coming.
