1
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:11,211
I wish you all the happiness
in the world.

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,837
Myrcella?

3
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:19,004
Myrcella?

4
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:33,211
KILL US !

5
00:00:42,128 --> 00:00:44,169
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

6
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,879
Please try not to scream.

7
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:51,378
This is Brandon Stark.

8
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:53,378
Son of Ned Stark.

9
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,211
Let's get them inside.

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,878
For decades,
House Lannister

11
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,587
has been
the true power in Westeros,

12
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,627
and the feat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

13
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:05,044
Grey Worm and the Unsullied
will sail for the Rock,

14
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:06,086
and take it.

15
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:07,587
Summon Jon Snow.

16
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,378
He would make
a valuable ally.

17
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:12,085
Let him stand before you
and tell you the things

18
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:13,128
that have happened to him.

19
00:01:13,545 --> 00:01:16,378
Dragonstone sits
on a mountain of dragonglass.

20
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:20,211
We can never hope to defeat
the army of the dead alone.

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,420
We need allies.

22
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:25,252
You're abandoning your people!
You're abandoning your home.

23
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:27,920
Until I return,
the North is yours.

24
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:59,025

25
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:04,253
The bastard
of Winterfell.

26
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,670
The dwarf
of Casterly Rock.

27
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,044
I believe we last saw
each other atop the Wall.

28
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:18,961
You were pissing off the edge
if I remember right.

29
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:21,419
Picked up some scars
along the road.

30
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,920
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

31
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,419
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

32
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,252
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

33
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:36,335
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

34
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:38,919
Unluckily for me.

35
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,962
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

36
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,335
Welcome to Dragonstone.

37
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:47,169
Our queen knows
it is a long journey.

38
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,544
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

39
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:53,295
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

40
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,295
Of course.

41
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,462
Please, this way.

42
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,794
Where are you from?

43
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:35,085
I can't place
the accent.

44
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,919
I was born on
the Island of Naath.

45
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,003
Ah. I hear it's
beautiful down there.

46
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:42,085
Palm trees
and butterflies.

47
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:43,503
Haven't been, myself.

48
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,462
This place has changed.

49
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:58,961
And Sansa?
I hear she's alive and well.

50
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,462
- She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

51
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:07,044
A sham marriage.
And unconsummated.

52
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:10,210
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

53
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:12,127
Anyway...

54
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:14,961
she's much smarter
than she lets on.

55
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,335
She's starting
to let on.

56
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,253
Good.

57
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:20,294
At some point,

58
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:24,252
I want to hear how a Night's Watch
recruit became King in the North.

59
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:26,044
As long as you tell me
how a Lannister

60
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:28,836
became Hand
to Daenerys Targaryen.

61
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,961
A long
and bloody tale.

62
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:33,712
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

63
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:38,878
My bannermen think
I'm a fool for coming here.

64
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,294
Of course they do.

65
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:43,004
If I was your Hand, I would
have advised against it.

66
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:47,544
General rule of thumb...

67
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:50,669
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

68
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,419
True...

69
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,544
but I'm not a Stark.

70
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,045
I'd say you get
used to them...

71
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:14,253
but you never
really do.

72
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:21,045
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

73
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,003
I wondered why you weren't
there to meet our guests.

74
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:40,003
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

75
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:42,461
Don't you want
to see him again?

76
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,085
I've done my part.

77
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:47,502
I've brought
ice and fire together.

78
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:49,794
Strange.

79
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,294
You spoke so highly
of Jon Snow,

80
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:55,961
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

81
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:58,335
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

82
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:02,544
My time whispering in the ears
of kings has come to an end.

83
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:04,961
Oh, I doubt that.

84
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:07,586
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

85
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,419
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

86
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,669
Nothing is ever
so sweet again.

87
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,920
Neither of us
is common folk anymore.

88
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:20,836
I did not part
on good terms

89
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:23,836
with the King in the North
or his advisor.

90
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,837
Why?

91
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:28,545
Because of
mistakes I made.

92
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,545
Terrible mistakes.

93
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:37,502
I would only be
a distraction if I stayed.

94
00:08:37,503 --> 00:08:39,711
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

95
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:41,711
Good.

96
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:43,961
If you don't mind
my saying,

97
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:47,711
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

98
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:50,170
I'm not sure
you'd be safe here.

99
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:55,294
Oh, I will return,
dear Spider.

100
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,085
- One last time.
- My lady...

101
00:08:57,086 --> 00:09:00,669
I have to die
in this strange country.

102
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,503
Just like you.

103
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:46,377
You stand in the presence

104
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,169
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

105
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,377
rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

106
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:54,335
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

107
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:56,753
Protector
of the Seven Kingdoms,

108
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,461
the Mother of Dragons,

109
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:00,669
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

110
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,462
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

111
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:11,253
This is Jon Snow.

112
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:17,045
He's King
in the North.

113
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,919
Thank you for traveling
so far, my lord.

114
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,169
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

115
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,753
The winds were kind,
Your Grace.

116
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:29,753
Apologies, I have a Flea
Bottom accent, I know,

117
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,627
but Jon Snow is King in
the North, Your Grace.

118
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:34,461
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me...

119
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:36,711
Your Grace, this is
Ser Davos Seaworth.

120
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:38,627
Forgive me,
Ser Davos.

121
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:41,252
I never did receive
a formal education,

122
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:42,586
but I could have
sworn I read

123
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:45,878
the last King in the
North was Torrhen Stark,

124
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,044
who bent the knee to my ancestor,
Aegon Targaryen.

125
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:52,252
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

126
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:57,294
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
House Targaryen in perpetuity.

127
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:58,794
Or do I have
my facts wrong?

128
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:01,127
I wasn't there,
Your Grace.

129
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,544
No, of course not.

130
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:06,127
But still,
an oath is an oath.

131
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:08,544
And perpetuity means...

132
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:11,003
what does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

133
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,502
Forever.

134
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:14,586
Forever.

135
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:17,419
So I assume, my lord...

136
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,628
...you're here
to bend the knee.

137
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,712
I am not.

138
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:26,836
Oh.

139
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:28,670
Well, that is
unfortunate.

140
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,669
You've traveled
all this way

141
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,836
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

142
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:36,335
Break faith?

143
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:38,669
Your father burned
my grandfather alive.

144
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,377
He burned
my uncle alive.

145
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:41,711
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms...

146
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:44,795
My father...
was an evil man.

147
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:48,837
On behalf
of House Targaryen...

148
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,711
I ask your forgiveness

149
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,669
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

150
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,544
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

151
00:11:57,545 --> 00:11:59,920
by the sins
of her father.

152
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:04,878
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

153
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,753
and those were
the best centuries

154
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:08,878
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

155
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,377
Centuries of peace
and prosperity

156
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:14,210
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

157
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:18,210
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

158
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:21,961
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

159
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:24,377
Honor the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

160
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:28,044
Bend the knee and I will name
you Warden of the North.

161
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,252
Together, we will
save this country

162
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:32,879
from those
who would destroy it.

163
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,753
You're right.

164
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:47,252
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

165
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:52,085
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

166
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:54,085
Then why are you here?

167
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:56,920
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

168
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:02,085
Did you see
three dragons

169
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:04,044
flying overhead
when you arrived?

170
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:05,127
I did.

171
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:07,419
And did you see
the Dothraki,

172
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,627
all of whom have sworn
to kill for me?

173
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:11,586
They're hard to miss.

174
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:15,627
- But still, I need your help?
- Not to defeat Cersei.

175
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,961
You could storm King's Landing
tomorrow and the city would fall.

176
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:21,210
Hell, we almost took it and
we didn't even have dragons.

177
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:25,335
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

178
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:26,961
Why not?

179
00:13:26,962 --> 00:13:28,669
The only reason
I can see

180
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,919
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

181
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,961
It's the fastest way
to win the war,

182
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:34,794
but you won't do it,

183
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:38,003
which means,
at the very least,

184
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,462
you're better
than Cersei.

185
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:44,336
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

186
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:50,836
Because right now, you and I
and Cersei and everyone else,

187
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:52,461
we're children
playing at a game,

188
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,544
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

189
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:56,669
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

190
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,169
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

191
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,044
he's refused to bow, and now
he's calling me a child.

192
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:06,836
I believe he's calling all of us children.
Figure of speech.

193
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:10,169
Your Grace, everyone you know
will die before winter's over

194
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,335
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

195
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:15,003
As far as I can see, you are
the enemy to the north.

196
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:16,670
I am not your enemy.

197
00:14:18,086 --> 00:14:20,003
The dead
are the enemy.

198
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:21,545
The dead?

199
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:24,419
Is that another
figure of speech?

200
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,044
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

201
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,127
The Army of the Dead?

202
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,294
You don't
know me well,
my lord,

203
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:33,627
but do you think
I'm a liar or a madman?

204
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:36,169
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

205
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,294
The Army of the Dead
is real.

206
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,753
The white walkers
are real.

207
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,669
The Night King is real.
I've seen them.

208
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,210
If they get
past the Wall

209
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:46,712
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

210
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,336
we're finished.

211
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,211
I was born
at Dragonstone.

212
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:03,544
Not that I can
remember it.

213
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:07,003
We fled before Robert's
assassins could find us.

214
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:10,210
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

215
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:14,044
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

216
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,587
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

217
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,962
Not that it matters now,
of course.

218
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,044
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

219
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,419
So many men
have tried to kill me,

220
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,919
I don't remember
all their names.

221
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,003
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

222
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:38,544
I've been chained
and betrayed,

223
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:41,335
raped and defiled.

224
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:43,586
Do you know
what kept me standing

225
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:46,544
through all those years
in exile?

226
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,502
Faith.

227
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,753
Not in any gods,

228
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:55,294
not in myths
and legends.

229
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:57,919
In myself.

230
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,085
In Daenerys Targaryen.

231
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,627
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

232
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:07,003
until my children
were born.

233
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:11,794
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

234
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:14,169
They did for me.

235
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,627
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

236
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:20,754
and I will.

237
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:25,627
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

238
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,962
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

239
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:32,586
The war against my sister
has already begun.

240
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:34,961
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

241
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:36,794
and join you
in fighting

242
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,295
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

243
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,711
You don't believe him.

244
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:45,627
I understand that.
It sounds like nonsense.

245
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:49,419
But if destiny has brought Daenerys
Targaryen back to our shores,

246
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,627
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

247
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:55,753
You were the first to bring
Dothraki to Westeros?

248
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:59,127
He is the first to make allies
of wildlings and Northmen.

249
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:01,210
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

250
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:02,294
He was named
King in the North.

251
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:03,669
Not because
of his birthright.

252
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,044
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

253
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:11,085
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

254
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:12,795
because they
believe in him.

255
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,169
All those things
you don't believe in,

256
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,711
he faced
those things.

257
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:19,919
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

258
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,502
He risked his life
for his people.

259
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:23,294
He took a knife in the
heart for his people.

260
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:25,045
He gave his own...

261
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:33,961
If we don't put aside our
enmities and band together,

262
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:36,044
we will die.

263
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:39,711
And then it doesn't matter whose
skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

264
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:42,044
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

265
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:44,210
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

266
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:45,836
help her to defeat
my sister,

267
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:48,003
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

268
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,753
There's no time
for that.

269
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:51,669
There's no time
for any of this!

270
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,169
While we stand here,
debating...

271
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,127
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

272
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:56,961
Pledge your sword
to her cause.

273
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:58,712
And why
would I do that?

274
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:03,711
I mean no offense,
Your Grace,

275
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:04,919
but I don't know you.

276
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,753
As far as I can tell,

277
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:10,044
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

278
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:13,378
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

279
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,169
The lords of the North

280
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,003
placed their trust
in me to lead them,

281
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:24,045
and I will continue to
do so as well as I can.

282
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:26,754
That's fair.

283
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:30,127
It's also fair
to point out

284
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:34,252
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

285
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:38,003
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

286
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:39,919
you are in
open rebellion.

287
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,210
Your Grace,
please dismiss your guests.

288
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,295
I have grave news.

289
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,711
You must forgive
my manners.

290
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:01,085
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

291
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:03,837
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

292
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:14,628
Am I your prisoner?

293
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:19,920
Not yet.

294
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:39,044
Our ironborn
and Dornish allies

295
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,502
were attacked
en route to Dorne.

296
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:43,003
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

297
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:45,335
the rest,
sunk or captured.

298
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:47,919
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
dead or captured.

299
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,502
The Greyjoys,
dead or captured.

300
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,211
All of them?

301
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,335
- Pull!
- Heave!

302
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:58,711
Pull!

303
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:10,420
Your sister's dead?

304
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,961
Euron has her.

305
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,336
You saw him take her?

306
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:21,003
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

307
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:22,503
I tried.

308
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:25,879
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

309
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:32,252
Come, men!

310
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:33,587
Sails up!

311
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:44,211
Murderer!

312
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,085
Whores!

313
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:59,420
Traitor!

314
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:04,545
This is the life.

315
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:09,419
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

316
00:21:13,754 --> 00:21:15,335
I have to be honest,

317
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,295
this is making me hard.

318
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,003
Did you see
Little Theon's face

319
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:24,377
right before
he jumped overboard?

320
00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:26,919
"Oh, no!"

321
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,378
What a twat.

322
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:59,086
- Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Murderers!

323
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:35,711
My queen, please
accept this gift

324
00:22:35,712 --> 00:22:39,545
on behalf of all of your loyal
subjects in the Iron Islands.

325
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:48,711
I give you what no other
man could give...

326
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:50,836
justice.

327
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:54,503
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

328
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:08,044
You've proven yourself the greatest
captain on the fourteen seas

329
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:10,711
and a true friend
to the crown.

330
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:13,919
You deserve more
than a true friend.

331
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,419
And you deserve a proper
reward for your heroism.

332
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,086
There's only
one reward I want.

333
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:24,086
You shall have
what your heart desires...

334
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:27,670
when the war is won.

335
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:37,502
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

336
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:40,669
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

337
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,711
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

338
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,003
shall defend our country.

339
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:54,252
There's nothing quite like it,
is there?

340
00:23:54,253 --> 00:23:56,003
The love of the people.

341
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:58,127
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

342
00:23:58,128 --> 00:24:01,461
This same mob spat at
my sister not long ago.

343
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:03,210
And if you turn
on us,

344
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:06,419
they'll cheer to see your
head mounted on a spike.

345
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,919
Or yours.

346
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,044
They just like
severed heads, really.

347
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:14,294
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

348
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:15,878
I would love to hear it.

349
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:18,919
When we have an hour or two
to speak as brothers.

350
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,627
Advice?

351
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:24,294
Does she like it
gentle or rough?

352
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:25,961
A finger in the bum?

353
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:29,253
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
We'll talk later.

354
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,044
I want you to
know I understand.

355
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,627
Even though we're
enemies, you and I,

356
00:24:51,628 --> 00:24:53,295
I understand the fury
that drives you.

357
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:55,794
I was there that day

358
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,587
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

359
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:02,461
If I close my eyes,

360
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:05,461
I can hear the sound of
Oberyn's skull breaking.

361
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,669
The sound
of your scream.

362
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,169
I never heard
a sound like that.

363
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,128
I thought,
"That's true love."

364
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:15,003
Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
He really did.

365
00:25:15,004 --> 00:25:16,377
No one moved like him.

366
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:19,502
No one had such skill
with a spear.

367
00:25:19,503 --> 00:25:22,586
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

368
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,044
If only he hadn't
taunted him.

369
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:29,003
He could've walked away and
left poor Ser Gregor to die.

370
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:31,044
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

371
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:33,878
Now he's buried
somewhere.

372
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:36,627
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

373
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:38,545
That must be
difficult for you.

374
00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:44,502
When my daughter
was taken from me,

375
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:47,627
my only daughter...

376
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:50,419
well, you can't
imagine how that feels

377
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,669
unless you've
lost a child.

378
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,335
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

379
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:58,044
to give her
to the wet nurse.

380
00:25:58,045 --> 00:26:01,544
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

381
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:03,794
I never got
to have a mother,

382
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,210
but Myrcella did.

383
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:08,878
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

384
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:10,920
Why did you do that?

385
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:18,879
Doesn't matter now.

386
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,210
Your daughter's
a beauty, too.

387
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:32,836
Those brown eyes.

388
00:26:32,837 --> 00:26:34,545
Those lips.

389
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,210
Perfect Dornish beauty.

390
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:40,085
I imagine
she's your favorite.

391
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:43,252
I know, I know, we're not
supposed to have favorites,

392
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:45,420
but still,
we're only human.

393
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,502
We love whom we love.

394
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:53,377
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

395
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,753
That gag makes it impossible to
understand what you're saying.

396
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:58,587
It must be frustrating.

397
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:04,753
We all make
our choices.

398
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:07,169
You chose to murder
my daughter.

399
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,419
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

400
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,628
Do you feel powerful now?

401
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:19,586
I don't sleep very well.

402
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:21,961
Not at all, really.

403
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:23,878
I lie in bed
and I stare at the canopy

404
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:26,252
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

405
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:30,128
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the
woman who murdered my only daughter.

406
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:33,294
I thought about
having Ser Gregor

407
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:35,461
crush your skull
the way he did Oberyn's.

408
00:27:35,462 --> 00:27:40,169
It would be poetic, I
suppose, but fast, too fast.

409
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,128
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

410
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:45,962
She's so beautiful.

411
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:48,878
The thought
of this lovely face

412
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:51,294
cracking open
like a duck egg,

413
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,045
no, it's just not right.

414
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:01,627
Mama.

415
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:14,335
Qyburn here is
the cleverest man I know.

416
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:17,419
Clever enough to learn what poison
you used to murder Myrcella.

417
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,085
The Long Goodbye,
was that it?

418
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:21,170
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

419
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,003
How long does
the poison take?

420
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:29,669
Difficult to say...
hours, days.

421
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,544
It depends on the
subject's constitution.

422
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:35,045
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

423
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,294
Your daughter will die
here in this cell,

424
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:46,419
and you will be here
watching when she does.

425
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,211
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

426
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:55,044
If you refuse to eat, we'll
force food down your throat.

427
00:28:55,045 --> 00:28:58,753
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

428
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:02,044
To watch that beautiful face collapse...

429
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:04,170
...to bone and dust.

430
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:09,503
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

431
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:15,210
Make sure the guards change
the torches every few hours.

432
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,628
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

433
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:48,879
No.

434
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:32,128
Don't.

435
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,003
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

436
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:50,670
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
I'll do as I please.

437
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:57,335
Forgive me, Your Grace.

438
00:30:57,336 --> 00:30:59,669
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

439
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,669
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

440
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,004
At once, Your Grace.

441
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:17,252
No, thank you.

442
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:18,961
My condolences,
Your Grace,

443
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,919
on the death
of your son.

444
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,627
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

445
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:26,377
The Iron Bank didn't send you
here to offer condolences.

446
00:31:26,378 --> 00:31:29,878
Condolences
and congratulations.

447
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:32,836
To become the first ruling
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

448
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:34,836
that's quite
an accomplishment.

449
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:38,627
The Iron Bank appreciates how you
cast off the yoke of superstition,

450
00:31:38,628 --> 00:31:40,210
freeing the crown
from elements

451
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:42,711
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

452
00:31:42,712 --> 00:31:45,878
The destruction of the Sept of
Baelor was a tragic accident.

453
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:50,085
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

454
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:52,461
to restore order
and rational leadership.

455
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:55,210
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

456
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:57,794
Your father never
minced words either.

457
00:31:57,795 --> 00:32:01,627
But, yes, your debts
are considerable.

458
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,502
And you're now engaged in a
conflict on several fronts.

459
00:32:04,503 --> 00:32:07,419
We both know how
expensive war can be.

460
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,627
And we both know
gold wins wars.

461
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,085
Your vaults are empty.

462
00:32:11,086 --> 00:32:13,586
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

463
00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:16,919
Your wealthiest allies, the
Tyrells, are now your enemies.

464
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,502
You are surrounded on all sides
by rivals for the throne.

465
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:22,461
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

466
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:24,169
We don't make bets.

467
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,753
We invest in endeavors we
deem likely to be successful.

468
00:32:27,754 --> 00:32:30,711
A fancy way
of saying "bet."

469
00:32:30,712 --> 00:32:34,461
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

470
00:32:34,462 --> 00:32:37,461
I decapitated
the Dornish snake.

471
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:39,502
My armada owns
the Narrow Sea.

472
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:41,961
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

473
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:43,461
Euron Greyjoy
is loyal to me.

474
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,669
For now.

475
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,419
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

476
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,753
How well do wooden ships fare
against fire-breathing dragons?

477
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:58,794
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

478
00:32:58,795 --> 00:33:01,169
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

479
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,085
You want to
invest in her?

480
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:07,461
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

481
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,711
How are your profits

482
00:33:09,712 --> 00:33:12,252
now that Daenerys
has freed all the slaves?

483
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:16,419
The slave trade has entered
a downturn, it's true.

484
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,294
From what I gather,
she considers herself

485
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:21,627
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

486
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:25,544
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

487
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,544
The Lannisters owe the Iron
Bank quite a lot of money,

488
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:30,711
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

489
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:35,128
Do former slaves
or Dothraki or dragons?

490
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:40,711
Your father's daughter,
indeed.

491
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:42,044
Give me a fortnight.

492
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:44,252
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

493
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:45,669
And when you
return to Braavos,

494
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:50,128
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

495
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:17,587
I came down here to brood over my
failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

496
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:21,669
You're making it
difficult.

497
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:25,336
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

498
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:29,586
You make me feel like I'm failing
at brooding over failing.

499
00:34:29,587 --> 00:34:31,294
I'm a prisoner
on this island.

500
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:35,252
I wouldn't say you're
a prisoner on this island.

501
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:36,753
You're free
to walk the castle,

502
00:34:36,754 --> 00:34:38,669
the beaches,
to go wherever you want.

503
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,836
Except to my ship.

504
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:42,252
You took my ship.

505
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:44,210
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

506
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:46,711
I'm not playing
word games with you.

507
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:48,586
The dead are coming
for us all.

508
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,252
Why don't you
figure out what to do

509
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:52,335
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

510
00:34:52,336 --> 00:34:55,210
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

511
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:57,419
It's hard for me to fathom.
It really is.

512
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,545
If someone told me about the white
walkers and the Night King...

513
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:09,211
You probably
don't believe me.

514
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,836
I do, actually.

515
00:35:13,837 --> 00:35:15,378
You didn't before.

516
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:19,294
"Grumkins and snarks,"
you called them.

517
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:21,377
Do you remember?

518
00:35:21,378 --> 00:35:23,461
You said
it was all nonsense.

519
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:26,586
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

520
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:29,711
But then Mormont
saw them

521
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,127
and you saw them.

522
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,794
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

523
00:35:32,795 --> 00:35:34,795
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

524
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:38,377
How do I convince people
who don't know me

525
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:41,127
that an enemy they don't believe
in is coming to kill them all?

526
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:44,461
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

527
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:46,627
I'm looking
for an answer.

528
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:50,919
People's minds aren't made
for problems that large.

529
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,377
White walkers,
the Night King,

530
00:35:53,378 --> 00:35:55,461
Army of the Dead...

531
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:57,085
it's almost a relief
to confront

532
00:35:57,086 --> 00:35:59,962
a comfortable, familiar
monster like my sister.

533
00:36:02,295 --> 00:36:05,253
I need to help prepare my
people for what's coming.

534
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:09,295
I can't help them
from here.

535
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:12,045
I'd like to leave.

536
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:16,003
It seems unlikely that
you became King in the North

537
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:17,670
by giving up
that easily.

538
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:22,961
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

539
00:36:22,962 --> 00:36:24,753
Don't go south.

540
00:36:24,754 --> 00:36:27,419
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

541
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,837
a foreign invader.

542
00:36:31,211 --> 00:36:33,919
And here I am,

543
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,461
a Northern fool.

544
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:37,919
Children are not
their fathers,

545
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,628
luckily
for all of us.

546
00:36:41,128 --> 00:36:43,335
And sometimes there's more
to foreign invaders

547
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:45,544
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

548
00:36:45,545 --> 00:36:49,753
Daenerys could have sailed for
Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

549
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:51,586
Instead, she stayed
where she was

550
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:54,252
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

551
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,586
some of whom are on this
island with us right now.

552
00:36:56,587 --> 00:36:58,169
While you're
our guest here,

553
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,711
you might consider
asking them

554
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:02,461
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

555
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:05,544
She protects people
from monsters,

556
00:37:05,545 --> 00:37:07,085
just as you do.

557
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:09,544
It's why she came here.

558
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:11,085
And she's not about
to head north

559
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:12,544
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

560
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:15,044
on the word of a man
she doesn't know.

561
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:17,461
After a single meeting,

562
00:37:17,462 --> 00:37:20,253
it's not a reasonable
thing to ask.

563
00:37:26,628 --> 00:37:28,879
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

564
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:34,878
What do you mean?

565
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,127
Maybe you are
a Northern fool.

566
00:37:37,128 --> 00:37:40,795
I'm asking if there's something
I can do to help you.

567
00:37:43,754 --> 00:37:45,294
- Dragonglass?
- Yes.

568
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:47,753
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

569
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:49,753
He says you have a tremendous
amount of it here.

570
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:51,544
Why are we talking
about glass?

571
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:53,419
We just lost
two of our allies.

572
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,795
Which is why I was speaking to
Jon Snow, a potential ally.

573
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,919
And what does the King in the
North want with dragonglass?

574
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,252
Apparently, it can be
turned into weapons

575
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:08,377
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

576
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:10,544
Or stop them.

577
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:11,836
Destroy them.

578
00:38:11,837 --> 00:38:13,462
Unsure about
the nomenclature.

579
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,377
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

580
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:21,252
and white walkers
and Night Kings?

581
00:38:21,253 --> 00:38:23,878
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

582
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:27,127
But a wise man once said that you
should never believe a thing

583
00:38:27,128 --> 00:38:29,670
simply because
you want to believe it.

584
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:35,544
Which wise man
said this?

585
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:37,419
I don't remember.

586
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,837
Are you trying to present your own
statements as ancient wisdom?

587
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:44,252
I would never do that.

588
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:45,295
To you.

589
00:38:47,128 --> 00:38:50,794
The reason I believe Jon
Snow is because he's here.

590
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,210
All of his advisors would
have told him not to come.

591
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:55,294
I would have told him
not to come.

592
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:57,627
And he's here anyway.

593
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:00,044
You don't
have to believe him.

594
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:02,085
Let him mine
the dragonglass.

595
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:03,711
If he's wrong,
it's worthless.

596
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:05,794
You didn't even know
it was here.

597
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:08,335
It's nothing to you.

598
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:11,627
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

599
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:14,335
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

600
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:16,919
with a possible ally.

601
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,294
Keep him occupied while we
focus on the task at hand...

602
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:21,670
Casterly Rock.

603
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,711
What was that
Ser Davos said

604
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:28,753
about taking a knife in
the heart for his people?

605
00:39:28,754 --> 00:39:30,544
Did you notice that?

606
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:33,003
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

607
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,170
It's dreary
in the North.

608
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:52,545
Amazing thing
to see.

609
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:57,086
I named them for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

610
00:39:58,211 --> 00:39:59,712
They're both gone now.

611
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:03,378
You lost
two brothers as well.

612
00:40:06,545 --> 00:40:09,420
People thought dragons were gone
forever, but here they are.

613
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,004
Perhaps we should all be
examining what we think we know.

614
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:22,252
You've been talking
to Tyrion.

615
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,003
He is my Hand.

616
00:40:25,004 --> 00:40:27,628
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

617
00:40:29,086 --> 00:40:30,587
I don't.

618
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:38,586
You know I'm not going to let
Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

619
00:40:38,587 --> 00:40:39,753
I never expected
that you would.

620
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:41,003
And I haven't
changed my mind

621
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:43,085
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

622
00:40:43,086 --> 00:40:44,920
I haven't either.

623
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:58,461
I will allow you to mine the
dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

624
00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:01,462
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

625
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,962
Thank you.

626
00:41:12,462 --> 00:41:16,128
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

627
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:22,004
You'd better
get to work, Jon Snow.

628
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,294
How much do we have?

629
00:41:48,295 --> 00:41:50,377
4,000 bushels,
my lady.

630
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:51,544
What does
that mean?

631
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:53,627
For the current
occupants of the castle,

632
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:57,294
it's enough food
for a year, perhaps more.

633
00:41:57,295 --> 00:42:00,711
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

634
00:42:00,712 --> 00:42:03,169
Uh, I'm not
entirely certain.

635
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,003
I-I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

636
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:08,502
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

637
00:42:08,503 --> 00:42:10,627
You're telling me
we don't have enough food,

638
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,837
especially not if the armies of the
North come back to defend Winterfell?

639
00:42:15,086 --> 00:42:17,335
No, my lady,
most likely not.

640
00:42:17,336 --> 00:42:19,461
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

641
00:42:19,462 --> 00:42:21,544
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

642
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:23,836
this is
the best place to be.

643
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:25,794
We need to start
building up our grain stores

644
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:28,377
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

645
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:30,669
If we don't use it by winter's end,
we'll give it back to them.

646
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,003
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

647
00:42:33,004 --> 00:42:36,711
they won't have enough time to bring
wagonloads of grain with them.

648
00:42:36,712 --> 00:42:38,127
Very wise, my lady.

649
00:42:38,128 --> 00:42:39,920
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

650
00:42:43,712 --> 00:42:46,210
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

651
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:47,586
No, my lady.

652
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:50,669
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

653
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,085
They should, indeed.

654
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:54,294
Pardon me, my lady.

655
00:42:54,295 --> 00:42:56,879
You there, why isn't there
leather on these?

656
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:00,670
Command suits you.

657
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:04,461
The Northerners
are all facing north,

658
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:06,544
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

659
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:08,085
So they should be.

660
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,753
I know Cersei
better than anyone here.

661
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,836
If you turn
your back on her...

662
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:16,753
- You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
- I only meant to say...

663
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:20,294
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

664
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:22,378
Thank you for
your wise counsel.

665
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,878
One of two things
will happen...

666
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:28,169
either the dead
will defeat the living,

667
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,127
in which case...

668
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:32,210
all our troubles
come to an end,

669
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:34,586
or life will win out.

670
00:43:34,587 --> 00:43:36,586
And what then?

671
00:43:36,587 --> 00:43:40,587
Don't fight in the
North or the South.

672
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,045
Fight every battle, everywhere,
always, in your mind.

673
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:50,836
Everyone is your enemy,

674
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,753
everyone
is your friend...

675
00:43:53,754 --> 00:43:57,878
every possible series of events
is happening all at once.

676
00:43:57,879 --> 00:44:01,461
Live that way and nothing
will surprise you.

677
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:04,044
Everything that happens
will be something

678
00:44:04,045 --> 00:44:05,962
that you've seen before.

679
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:10,962
Lady Sansa,
at the gate.

680
00:44:43,503 --> 00:44:44,670
Hello, Sansa.

681
00:45:05,545 --> 00:45:07,669
I wish Jon were here.

682
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:10,545
Yes, I need
to speak to him.

683
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,336
You're Father's
last living trueborn son.

684
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,044
You're Lord
of Winterfell now.

685
00:45:22,045 --> 00:45:25,294
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

686
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:27,127
I can never be
lord of anything.

687
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:28,378
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

688
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:32,252
I don't know
what that means.

689
00:45:32,253 --> 00:45:34,669
It's difficult
to explain.

690
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,879
Try.
Please, for me.

691
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:41,544
It means I can see
everything.

692
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:43,878
Everything that's ever
happened to everyone.

693
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:46,878
Everything that's
happening right now.

694
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:51,669
It's all pieces now,
fragments.

695
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,878
I need to learn to see better.

696
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:57,294
When the Long Night
comes again,

697
00:45:57,295 --> 00:45:58,920
I need to be ready.

698
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:04,377
How do you know
all this?

699
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:05,919
The Three-Eyed Raven
taught me.

700
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,836
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

701
00:46:07,837 --> 00:46:10,586
I told you it's
difficult to explain.

702
00:46:12,754 --> 00:46:14,252
Bran...

703
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:16,627
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

704
00:46:16,628 --> 00:46:20,628
I'm sorry it had to
happen here in our home.

705
00:46:25,837 --> 00:46:27,920
It was so beautiful
that night.

706
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,920
Snow falling,
just like now.

707
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,004
And you were
so beautiful...

708
00:46:40,962 --> 00:46:42,754
in your white
wedding dress.

709
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:48,503
I have to go
back inside, Bran.

710
00:46:49,879 --> 00:46:51,587
I'll stay
a bit longer.

711
00:47:05,295 --> 00:47:06,837
Hmm.

712
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:17,170
Hmm.

713
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:24,502
Does it hurt?

714
00:47:24,503 --> 00:47:27,211
A bit.
Less than before.

715
00:47:29,004 --> 00:47:31,627
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

716
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:35,044
Unusual.

717
00:47:35,045 --> 00:47:36,502
Unlikely.

718
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:38,502
One could almost
be forgiven

719
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:42,085
for thinking that the entire upper
layer of diseased skin was debrided

720
00:47:42,086 --> 00:47:46,461
and the underlying region treated
with some sort of unguent.

721
00:47:46,462 --> 00:47:49,753
Don't know
anything about that.

722
00:47:49,754 --> 00:47:51,836
I just started
feeling better.

723
00:47:51,837 --> 00:47:55,503
I assumed it was
the rest that did it.

724
00:47:57,462 --> 00:48:00,085
And the climate.

725
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,044
The climate.

726
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,836
You're free
to go, ser.

727
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:05,878
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

728
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:07,586
which you are
no longer.

729
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:11,086
Tarly, I'd like to speak with
you in my study this evening.

730
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:15,336
How bad is it?

731
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:18,378
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

732
00:48:23,503 --> 00:48:26,210
Where will you go?

733
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:29,920
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

734
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:34,210
I knew
it would kill me

735
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,878
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

736
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:40,127
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

737
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:43,753
The only place for me
is back with her.

738
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,169
I owe her my life.

739
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,753
Her and you.

740
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:53,294
Your father saved me
more than once.

741
00:48:53,295 --> 00:48:55,086
It's the least
I could do.

742
00:48:56,587 --> 00:48:59,961
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

743
00:48:59,962 --> 00:49:01,378
I hope they do.

744
00:49:28,503 --> 00:49:31,961
- You treated him?
- Yes.

745
00:49:31,962 --> 00:49:34,461
Who told you
to treat him?

746
00:49:34,462 --> 00:49:35,794
No one.

747
00:49:35,795 --> 00:49:39,085
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

748
00:49:39,086 --> 00:49:41,794
I seem
to remember you.

749
00:49:41,795 --> 00:49:44,628
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

750
00:49:46,295 --> 00:49:49,419
I forbade it because it is
dangerous and rarely successful,

751
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,753
especially on
someone of that age.

752
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:53,961
You could have infected
yourself and others.

753
00:49:53,962 --> 00:49:57,420
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

754
00:49:59,712 --> 00:50:01,627
But you didn't.

755
00:50:01,628 --> 00:50:04,252
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

756
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:07,669
Many maesters whose chains
are heavy with healing links

757
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,127
have attempted it
and failed.

758
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:12,210
Yet you succeeded.

759
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:13,336
How?

760
00:50:15,336 --> 00:50:18,628
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

761
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,211
That man is alive
because of you.

762
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:35,128
You should be proud.

763
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:40,711
Thank you, Archmaester.

764
00:50:40,712 --> 00:50:41,712
Come here.

765
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:49,335
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

766
00:50:49,336 --> 00:50:52,004
I need you
to make copies of them.

767
00:50:56,295 --> 00:50:58,378
You were expecting
a reward.

768
00:51:00,086 --> 00:51:03,879
Your reward is not being immediately
expelled from the Citadel.

769
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:07,044
You'd better
get started.

770
00:51:07,045 --> 00:51:08,711
And careful
of the paper mites.

771
00:51:08,712 --> 00:51:10,045
They like flesh
as well.

772
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:20,669
We need to find Euron
Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

773
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:24,169
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

774
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,711
To send our remaining
ships after him...

775
00:51:25,712 --> 00:51:28,378
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

776
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:33,753
Would you have to go
yourself?

777
00:51:33,754 --> 00:51:35,753
Euron's ships
could be anywhere

778
00:51:35,754 --> 00:51:37,753
or in more than
one place.

779
00:51:37,754 --> 00:51:40,169
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

780
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,210
for who knows
how long.

781
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:42,836
I wouldn't be alone.

782
00:51:42,837 --> 00:51:45,419
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

783
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,210
What can anyone
do to them?

784
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:49,210
They can still
do something to you.

785
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:51,003
It only takes
one arrow.

786
00:51:51,004 --> 00:51:53,545
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

787
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,003
What about
Casterly Rock?

788
00:51:58,004 --> 00:51:59,961
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

789
00:51:59,962 --> 00:52:02,544
And what will they face?

790
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:04,961
A difficult situation.

791
00:52:04,962 --> 00:52:07,085
They know we're coming.

792
00:52:07,086 --> 00:52:10,419
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

793
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,044
is to destroy
House Lannister.

794
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,795
She will be ready.

795
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:20,419
- No one has ever taken the Rock.
- Archers!

796
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,794
The Lannister Army is
still the army my father built.

797
00:52:22,795 --> 00:52:25,127
- Come on!
- Well-trained and well-provisioned.

798
00:52:25,128 --> 00:52:26,919
10,000 men at least.

799
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
They will see us coming.

800
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:34,127
They will be ready.

801
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,462
- Draw! Loose!
- Loose!

802
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,795
The gates of Casterly
Rock are impregnable.

803
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,753
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

804
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,295
We will be
at a disadvantage.

805
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,336
Many men will die.

806
00:53:01,503 --> 00:53:03,545
Just as my father
said they would.

807
00:53:05,712 --> 00:53:08,335
Interesting thing
about my father...

808
00:53:08,336 --> 00:53:10,252
he built our house up
from near ruin.

809
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:14,419
He built our army, he built
Casterly Rock as we know it,

810
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,502
but he didn't
build the sewers.

811
00:53:16,503 --> 00:53:18,586
That was beneath him,

812
00:53:18,587 --> 00:53:21,461
so he gave the job to the
lowest person he could find...

813
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:23,003
me.

814
00:53:23,004 --> 00:53:24,836
He was right,
I was low.

815
00:53:24,837 --> 00:53:26,961
The company I kept, low.

816
00:53:26,962 --> 00:53:28,502
Women, mostly.

817
00:53:28,503 --> 00:53:30,169
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

818
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,461
Father disapproved
of that sort of behavior.

819
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:34,085
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

820
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,544
I couldn't have them
in my chambers,

821
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,794
so in the process
of building the sewers,

822
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:40,545
I threw in something
for myself.

823
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,586
It was a passage
that began

824
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:46,294
in an out of the way cove
by the sea

825
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:49,711
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

826
00:53:49,712 --> 00:53:52,920
No better place for low pursuits
than beneath the ground.

827
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:58,294
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

828
00:54:00,545 --> 00:54:04,210
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

829
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:08,169
"Give me 10 good men
and I'll impregnate the bitch."

830
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:14,920
And so it begins.

831
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:24,544
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

832
00:54:24,545 --> 00:54:26,419
They will be outnumbered.

833
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,754
They will have less armor
and fewer weapons.

834
00:54:33,712 --> 00:54:37,502
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

835
00:54:37,503 --> 00:54:40,461
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

836
00:54:40,462 --> 00:54:42,461
They will be fighting
for freedom

837
00:54:42,462 --> 00:54:44,252
and the person
who gave it to them.

838
00:54:44,253 --> 00:54:46,753
They will be fighting
for you.

839
00:54:46,754 --> 00:54:49,211
And that is why
they will triumph.

840
00:55:35,962 --> 00:55:37,169
Where are they?!

841
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,795
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

842
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,920
- It's done.
- It is.

843
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:16,920
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

844
00:57:19,253 --> 00:57:20,711
Did we fight well?

845
00:57:20,712 --> 00:57:23,753
Uh, as well
as could be expected.

846
00:57:23,754 --> 00:57:25,878
It was never our forte.

847
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:27,962
Golden roses, indeed.

848
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,919
Your brother
and his new queen

849
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,836
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

850
00:57:34,837 --> 00:57:38,127
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

851
00:57:38,128 --> 00:57:39,711
Well, it is to me,

852
00:57:39,712 --> 00:57:42,044
but my fond
childhood memories

853
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:43,586
won't keep Cersei
on the throne.

854
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:45,711
So you just
let them take it?

855
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,753
For now. They won't
be able to hold it.

856
00:57:47,754 --> 00:57:50,294
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

857
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:52,294
we emptied the larders
before we left.

858
00:57:52,295 --> 00:57:54,544
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

859
00:57:54,545 --> 00:57:57,961
and march all the way
across Westeros.

860
00:57:57,962 --> 00:58:01,127
And you took your army,
your real army,

861
00:58:01,128 --> 00:58:03,003
and went
where they weren't.

862
00:58:03,004 --> 00:58:06,335
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

863
00:58:06,336 --> 00:58:08,377
There are always
lessons in failures.

864
00:58:08,378 --> 00:58:11,962
Yes. You must be
very wise by now.

865
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:16,127
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

866
00:58:16,128 --> 00:58:17,878
If he was so clever,

867
00:58:17,879 --> 00:58:19,627
why didn't he take
Highgarden

868
00:58:19,628 --> 00:58:23,335
the moment your
gold mines ran dry?

869
00:58:24,879 --> 00:58:28,794
I suppose I'll be able to
ask him myself soon enough.

870
00:58:28,795 --> 00:58:31,879
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

871
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:36,836
How will you do it?

872
00:58:36,837 --> 00:58:39,294
With that sword?

873
00:58:39,295 --> 00:58:41,669
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

874
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:44,003
Not that
he ever used it.

875
00:58:44,004 --> 00:58:45,670
What did he call it?

876
00:58:47,295 --> 00:58:49,627
Widow's Wail.

877
00:58:49,628 --> 00:58:51,837
He really was a cunt,
wasn't he?

878
00:58:53,462 --> 00:58:58,836
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

879
00:58:58,837 --> 00:59:02,878
Or watched them
being done on my orders.

880
00:59:02,879 --> 00:59:06,044
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

881
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:08,085
They were necessary.

882
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,127
And whatever
I imagined necessary

883
00:59:10,128 --> 00:59:14,044
for the safety
of House Tyrell, I did.

884
00:59:14,045 --> 00:59:18,670
But your sister
has done things...

885
00:59:20,336 --> 00:59:22,669
I was incapable
of imagining.

886
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:25,502
That was
my prize mistake...

887
00:59:25,503 --> 00:59:28,045
a failure
of imagination.

888
00:59:29,378 --> 00:59:31,836
She's a monster,
you do know that?

889
00:59:31,837 --> 00:59:34,003
To you, I'm sure.

890
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,878
To others as well.

891
00:59:35,879 --> 00:59:39,377
But after we've won and there's
no one left to oppose us,

892
00:59:39,378 --> 00:59:43,711
when people are living peacefully
in the world she built,

893
00:59:43,712 --> 00:59:47,420
do you really think they'll wring their
hands over the way she built it?

894
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:52,044
You love her.

895
00:59:52,045 --> 00:59:53,836
You really do
love her.

896
00:59:53,837 --> 00:59:56,294
You poor fool.

897
00:59:56,295 --> 00:59:58,044
She'll be
the end of you.

898
00:59:58,045 --> 01:00:00,586
Possibly.

899
01:00:00,587 --> 01:00:02,377
Not much
to be gained

900
01:00:02,378 --> 01:00:04,419
from discussing it with
you, though, is there?

901
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:07,127
What better person
to discuss it with?

902
01:00:07,128 --> 01:00:09,044
What better guarantee
could you have

903
01:00:09,045 --> 01:00:13,085
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

904
01:00:13,086 --> 01:00:16,127
But perhaps
you're right.

905
01:00:16,128 --> 01:00:17,711
If she's driven you
this far,

906
01:00:17,712 --> 01:00:20,128
it's gone beyond
your control.

907
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,604
Yes.
It has.

908
01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:28,003
She's a disease.

909
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:30,961
I regret my role
in spreading it.

910
01:00:30,962 --> 01:00:32,544
You will, too.

911
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,295
I think
we're done here.

912
01:00:37,712 --> 01:00:38,754
How will it happen?

913
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:42,210
Cersei had
several ideas.

914
01:00:42,211 --> 01:00:43,627
Whipping you
through the streets

915
01:00:43,628 --> 01:00:46,294
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

916
01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:50,128
Flaying you alive and hanging you
from the walls of King's Landing.

917
01:00:53,295 --> 01:00:55,086
I talked her
out of those.

918
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,753
Will there be pain?

919
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:16,335
No. I made sure
of that.

920
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:17,670
That's good.

921
01:01:20,115 --> 01:01:28,432

922
01:01:30,462 --> 01:01:32,462
I'd hate to die
like your son.

923
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,127
Clawing at my neck,

924
01:01:35,128 --> 01:01:38,003
foam and bile spilling
from my mouth,

925
01:01:38,004 --> 01:01:41,836
eyes bloodred,
skin purple.

926
01:01:41,837 --> 01:01:44,210
Must have been
horrible for you,

927
01:01:44,211 --> 01:01:47,669
as a Kingsguard,
as a father.

928
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,252
It was horrible
enough for me.

929
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:52,919
A shocking scene.

930
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,712
Not at all
what I intended.

931
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:02,253
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

932
01:02:07,211 --> 01:02:09,377
Tell Cersei.

933
01:02:09,378 --> 01:02:11,837
I want her to know
it was me.

934
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:57,669
My only venture at this moment

935
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:00,294
is reestablishing control
over this continent

936
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:01,837
and every person on it.

937
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:05,502
All my allies are gone.

938
01:04:05,503 --> 01:04:06,503
I'm losing.

939
01:04:07,086 --> 01:04:10,211
You can count on the Iron Bank.
As soon as the gold arrives.

940
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,795
Enough with the clever plans.
