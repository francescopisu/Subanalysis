1
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:07,040
The Lannisters have
declared war on house Tyrell.

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,291
They have declared war
on Dorne.

3
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,791
We must be allies now,
if we wish to survive.

4
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:14,875
I offer vengeance...
justice...

5
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:16,708
Fire and blood.

6
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,582
I traveled south

7
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,332
under orders
from the Lord Commander.

8
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,666
You ought to be a Maester.

9
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,081
Spending your life reading
about the achievements

10
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:27,207
of better men.

11
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,081
It's a map of Dragonstone.

12
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:30,207
That's dragonglass.

13
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,898
A mountain of it,
beneath the ground.

14
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,207
John needs to know.

15
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:34,958
You must send me away.

16
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:37,123
I command you to heal yourself.

17
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:39,416
I command you to find the cure.

18
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,416
So why's a nice girl on her own
heading to King's Landing?

19
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,249
I'm going to kill the queen.

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,540
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

21
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,207
the new king
of the Iron Islands.

22
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:02,082
The Iron Fleet is the greatest
armada Westeros has ever seen.

23
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,290
The surest way to
a woman's heart is with a gift.

24
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,374
I won't return to King's Landing
until I have that for you.

25
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,416
Shall we begin?

26
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:36,002

27
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:43,040
On a night like this,
you came into the world.

28
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,331
I remember that storm.

29
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:47,081
All the dogs
in King's Landing

30
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:49,081
howled through
the night.

31
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:50,707
I wish I could
remember it.

32
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,623
I always thought
this would be a homecoming.

33
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,415
Doesn't feel
like home.

34
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,749
We won't stay
on Dragonstone for long.

35
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,041
Good.

36
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,290
Not so many lions.

37
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,206
Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

38
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:07,498
The lords of Westeros
despise her.

39
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:10,373
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

40
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:13,874
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

41
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,498
They drink secret toasts
to my health?

42
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,457
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

43
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,499
and he was stupid enough
to believe them.

44
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:29,331
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

45
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:31,331
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

46
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:33,915
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

47
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,332
But you're not here
to be queen of the ashes.

48
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,081
No.

49
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:41,331
We can take
the Seven Kingdoms

50
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,206
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

51
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:46,790
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

52
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,874
the game is won.

53
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,331
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

54
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,498
we have powerful allies
in the south.

55
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:57,081
I never properly
thanked you for that.

56
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,832
They joined our side,
my queen,

57
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,373
because
they believe in you.

58
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:04,708
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

59
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,331
I did.

60
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:08,665
And then you served
the man who overthrew him.

61
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,415
I had a choice,
Your Grace...

62
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,540
serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's axe.

63
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,874
But you didn't
serve him long.

64
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,332
You turned
against him.

65
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,498
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

66
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:23,582
There have been
few rulers in history

67
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,665
as cruel
as the Mad King.

68
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,123
Robert was
neither mad nor cruel.

69
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:30,665
He simply had no interest
in being king.

70
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,373
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

71
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,582
Your Grace,

72
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,582
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

73
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,623
Lord Varys told me about
a queen in the east who...

74
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:43,541
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

75
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,248
All your spies,
your little birds,

76
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:51,916
did they tell you Viserys
was cruel, stupid, and weak?

77
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:58,540
Would those qualities have made for a
good king in your learned opinion?

78
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,206
Until your marriage
to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

79
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:03,707
I knew nothing about you,
save your existence

80
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,040
and that you were said
to be beautiful.

81
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,749
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

82
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,749
Which you turned
to your advantage.

83
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,791
Who gave the order
to kill me?

84
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,832
King Robert.

85
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,582
Who hired
the assassins?

86
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,749
Who sent word to Essos
to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

87
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,290
- Your Grace, I did what had to be done to...
- To keep yourself alive.

88
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,582
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

89
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,373
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

90
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:38,081
If he dislikes one monarch,
he conspires to crown the next one.

91
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,498
What kind of a servant
is that?

92
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,623
The kind
the realm needs.

93
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:45,999
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,958
As long as I have my eyes,
I'll use them.

95
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,665
I wasn't born
into a great house.

96
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,248
I came from nothing.

97
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,206
I was sold as a slave
and carved up as an offering.

98
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:02,040
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

99
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,623
You wish to know
where my true loyalties lie?

100
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,832
Not with any king or queen,
but with the people.

101
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:11,790
The people who suffer under despots
and prosper under just rule.

102
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,166
The people whose hearts
you aim to win.

103
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,874
If you demand
blind allegiance,

104
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,623
I respect your wishes.

105
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:26,623
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

106
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:29,206
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

107
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:32,498
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

108
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,999
because I choose you.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,541
Because I know the people have
no better chance than you.

110
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,000
Swear this to me,
Varys.

111
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:53,957
If you ever think
I'm failing the people,

112
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,165
you won't conspire
behind my back.

113
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,123
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

114
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,958
and you'll tell me
how I'm failing them.

115
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,958
I swear it,
my queen.

116
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,206
And I swear this...
if you ever betray me,

117
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,916
I'll burn you alive.

118
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,666
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

119
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,707
Forgive me, my queen.

120
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,875
A red priestess from As'shai
has come to see you.

121
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,957
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

122
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,874
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

123
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,540
No, it didn't.

124
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,373
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

125
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:24,248
We've just decided
to pardon those

126
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:26,916
who once served
the wrong king.

127
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,248
The Lord of Light doesn't have many
followers in Westeros, does he?

128
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:37,915
Not yet, but even those
who don't worship the Lord

129
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,415
can serve his cause.

130
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,332
What does your lord
expect from me?

131
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:49,666
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

132
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:52,957
I'm afraid
I'm not a prince.

133
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,540
Your Grace,
forgive me,

134
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,498
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

135
00:09:57,499 --> 00:10:00,248
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian,

136
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:03,206
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

137
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:07,582
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

138
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,749
Doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

139
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,291
No, but I like it
better.

140
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,832
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

141
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,623
Prophecies are
dangerous things.

142
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:20,957
I believe you have
a role to play.

143
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,832
As does another...

144
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,332
the King in the North,
Jon Snow.

145
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:28,040
Jon Snow?

146
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,832
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

147
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,999
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,123
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

149
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:40,832
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

150
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,749
As Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

151
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,999
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,081
to protect them
from grave danger.

153
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,665
As King in the North,

154
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,498
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

155
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:54,999
so together they may
face their common enemy.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,123
He sounds like
quite a man.

157
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,498
Summon Jon Snow.

158
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:01,165
Let him stand
before you

159
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,790
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

160
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,416
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

161
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,582
I can't speak
to prophecies

162
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,206
or visions
in the flames,

163
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:14,999
but I like Jon Snow
and I trusted him.

164
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,498
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

165
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:19,957
If he does
rule the North,

166
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,708
he would make
a valuable ally.

167
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,957
The Lannisters
executed his father

168
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,123
and conspired
to murder his brother.

169
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:30,332
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

170
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,498
Very well.

171
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:38,290
Send a raven north.

172
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,290
Tell Jon Snow
that his queen

173
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,290
invites him to come
to Dragonstone...

174
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,041
and bend the knee.

175
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,582
Gather round.
Come here.

176
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,081
You think
it's really Tyrion?

177
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:03,582
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

178
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,123
Read the last bit.

179
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:09,749
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

180
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,498
What does that mean?

181
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,416
It's something he said to me
the first night we met.

182
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,583
You know him better
than any of us.

183
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,750
What do you think?

184
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:25,832
Tyrion's not like
the other Lannisters.

185
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,623
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

186
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,623
"The Seven Kingdoms
will bleed

187
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:34,123
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

188
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,290
Join us.

189
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,124
Together, we can
end her tyranny."

190
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,290
Sounds like a charmer.

191
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,498
Of course, the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

192
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,457
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

193
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,000
a bit less charming.

194
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:53,165
What?

195
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,415
Fire kills wights,
you told me.

196
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,583
What breathes fire?

197
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,790
You're not suggesting
Jon meet with her?

198
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,206
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

199
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:07,165
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

200
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,666
do we have enough men
to fight them?

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,373
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

202
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:18,291
she'll destroy the realm
as we know it.

203
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:22,540
Some of you are bannermen
of House Tyrell.

204
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,665
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

205
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,874
With their help,
the Mad King's daughter

206
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,373
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

207
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:36,165
mindless Unsullied soldiers who will
destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

208
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:40,331
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

209
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:42,540
rape and enslave
your women,

210
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,457
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

211
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:50,331
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

212
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:53,165
You all remember the Mad King.

213
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,707
You remember the horrors
he inflicted upon his people.

214
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,707
His daughter
is no different.

215
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,498
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

216
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:05,790
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

217
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,457
And when she
grew bored of that,

218
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,707
she fed them
to her dragons.

219
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,290
It is my solemn duty to protect
the people, and I will.

220
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,457
But I need your help,
my lords.

221
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,249
We must stand together,
all of us...

222
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,457
if we hope to stop her.

223
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,875
She has three full-grown dragons,
Your Grace.

224
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,040
The same as Aegon
when he conquered

225
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,540
the Seven Kingdoms.

226
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,916
How do you propose
to stop them?

227
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,708
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

228
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,583
Lord Tarly.

229
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,331
Ser Jaime.

230
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,040
I believe
you know my son.

231
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,041
Ser Jaime.

232
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:03,540
Rickard, isn't it?

233
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,248
Dickon.

234
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:06,790
That's it.

235
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,790
Thank you for coming.

236
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,707
The other lords of the Reach look to
you for guidance, now more than ever.

237
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,415
They might not have come
if you hadn't.

238
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,707
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

239
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,499
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

240
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:25,749
You ride for
Horn Hill today?

241
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,457
I have an army
to mobilize.

242
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,790
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

243
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,249
And which side
will you be fighting for?

244
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,582
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

245
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,498
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen
could do that.

246
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:42,457
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

247
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,415
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

248
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,540
I want you to swear
allegiance to Cersei

249
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,540
and I want you to help me
destroy her enemies.

250
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,373
All her enemies.

251
00:15:52,374 --> 00:15:54,416
Including
Olenna Tyrell.

252
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,665
I'm a Tarly.

253
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,166
That name
means something.

254
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,206
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

255
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,665
We don't stab
our rivals in the back

256
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,499
or cut their throats
at weddings.

257
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:15,540
I swore an oath
to House Tyrell.

258
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,875
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

259
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,665
I've known Olenna
since I was a child.

260
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,290
She was
a great woman once.

261
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,665
Now she's broken.

262
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,790
She wants revenge
so badly,

263
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,040
she brought the Dothraki
to our shores.

264
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,958
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

265
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,874
I know you don't
like my sister,

266
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,040
but you have
to make a choice.

267
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,081
Do you fight with us

268
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,207
or with foreign savages
and eunuchs?

269
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,707
When the war is won,

270
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,874
the queen will need
a new Warden of the South.

271
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,707
I can think
of no better man

272
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,541
than Randyll Tarly.

273
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,373
The infection
has spread too far.

274
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:11,332
You should have cut off your arm
the moment you were touched.

275
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,166
How long?

276
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,040
It'll be years
before it kills you.

277
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,623
Could be 10.

278
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,290
Could be 20.

279
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,041
But how long until...?

280
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,540
Your mind?

281
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,416
Six months,
maybe fewer.

282
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:45,207
Um...

283
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,915
Pardon, Archmaester.

284
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,915
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

285
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,373
She had the greyscale
as a baby and was cured.

286
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,957
- No.
- Isn't there some way...

287
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,749
Does this look
like a baby to you?

288
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,081
- No.
- Have you studied

289
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:02,123
the varying rates
of greyscale progression

290
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,750
in infants
and fully grown men?

291
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,166
No.

292
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,540
Maester Cressen discovered

293
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,124
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

294
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,291
This is quite advanced.

295
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:20,332
And beyond
our skills, ser.

296
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,749
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

297
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,290
to live out your life
with the stone men.

298
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,124
As an anointed knight,
I'll allow you one more day.

299
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,458
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

300
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,958
Come, Samwell.

301
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,708
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...?

302
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,332
Jorah.

303
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,665
Jorah Mormont.

304
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,707
Mormont?

305
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,457
There's no need.

306
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,041
I've been dead
to them for years.

307
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,374
Come, Samwell!

308
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:25,248
Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

309
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:26,750
No, I can't say
I have.

310
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,457
I haven't seen these since Robert had
them removed from the throne room.

311
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:36,415
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

312
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,582
They were his trophies.

313
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,790
He couldn't
keep them around.

314
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,707
They would have
made him look small.

315
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,249
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

316
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,416
I believe he brought
his whores on occasion.

317
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,541
Balerion the Dread.

318
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,957
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

319
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,874
His flames forged
the Iron Throne

320
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,750
and brought the Seven
Kingdoms to heel.

321
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,082
Powerful...

322
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:14,624
but not invincible.

323
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:22,415
Apparently,
one of Daenerys's dragons

324
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,082
was wounded by spears in the
fighting pits of Meereen.

325
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,915
And if they can
be wounded,

326
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,291
they can be killed.

327
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,582
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

328
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,416
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

329
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,458
If you'll kindly
pull that lever.

330
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,458
If you want the
Iron Throne, take it.

331
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,623
We have an army, a fleet,
and three dragons.

332
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:16,290
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

333
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,790
The city will fall
within a day.

334
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,707
If we turn the dragons loose, tens of
thousands will die in the firestorms.

335
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,290
It's called war.

336
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,290
You don't have the stomach for it,
scurry back into hiding.

337
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,623
I know
how you wage war.

338
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:30,373
We don't poison
little girls here.

339
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,665
Myrcella was innocent.

340
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,040
She was a Lannister.

341
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,665
There are no
innocent Lannisters.

342
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,957
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

343
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,832
That's enough.

344
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,415
Lord Tyrion
is Hand of the Queen.

345
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,833
You will treat him
with respect.

346
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,833
I am not here to be
queen of the ashes.

347
00:21:52,082 --> 00:21:54,248
That's very nice
to hear.

348
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:56,206
Of course,
I can't remember a queen

349
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:59,165
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

350
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,123
The common people
loved her.

351
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:02,874
The nobles loved her.

352
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,623
And what is left
of her now?

353
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:07,457
Ashes.

354
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,165
Commoners, nobles,

355
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,040
they're all
just children, really.

356
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,666
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

357
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,915
I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna,
for your counsel.

358
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,832
I'm grateful
to all of you.

359
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,457
But you have chosen
to follow me.

360
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,832
I will not attack
King's Landing.

361
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,665
We will not attack
King's Landing.

362
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,331
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

363
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:33,666
By asking nicely?

364
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,206
We will lay siege
to the capital,

365
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:38,915
surrounding the city
on all sides.

366
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,707
Cersei will have
the Iron Throne,

367
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,081
but no food for her army
or the people.

368
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:45,999
But we won't use
Dothraki and Unsullied.

369
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,040
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

370
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,707
by appealing
to their loyalty,

371
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,373
their love
for their country.

372
00:22:51,374 --> 00:22:53,290
If we besiege the city
with foreigners,

373
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,999
we prove her point.

374
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,623
Our army should be
Westerosi.

375
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:58,915
And I suppose we're
providing the Westerosi?

376
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,206
You are.

377
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:03,583
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

378
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:09,582
And her Iron Fleet
will ferry the Dornish army

379
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,582
back up to King's Landing.

380
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,415
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

381
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,457
alongside
the Tyrell army.

382
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,123
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

383
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:24,248
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

384
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:27,624
Forgive me for asking, but why did
you bother to bring your own?

385
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:32,123
The Unsullied will have
another objective.

386
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:35,707
For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

387
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,874
And the seat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

388
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,790
Grey Worm
and the Unsullied

389
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,666
will sail for the Rock
and take it.

390
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:04,833
Do I have
your support?

391
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:08,000
You have mine.

392
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,666
Dorne is with you,
Your Grace.

393
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,332
Thank you all.

394
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,666
Lady Olenna, may I speak
with you alone?

395
00:24:29,624 --> 00:24:34,040
I realize you're here out of hatred
for Cersei and not love for me.

396
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,957
But I swear to you,
she will pay for what she's done.

397
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,623
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

398
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:42,665
Peace?

399
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:45,331
Do you think that's what
we had under your father?

400
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:48,457
Or his father?
Or his?

401
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:51,123
Peace never lasts,
my dear.

402
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,458
Will you take a bit of
advice from an old woman?

403
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,457
He's a clever man,
your Hand.

404
00:24:57,458 --> 00:25:01,290
I've known
a great many clever men.

405
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,206
I've outlived them all.

406
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:05,123
You know why?

407
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:06,665
I ignored them.

408
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:10,165
The lords of Westeros
are sheep.

409
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,541
Are you a sheep?

410
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:14,874
No.

411
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,165
You're a dragon.

412
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,708
Be a dragon.

413
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:25,040
Mají.

414
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,166
You leave tomorrow.

415
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,415
Were you going
to say goodbye?

416
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:39,040
I will see you
when I return.

417
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,916
But you don't know
when that will be.

418
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,916
No one knows.

419
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,750
I wish you
good fortune.

420
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:52,291
Missandei.

421
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:03,248
It is hard for me
to say goodbye to you.

422
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:04,457
Why?

423
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,123
You know why.

424
00:26:06,124 --> 00:26:07,207
I don't.

425
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:13,875
Y-you are my weakness.

426
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,331
That's what I am?

427
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:18,790
Your weakness?

428
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:22,499
When Unsullied are young,
the masters learn their fears.

429
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,457
One boy is scared
of dogs,

430
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,331
one boy hates
high places,

431
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:31,165
one is frightened
of the ocean.

432
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,623
They make the boy
sleep with dogs

433
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:35,540
or climb a cliff.

434
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,832
They throw him
in the water.

435
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,123
If he learns
to swim, good.

436
00:26:40,124 --> 00:26:42,082
If he drowns, good.

437
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:46,290
Either way,
strong Unsullied.

438
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,707
But I had no fears.

439
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:52,499
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

440
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:57,166
but I was bravest,
always.

441
00:26:58,624 --> 00:27:00,582
- I believe it.
- Until...

442
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:04,374
I meet Missandei
from the Isle of Naath.

443
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,166
Now I have fear.

444
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,000
I do, too.

445
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,207
No.

446
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,416
I want to see you.

447
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:39,124
Please.

448
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,123
Might be useful.

449
00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:14,999
Ch'Vyalthan was
a dreadful writer,

450
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,832
but an excellent
researcher.

451
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:19,290
- Archmaester, I wondered if I...
- And this one.

452
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:21,165
Maester Faull was
quite the opposite...

453
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,915
a brilliant stylist who invented
half the stories he tells.

454
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,540
Um, I wanted
to ask you...

455
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,331
If you're going
to write histories, Tarly,

456
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:28,915
you have to do
the research.

457
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,790
If you want people
to read your histories,

458
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,040
you need
a bit of style.

459
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,040
I'm not writing
"A Chronicle of the Wars

460
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,874
Following the Death
of King Robert I"

461
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,166
so it can sit
on a shelf unread.

462
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:44,000
What?
You don't like the title?

463
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:46,540
What would you call it, then?

464
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:49,874
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

465
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,623
We're not poets, Tarly.

466
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:54,790
Um, Archmaester,
if I could just have a moment.

467
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,540
This is your moment.

468
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:58,000
Use it wisely.

469
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,000
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

470
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:05,373
There are
two recorded cases

471
00:31:05,374 --> 00:31:07,206
of advanced greyscale
being cured.

472
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:09,040
I found the procedure
in the study of rare diseases

473
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,373
by Archmaester Pylos.

474
00:31:10,374 --> 00:31:12,540
I'm familiar with
Archmaester Pylos

475
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,498
and his study
of rare diseases.

476
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,498
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

477
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,416
And shall I tell you
how he died?

478
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:20,916
From greyscale.

479
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,582
- Oh.
- The procedure's far too dangerous,

480
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,823
which is why
it's now forbidden.

481
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,582
Hello.

482
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,124
What are you doing?

483
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:17,665
You're Jorah Mormont,

484
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,624
the only son
of Jeor Mormont.

485
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,749
My name
is Samwell Tarly,

486
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,540
Sworn Brother
of the Night's Watch,

487
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:27,331
training to serve
as maester at Castle Black.

488
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:28,623
I knew your father.

489
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:30,124
I was with him
when he died.

490
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:38,332
You are not dying today,
Ser Jorah.

491
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:45,957
Drink this.

492
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,749
- What is it?
- Rum.

493
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,910
Drink it all, please.
I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

494
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:13,000
If you could
take off your shirt.

495
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:29,875
If you wouldn't mind,
bite down hard.

496
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:33,331
I'm sorry, but no one
knows I'm here,

497
00:33:33,332 --> 00:33:35,572
and if they hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

498
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,041
Have you ever
done this before?

499
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:49,499
No.

500
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:53,750
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

501
00:33:57,249 --> 00:33:58,708
Have a seat.

502
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,623
I'm going to have to remove the entire
upper layer of infected tissue,

503
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:07,916
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

504
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:23,749
Shh, shh!

505
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,999
Shh.

506
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,415
Again, I'm sorry,

507
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:30,916
but please try
not to scream.

508
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:32,248
They say her dragons
are bigger than Aegon's.

509
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:34,999
Horseshit. Cersei's just
trying to frighten us.

510
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,582
I hope it's true.

511
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,623
If she lays siege to King's Landing,
prices will triple.

512
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:42,999
As long as we get back
there before they start.

513
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,541
One more round.
It's a long ride.

514
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,999
Arry!

515
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,207
Hello, Hot Pie.

516
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:52,541
Sit down.

517
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,207
Who's that for?

518
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,708
Mm. This is good.

519
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,165
You think so?

520
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,915
The secret is browning the
butter before making the dough.

521
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:15,874
Most people don't do that 'cause
it takes up too much time.

522
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,498
Mm, I didn't do that.

523
00:36:17,499 --> 00:36:19,040
You've been
making pies?

524
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:21,373
One or two.

525
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:23,373
I can't believe
you're here.

526
00:36:23,374 --> 00:36:25,832
Did you meet
the big lady?

527
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,832
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

528
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,040
You know, I figured she was a
knight 'cause she had armor on.

529
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:34,874
She was looking for your sister,
but I told her about you.

530
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,374
Did she ever find you?

531
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,332
She found me.

532
00:36:44,624 --> 00:36:45,875
What happened
to you, Arry?

533
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:57,374
You got any ale?

534
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,915
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

535
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:17,415
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's queen now.

536
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:18,999
Heard she blew up
the Great Sept.

537
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,582
That must have been
something to see.

538
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,373
- Boom.
- Mm.

539
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,582
I can't believe
someone would do that.

540
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,124
Cersei would do that.

541
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:31,331
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

542
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,457
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

543
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,916
No, the Boltons
are dead.

544
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:39,290
What?

545
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,457
Jon Snow came down from Castle
Black with a wildling army

546
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,248
and won the Battle
of the Bastards.

547
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:44,666
He's King
of the North now.

548
00:37:46,374 --> 00:37:47,457
You're lying.

549
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,331
Why would I lie
about that?

550
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:50,791
He's your brother,
right?

551
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,123
Thanks for the pie.

552
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:02,040
Friends don't pay.

553
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,331
Can't believe
I thought you were a boy.

554
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:06,249
You're pretty.

555
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,458
Thanks.

556
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:15,875
Take care
of yourself, Hot Pie.

557
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,665
Try not
to get killed.

558
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:20,081
Ah, I won't.

559
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:21,331
I'm like you, Arry.

560
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm a survivor.

561
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:29,332
200 miles
to King's Landing.

562
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,000
One bottle of rum.
You think we'll make it?

563
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:08,749
Come in.

564
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,207
A raven, my king,
from the Citadel.

565
00:39:22,374 --> 00:39:24,749
This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

566
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,081
He was my brother
at the Night's Watch,

567
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:32,623
a man I trust as much
as anyone in this world.

568
00:39:32,624 --> 00:39:35,415
He's discovered proof
that Dragonstone

569
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:38,248
sits on a mountain
of dragonglass.

570
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:46,582
I received this
a few days ago

571
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,207
from Dragonstone.

572
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,206
It was sent to me
by Tyrion Lannister.

573
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:57,582
He is now Hand of the Queen
to Daenerys Targaryen.

574
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:01,623
She intends to take the Iron
Throne from Cersei Lannister.

575
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:03,540
She has a powerful army
at her back

576
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:07,415
and, if this message
is to be believed,

577
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:08,707
three dragons.

578
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,457
Lord Tyrion has
invited me to Dragonstone

579
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:15,207
to meet with Daenerys.

580
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,957
And I'm going
to accept.

581
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,291
Accept?!

582
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:25,749
We need this dragonglass,
my lords!

583
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,707
We know that dragonglass
can destroy

584
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,623
both white walkers
and their army.

585
00:40:29,624 --> 00:40:33,166
We need to mine it
and turn it into weapons.

586
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:36,540
But more importantly,
we need allies!

587
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:40,832
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

588
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,582
We can't defeat them
on our own.

589
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,415
We don't have
the numbers.

590
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:48,123
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

591
00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:51,415
I need to try and persuade
her to fight with us.

592
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,540
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

593
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:56,957
then sail
for Dragonstone.

594
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,874
Have you forgotten what
happened to our grandfather?

595
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,081
The Mad King invited him
to King's Landing

596
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:04,373
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

597
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:07,498
She is here to reclaim the Iron
Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

598
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,498
The North is one
of those seven kingdoms.

599
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,331
This isn't an invitation;
it's a trap.

600
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:15,623
It could be, but I don't
believe Tyrion would do that.

601
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:17,999
You know him.
He's a good man.

602
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,832
Your Grace, with respect,
I must agree with Lady Sansa.

603
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,915
I remember the Mad King
all too well.

604
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:27,665
A Targaryen
cannot be trusted.

605
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:29,874
- Nor can a Lannister.
- Yeah!

606
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:33,331
Aye. We called
your brother king.

607
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:37,248
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

608
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:41,040
Winter is here,
Your Grace.

609
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,915
We need the King in the
North in the North.

610
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:47,249
Aye!

611
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,000
You all crowned me
your king.

612
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:02,206
I never wanted it.

613
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:04,665
I never asked for it.

614
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:08,957
But I accepted it because
the North is my home.

615
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:13,248
It's part of me, and I will
never stop fighting for it,

616
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:14,666
no matter the odds.

617
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:19,332
But the odds
are against us.

618
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,540
None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.
None of you.

619
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:29,582
We can never hope
to defeat them alone.

620
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:32,583
We need allies,
powerful allies.

621
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:37,416
I know it's a risk.

622
00:42:39,207 --> 00:42:40,623
But I have
to take it.

623
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,373
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

624
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:44,915
Daenerys is a queen.

625
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:47,248
Only a king can
convince her to help us.

626
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:49,040
It has to be me.

627
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,999
You're abandoning
your people!

628
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,790
You're abandoning
your home.

629
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,707
I'm leaving both
in good hands.

630
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,124
- Whose?
- Yours.

631
00:42:58,166 --> 00:42:59,623
You are my sister.

632
00:42:59,624 --> 00:43:01,707
You're the only Stark
in Winterfell.

633
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:05,624
Until I return,
the North is yours.

634
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:30,750
I delivered his bones myself.

635
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:33,915
Presented them
to Lady Catelyn

636
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:36,416
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

637
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,249
Seems like
a lifetime ago.

638
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,583
Do give Lord Tyrion my best
when you see him.

639
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,957
I was sorry
when he died.

640
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:52,666
Your father and I had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

641
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,875
So did I.

642
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,332
She wasn't fond
of you, was she?

643
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:06,291
Well, it appears she vastly
underestimated you.

644
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:09,749
Your father
and brothers are gone,

645
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,791
yet here you stand,
King in the North.

646
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:15,499
Last best hope
against the coming storm.

647
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,666
You don't belong
down here.

648
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,458
Forgive me.

649
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:30,707
We haven't ever
talked... properly.

650
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,207
I wanted
to remedy that.

651
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:35,374
I have nothing
to say to you.

652
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:39,457
Not even
"thank you"?

653
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:43,707
If it weren't for me, you'd have been
slaughtered on that battlefield.

654
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:47,082
You have many enemies, my king, but I
swear to you, I'm not one of them.

655
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:51,749
I love Sansa,

656
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,415
as I loved her mother.

657
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:07,249
Touch my sister,
and I'll kill you myself.

658
00:45:33,124 --> 00:45:34,875
- Ready?
- Ready?

659
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:39,916
Ready!

660
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:44,541
Come on.

661
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:50,291
- Yah!
- Come on!

662
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,206
Nymeria?

663
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:58,916
Nymeria,
it's me, Arya.

664
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,249
I'm heading north, girl.

665
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,291
Back to Winterfell.
I'm finally going home.

666
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,082
Come with me.

667
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,708
Come with me.

668
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,458
That's not you.

669
00:49:13,332 --> 00:49:16,290
You can't have them all.
It's not fair.

670
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:17,707
I'm oldest.

671
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,832
Mama will want Cersei
for herself.

672
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,832
She's not my mama.

673
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,915
You can have Cersei.

674
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:26,457
I want the Mountain.

675
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:28,582
The Mountain
killed Father.

676
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:30,331
He'll crush you
with one hand.

677
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:33,081
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

678
00:49:33,082 --> 00:49:35,290
Will you shut up
about Mama?

679
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:36,874
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

680
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:40,749
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

681
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,291
And then I won't
have to share.

682
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,000
"Mama!"

683
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:49,999
How can you drink
this piss?

684
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,123
When we reach
Sunspear,

685
00:49:52,124 --> 00:49:54,665
I'll treat you
to a Dornish red.

686
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,081
The best
in the world.

687
00:49:57,082 --> 00:49:58,498
Have you ever
been to Dorne?

688
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,498
A few times.

689
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:01,874
Never stayed long.

690
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:03,416
A boy in every port?

691
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:06,000
A boy, a girl.

692
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:08,916
Depends on the port.

693
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:14,750
Could we get
some more?

694
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:17,915
I thought
it wasn't for you.

695
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:20,207
I'm developing
a taste for it.

696
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,000
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

697
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:30,707
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

698
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:32,540
Once I kill my uncle.

699
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:34,999
And what will you be,
handsome?

700
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,707
Whatever
my queen commands.

701
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:40,540
He'll be my advisor,
my protector.

702
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,790
Oh, I see.

703
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:44,207
Your protector.

704
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:48,498
So, if someone gets
too close to you...

705
00:50:48,499 --> 00:50:50,290
He might have
to intervene.

706
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:52,081
To hold
that person back.

707
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,750
Until they've made
their intentions known.

708
00:50:58,124 --> 00:51:00,084
Why are you standing
all the way over there, then?

709
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:03,665
A foreign invasion
is underway.

710
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:05,416
Leave him be.

711
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:10,791
Seems like you
don't need a protector.

712
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:17,708
Stay here.

713
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,666
We're under attack!

714
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,416
Euron.

715
00:52:55,332 --> 00:52:57,666
You mother's below deck.
Keep her safe.

716
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,248
Aah!

717
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:06,082
Yah!

718
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:12,833
Aah!

719
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,124
Yah!

720
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:34,791
Yah!

721
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,832
Kill us.

722
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,291
Get it over with.

723
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,499
Give your uncle a kiss.

724
00:55:30,024 --> 00:55:39,991

725
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:01,249
Little Theon!

726
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:18,249
Ah, come on,
you cockless coward.

727
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:23,999
I have her.

728
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,583
Come and get her.

729
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:22,415
I was born
to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

730
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,583
And I will.

731
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:29,041
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

732
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:31,041
Cersei will be ready.

733
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:32,750
They know we're coming.
