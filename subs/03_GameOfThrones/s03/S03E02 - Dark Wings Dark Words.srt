1
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,495
Don't think too much, Bran.

2
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:47,545
Relax your bow arm.

3
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:59,055
<i>And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?</i>

4
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:00,956
Father?

5
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,997
You can't kill it, you know.

6
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:12,767
Why not?

7
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:17,169
Because the raven is you.

8
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:28,413
Hodor.

9
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:30,114
It's all right, Hodor.

10
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:32,517
Hodor.

11
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:40,124
<i>Were you inside the
wolf again, little lord?</i>

12
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,093
No, it was
the three-eyed raven.

13
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:45,296
<i>He's back.</i>

14
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:48,431
I tried to kill it,
but I couldn't.

15
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:51,401
- There was a boy.
- <i>I don't want to hear about it.</i>

16
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:53,869
- But you asked.
- We've got plenty of worries.

17
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:56,305
We don't need to pour
black magic on top of them.

18
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:59,675
I didn't ask
for black magic dreams.

19
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,409
I know you didn't, little lord.

20
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:05,213
We need to move.

21
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,847
We don't know
who might be after us.

22
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:08,616
No one even knows we're alive.

23
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,485
And who told you that?

24
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,720
<i>The three-eyed raven
tell you?</i>

25
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,789
- No.
- Some good he is, then.

26
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:21,194
<i>I don't know what other people
know and what they don't.</i>

27
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,263
I only know the Wall
is a long way off.

28
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,540
My mother always told me

29
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,908
you Westerosi were a grim lot.

30
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,279
Grim, bearded,

31
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:43,980
stinking barbarians

32
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:46,449
that would row
across the Narrow Sea

33
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:49,185
and steal us from our beds.

34
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,420
Did you ever think
you'd marry one?

35
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:55,992
I never thought
I'd marry anyone at all.

36
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:58,327
Never?

37
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:01,863
Not until I met
the king of the grim,

38
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:04,098
bearded, stinking barbarians.

39
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,874
Pardon me, Your Grace.

40
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:15,776
- My queen.
- Lord Bolton.

41
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,147
Let me guess which one
is the good news.

42
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:24,551
Word from Riverrun

43
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:26,220
and Winterfell.

44
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,625
I hadn't seen him in years.

45
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,794
I don't even know how many.

46
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:41,164
We'll travel
to the funeral together.

47
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,666
<i>Lord Bolton will garrison here</i>

48
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,103
<i>until we return.</i>

49
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,805
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

50
00:05:55,577 --> 00:05:57,711
Something else?

51
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:01,347
By the time Bolton's
bastard got to Winterfell,

52
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:03,282
the ironborn were gone.

53
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:08,186
<i>They massacred everyone and
put the castle to the torch.</i>

54
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:13,557
And Bran and Rickon
have not been found.

55
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:19,598
They may have escaped.

56
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:22,934
Or Theon may have taken them back
to the Iron Islands as hostages.

57
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:25,369
Have you received any demands?

58
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:27,738
No.

59
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:30,372
Have you heard anything
from Theon at all?

60
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:54,194
Where am I?

61
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,168
Who are you?

62
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:09,608
What do you want?

63
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:11,777
I want to do this.

64
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:18,916
Do you know how long
it's going to take us

65
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,651
to get to King's Landing walking
through fields and forests?

66
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:23,352
Yes.

67
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:26,256
So how shall we pass the time?

68
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,157
By putting one foot
in front of the other.

69
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,525
It's going to be
a very dull walk.

70
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,927
I'm here to take you
to King's Landing

71
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:34,796
and bring back Lady Stark's
daughters in exchange.

72
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,830
Dull is fine.

73
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:39,633
You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,

74
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,535
no one enjoys the company
of a humorless mute.

75
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,002
Trust me on this.

76
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,272
People have been serving me
since I was born.

77
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:49,675
You think Lady Stark is going
to want a giant towheaded plank

78
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:52,278
following her around
for the rest of her life?

79
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:55,681
A week's journey with you and she'll
order you to fall on your sword.

80
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:59,418
If Lady Stark is unhappy
with any aspect of my service,

81
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:01,186
I'm sure she'll let me know.

82
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,720
She's an honest woman.

83
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:04,721
All the good it's done her.

84
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,496
How did you come into
Lady Stark's service?

85
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,863
There's something
we can talk about.

86
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:16,797
Not your concern, Kingslayer.

87
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:18,400
It had to be recently.

88
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:20,401
You weren't with her
at Winterfell.

89
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:21,835
How would you know?

90
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,671
Because I visited Winterfell.

91
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,440
I would have noticed
your dour head

92
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,408
smacking into the archways.

93
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,943
Move.

94
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,049
- Were you pledged to Stannis?
- Gods, no.

95
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,984
Ah, Renly.

96
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,586
Really?

97
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,320
He wasn't fit
to rule over anything

98
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:45,189
more important than
a 12-course meal.

99
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,790
- Shut your mouth.
- Why?

100
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:50,092
I lived with him at court since
he was a boy, don't forget.

101
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:52,228
Could hardly escape
the little tulip.

102
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:55,263
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

103
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:57,131
I knew him far better than you.

104
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,134
I knew him as well as anyone.

105
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:00,702
As a member of his Kingsguard,

106
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:02,504
he trusted me with everything.

107
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:03,937
He would have been
a wonderful king.

108
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:05,440
Sounds like you
quite fancied him.

109
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,708
I did not fancy him.

110
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:09,377
Oh, gods, you did.

111
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:12,246
<i>Did you ever tell him?</i>

112
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,081
No, of course not.

113
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:18,083
You weren't Renly's
type, I'm afraid.

114
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:21,954
He preferred curly-haired
little girls like Loras Tyrell.

115
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:23,354
You're far too much
man for him.

116
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,190
I'm not interested
in foul rumors.

117
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:27,225
Unless they're about me.

118
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,594
It's all true about Renly.

119
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:32,531
His proclivities were the
worst kept secret at court.

120
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,899
It's a shame the throne
isn't made out of cocks.

121
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:37,834
- They'd have never got him off it.
- Shut your mouth!

122
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:41,405
I don't blame him.

123
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,439
And I don't blame you, either.

124
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:46,677
We don't get to choose
who we love.

125
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,688
- Where are you headed, then?
- South.

126
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:02,757
- You?
- Riverrun.

127
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,927
Staying off
the kingsroad, are you?

128
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:08,129
They get you no matter
where you go.

129
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:09,798
- You can't win.
- No, you really can't.

130
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:12,033
Looks like you're
safe enough, though.

131
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:13,701
Meaning no offense,
my lady, but...

132
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:16,136
I wouldn't
tangle with you.

133
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:20,206
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.

134
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,314
<i>He knows who I am.</i>

135
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:30,781
- He doesn't.
- Maybe you're right.

136
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:33,550
But what if you're not?
What if he tells someone?

137
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:38,456
We're not doing it.

138
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,724
<i>He's an innocent man.</i>

139
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:43,293
More innocent than
Lady Stark's daughters?

140
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:57,103
Make it tighter here.

141
00:10:58,205 --> 00:10:59,806
That's better.

142
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,841
<i>It makes you look very strong.</i>

143
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:04,876
No flowers.

144
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,011
I said no flowers.

145
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:10,513
All these are wrong.
Bring others.

146
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:12,516
Yes, Your Grace.

147
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:15,485
Bloody flowers.

148
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,518
On the king.

149
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,922
Looks like a Tyrell rose.

150
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:22,790
Give it to Margaery
for her wedding gown.

151
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:25,359
Should be more
than enough fabric.

152
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:32,265
Tell me what you think of her.

153
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,499
Who?

154
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:35,568
Margaery.

155
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,502
She's an ideal match.

156
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,472
With the Tyrells beside us,

157
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:41,707
we'll crush the Northerners.

158
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:44,909
Hang their lords,
burn their strongholds,

159
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,478
sow their fields with salt,

160
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:49,613
and no one will think of
rebelling for another century.

161
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:54,250
It is a good match, but
what do you think of her?

162
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:00,322
She's beautiful
and intelligent.

163
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:02,124
Yes, she is.

164
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:05,928
Her concern with the well-being of
the common people is interesting.

165
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:08,463
Not to me.

166
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:12,434
I only meant that to go out of
your way to endanger yourself...

167
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:14,769
This is becoming
one of the most boring

168
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:17,237
conversations I've ever had.

169
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:24,477
Margaery Tyrell dotes on
filthy urchins for a reason.

170
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,945
She dresses like
a harlot for a reason.

171
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,278
She married a traitor
and known degenerate

172
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:31,633
like Renly Baratheon
for a reason.

173
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:35,216
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

174
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,917
That's what
intelligent women do...

175
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:39,787
What they're told.

176
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,591
- You need to ask yourself...
- I don't need to do anything.

177
00:12:58,132 --> 00:12:59,900
Better.

178
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:03,101
Much better.

179
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:05,470
I still don't believe it.

180
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,237
He didn't.
He didn't want anything.

181
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:10,939
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

182
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:15,910
Men only want one thing
from a pretty girl.

183
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:21,079
Littlefinger's not
in love with me.

184
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:25,649
Love is not the thing he wants.

185
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,084
He's too old.

186
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:31,285
They never see it that way.

187
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:38,123
He didn't ask you
to do something for him?

188
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:40,358
Spy on someone or...?

189
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,261
No.

190
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,600
If he does ask you for anything

191
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:52,603
or try anything

192
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:55,972
or touch you,
I want you to tell me.

193
00:13:57,174 --> 00:13:59,643
Why?
What will you do?

194
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:01,310
I will make him stop.

195
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,448
<i>Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.</i>

196
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:07,949
Send him in.

197
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,626
Lady Sansa.

198
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:20,027
Ser Loras.

199
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:21,328
My sister Margaery
invites you to take

200
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:22,763
the air with her
and our grandmother

201
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:25,164
the Lady Olenna in the gardens.

202
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,900
May I escort you to them?

203
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,407
I believe you grow more beautiful
every day, Lady Sansa.

204
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,610
You are too kind, Ser Loras.

205
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:45,582
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

206
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:49,986
At the Hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.

207
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,922
A rose, a red rose.

208
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,624
Of course I did.

209
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:00,095
<i>It's more your color.</i>

210
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,864
- You take it.
- Thank you.

211
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:04,765
You're such a dear.

212
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,835
I'll take my leave.

213
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,636
Lady Sansa.

214
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,838
Thank you, Ser Loras.

215
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:12,841
Come.

216
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,281
Lady Sansa, it is my honor

217
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:23,483
to present my grandmother...

218
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:27,019
the Lady Olenna
of House Tyrell.

219
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:29,055
Kiss me, child.

220
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:31,123
It's so good of you to visit me

221
00:15:31,157 --> 00:15:33,026
and my foolish flock of hens.

222
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,428
We're very sorry
for your losses.

223
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:39,131
And I was sorry when I heard of
Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.

224
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,366
- He was very gallant.
- Gallant, yes.

225
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,635
And charming and very clean.

226
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:45,570
He knew how to dress and smile

227
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:48,439
and somehow this gave him the
notion he was fit to be king.

228
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,473
Renly was brave
and gentle, Grandmother.

229
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:52,176
Father liked him
and so did Loras.

230
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,844
Loras is young and very good

231
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:55,813
at knocking men
off horses with a stick.

232
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:58,514
That does not make him wise.

233
00:15:58,549 --> 00:15:59,917
As to your
fathead father...

234
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,752
Grandmother! What will
Sansa think of us?

235
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:05,186
<i>She might think we have
some wits about us.</i>

236
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:06,922
One of us, at any rate.

237
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,691
It was treason.
I warned them.

238
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,661
Robert has two sons and
Renly has an older brother.

239
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:14,795
How could he possibly
have any claim

240
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,430
to that ugly iron chair?

241
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:20,500
We should have stayed well out
of all this if you ask me.

242
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:22,402
But once the cow's been milked,

243
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:25,004
there's no squirting
the cream back up her udders.

244
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:27,074
So here we are
to see things through.

245
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,711
What do you say to that, Sansa?

246
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,781
Shall we have some lemon cakes?

247
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:34,381
Lemon cake's my favorite.

248
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,550
So we've been told.

249
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:40,087
Are you going to bring the food or
do you mean to starve us to death?

250
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:42,922
Here, Sansa,

251
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:45,057
come sit with me.

252
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:48,527
I'm much less boring
than these others.

253
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:53,299
Do you know my son?

254
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,166
The Lord of Highgarden?

255
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:57,401
I haven't had the pleasure.

256
00:16:57,469 --> 00:16:59,404
No great pleasure, believe me.

257
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:00,938
A ponderous oaf.

258
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:02,973
<i>His father was an oaf as well.</i>

259
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:05,776
<i>My husband,
the late Lord Luthor.</i>

260
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:08,711
He managed to ride off
a cliff whilst hawking.

261
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:10,913
They say he was looking
up at the sky

262
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,450
and paying no mind to where
his horse was taking him.

263
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:16,485
And now my son
is doing the same,

264
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,189
only this time he's riding
a lion instead of a horse.

265
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:22,791
Now...

266
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,193
I want you to tell me the truth

267
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:29,164
about this royal boy,
this Joffrey.

268
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,365
I... I...

269
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,835
You, you.

270
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:34,602
Who else would know better?

271
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,438
We've heard
some troubling tales.

272
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:40,208
Is there any truth to them?

273
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:42,643
<i>Has this boy mistreated you?</i>

274
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:45,011
Has he ripped out your tongue?

275
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:47,480
Joff... King Joffrey,

276
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:50,749
he... His Grace
is very fair

277
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:53,852
and handsome
and as brave as a lion.

278
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:56,488
Yes, all Lannisters are lions.

279
00:17:56,522 --> 00:18:00,225
And when a Tyrell farts,
it smells like a rose.

280
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,526
<i>But how kind is he?
How clever?</i>

281
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,061
Has he a good heart,
a gentle hand?

282
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:06,530
I'm to be his wife.

283
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:08,764
I only want to know
what that means.

284
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:18,105
Bring me some cheese.

285
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,507
The cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.

286
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:22,842
The cheese will be served
when I want it served.

287
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:24,443
And I want it served now.

288
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,648
Are you frightened, child?

289
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:32,584
No need for that.

290
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:34,518
We're only women here.

291
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:37,854
Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.

292
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:41,891
My father always
told the truth.

293
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:43,992
Yes, he had that reputation.

294
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:46,462
And they named him traitor
and took his head.

295
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:49,398
Joffrey.

296
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:51,332
Joffrey did that.

297
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:54,736
He promised he would be merciful
and he cut my father's head off.

298
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,571
And he said that was mercy.

299
00:18:56,606 --> 00:19:00,441
Then he took me up on the
walls and made me look at it.

300
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,480
Go on.

301
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,615
I... I can't.
I never meant...

302
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,852
My father was a traitor.

303
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,320
My brother as well.
I have traitor's blood.

304
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,022
Please don't make me
say anymore.

305
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,555
She's terrified, Grandmother.

306
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,026
- Just look at her.
- Speak freely, child.

307
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,863
We would never betray your
confidence, I swear it.

308
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,732
He's a monster.

309
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:33,736
Ah.

310
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:35,704
<i>That's a pity.</i>

311
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:38,139
Please, don't stop the wedding.

312
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:40,841
Have no fear.
The Lord Oaf of Highgarden

313
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,710
<i>is determined that
Margaery shall be queen.</i>

314
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:47,213
Even so, we thank you
for the truth.

315
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:50,049
Ah, here comes my cheese.

316
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:07,263
<i>We're at war.</i>

317
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:09,833
<i>This march is a distraction.</i>

318
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:13,036
My grandfather's funeral
is not a distraction.

319
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,038
- Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
- No.

320
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:18,105
Then it's a distraction.

321
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,208
My Uncle Edmure has his
forces garrisoned there.

322
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:23,110
We need his men.

323
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:25,445
Unless he's been breeding them,

324
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,447
he don't have enough
to make a difference.

325
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:30,083
Have you lost faith
in our cause?

326
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:33,720
If it's revenge,
I still got faith in it.

327
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,620
If you no longer
believe...

328
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,288
I can believe
till it snows in Dorne.

329
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:41,926
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

330
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:46,330
You don't think we can win?

331
00:20:46,364 --> 00:20:48,498
May I speak my mind,
Your Grace?

332
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:52,000
Have you not been speaking
your mind, Lord Karstark?

333
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,936
I think you lost this war

334
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,139
the day you married her.

335
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,583
Whoa, whoa.

336
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:11,685
Your Grace.

337
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:14,321
You're afraid of her.

338
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,058
- And she knows it.
- I'm not afraid of her.

339
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,267
May I help you, Lady Stark?

340
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:30,935
No.

341
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,472
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have...

342
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,006
You can't help because a mother

343
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,209
makes one for her
children to protect them.

344
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:42,146
Only a mother can make them.

345
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:51,085
You've made them before?

346
00:21:52,522 --> 00:21:54,788
Twice.

347
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,957
Did they work?

348
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,127
After a fashion.

349
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,399
I prayed for my son Bran
to survive his fall.

350
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:13,105
Many years before that,

351
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:15,640
one of the boys came down
with the pox.

352
00:22:17,442 --> 00:22:19,845
Maester Luwin said if he made it
through the night, he'd live.

353
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:23,681
But it would be
a very long night.

354
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:29,620
So I sat with him
all through the darkness.

355
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:34,157
Listened to his ragged
little breaths,

356
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:37,027
his coughing, his whimpering.

357
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:39,162
<i>Which boy?</i>

358
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:42,331
Jon Snow.

359
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,969
When my husband brought
that baby home from the war,

360
00:22:47,004 --> 00:22:49,471
I couldn't bear to look at him.

361
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,939
I didn't want
to see those brown

362
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:55,243
<i>stranger's eyes
staring up at me.</i>

363
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:58,213
<i>So I prayed to the gods,
take him away.</i>

364
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:00,748
Make him die.

365
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:04,717
He got the pox.

366
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:11,791
<i>And I knew I was the worst
woman who ever lived.</i>

367
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,828
A murderer.

368
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:20,099
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child

369
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:22,567
to a horrible death

370
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,135
all because I was
jealous of his mother.

371
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,572
A woman he didn't even know.

372
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,775
So I prayed to all seven gods,

373
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:34,978
let the boy live.

374
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:37,446
Let him live

375
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:39,515
and I'll love him.

376
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,851
I'll be a mother to him.

377
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:46,622
I'll beg my husband
to give him a true name,

378
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,591
to call him Stark
and be done with it,

379
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:51,192
to make him one of us.

380
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:53,495
And he lived.

381
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:55,330
And he lived.

382
00:23:58,232 --> 00:24:00,668
And I couldn't keep my promise.

383
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:07,740
<i>And everything
that's happened since then...</i>

384
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:12,545
<i>all this horror
that's come to my family...</i>

385
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,816
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

386
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,095
Was it hard for you
to kill the Halfhand?

387
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:35,766
Yes.

388
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,234
You liked him?

389
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,936
I like you, but if
you're playing us false,

390
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:42,905
it won't be hard
for me to kill you.

391
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,673
I've got wildling
blood in my veins.

392
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:47,776
- These are my people.
- I understand.

393
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,712
Well, how could you understand?

394
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:53,014
You want to protect
your people.

395
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:56,216
Do you know what it takes
to unite 90 clans,

396
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,518
half of whom want
to massacre the other half

397
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,954
for one insult or another?

398
00:25:00,988 --> 00:25:04,757
They speak seven different
languages in my army.

399
00:25:04,824 --> 00:25:06,760
<i>The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.</i>

400
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:08,694
<i>The Hornfoots hate
the ice-river clans.</i>

401
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:11,329
Everyone hates the cave people.

402
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:14,732
So you know how I got
moon worshippers

403
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:16,901
and cannibals and giants

404
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:19,204
to march together
in the same army?

405
00:25:19,238 --> 00:25:20,605
No.

406
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:23,474
I told them we were
all going to die

407
00:25:23,508 --> 00:25:25,475
if we don't get south.

408
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:27,644
Because that's the truth.

409
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,322
Shouldn't be long now.

410
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,701
What's wrong with him?

411
00:25:54,735 --> 00:25:56,836
<i>He's a warg.</i>

412
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:59,940
He can enter the mind of
animals, see through their eyes.

413
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,473
He's scouting for us.

414
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:04,176
What, you've never met a warg?

415
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,351
<i>Orell.</i>

416
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:27,761
Where were you this time?

417
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:35,034
The Fist of the First Men.

418
00:26:35,102 --> 00:26:37,471
What did you see?

419
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,009
Dead crows.

420
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:54,784
What's the matter, Piggy?

421
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:56,786
You crying 'cause you're cold?

422
00:26:59,691 --> 00:27:03,426
There's 200 brothers
killed by dead men

423
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,961
and you're still here

424
00:27:05,996 --> 00:27:08,530
whimpering.

425
00:27:08,564 --> 00:27:10,765
That seem fair to you?

426
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:13,902
I seen 'em torn
to pieces fighting

427
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:16,636
while you was off somewhere
hiding in a hole.

428
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,640
Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while, eh?

429
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:24,309
You know you want to.

430
00:27:41,156 --> 00:27:43,056
Hey.

431
00:27:48,328 --> 00:27:50,062
Get up, Sam.

432
00:27:50,097 --> 00:27:52,732
- No.
- <i>Get up.</i>

433
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:54,332
I can't.

434
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:56,901
If you stop, you'll die.

435
00:27:56,935 --> 00:28:00,637
'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die, too.

436
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:03,939
- You don't care.
- 'Course we care.

437
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,242
You left me.

438
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:09,677
When the white walkers came,
you left me.

439
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:12,346
Aye, we left you.

440
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:14,715
<i>You're fat and you're slow.</i>

441
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,951
We didn't want to die.

442
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:20,555
Help me get him up.

443
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:23,356
Looks like that piggy
is done for.

444
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,524
- Help us get him up.
- He's slowing us down.

445
00:28:25,592 --> 00:28:27,160
Just get him up!

446
00:28:27,195 --> 00:28:30,262
Why? So the rest
of us can die?

447
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:34,066
We'll move faster without him.

448
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,535
What is this?
Get up, Tarly.

449
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:41,472
- Is he all right?
- Aye, I think so.

450
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:43,273
If he can't, we may as
well just go without him.

451
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:45,174
That's enough.

452
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,244
Tarly,

453
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:49,611
I forbid you to die.

454
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,880
Do you hear me?

455
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:54,615
- Why should the rest of us...
- Rast...

456
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,118
you're responsible for him.

457
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,185
What am I supposed to do?

458
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,254
Make sure he gets back alive.

459
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,056
If he doesn't, you don't.

460
00:29:04,957 --> 00:29:06,959
Move on!

461
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:15,132
I'm not dying for you, Piggy.

462
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:17,001
You hear me?

463
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:44,259
Where's Rickon and Hodor?

464
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:47,596
Looking for food.

465
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:52,232
What's out there?

466
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:43,877
<i>Not another step, boy.</i>

467
00:30:43,912 --> 00:30:46,046
<i>Unless you want to drown
in your own blood.</i>

468
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:47,448
I'm unarmed.

469
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:50,316
That was poor planning.

470
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,551
My sister carries the weapons.

471
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:57,089
I'm better with them.

472
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:59,458
<i>Drop the spear.</i>

473
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,061
<i>Drop it.</i>

474
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,531
If you kill me,

475
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:11,200
that wolf will tear
you to bits.

476
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:19,676
You must be Summer.

477
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,998
I'm Jojen Reed.

478
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:48,101
This is my sister Meera.

479
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:54,807
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

480
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:58,745
And we have much farther to go.

481
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:04,084
I'm just
trying to understand.

482
00:32:04,118 --> 00:32:06,953
Would you please
shut up about it?

483
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:08,687
Jaqen H'ghar offered
you three kills.

484
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:10,922
- I'm not listening.
- But just explain it to me.

485
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:13,659
He offered to kill
any three people you wanted.

486
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:16,394
Dead. All you had to do
was give him the names.

487
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:19,129
Anyone. You could have
picked King Joffrey.

488
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:21,197
- Shut up.
- You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

489
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,699
Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal,

490
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,467
so why are you complaining?

491
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:26,303
But you could have
ended the war.

492
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:29,071
- Where are we going?
- North.

493
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:30,506
If we were going north,

494
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,173
we should have come to the
Red Fork River by now.

495
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,343
Maybe we already passed it.

496
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:36,010
It's 100 feet wide.

497
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:38,277
How could we have passed it?

498
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:40,747
If we hit the Red Fork,

499
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:42,248
we can follow it west
to Riverrun.

500
00:32:42,283 --> 00:32:43,783
My mother grew up there.

501
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:46,151
My grandfather's a lord.
He'll protect us.

502
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:50,689
Could be a minstrel.

503
00:32:50,723 --> 00:32:52,858
Shut up.

<i>We could jump him,
tie him up, steal his gold,</i>

507
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:03,468
- and buy some food.

<i>- Loose a few more shafts.</i>
- Don't.

517
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,705
Put the sword down, girl.

518
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:49,307
You go on down the road.

519
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,308
Just keep on singing
so we know where you are.

520
00:33:51,342 --> 00:33:54,945
Leave us be
and I won't kill you.

521
00:33:57,948 --> 00:33:59,583
Generous.

522
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:02,085
You're a dangerous person.

523
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,954
I like dangerous people.

524
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:09,659
Why are your friends so shy?

525
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:12,828
What friends?

526
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:16,099
The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.

527
00:34:36,985 --> 00:34:38,985
Three young ones on the run

528
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:42,489
carrying
castle-forged swords.

529
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:44,023
You escape from Harrenhal?

530
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:46,659
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- Thoros of Myr.

531
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:48,727
And the fellow here
with the bow is Anguy.

532
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,162
No, who do you fight for?

533
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:52,230
<i>The Brotherhood
without Banners.</i>

534
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:56,801
Now come along.

535
00:34:56,835 --> 00:34:58,435
I want to hear how two boys

536
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,006
and a very dangerous girl
escaped Harrenhal.

537
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,708
I'm not going with them.
The Brotherhood?

538
00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:07,279
That's who the Mountain
and them lot were looking for.

539
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,113
They'll bring us back
and put rats in us.

540
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:11,147
You've got nothing
to fear from us, son.

541
00:35:11,182 --> 00:35:13,983
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

542
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:15,917
We're trying to save it.

543
00:35:15,952 --> 00:35:17,553
Now come on.

544
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:20,288
We'll talk some more
over brown bread and stew.

545
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:22,422
And then you can go
on your way.

546
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:32,064
Here's the thing, fat boy.

547
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:36,903
When I'm done talking,

548
00:35:36,937 --> 00:35:39,840
that arrow's falling down
on your fat head.

549
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:43,241
So I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.

550
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,588
Half the country's starving
and look at this one.

551
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:04,091
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

552
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,968
My lion.

553
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:19,705
We've spoken of this.

554
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,440
You cannot come here.

555
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,212
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

556
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:30,047
Did anyone see you?

557
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:32,248
- No.
- You sure?

558
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:34,585
My father does not
make idle threats.

559
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,955
Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.

560
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,991
You have to be
absolutely certain.

561
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:45,695
All right.

562
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:47,731
What is this problem?

563
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,599
I'm worried about Sansa.

564
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:53,468
When she spoke
with Lord Baelish,

565
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,938
his friend warned me about him.

566
00:36:56,972 --> 00:36:59,072
Baelish doesn't have friends.

567
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:01,842
I don't know her name.

568
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:05,010
- Oh, Ros? The redhead?
- How do you know her?

569
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:07,247
I try to know
as many people as I can.

570
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:09,048
You never know
which one you'll need.

571
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:10,816
She's a whore.

572
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:13,952
Yes, well, we shouldn't be
judgmental about these things.

573
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:17,288
- You fucked her.
- Oh, please.

574
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:20,058
All right, yes,
I fucked her once.

575
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,693
Twice.

576
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:27,797
But since I met you, my lady,

577
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,298
I've been with no one else.

578
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:35,436
And was she good?
Did you like her?

579
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,171
Not as much
as I like you, obviously,

580
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,974
or she'd be the one
torturing me right now.

581
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:45,678
What did she say
about Littlefinger?

582
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:49,982
That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

583
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,918
Is there an idiot
in any village

584
00:37:52,952 --> 00:37:54,920
who trusts Littlefinger?

585
00:37:57,423 --> 00:37:59,256
We have to protect her.

586
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,492
We can't.

587
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:03,460
Now that the Lannisters
have discarded her,

588
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:05,895
Sansa will have many suitors.

589
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:09,165
A great beauty
with a very old name.

590
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,334
A great beauty?
Oh, a great beauty?

591
00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:15,437
Yes, she is, objectively, very.

592
00:38:15,471 --> 00:38:18,006
Her face
is quite pleasing...

593
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,707
To other men and to women,

594
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:21,609
people in general.

595
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:23,578
But not to me, of course.

596
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:26,781
I only have eyes for you.

597
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:29,449
You pervert.
You want her?

598
00:38:29,484 --> 00:38:32,651
- This child?
- I don't even want to talk about her.

599
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,421
- But you are.
- Only because you're making me.

600
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:38,956
I didn't force
you to open your mouth

601
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:41,026
and make words come out.

602
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:44,262
This is cruel and unfair.
Cruelly unfair.

603
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:46,029
"Oh, the cruelty.

604
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:48,499
Shae is so cruel to me."

605
00:38:50,668 --> 00:38:52,635
Hmm, yes.

606
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:03,912
Now do you think I'm cruel?

607
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:06,714
Only if you stop.

608
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,552
But you mustn't
come here again.

609
00:39:14,323 --> 00:39:16,557
Do you hear me?

610
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,528
You've come to
a dangerous place

611
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:23,096
full of dangerous people.

612
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:28,300
Dangerous people.

613
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,609
<i>Lady Tyrell, my king.</i>

614
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,512
Send her in.

615
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:58,559
You wanted to see me,
Your Grace?

616
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:00,329
I'm leaving on a hunting trip.

617
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:02,730
I just wanted to make sure

618
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:04,632
you had everything
you need before I left.

619
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,901
That's very thoughtful,
Your Grace.

620
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:08,702
I have everything I could want.

621
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:09,937
Good. Good.

622
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:12,672
How are you finding life
in the capital?

623
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:15,374
It must be quite a change
after Renly's camp.

624
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,276
A welcome one.

625
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:21,646
A military encampment
is no place for a lady.

626
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:24,082
And the bedside of a traitor?

627
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,152
Is that a place for a lady?

628
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:33,122
Your Grace,

629
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:36,092
I tried to do my duty
as a wife, that is all.

630
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:39,694
What was your duty to this
traitor as you saw it?

631
00:40:39,762 --> 00:40:41,930
The duty of any wife
to any husband...

632
00:40:41,964 --> 00:40:43,664
To provide him with children.

633
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:45,765
<i>You failed to do this.</i>

634
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,002
- Why?
- <i>I...</i>

635
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:54,006
I would not speak ill
of the dead, Your Grace.

636
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,973
You think one ought
to speak kindly

637
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:58,809
of a traitor merely because he's
had a sword put through his heart?

638
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:00,678
No.

639
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:03,547
I do beg your pardon.

640
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:06,850
The subtleties of politics
are often lost on me.

641
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:09,285
Renly...

642
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,789
I don't believe
he was interested

643
00:41:13,824 --> 00:41:16,224
<i>in the company of women.</i>

644
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,693
What makes you say this?

645
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:24,965
Whenever I wanted
to make a child with him,

646
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,435
he...

647
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,503
He had so many excuses,

648
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:31,671
so many late-night
war councils.

649
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:34,041
He never wanted to try.

650
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,177
Except one evening,

651
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:41,013
after he'd had far too
much wine to drink,

652
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:43,515
he suggested something...

653
00:41:46,986 --> 00:41:50,554
Something that sounded
very painful

654
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:52,688
and couldn't possibly
result in children.

655
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:56,625
Maybe the fault was with me.

656
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,694
No, he was a known...

657
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,297
degenerate.

658
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:04,765
It's such a relief to hear
you say so, Your Grace.

659
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:06,499
Mmm.

660
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:09,235
I've considered
making his perversion

661
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:11,270
punishable by death.

662
00:42:12,371 --> 00:42:15,439
As is your right.

663
00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:19,042
You must do whatever
you need to do.

664
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:24,280
You are the king.

665
00:42:24,314 --> 00:42:26,515
Yes.

666
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:30,953
I am.

667
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:38,559
Do you like it?

668
00:42:38,593 --> 00:42:40,495
I just had it made.

669
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,297
Probably one of the finest
weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.

670
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:44,732
It's beautiful.

671
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,967
Will you show me how it works?

672
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:52,738
It's a new design.

673
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:55,207
Much easier to load.
There's no crank.

674
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:59,210
You use this lever
to draw the string.

675
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,818
The bolt goes here.

676
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,855
And then you just aim...

677
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,193
and...

678
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:24,699
Would you take me
hunting sometime?

679
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:26,666
Forgive me, Your Grace.

680
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:28,835
I know a hunt
is no place for a woman.

681
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:30,437
It's not unheard of.

682
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:32,772
My father would never
let me before...

683
00:43:32,806 --> 00:43:35,207
You no longer belong to him.

684
00:43:36,242 --> 00:43:38,177
Do you want to hold it?

685
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:40,279
May I?
Please.

686
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:50,255
I imagine it must be
so exciting

687
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:52,289
to squeeze your finger here

688
00:43:52,323 --> 00:43:54,993
and watch something
die over there.

689
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:01,531
Could you do it?

690
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:03,565
Could you...

691
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,900
kill something?

692
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,570
I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?

693
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,938
Yes.

694
00:44:11,973 --> 00:44:14,375
Would you like to watch me?

695
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:20,314
Yes.

696
00:44:21,882 --> 00:44:24,584
Stop! Stop!

697
00:44:24,618 --> 00:44:26,987
- <i>Tell us the truth.</i>
- About what?

698
00:44:28,455 --> 00:44:30,957
I don't
know what you want.

699
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:33,224
I want the truth.

700
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:35,027
What truth?

701
00:44:35,062 --> 00:44:37,028
Why'd you take Winterfell?

702
00:44:37,062 --> 00:44:39,463
I took it to...
I took it...

703
00:44:39,497 --> 00:44:40,899
- Who gave the orders?
- No one.

704
00:44:40,933 --> 00:44:42,466
- I took it on my own.
- <i>Why?</i>

705
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,501
To take the North
while it was vulnerable.

706
00:44:44,536 --> 00:44:46,269
What were you going
to do once you took it?

707
00:44:46,303 --> 00:44:48,038
Hold it.
Rule it.

708
00:44:48,072 --> 00:44:51,774
Good.
That's very good.

709
00:44:56,745 --> 00:44:58,446
Why did you do that?
I told you.

710
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,114
Why did you take Winterfell?

711
00:45:00,149 --> 00:45:03,416
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

712
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:13,191
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

713
00:45:13,226 --> 00:45:16,661
I took it because
I hated the Starks.

714
00:45:16,696 --> 00:45:19,063
I hated them
for holding me prisoner.

715
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:21,533
I wanted to hurt them.

716
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:29,405
What are you doing?

717
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:34,577
Please.

718
00:45:39,648 --> 00:45:42,482
I'll tell you anything.

719
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:44,518
Just take it off.

720
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:47,654
<i>Please.
Please, just take it off.</i>

721
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,963
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

722
00:46:07,072 --> 00:46:09,573
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

723
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:11,642
No, don't go.
Please, please.

724
00:46:11,676 --> 00:46:13,343
No, please don't leave me.

725
00:46:13,377 --> 00:46:15,079
Please, please.

726
00:46:15,113 --> 00:46:16,513
Please, please don't go!

727
00:46:16,547 --> 00:46:21,252
Please. Please.
Don't leave me.

728
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:23,953
Please don't go.

729
00:46:28,691 --> 00:46:30,825
Rickon, stay with us.

730
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,595
It's all right.
The wolves will protect him.

731
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:46,872
You can get inside his head,

732
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:49,007
see through his eyes.

733
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,408
Only when I'm asleep.

734
00:46:50,443 --> 00:46:52,977
That's how it begins until
you learn to control it.

735
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,379
You're a warg.

736
00:46:54,414 --> 00:46:57,114
It's not just wolves.

737
00:46:57,149 --> 00:46:58,948
Sometimes in my dreams
there's a...

738
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,719
- A three-eyed raven?
- <i>You've seen it?</i>

739
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:03,987
We saw him together.
You haven't forgotten?

740
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,722
Does it have anything
to do with warging?

741
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:09,491
No, the raven
is something different,

742
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:11,860
something deeper.

743
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:13,360
The raven brings the sight.

744
00:47:13,394 --> 00:47:16,363
Seeing things
that haven't happened yet?

745
00:47:16,397 --> 00:47:18,631
<i>Or things that happened
long before you were born</i>

746
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:22,368
or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

747
00:47:22,403 --> 00:47:24,737
What's he telling him?

748
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:26,973
Why don't you ask?

749
00:47:28,508 --> 00:47:30,442
Isn't he ashamed, your brother,

750
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:32,176
needing you to protect him?

751
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:34,979
Where's the shame in that?

752
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:38,614
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

753
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:42,484
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

754
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,921
Some people
will always need help.

755
00:47:46,956 --> 00:47:49,290
<i>That doesn't mean
they're not worth helping.</i>

756
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:56,964
When my father died,
I dreamt it.

757
00:47:56,998 --> 00:48:00,334
You didn't dream it.
You saw it.

758
00:48:00,402 --> 00:48:02,302
So did I.

759
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:03,937
You have the sight, too?

760
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,076
When I told my father
about your father...

761
00:48:12,511 --> 00:48:15,646
for the first time
in my life, I saw him cry.

762
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,381
Your father is Howland Reed?

763
00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:19,114
Yeah.

764
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:22,418
He saved my father's life
during the rebellion.

765
00:48:22,452 --> 00:48:24,253
Your father told you
about the rebellion?

766
00:48:24,287 --> 00:48:26,287
Mine never did.

767
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:28,157
But I saw that, too.

768
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:31,392
What else have you seen?

769
00:48:31,427 --> 00:48:33,393
Only one thing
that matters...

770
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:35,529
You.

771
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:48,241
<i>I never liked
the skinny ones.</i>

772
00:48:48,276 --> 00:48:50,142
<i>Like drinking from a puddle.</i>

773
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,978
Not that I'm averse
to drinking from a puddle

774
00:48:52,011 --> 00:48:53,312
every now and again,
you understand.

775
00:48:53,346 --> 00:48:55,347
I don't drink ale.

776
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:58,084
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

777
00:48:58,118 --> 00:48:59,851
- Yeah!
- You see?

778
00:48:59,886 --> 00:49:02,121
They've all suffered through
my bouts of sobriety.

779
00:49:02,155 --> 00:49:04,456
It's very tedious
for all concerned.

780
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,957
Now, how did
three children...

781
00:49:06,992 --> 00:49:08,527
We're not children.

782
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:11,295
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

783
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:13,898
untrained in the art of war,

784
00:49:13,932 --> 00:49:15,566
escape from Harrenhal?

785
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:19,902
Gendry's a smith.

786
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:21,605
He was apprenticed
in the armory.

787
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:24,941
A smith, eh?
Where'd you train?

788
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:30,913
King's Landing.
Tobho Mott's shop.

789
00:49:30,947 --> 00:49:33,081
That criminal.
He charges twice as much

790
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:34,583
as every other armorer
in the city.

791
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:36,251
That's because
he's twice as good.

792
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,653
Aha! A smith
and a salesman.

793
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,923
Gendry stole us weapons.

794
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:44,792
Ah, fought your way
out of Harrenhal, I see.

795
00:49:44,826 --> 00:49:48,362
He knows how to use a
sword and so do I.

796
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,898
My brothers taught me.

797
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:58,537
Ooh!

798
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:16,252
To your brothers!

799
00:50:22,558 --> 00:50:25,126
You can finish
your meals before you go.

800
00:50:25,161 --> 00:50:27,595
It may be awhile
before you see another.

801
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:30,664
- You'll free us?
- I gave you my word.

802
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:35,168
But before you go,

803
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:38,469
allow me to raise
a cup to your...

804
00:50:38,504 --> 00:50:41,072
Hey, hey.

805
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:43,807
Now that is an uncommonly
large person.

806
00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:45,376
How does one manage to subdue

807
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,177
such an uncommonly
large person?

808
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,912
One waits for him to drink
until he passes out.

809
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:52,747
Poor man.
You have my sympathy.

810
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,052
Aha, not a man at all.

811
00:50:59,187 --> 00:51:02,155
A Hound!

812
00:51:02,223 --> 00:51:04,791
So good to see
you again, Clegane.

813
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,792
Thoros?

814
00:51:06,827 --> 00:51:09,228
The fuck you doing here?

815
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:11,163
Drinking and talking too much.

816
00:51:11,198 --> 00:51:13,198
Same as ever.

817
00:51:13,232 --> 00:51:16,735
- A pretty prize, lads.
- Yeah!

818
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:20,405
Girl.

819
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:23,942
What in seven hells

820
00:51:23,976 --> 00:51:26,444
are you doing
with the Stark bitch?

821
00:51:37,489 --> 00:51:40,057
It's a tough decision...

822
00:51:40,091 --> 00:51:42,093
Take the bridge
and risk being seen

823
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:44,028
or cross the great water.

824
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:46,629
- Silence, Kingslayer.
- Anyone can see us on the bridge,

825
00:51:46,663 --> 00:51:49,666
but cross by water
and the current could take us

826
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,667
or I could escape
down the river.

827
00:51:51,702 --> 00:51:53,568
Good luck.

828
00:51:55,538 --> 00:51:59,573
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

829
00:51:59,608 --> 00:52:01,743
Which will she choose?

830
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:08,616
Gambler at heart.

831
00:52:08,651 --> 00:52:10,084
Wouldn't have guessed.

832
00:52:10,118 --> 00:52:12,252
Be quick about it.

833
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,761
- I need to rest.
- Get up.

834
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:23,229
I have these, you know, on your
feet when you walk too far.

835
00:52:23,263 --> 00:52:24,430
- What do you call them?
- Get up now.

836
00:52:24,464 --> 00:52:26,965
Corns. I never
used to get corns.

837
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:29,333
<i>Of course I used
to ride everywhere,</i>

838
00:52:29,368 --> 00:52:31,836
not march around
like a common foot soldier

839
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:34,104
wearing the same shit boots
for over a year.

840
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:36,539
This heel is ruined.
There's no way...

841
00:52:44,646 --> 00:52:48,283
I never understood why some knights
felt the need to carry two swords.

842
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:05,364
Ooh.

843
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:11,135
You move well...

844
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:16,138
for a great beast of a woman.

845
00:53:20,074 --> 00:53:22,143
You shouldn't grimace
before you lunge.

846
00:53:22,177 --> 00:53:24,677
It gives away the game.

847
00:53:38,223 --> 00:53:40,524
<i>Bit of a quandary for you.</i>

848
00:53:40,558 --> 00:53:43,427
If you kill me,
you fail Lady Stark.

849
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:46,062
<i>But if you don't kill me,</i>

850
00:53:46,096 --> 00:53:48,399
I'm going to kill you.

851
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,105
You're good.

852
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,341
Graceless, but good.

853
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,617
See? If you were
willing to hurt me,

854
00:54:09,651 --> 00:54:11,452
you might have had me there.

855
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,594
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

856
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,662
if you can call that a woman.

857
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,765
We enjoy a good fight.

858
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,066
Gets our juices flowing.

859
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,968
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.

860
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:08,904
A bit gruesome for my taste.

861
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:12,640
- You sure he's the one?
- That's him, all right.

862
00:55:12,674 --> 00:55:14,475
I saw him fight at the tourney

863
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,476
for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

864
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:20,714
Give the man his silver.

865
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:24,483
Let us go and my father will
pay you whatever you want.

866
00:55:24,518 --> 00:55:26,785
Enough to buy me a new head?

867
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:30,188
<i>If the King in the North
hears I had the Kingslayer</i>

868
00:55:30,222 --> 00:55:33,090
and let him go,
he'll be taking it right off.

869
00:55:33,124 --> 00:55:35,260
I'd rather he takes yours.

870
