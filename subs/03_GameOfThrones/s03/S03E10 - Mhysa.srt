1
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:31,189
Yah! Yah!

2
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:45,168
<i>- Go, move out!
- The King in the North!</i>

3
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:48,371
<i>The King in the North!</i>

4
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,606
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

5
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:53,008
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

6
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,446
Here comes the
King in the North!

7
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:58,714
Here
comes the King in the North!

8
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:00,683
<i>The King in the North!
The King in the North!</i>

9
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:04,854
Here comes...

10
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:33,968
Hmm.

11
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,684
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

12
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:39,218
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

13
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,820
What are you doing?

14
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,722
I have a list.

15
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,791
A list of people
you mean to kill?

16
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,092
For laughing at me?

17
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,227
Do I look like Joffrey to you?

18
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,196
No, death seems a bit extreme.

19
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,264
Fear of death,
on the other hand...

20
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,900
You should learn
to ignore them.

21
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,067
My lady, people have
been laughing at me

22
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,936
far longer than they've
been laughing at you.

23
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,905
I'm the Halfman,

24
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,974
the Demon Monkey, the Imp.

25
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,542
You're a Lannister.

26
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,112
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

27
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,815
The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.

28
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,516
We're perfect for each other.

29
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:17,421
So how should we punish them?

30
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:19,023
Who? Whom?

31
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:22,126
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

32
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,794
Ah.

33
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:27,296
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

34
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:30,800
Anyone named Desmond
Crakehall must be a pervert.

35
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:33,236
I hear that you're a pervert.

36
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:34,571
I am the Imp.

37
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:36,339
I have certain standards
to maintain.

38
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:42,145
We could sheep shift
Lord Desmond's bed.

39
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:44,713
You cut a little hole
in his mattress

40
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,481
and you stuff
sheep dung inside.

41
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:49,484
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

42
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:52,036
His room will stink, but he won't
know where it's coming from.

43
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:53,571
Lady Sansa!

44
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:56,040
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

45
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,575
And she was always
angry with me.

46
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:00,577
Why sheep <i>shift?</i>

47
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:04,113
That's the vulgar word
for dung.

48
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:06,082
My lady...

49
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,417
Well, you asked me.

50
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:08,818
Oh!

51
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:10,687
That's him!

52
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:13,557
My lord, my lady.

53
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:15,891
Your father has called
a meeting of the small council.

54
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:26,302
Killed a few puppies today?

55
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:28,270
Show him.

56
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:30,538
Come on, show him.

57
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:37,545
Oh, apologies, my lord.

58
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,780
Old fingers.

59
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:50,691
"Roslin caught
a fine fat trout.

60
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:54,728
<i>Her brothers gave her a pair
of wolf pelts for her wedding.</i>

61
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,831
<i>Signed Walder Frey."</i>

62
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:01,301
Is that bad poetry

63
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,402
or is it supposed
to mean something?

64
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:05,271
Robb Stark is dead.

65
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:08,874
<i>And his bitch mother.</i>

66
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,477
Write back to Lord Frey.

67
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:14,179
<i>Thank him for his service
and command him</i>

68
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,949
to send Robb Stark's head.

69
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,184
I'm going to serve it to
Sansa at my wedding feast.

70
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:23,688
Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

71
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:26,258
A joke.
Joffrey did not mean it.

72
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,859
Yes, I did.

73
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,828
I'm going to have it served
to Sansa at my wedding feast.

74
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:32,397
<i>No.</i>

75
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:35,360
She is no longer
yours to torment.

76
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:39,036
Everyone is mine to torment.

77
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:43,039
You'd do well to remember
that, you little monster.

78
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,908
Oh, I'm a monster.

79
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:48,445
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

80
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:50,713
<i>Monsters are dangerous</i>

81
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:55,117
and just now kings
are dying like flies.

82
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,394
I could have your tongue out

83
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:05,928
<i>for saying that.</i>

84
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:08,863
Let him make his threats.

85
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:11,866
Hmm? He's a bitter
little man.

86
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:15,069
Lord Tyrion should
apologize immediately.

87
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,173
Unacceptable, disrespectful,

88
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:20,309
<i>and in very bad taste.</i>

89
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,177
I am the king!

90
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:24,679
I will punish you.

91
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,281
Any man who must say,
"I am the king"

92
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:29,950
is no true king.

93
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,885
I'll make sure
you understand that

94
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,454
when I've won your war for you.

95
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:36,156
My father won the real war.

96
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:39,258
He killed Prince Rhaegar.
He took the crown

97
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,328
while you hid
under Casterly Rock!

98
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,675
The king is tired.

99
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,877
See him to his chambers.

100
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,146
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

101
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,882
We have so much to celebrate.

102
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:07,252
A wedding to plan.
You must rest.

103
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,856
Grand Maester, perhaps
some essence of nightshade

104
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:14,325
to help him sleep.

105
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:18,062
I'm not tired!

106
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,498
Come.

107
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:43,719
Not you.

108
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,061
You just sent the most
powerful man in Westeros

109
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:55,431
to bed without his supper.

110
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:59,033
You're a fool if you believe he's
the most powerful man in Westeros.

111
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:02,003
A treasonous statement.
Joffrey is king.

112
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:05,306
You really think a crown
gives you power?

113
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,643
No.

114
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:11,479
I think armies give you power.

115
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,315
- Mm-hmm.
- Robb Stark had one,

116
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:16,283
never lost a battle,

117
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:18,552
and you defeated him
all the same.

118
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:21,755
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I know.

119
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:24,658
Walder Frey
gets all the credit.

120
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,660
Or the blame, I suppose,

121
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:28,829
depending on your allegiance.

122
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,831
<i>Walder Frey is many things,</i>

123
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,966
but a brave man?

124
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,634
No.

125
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,738
He never would have
risked such an action

126
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:41,273
if he didn't have
certain assurances.

127
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:44,043
Which he got from me.

128
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:45,978
Do you disapprove?

129
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:47,979
<i>I'm all for cheating.
This is war.</i>

130
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,148
But to slaughter them
at a wedding...

131
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:52,984
Explain to me
why it is more noble

132
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:55,086
to kill 10,000 men in battle

133
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:56,421
than a dozen at dinner.

134
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,457
So that's why you did it?

135
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,058
To save lives?

136
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,193
To end the war.
To protect the family.

137
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:06,096
<i>Do you want to write a song
for the dead Starks?</i>

138
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:08,966
Go ahead, write one.

139
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:12,436
<i>I'm in this world
a little while longer</i>

140
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:16,273
to defend the Lannisters,
to defend my blood.

141
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:18,942
The northerners
will never forget.

142
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:20,343
Good.

143
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:22,078
Let them remember what happens

144
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,713
when they march on the south.

145
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:29,185
All the Stark men are dead.

146
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:32,021
Winterfell is a ruin.

147
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:35,958
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden of the North

148
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:41,263
until your son by Sansa
comes of age.

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:47,735
I believe you still have some
work to do on that score.

150
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:51,973
Do you think she'll open
her legs for me

151
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:55,409
after I tell her how we murdered
her mother and brother?

152
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,779
One way or another, you will
get that girl pregnant.

153
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,581
I will not rape her.

154
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:05,753
Shall I explain to you in one
easy lesson how the world works?

155
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:08,788
Use small words.
I'm not as bright as you.

156
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:11,958
The house that puts family
first will always defeat

157
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,394
the house that puts
the whims and wishes

158
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:17,664
<i>of its sons
and daughters first.</i>

159
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:20,099
A good man does
everything in his power

160
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,268
to better his family's position

161
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:27,139
regardless of his own
selfish desires.

162
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,044
Does that amuse you?

163
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,946
No, it's a very good lesson.

164
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:38,282
Only it's easy for you to
preach utter devotion to family

165
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:40,885
when you're making
all the decisions.

166
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:42,720
Easy for me, is it?

167
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:46,123
When have you ever done something
that wasn't in your interest

168
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:48,492
but solely for the benefit
of the family?

169
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:51,627
The day that you were born.

170
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,634
I wanted to carry you
into the sea

171
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:00,303
and let the waves
wash you away.

172
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:05,107
Instead, I let you live.

173
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:08,677
And I brought you up as my son.

174
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,483
Because you're a Lannister.

175
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,799
Sansa.

176
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,161
It's empty.

177
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:04,096
Let's find a place to sleep.

178
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,807
Hodor.

179
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,443
Hodor.

180
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:21,446
Don't, Hodor.

181
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:27,694
Maybe we shouldn't stay.

182
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:30,364
You'd rather be out there?

183
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:33,600
There are a lot of stories
about this place.

184
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,070
Horrible stories.

185
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:38,238
I always quite liked
the horrible stories.

186
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:40,193
So did I.

187
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,675
Once.

188
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:46,645
You ever heard
about the Rat Cook?

189
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:48,881
No.
Who's he?

190
00:13:48,882 --> 00:13:52,151
Just a cook
in the Night's Watch.

191
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:54,620
He was angry at the king
for something,

192
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,555
I don't remember.

193
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:59,358
When the king was visiting
the Nightfort,

194
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,826
the cook killed the king's son,

195
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:03,761
cooked him into a big pie

196
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:07,366
with onions, carrots,
mushrooms and bacon.

197
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:11,370
That night he served
the pie to the king.

198
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:14,105
He liked the taste
of his son so much,

199
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:16,807
he asked for a second slice.

200
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,745
The gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

201
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:24,081
<i>who could only eat
his own young.</i>

202
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:27,485
<i>He's been roaming
the Nightfort ever since,</i>

203
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:30,085
<i>devouring his own babies.</i>

204
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,990
But no matter what he does,

205
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,992
he's always hungry.

206
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,262
If the gods turned every killer

207
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:40,596
into a giant white rat...

208
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:42,965
It wasn't for murder
the gods cursed the Rat Cook

209
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,334
<i>or for serving
the king's son in a pie.</i>

210
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:47,702
He killed a guest
beneath his roof.

211
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,407
That's something
the gods can't forgive.

212
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:03,351
"The late Walder Frey,"
old Tully called me

213
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:07,155
because I didn't get my men to
the Trident in time for battle.

214
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,524
<i>He thought he was witty.</i>

215
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,759
<i>Look at us now, Tully.</i>

216
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,795
<i>You're dead,
your daughter's dead,</i>

217
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:16,397
your grandson's dead,

218
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,599
your son spent his wedding
night in a dungeon

219
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,436
and I'm Lord of Riverrun.

220
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,406
The Blackfish escaped.

221
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,842
An old man on the run

222
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:32,312
<i>with no allies.</i>

223
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:34,346
I have Tywin Lannister
backing me.

224
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:37,383
- Who does he have?
- As you say.

225
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:39,051
<i>They all laughed at me,</i>

226
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:41,019
all those high lords.

227
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,022
They all thought
they were better than me.

228
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,792
Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.

229
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:50,328
People snigger
when I marry a young girl,

230
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,831
but who said a word when Jon Arryn
married the little Tully bitch?

231
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:55,900
You'll be needing
a new young girl.

232
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:58,035
Yeah.

233
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:01,005
Got that to look forward to.

234
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:03,575
<i>And you,</i>

235
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,742
the Warden of the North.

236
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:09,113
<i>No more Starks
to bow and scrape to.</i>

237
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:10,814
Must have been torture

238
00:16:10,815 --> 00:16:12,916
following that stupid boy
all over the country.

239
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:16,019
He ignored my advice
at every turn.

240
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,188
If he'd been a trifle
less arrogant...

241
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:20,724
Calling himself the Young Wolf.

242
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:22,492
How's that for pomposity?

243
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:27,396
Well, here's to the Young Wolf!

244
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:30,166
Forever young.

245
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:38,507
Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

246
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:41,109
At some point perhaps.

247
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,278
But Winterfell's in ruins.

248
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,148
Yeah.

249
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:47,949
What happened up there?

250
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,019
I heard the Greyjoy boy
seized the place.

251
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,621
I heard he killed
all the ravens.

252
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:56,056
And after that, nothing.

253
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,059
I sent my bastard Ramsay
to root him out.

254
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,663
Robb Stark offered
amnesty for the ironborn

255
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:04,532
if they gave us Theon.

256
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,500
Oh. And?

257
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,135
<i>Ramsay delivered the terms.</i>

258
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:12,305
The ironborn turned on Theon
as we knew they would.

259
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:15,508
<i>They handed him over
trussed and hooded.</i>

260
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:19,612
<i>But Ramsay... well...</i>

261
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:22,515
<i>Ramsay has his own way
of doing things.</i>

262
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:25,184
Well, the girls weren't lying.

263
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:27,385
You had
a good-sized cock.

264
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:37,262
What?

265
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,964
No.

266
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,401
Pork sausage.

267
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:46,069
You think I'm some
sort of savage?

268
00:17:57,182 --> 00:18:00,717
People talk about
phantom limbs.

269
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:04,153
<i>An amputee might have an itch
where his foot used to be.</i>

270
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:06,856
<i>So I've always wondered...</i>

271
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:13,329
do eunuchs have a phantom cock?

272
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:17,065
<i>Next time you think
about naked girls,</i>

273
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,935
would you feel an itch?

274
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,877
Sorry.

275
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:32,813
I shouldn't make jokes.

276
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:37,384
My mother taught me not
to throw stones at cripples.

277
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:44,225
But my father taught me
to aim for their head.

278
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:46,293
Kill me.

279
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:48,528
Sorry, what?

280
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:51,665
Kill me.

281
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,635
A little louder.

282
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:58,004
Kill me!

283
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,674
You're no good to me dead.

284
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,409
We need you.

285
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,865
You don't look like
a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

286
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,435
That's a name for a lord.

287
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,438
But you're not a lord,

288
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,640
are you?

289
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,610
You're just meat.

290
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:45,015
Stinking meat.

291
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,553
You reek.

292
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:53,356
Reek!

293
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,858
That's a good name for you.

294
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,395
What's your name?

295
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:01,931
Theon Greyjoy.

296
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:09,104
What's your name?

297
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:12,708
Th...

298
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:15,476
Theon Greyjoy.

299
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:23,451
Please.

300
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:28,756
What is your name?!

301
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,759
Reek.

302
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:36,630
My name is...

303
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:40,566
Reek.

304
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:09,927
Hodor.

305
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:42,190
- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?

306
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:44,927
- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?!

307
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,863
Gilly.
Don't hurt us.

308
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:49,664
Where are you going?

309
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:53,200
To Castle Black. I'm a brother
of the Night's Watch.

310
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,570
- My brother, he's in the Night's...
- Shush.

311
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:57,338
- Who's your brother?
- Doesn't matter.

312
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:08,715
You're Jon's brother.

313
00:22:08,716 --> 00:22:10,684
<i>The one who fell
from the window.</i>

314
00:22:10,685 --> 00:22:12,853
No, I'm not.

315
00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:17,424
I've been around Ghost enough to
know a direwolf when I see one.

316
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:19,593
And I've heard all about Hodor.

317
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,761
Hodor.

318
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:26,599
I'd be dead
if it wasn't for Jon.

319
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,668
If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.

320
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:31,036
And anything I can do
to help you, I will.

321
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:33,705
Take us north of the Wall.

322
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:40,078
What?

323
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,046
Why in the world
would you want to go...

324
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:44,415
I don't want to.
I have to.

325
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,810
How did you get
through the Wall?

326
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:49,153
Does the well lead to an underground river?
Is that how you came here?

327
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:51,623
Come with us.

328
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:55,246
There are steps carved into
the south side of the Wall.

329
00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:57,027
Hodor can carry you to the top.

330
00:22:57,028 --> 00:22:59,229
We'll walk straight
to Castle Black.

331
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,700
Come with us. There's
nothing north but death.

332
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:05,002
<i>If Jon is alive,</i>

333
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:06,804
<i>then Castle Black's
where he'll be.</i>

334
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:08,772
It's the safest place for you.

335
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:11,440
There's nowhere safe any longer.
You know that.

336
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:15,011
What I know is what I saw.

337
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:16,946
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

338
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:20,783
You saw the white walkers
and the army of the dead.

339
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:22,952
How do you know all that?

340
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:25,554
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

341
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:29,457
The kings of Westeros and all
their armies can't stop them.

342
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,335
But you're going to stop them?

343
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,070
Please, Sam.

344
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,405
<i>I have to go north.</i>

345
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,843
I have to.

346
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:19,772
"Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands"

347
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:22,041
and invader of the North.

348
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,076
I give you until the full moon

349
00:24:24,077 --> 00:24:27,279
to order all ironborn scum
out of the North

350
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,448
<i>and back to those
shit-stained rocks</i>

351
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,650
<i>you call a home.</i>

352
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:35,453
<i>On the first night
of the full moon,</i>

353
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:38,056
<i>I will hunt down every islander</i>

354
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:42,627
still in our lands
and flay them living

355
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:46,129
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

356
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,931
I found at Winterfell.

357
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:51,868
<i>In the box you'll find
a special gift...</i>

358
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,739
Theon's favorite toy.

359
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,376
He cried when I took it
away from him.

360
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:23,498
Leave the North now
or more boxes will follow

361
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:26,067
with more Theon.

362
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,436
Signed Ramsay Snow,

363
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:30,105
natural-born son
of Roose Bolton,

364
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:33,374
"Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

365
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,578
Get that out of my sight.

366
00:25:43,885 --> 00:25:47,854
Theon disobeyed my orders.

367
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:53,725
The boy is a fool.

368
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:59,398
He cannot further
the Greyjoy line.

369
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,836
I will not give up
the lands I have seized,

370
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:06,038
the strongholds I have taken.

371
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:08,106
Get this away from me.

372
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:10,275
He's your son.

373
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:13,145
Son?

374
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:15,947
He's not a man anymore.

375
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:17,549
He's your son.

376
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,019
He's my brother.

377
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,319
He's a Greyjoy.

378
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,588
Watch yourself.

379
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:27,224
I've made my decision.

380
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:34,298
And I've made mine.

381
00:26:36,902 --> 00:26:40,470
I'm going to pick the
fastest ship in our fleet.

382
00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:45,809
<i>I'm going to choose the 50 best
killers on the Iron Islands.</i>

383
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,277
Get those ropes!

384
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:50,346
<i>I'm going to
sail up the Narrow Sea</i>

385
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:52,982
<i>all the way
to the Weeping Water.</i>

386
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:57,052
<i>I'm going to march
on the Dreadfort.</i>

387
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:59,822
<i>I'm going to find
my little brother</i>

388
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:03,025
<i>and I'm going
to bring him home.</i>

389
00:27:08,364 --> 00:27:10,031
What is it?

390
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:11,565
Dragonglass.

391
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:13,400
We found them at the Fist.

392
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:17,004
Someone buried them
a long time ago.

393
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:19,207
Someone wanted us to find them.

394
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:23,344
Why?
What are they for?

395
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,249
Killing white walkers.

396
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,751
How do you know that?

397
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:33,686
<i>The walker
came for my baby.</i>

398
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:35,822
And Sam...

399
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:39,059
But no one's killed a white
walker in thousands of years.

400
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,062
Well, I suppose someone
had to be the first.

401
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:45,564
Take it, Hodor.

402
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,106
And the archer.

403
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,913
I got lucky

404
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:04,182
with one of them.

405
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,117
There are more.

406
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,420
<i>Many more.</i>

407
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,956
And for every one of them,

408
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,524
the dead men,

409
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:16,726
more than you could count.

410
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,166
I wish you'd come with us.

411
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,934
I wish I could.

412
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,638
I really do.

413
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:18,551
How are you keeping?

414
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:20,386
Great.

415
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:21,855
Never better.

416
00:29:21,856 --> 00:29:24,757
It was just a bit of blood.

417
00:29:25,326 --> 00:29:27,293
I should have known.

418
00:29:27,294 --> 00:29:30,229
Every time a highborn
asks my name, it's trouble.

419
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:32,765
We're not really people
to you, are we?

420
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:34,599
Just a million different ways
to get what you want.

421
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,302
- I'm not a highborn.
- She called you Ser.

422
00:29:37,303 --> 00:29:39,471
I heard it.

423
00:29:40,974 --> 00:29:44,008
A recent state of affairs.

424
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,748
I was born in Flea Bottom
just like you.

425
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:52,950
Sure, you were.

426
00:29:52,951 --> 00:29:54,685
You're my friend.
You're here to help.

427
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:56,754
I lived below
the Street of Flour.

428
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,189
<i>How far below?</i>

429
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,658
How close to the
Red Keep were you?

430
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,262
The shit that poured
from their privy pipes

431
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:08,031
<i>flowed down the side
of Aegon's Hill</i>

432
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:12,102
along Tanner's Row and right
in front of my front door

433
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:14,537
- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

434
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:18,909
The Street of Steel,

435
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,244
with your armor and your knights?
Pfft.

436
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:24,979
You lived in the fancy
part of town.

437
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:31,553
And here we are now.

438
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:35,157
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

439
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:37,892
Yeah, we've come a long way.

440
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:40,895
We're all the same, really.

441
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,898
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

442
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:46,301
If you mistrust
fancy people so much,

443
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:49,737
why were you in such a
hurry to trust her?

444
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:53,241
You're me.

445
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:54,607
Never been with a woman.

446
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:57,477
<i>Never talked
to a woman, really.</i>

447
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:59,079
<i>And then she
comes at you...</i>

448
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,215
Big words, no clothes.

449
00:31:02,216 --> 00:31:04,284
What would you have done?

450
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:09,323
She does know her way around a
man's head, I'll give her that.

451
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:17,663
So how'd you become a lord?

452
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,365
Oh, that's a long story.

453
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:22,768
Better not, then.
I'm a bit busy.

454
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:27,672
Many years ago
I helped King Stannis

455
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:30,141
out of a difficult situation.

456
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:33,544
He rewarded me with a lordship.

457
00:31:33,545 --> 00:31:36,112
And this.

458
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:39,950
You see?

459
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:42,419
Highborns.

460
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:48,225
I didn't want to be a lord.

461
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:50,026
I nearly didn't accept.

462
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,527
Why did you?

463
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:54,530
I did it for my son.

464
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:57,000
I didn't want him to step
over a river of shit

465
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:59,802
every time he stepped
through his front door.

466
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:03,539
I wanted him to have
a better life.

467
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,141
Does he?

468
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:10,077
He's dead.

469
00:32:15,385 --> 00:32:17,118
How'd he die?

470
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,488
Following me.

471
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:34,768
When did you come
to this strange country?

472
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:37,704
When I was 13.

473
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,972
You were only a child.

474
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:43,243
I stopped being a child
when I was nine.

475
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:46,346
My mother made sure of that.

476
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:49,574
You've been a good influence

477
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:51,809
on our mutual friend, you know.

478
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,911
He used to drink
from sundown to sunup,

479
00:32:53,912 --> 00:32:55,613
visit three brothels a night,

480
00:32:55,614 --> 00:32:58,182
gamble away his father's money.

481
00:32:58,183 --> 00:33:00,150
Now it's just the drinking.

482
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:03,553
And now I'm his wife's servant.

483
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:05,522
I brush her hair
and clip her nails

484
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:07,023
and empty her chamber pot.

485
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:08,525
She is a sweet young thing.

486
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:10,026
None of this is her fault.

487
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:12,996
I love that girl.
I would kill for her.

488
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:14,964
Do you think that
makes it easier for me?

489
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:18,333
No, I expect not.

490
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:23,872
She's young and she's
beautiful and highborn.

491
00:33:23,873 --> 00:33:25,675
We break bread with them,

492
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:28,277
but that doesn't
make us family.

493
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:29,779
We've learned their language,

494
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,614
but we'll never be
their countrymen.

495
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:37,084
If you let yourself believe

496
00:33:37,085 --> 00:33:39,321
that a foreign girl
with no name

497
00:33:39,322 --> 00:33:41,690
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister...

498
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,492
- I have a name.
- You have one name.

499
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:46,060
As do I.

500
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:49,029
Here only the family
name matters.

501
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,632
What do you want
from me, Lord Varys?

502
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:56,770
Diamonds.

503
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:59,640
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

504
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:02,408
but you know how
to protect yourself.

505
00:34:03,077 --> 00:34:04,811
Get on one of those ships.

506
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:07,547
Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.

507
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:10,783
You can buy a house
with these diamonds,

508
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:12,785
a very large house.

509
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:14,654
Hire servants.

510
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:16,088
Start a new life,

511
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,558
a good life, far from here.

512
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,660
The mysterious foreign beauty.

513
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:23,662
You'll have suitors lining up.

514
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:25,997
Why do you want me to leave?

515
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:28,700
Tyrion Lannister is one
of the few people alive

516
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:30,802
who could make this country
a better place.

517
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,537
He has the mind for it,
he has the will,

518
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:34,005
he has the right last name.

519
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:36,106
And you...

520
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,576
You are a complication.

521
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,646
I know you love him.

522
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,717
And I know it's true love not
bought by gold and silver.

523
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,219
I'm not asking you
to leave him for money.

524
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,888
I'm asking you to leave

525
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,924
because your presence
in the capital

526
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:57,593
endangers him.

527
00:34:58,462 --> 00:35:00,897
This will never
be your home, my lady.

528
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:05,637
Find a true home
somewhere far from here...

529
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:08,636
while there's still time.

530
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:12,440
Lord Varys.

531
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:19,414
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

532
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:29,566
Keep up.

533
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:32,536
I don't think I can, my lord.

534
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,073
It's not easy
being drunk all the time.

535
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:41,244
Everyone would do it
if it were easy.

536
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,981
Leave.

537
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:58,027
So, enjoying married life?

538
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:05,268
An unhappy wife is a wine
merchant's best friend.

539
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,637
She doesn't deserve this.

540
00:36:07,638 --> 00:36:09,204
Deserve?

541
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:12,140
Be careful with that.

542
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:15,343
Start trying to work out
who deserves what

543
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:17,812
and before long you'll spend
the rest of your days

544
00:36:17,813 --> 00:36:21,082
weeping for each and every
person in the world.

545
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:24,719
There's nothing worse than a
late-blooming philosopher.

546
00:36:26,054 --> 00:36:28,389
Will you be facing
your marriage to Ser Loras

547
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,525
with the same
philosophical spirit?

548
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,059
I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

549
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,029
I seem to remember
saying something similar

550
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,031
about my own marriage.

551
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:40,601
You're not me.

552
00:36:41,536 --> 00:36:43,469
You want to make things
better for Sansa?

553
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,237
Give her a child.

554
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:47,173
So you can tell Father
it was you

555
00:36:47,174 --> 00:36:49,475
who finally talked me into it?

556
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:52,612
So she can have some
happiness in her life.

557
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:54,280
You have children.

558
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:57,750
How happy would
you say you are?

559
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,353
Not very.

560
00:37:05,113 --> 00:37:07,280
But if it weren't
for my children,

561
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:10,483
I'd have thrown myself from the
highest window in the Red Keep.

562
00:37:12,053 --> 00:37:14,621
They're the reason I'm alive.

563
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:16,989
Even Joffrey?

564
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:19,891
Even Joffrey.

565
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,698
He was all I had once.

566
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:28,667
Before Myrcella was born.

567
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:34,505
I used to spend hours

568
00:37:34,506 --> 00:37:36,975
looking at him.

569
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:39,377
His wisps of hair.

570
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:43,181
His tiny little hands and feet.

571
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:46,684
He was such
a jolly little fellow.

572
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,690
You always hear the terrible
ones were terrible babies.

573
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:55,492
"We should have known. Even
then we should have known."

574
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:57,894
It's nonsense.

575
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:02,232
Whenever he was with me,
he was happy.

576
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:07,636
And no one can take that
away from me,

577
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:09,438
not even Joffrey...

578
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:12,341
How it feels to have someone.

579
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:15,844
Someone of your own.

580
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:28,189
How long does it go on?

581
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:33,261
Until we've dealt
with all our enemies.

582
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,297
Every time we deal
with an enemy,

583
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:39,666
we create two more.

584
00:38:40,936 --> 00:38:44,571
Then I suppose it will go
on for quite a long time.

585
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:51,678
I'm telling you,
that's what she did.

586
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:56,983
<i>Sounded like a cow in heat.</i>

587
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:59,318
- Aye, not for long.
- That's right.

588
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,654
Black Walder shut
her up right quick.

589
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:04,891
<i>None of the Starks had much to
say about the end of that meal.</i>

590
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:06,459
I'll tell you what, though.

591
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,795
The hardest thing was getting that
wolf's head to stay on the body.

592
00:39:09,796 --> 00:39:12,330
- You sewed it on?
- I did.

593
00:39:12,331 --> 00:39:15,467
I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.

594
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:17,236
It was me.

595
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:20,205
And Malcolm and Talbott.

596
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:22,975
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

597
00:39:22,976 --> 00:39:24,575
Took the skin right with it.

598
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:27,578
<i>What we ended up having to do
was hook the needle</i>

599
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,180
<i>right under the collarbone.</i>

600
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:32,283
Give it a nice
firm mooring and...

601
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:36,587
What do you want?

602
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:39,890
- Mind if I keep warm?
- Fuck off.

603
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:42,292
But I'm hungry.

604
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:45,728
Does fuck off mean something
different where you're from?

605
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:48,164
I've got money.

606
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:53,970
What kind of coin is that?

607
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:56,105
It's worth a lot.

608
00:39:58,408 --> 00:39:59,775
Sorry.

609
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:02,077
Little shit.

610
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:08,516
<i>Fool!</i>

611
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:25,699
Where did you get the knife?

612
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
From you.

613
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:33,440
<i>Is that the first
man you've killed?</i>

614
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:35,842
The first man.

615
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:39,212
Next time you're going
to do something like that,

616
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:41,647
tell me first.

617
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,693
Valar morghulis.

618
00:41:24,522 --> 00:41:27,523
Ygritte, you know
I didn't have a choice.

619
00:41:30,427 --> 00:41:33,263
You always knew who I was,

620
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:35,398
what I am.

621
00:41:37,634 --> 00:41:40,603
I have to go home now.

622
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:45,106
I know you won't hurt me.

623
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:48,710
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

624
00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:54,816
I do know some things.

625
00:41:55,718 --> 00:41:57,652
I know I love you.

626
00:42:00,022 --> 00:42:02,656
<i>I know you love me.</i>

627
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:08,128
But I have to go home now.

628
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:51,235
I know how this must look.

629
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:56,740
- What I meant was...
- I swear to you, my lord...

630
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,277
I'm not a lord, my dear.

631
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:02,012
Not for many, many years.

632
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:05,382
<i>Every man who joins
the Night's Watch</i>

633
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:09,753
renounces all former titles.

634
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,657
Among other things.

635
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,194
What is your name?

636
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,895
Gilly.

637
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:23,232
Ah, for the gillyflower.

638
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,700
Lovely.

639
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:27,403
Yes, my...

640
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:31,106
Maester.

641
00:43:31,741 --> 00:43:33,042
Master.

642
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,576
Maester.

643
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:37,845
And the child?

644
00:43:38,981 --> 00:43:41,216
She hasn't chosen a name yet.

645
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:43,818
His name is Sam.

646
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:49,157
Tarly...

647
00:43:49,158 --> 00:43:52,659
do you remember
the oath you swore

648
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,262
when you joined this order?

649
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,732
He's not my child,
Maester Aemon.

650
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,968
She's one of Craster's wives.

651
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,343
I remember every word
of the oath.

652
00:44:11,145 --> 00:44:13,712
Night gathers
and my watch begins.

653
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:18,016
<i>I am the shield that
guards the realms of men.</i>

654
00:44:19,753 --> 00:44:22,654
The realms of men.

655
00:44:24,223 --> 00:44:27,059
That means her as well as us.

656
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,462
We didn't build
500 miles of ice walls,

657
00:44:30,463 --> 00:44:33,465
700 feet high to keep out men.

658
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:37,536
The night is gathering,
Maester Aemon.

659
00:44:37,537 --> 00:44:39,603
I've seen it.

660
00:44:39,604 --> 00:44:42,439
It's coming for all of us.

661
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:47,945
Gilly, you and your son

662
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:51,048
will be our guests
for the time being.

663
00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:55,985
We certainly cannot
send you back

664
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,987
beyond the Wall.

665
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:00,523
Thank you...

666
00:45:00,524 --> 00:45:02,825
Maester.

667
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:05,027
I can cook and clean
and I can...

668
00:45:05,028 --> 00:45:06,729
Good.

669
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:11,566
Samwell, fetch a quill
and inkwell.

670
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:19,007
I hope your penmanship is
better than your swordplay.

671
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:21,410
Miles better.

672
00:45:22,778 --> 00:45:26,614
We had 44 ravens at last count.

673
00:45:26,615 --> 00:45:30,218
Make sure they're all fed.

674
00:45:30,219 --> 00:45:33,788
Every one of them
flies tonight.

675
00:45:42,463 --> 00:45:44,964
"To His Grace"

676
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:47,967
King Stannis Baratheon.

677
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:52,139
Invaded... inv...
Invit... invited

678
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,942
to the name day celebration

679
00:45:55,943 --> 00:46:01,280
for Rylene Florent

680
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:03,549
"on the first night... "

681
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,484
Night.

682
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:07,853
"First night
of the full moon."

683
00:46:07,854 --> 00:46:09,288
Why is there a G in night?

684
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:11,657
I don't know.
There just is.

685
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,926
Well, your father's
not going to go to that.

686
00:46:16,061 --> 00:46:18,596
My books are better
than these boring scrolls.

687
00:46:18,597 --> 00:46:20,632
You could read about
Balerion the Dread.

688
00:46:20,633 --> 00:46:24,169
They say you can still see his skull
in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.

689
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,504
I'd like to see that someday.

690
00:46:26,505 --> 00:46:29,840
I've been trying to stay out of
those dungeons my whole life.

691
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:33,777
"His fangs were as long
as bastard swords."

692
00:46:34,812 --> 00:46:36,880
Aye, old Balerion's
definitely better

693
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:39,949
than anything your cousin
Rylene's got on offer.

694
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,452
But now that I'm your
father's Hand again,

695
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:45,021
I have to keep him informed.

696
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:48,591
The king does not have
time for this drudgery.

697
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,330
"To all the lords
and nobble men of Westeros."

698
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:57,132
- Noblemen.
- <i>"Noblemen of Westeros,</i>

699
00:46:57,133 --> 00:47:01,937
the Nig...
The Night's Watch...

700
00:47:04,707 --> 00:47:06,808
"implores..."

701
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:08,476
What is it?

702
00:47:12,848 --> 00:47:14,782
Why are they ringing the bells?

703
00:47:14,783 --> 00:47:16,651
<i>Are we being attacked?</i>

704
00:47:16,652 --> 00:47:19,152
Stay here.

705
00:47:19,153 --> 00:47:21,588
Bar the door.

706
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:42,074
The usurper Robb Stark is dead.

707
00:47:42,075 --> 00:47:45,511
Betrayed by his bannerman.

708
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:49,349
And you take credit because you
dropped a leech into the fire?

709
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,982
I take no credit.

710
00:47:50,983 --> 00:47:54,318
<i>I have faith and my faith
has been rewarded.</i>

711
00:47:57,223 --> 00:48:01,526
Your Grace, the world
has got so far bent.

712
00:48:01,527 --> 00:48:04,463
I've seen things
crawl out of nightmares,

713
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,197
but my eyes were open.

714
00:48:06,198 --> 00:48:09,066
I don't know if Robb Stark died
because of the Red Woman's sorcery

715
00:48:09,067 --> 00:48:11,302
or because at war
men die all the time,

716
00:48:11,303 --> 00:48:14,505
but I do know that uniting
the Seven Kingdoms

717
00:48:14,506 --> 00:48:16,173
with blood magic is wrong.

718
00:48:16,174 --> 00:48:17,408
It is evil.

719
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:19,510
And you are not an evil man.

720
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:22,612
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

721
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:24,547
Aegon Targaryen.

722
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:27,216
And do you know how Aegon
Targaryen conquered Westeros?

723
00:48:27,217 --> 00:48:29,319
On the back of his dragon
Balerion the Dread.

724
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,256
He had a smaller fleet
than the kings he faced

725
00:48:33,257 --> 00:48:35,958
and a smaller army,
but he had three dragons.

726
00:48:35,959 --> 00:48:38,027
Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.

727
00:48:38,028 --> 00:48:41,863
My enemies have made
my kingdom bleed.

728
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,567
<i>I will not forget that.</i>

729
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:48,503
I will not forgive that.

730
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:52,574
I will punish them
with any arms

731
00:48:52,575 --> 00:48:53,875
at my disposal.

732
00:48:53,876 --> 00:48:56,744
You do not need
to burn the boy.

733
00:48:56,745 --> 00:49:00,080
<i>If what you say is true,</i>

734
00:49:00,081 --> 00:49:03,117
a drop of his blood
killed Robb Stark...

735
00:49:03,118 --> 00:49:06,253
And our king is still
no closer to the Iron Throne.

736
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:12,358
A great gift requires
a great sacrifice.

737
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:31,109
His name is Gendry.

738
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,045
He's a good lad.

739
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,981
A poor lad from Flea Bottom

740
00:49:35,982 --> 00:49:38,951
who happens to be your nephew.

741
00:49:43,756 --> 00:49:47,759
What is the life of one bastard
boy against a kingdom?

742
00:49:49,228 --> 00:49:51,295
Everything.

743
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,431
The boy must die.

744
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:03,474
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

745
00:50:03,475 --> 00:50:06,343
Is this some kind of trick?

746
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:09,311
Yes, but not on you.

747
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:15,918
Aim for that star.
Don't stop.

748
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:18,187
There's bread and water.
Go slow with it.

749
00:50:18,188 --> 00:50:19,889
If you finish it off,

750
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:23,258
no matter how thirsty you get,

751
00:50:23,259 --> 00:50:25,226
don't drink seawater.

752
00:50:25,227 --> 00:50:27,262
I know not to drink seawater.

753
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:30,965
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

754
00:50:30,966 --> 00:50:33,735
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

755
00:50:33,736 --> 00:50:35,103
Where should I go?

756
00:50:35,104 --> 00:50:36,538
You must keep the coast
on your left side

757
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:38,106
until you reach King's Landing.

758
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:40,007
The gold cloaks
are looking for me.

759
00:50:40,008 --> 00:50:41,742
They were looking
for me for 20 years.

760
00:50:41,743 --> 00:50:43,677
- Do they know your face?
- No.

761
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:45,779
I'd worry more
about the Red Woman.

762
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:54,454
The other way.

763
00:50:58,692 --> 00:51:00,560
You ever been in a boat before?

764
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,128
No.

765
00:51:02,129 --> 00:51:03,496
You know how to swim?

766
00:51:03,497 --> 00:51:04,731
No.

767
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:06,198
Don't fall out.

768
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:09,001
Go on.

769
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,070
Why are you doing this?

770
00:51:12,071 --> 00:51:14,573
<i>Because it's right.</i>

771
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:16,742
And because I'm a slow learner.

772
00:51:19,111 --> 00:51:22,948
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

773
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:29,186
<i>Horse approaching!</i>

774
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:32,656
Halt! Halt!

775
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,975
Jon! Jon!

776
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,710
<i>Jon, it's us.</i>

777
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,312
I don't think he can see us.

778
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:03,051
Pyp?

779
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:05,287
Sam?

780
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,957
Hush, now.
You're home.

781
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,662
Carry him inside.
Gently.

782
00:52:38,686 --> 00:52:41,054
Out of the way.

783
00:52:41,055 --> 00:52:42,723
Step aside, country boy.

784
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:44,891
People working here.

785
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:32,102
Cersei.

786
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,520
You don't deny it?

787
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,822
No.

788
00:53:55,592 --> 00:53:57,693
I let him go.

789
00:53:57,694 --> 00:54:00,796
Your mercy
saved the boy's life.

790
00:54:00,797 --> 00:54:02,631
You feel good about that?

791
00:54:02,632 --> 00:54:04,032
Aye, I do.

792
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,568
<i>You saved one innocent.</i>

793
00:54:06,569 --> 00:54:10,604
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

794
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:15,943
There has got
to be another way.

795
00:54:15,944 --> 00:54:17,411
What other way?!

796
00:54:17,412 --> 00:54:19,246
Tell us about this other way.

797
00:54:19,247 --> 00:54:20,881
I don't know, Your Grace.

798
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,783
I can't see the future
in the fire.

799
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:30,356
Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.

800
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:33,927
I, Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

801
00:54:33,928 --> 00:54:36,395
First of My Name, Rightful King
of the Andals and the First Men,

802
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:38,331
- sentence you to die.
- I understand.

803
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:40,633
But since you haven't yet
unnamed me Hand of the King,

804
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:43,135
it is my duty
to advise you against it.

805
00:54:43,136 --> 00:54:46,071
- You're gonna need me.
- Take him away.

806
00:54:47,173 --> 00:54:49,241
Why am I gonna need you?

807
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:54,979
My king.

808
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,019
<i>It's from Maester
Aemon of the Night's Watch.</i>

809
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,820
<i>Their Lord Commander is dead.</i>

810
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:05,456
<i>Took a ranging party north
and never made it back.</i>

811
00:55:05,457 --> 00:55:07,759
One lad did, though.

812
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,427
What he saw
beyond the Wall...

813
00:55:10,428 --> 00:55:13,163
It's coming for all of us.

814
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,878
When did you learn to read?

815
00:55:28,879 --> 00:55:30,379
Matthos taught me
before he died

816
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,747
so I could be
of better service to you.

817
00:55:39,956 --> 00:55:43,757
This War of Five Kings
means nothing.

818
00:55:44,694 --> 00:55:48,296
<i>The true war lies
to the north, my king.</i>

819
00:55:49,098 --> 00:55:51,432
Death marches on the Wall.

820
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:54,102
Only you can stop him.

821
00:55:54,103 --> 00:55:56,204
You can't stop him alone.

822
00:55:56,205 --> 00:55:58,839
You need someone to rebuild
your army for you,

823
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,508
someone to convince this lord
and that lord to fight for you,

824
00:56:01,509 --> 00:56:03,610
to bring sellswords
and pirates to your side.

825
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:06,279
I've made my decision.

826
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:10,617
He's right.
You need him.

827
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:13,553
He has a part to play
in the war to come.

828
00:56:22,229 --> 00:56:24,731
You see, Ser Davos?

829
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:28,401
You've been saved by that
fire god you like to mock.

830
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:34,172
You're in his army now.

831
00:56:56,728 --> 00:56:59,263
They will come, Your Grace.

832
00:56:59,264 --> 00:57:01,165
When they're ready.

833
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:03,032
Perhaps they didn't
want to be conquered.

834
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:05,568
You didn't conquer them.

835
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:08,003
You liberated them.

836
00:57:08,806 --> 00:57:10,668
People learn to love
their chains.

837
00:58:12,933 --> 00:58:15,234
No.

838
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:55,204
- Mhysa!
- Mhysa!

839
00:58:55,205 --> 00:58:58,007
Mhysa! Mhysa!

840
00:58:58,008 --> 00:59:00,609
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

841
00:59:01,211 --> 00:59:03,312
What does it mean?

842
00:59:03,313 --> 00:59:06,249
It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi.

843
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,650
It means "mother."

844
00:59:13,956 --> 00:59:16,724
It's all right.

845
00:59:16,725 --> 00:59:18,726
These people won't hurt me.

846
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:23,898
Mhysa! Mhysa!

847
01:00:12,377 --> 01:00:15,846
Mhysa.

848
01:00:27,058 --> 01:00:29,959
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
