1
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:15,159
<i>Fall back!</i>

2
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:03,741
Brother?

3
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,657
Did you send the ravens?

4
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:35,064
Tarly, look at me.

5
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,734
Did you send the ravens?

6
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:45,273
<i>That was your job.</i>

7
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:48,076
Your only job.

8
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:59,254
We need to get
back to the Wall.

9
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:01,922
<i>It's a long march.</i>

10
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:04,691
<i>We know what's out there,</i>

11
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,495
but we have to make it,
have to warn them

12
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:11,365
or before winter's done,

13
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,567
everyone you've ever known

14
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,403
will be dead.

15
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:59,391
3x01
Valar Dohaeris

16
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:11,040
First time you've seen
a giant, Jon Snow?

17
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:16,679
Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.

18
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:22,318
When they stop being shy,
they get angry.

19
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:24,487
And when they're angry,

20
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,625
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

21
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:29,659
like a hammer on a nail.

22
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:41,971
<i>- Crow!
- Crow!</i>

23
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:45,107
<i>- Look over there!
- Crow!</i>

24
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,975
<i>Crow! Look over here!
Look!</i>

25
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,145
<i>Ah, look, crow coming!</i>

26
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,882
<i>Crow!</i>

27
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,285
You're wearing
the wrong color.

28
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,821
Mance was a ranger.

29
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:04,960
In your hearts, all you
crows want to fly free.

30
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:06,895
When I'm free,
will I be free to go?

31
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,930
- Crow!
- Crow!

32
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:09,264
Sure, you will.

33
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:12,499
Oh!

34
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:15,403
And I'll be free to kill you.

35
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:19,039
<i>Got no respect, this lot.</i>

36
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:22,243
Got no fathers to slap 'em
when they're foul.

37
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:24,613
What happened to their fathers?

38
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,882
Some of them were killed
by crows like you.

39
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:33,354
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

40
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:36,424
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

41
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,327
And if he don't...

42
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,550
I smell a crow.

43
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,785
We killed his friends.

44
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,620
Thought you'd want
to question this one.

45
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,758
What do we want
with a baby crow?

46
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:13,727
This baby killed
Qhorin Half hand.

47
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,964
<i>He wants to be one of us.</i>

48
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,672
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

49
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,109
Friends twice your size.

50
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:33,681
My father told me big men fall
just as quick as little ones

51
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:37,184
<i>if you put a sword
through their hearts.</i>

52
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:40,053
Plenty of little men

53
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,023
tried to put their swords
through my heart.

54
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:45,824
And there's plenty
of little skeletons

55
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,527
<i>buried in the woods.</i>

56
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:52,599
- <i>What's your name, boy?</i>
- Jon Snow.

57
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,807
Your Grace.

58
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,546
Your Grace?

59
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,247
Did you hear that?

60
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,349
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

61
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,786
Stand, boy.

62
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,925
We don't kneel for anyone
beyond the Wall.

63
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:26,799
So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.

64
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,967
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.

65
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,672
You can leave us.

66
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,980
The girl likes you.

67
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,184
You like her back, Snow?

68
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,586
That why you want to join us?

69
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,387
<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>

70
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,624
This isn't the damned
Night's Watch

71
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,860
where we make you
swear off girls.

72
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:56,563
This chicken eater you thought
was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

73
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:59,032
Can't believe this pup

74
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,367
<i>killed the Half hand.</i>

75
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,603
He was our enemy

76
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:06,505
and I'm glad he's dead.

77
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,983
He was my brother once.

78
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,686
Back when he had a whole hand.

79
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,223
What were you doing with him?

80
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,560
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Half hand for seasoning.

81
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,427
Why?

82
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:32,230
He wants me to lead one day.

83
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,733
But here you are, a traitor

84
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,235
kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

85
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:41,840
If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.

86
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:52,449
Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?

87
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:00,391
I want to be free.

88
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,561
No, I don't think so.

89
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,764
I think what you want
most of all

90
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,998
is to be a hero.

91
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:12,937
I'll ask you
one last time...

92
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:16,005
Why do you want to join us?

93
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:24,045
We stopped at Craster's
Keep on the way north.

94
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,950
I saw...

95
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:29,551
You saw what?

96
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:33,921
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

97
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:36,690
and leave it in the woods.

98
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:38,993
I saw what took it.

99
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,634
You're telling me
you saw one of them?

100
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:51,975
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

101
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:55,077
Because when I told
the Lord Commander,

102
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:57,112
he already knew.

103
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,716
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men

104
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,086
battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

105
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,090
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

106
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,361
Did I come to the right place?

107
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:21,901
We'll need to find you
a new cloak.

108
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:45,225
What if you took off
that bit there?

109
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:50,964
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

110
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:54,901
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

111
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,071
I want you to take it off.

112
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,246
Mouth.

113
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:17,019
Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.

114
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:20,891
I didn't hear that.

115
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,925
- Apologies, ser.
<i>- Back away.</i>

116
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,895
Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment.

117
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:29,565
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.

118
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,568
I will murder you, boy.

119
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:35,070
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

120
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,087
- Pod?
<i>- It's your sister.</i>

121
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:58,693
<i>The queen.</i>

122
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:12,740
<i>What are they doing here?</i>

123
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:15,943
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

124
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:18,812
No, I don't think so.

125
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,548
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think

126
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:23,251
I'd let a wooden door stop me?

127
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:30,759
They stay outside.

128
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:33,027
I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.

129
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:51,444
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

130
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:55,050
They said you'd lost your nose, but
it's not as gruesome as all that.

131
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:58,519
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

132
00:14:58,553 --> 00:15:00,921
I should hope so.

133
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:04,258
The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.

134
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,359
Thanks to Father.

135
00:15:06,394 --> 00:15:08,863
Thanks to Father.

136
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:12,466
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

137
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,036
No? Curious.

138
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,872
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

139
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:21,109
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

140
00:15:21,144 --> 00:15:24,111
Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.

141
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:27,449
You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

142
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:29,249
You're meeting Father today?

143
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:31,352
How do you know that?

144
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:34,223
<i>Because I have hundreds
of spies in my employ.</i>

145
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:37,758
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

146
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:42,396
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

147
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:44,064
What do I want from him?
He's my father.

148
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:46,600
Do I need to want something?

149
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:51,269
I'm sure he loves me dearly,

150
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,005
as any father loves his child,

151
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,707
his baby boy.

152
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:57,809
Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

153
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:59,478
<i>since arriving
in King's Landing.</i>

154
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:02,613
<i>I lay here,
my face split in half,</i>

155
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:05,183
but Father never came.

156
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:12,755
You're going to make me cry.

157
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:15,158
Why do you care
what I want from him?

158
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:18,662
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

159
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:20,929
Slandered?
When?

160
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,198
<i>You told him I had my guards</i>

161
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,100
beat that servant girl
at Casterly Rock.

162
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:26,968
<i>You did have
your guards beat her.</i>

163
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:28,236
A girl of nine, I believe.

164
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,071
<i>I was nine, too.</i>

165
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,139
She lost an eye,
if I remember correctly.

166
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:33,574
If I remember correctly,

167
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,842
she never stole
a necklace again.

168
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:40,448
It's not slander if it's true.

169
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:43,184
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

170
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,951
<i>Why are you so nervous</i>

171
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:47,221
<i>about what I'm going
to say to Father?</i>

172
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:49,323
Because you're a liar.

173
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:52,426
I expect you'll tell lies
about me, about Joffrey.

174
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,929
Any lies in particular?

175
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,100
You're a clever man,

176
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,403
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

177
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,473
Still makes me
more clever than you.

178
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:11,280
Oh, look at these two
shining warriors.

179
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:14,783
Ser Taryn Mant and...

180
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,551
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

181
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:17,953
Ser Meryn Trant.

182
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:20,522
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

183
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:23,158
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

184
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,626
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater

185
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,561
was anointed
by the king himself.

186
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,297
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat,

187
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:30,933
nothing more.

188
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,901
That's exactly who I am.

189
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:34,704
And you're a grub
in fancy armor

190
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:38,007
<i>who's better at beating little
girls than fighting men.</i>

191
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,810
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

192
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:43,680
You put your hand on that door,

193
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:46,315
you lose the hand.

194
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:04,833
As much as I appreciate a walk
in the sunshine, your lordship,

195
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:07,003
I am wondering
why you sent for me.

196
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:09,137
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

197
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,470
You're here to protect me.

198
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,707
I've been doing that
for a while now.

199
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:14,509
Do you grow bored
protecting me?

200
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,010
I grow poor protecting you.

201
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,944
Poor?
Poor?

202
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:20,046
Under my patronage
you've become a knight,

203
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:22,149
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

204
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,919
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you filled your pockets.

205
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:27,020
And now my pockets are empty.

206
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:29,390
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

207
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,426
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

208
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,793
you'll need to pay more.

209
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:35,295
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

210
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:38,099
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

211
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,899
I don't loan it out
to friends as a favor.

212
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:41,367
- How much?
- Double.

213
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:43,568
- Double?
- I'm a knight now.

214
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:45,038
Knights are worth double.

215
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:47,440
I don't even know how much
I'm paying you now.

216
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:49,541
Which means you can afford it.

217
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:30,112
Here. Here!

218
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,924
Help me!

219
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:04,882
Who are you?

220
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,622
I was in the battle
at Blackwater.

221
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:16,662
I was a captain and a knight.

222
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:20,567
Aye, ser,
and serving which king?

223
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,909
The one true king
of Westeros...

224
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:33,612
Stannis Baratheon.

225
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:44,790
I thought you were dead.

226
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:47,458
Everyone thought you were dead.

227
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:53,030
And your son?

228
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:01,205
He may have swam
ashore as you did.

229
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,275
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.

230
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:17,020
I'm so sorry, my friend.

231
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:19,589
I, too, have lost a son.

232
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:21,990
There is nothing worse
in this world.

233
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:26,895
But, Davos, you were
a good father.

234
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,465
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

235
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:35,068
Stannis lives?

236
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:37,304
He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

237
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,105
Will you take me there?

238
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,541
There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.

239
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:43,043
This war is not over.

240
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:44,410
Not for you, maybe.

241
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:47,179
But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.

242
00:21:47,213 --> 00:21:49,216
We're both sworn
to King Stannis.

243
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,718
I am sworn to no man.

244
00:21:51,752 --> 00:21:55,556
I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.

245
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,090
I delivered the ships.

246
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,293
Stannis never gives up.
Never.

247
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:01,729
- Now he will regroup...
- <i>He's a broken man.</i>

248
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:04,232
His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

249
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,900
They say he sees no one...

250
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,170
Not his generals,
not even his wife.

251
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:11,206
Only the Red Woman

252
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,607
whispering in his ear,

253
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:15,476
telling him what
she sees in the flames

254
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:17,145
and burning men alive.

255
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:18,612
What?

256
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:22,150
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

257
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:25,085
All those who spoke
against her she called

258
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,723
servants of darkness.

259
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:32,225
They say she sang
to them as they burned.

260
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:38,532
I'm a pirate.

261
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,867
<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

262
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,569
<i>Servants of darkness.</i>

263
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:45,873
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.

264
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:48,173
Take me back there, please.

265
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,108
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

266
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:52,778
Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.

267
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:54,412
You could try.

268
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:56,814
If you fail,
they will burn you.

269
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:59,719
If you succeed,
they'll burn you.

270
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:01,887
And you've only
just come back to life.

271
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:04,155
Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.

272
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:06,925
You call me friend. You drank
with me on my wedding day.

273
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,426
And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,

274
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:11,363
but I don't ask you for favors.

275
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:12,997
I have to stop her.

276
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:16,167
Please, do this for me.

277
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:21,373
When you are dead,

278
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:23,843
I will gather your bones
in a little sack

279
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:26,979
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

280
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:43,195
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

281
00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:45,997
There won't be a siege. The
Mountain can't defend a ruin.

282
00:23:46,031 --> 00:23:47,532
I imagine the Mountain
will defend

283
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:49,434
whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

284
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,636
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

285
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,371
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

286
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:57,209
I don't think
we're going to get one.

287
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:49,528
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

288
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:52,599
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

289
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:55,435
For them and for your sons.

290
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:57,636
Will it?

291
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,006
They rot in the ground

292
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,241
<i>while their killer runs free.</i>

293
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:05,209
The Kingslayer won't
remain free for long.

294
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:08,080
My best hunters are after him.

295
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:30,735
<i>- A Mallister?</i>
- Ser Jeremy.

296
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:33,304
My father's bannerman.

297
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:56,528
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

298
00:26:08,872 --> 00:26:10,242
<i>She's your mother.</i>

299
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,910
She freed Jaime Lannister.

300
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:15,313
The Lannisters robbed
them of their sons

301
00:26:15,347 --> 00:26:17,114
and she robbed them
of their justice.

302
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:20,417
<i>Water.</i>

303
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:24,254
Water.

304
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,523
This needs to be
cleaned and closed.

305
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:33,264
What's your name, friend?

306
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:35,167
Qyburn.

307
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:36,568
You're lucky to be alive.

308
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:42,308
Lucky?

309
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:10,271
The badge looks good on you.

310
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:14,742
Almost as good
as it looked on me.

311
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:20,114
Are you enjoying
your new position?

312
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:23,284
Am I enjoying it?

313
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:25,720
I was very happy
as Hand of the King.

314
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:27,787
Yes.

315
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:29,790
I heard how happy you were.

316
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:34,293
You brought a whore
into my bed.

317
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:36,928
It wasn't your bed at the time.

318
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,301
I sent you here
to advise the king.

319
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:46,371
I gave you real power
and authority.

320
00:27:46,405 --> 00:27:48,740
You chose to spend your days

321
00:27:48,774 --> 00:27:50,942
as you always have,

322
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:53,411
bedding harlots

323
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:55,812
and drinking with thieves.

324
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,342
Occasionally I drank
with the harlots.

325
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:02,178
What do you want, Tyrion?

326
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:05,228
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

327
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:08,164
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

328
00:28:08,198 --> 00:28:11,801
My beloved father who

329
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:14,931
somehow forgot to visit
his wounded son

330
00:28:15,051 --> 00:28:16,405
after he fell
on the battlefield.

331
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,009
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

332
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:23,045
I organized
the defense of this city

333
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:26,248
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

334
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:29,016
I led the foray when the
enemies were at the gate

335
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:31,318
while your grandson, the king,

336
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:33,987
quivered in fear
behind the walls.

337
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:37,624
I bled in the mud
for our family.

338
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,126
And as my reward,

339
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,497
I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

340
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:45,532
But what do I want?

341
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:49,003
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

342
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,272
Jugglers and singers
require applause.

343
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:54,742
You are a Lannister.

344
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,811
<i>Do you think I demanded
a garland of roses</i>

345
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:00,547
<i>every time I suffered
a wound on a battlefield?</i>

346
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:02,548
Hmm?

347
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:06,385
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after

348
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,787
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

349
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:13,593
So tell me what you want.

350
00:29:17,498 --> 00:29:20,300
I want what is mine by right.

351
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:25,338
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

352
00:29:25,406 --> 00:29:29,678
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
from marriage or inheritance.

353
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:31,746
The day Jaime put on
the white cloak,

354
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,549
he gave up his claim
to Casterly Rock.

355
00:29:35,884 --> 00:29:38,953
I am your son and lawful heir.

356
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:43,557
You want Casterly Rock?

357
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:45,560
It is mine by right.

358
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:52,233
We'll find you accommodations

359
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:54,169
more suited to your name

360
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:56,570
<i>and as a reward
for your accomplishments</i>

361
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:59,473
during the battle
of Blackwater Bay.

362
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:03,177
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

363
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,879
<i>fit for your talents</i>

364
00:30:04,914 --> 00:30:07,448
so that you can
serve your family

365
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,583
and protect our legacy.

366
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,253
<i>And if you serve faithfully,</i>

367
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,821
<i>you will be rewarded
with a suitable wife.</i>

368
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:17,692
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

369
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:18,993
<i>before mocking the family name</i>

370
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,962
<i>and making you
heir to Casterly Rock.</i>

371
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:26,366
- Why?
- Why?

372
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,534
You ask that?

373
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:31,970
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

374
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:36,142
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

375
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,180
full of envy, lust,
and low cunning.

376
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,782
<i>Men's laws give you
the right to bear my name</i>

377
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:47,418
and display my colors since I
cannot prove that you are not mine.

378
00:30:49,123 --> 00:30:51,490
<i>And to teach me humility,
the gods have condemned me</i>

379
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:54,925
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

380
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,864
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

381
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,598
But neither gods nor men

382
00:31:00,632 --> 00:31:03,534
will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock

383
00:31:03,568 --> 00:31:06,670
<i>into your whorehouse.</i>

384
00:31:06,705 --> 00:31:09,573
Go, now.

385
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:16,480
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

386
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:20,685
Go.

387
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,793
Oh, one more thing.

388
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:37,333
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

389
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:48,178
<i>Dorne.
It's going to Dorne.</i>

390
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:51,113
<i>- Why Dorne?</i>
- It's carrying silk

391
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:54,618
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

392
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:00,990
But it's not coming back.

393
00:32:01,025 --> 00:32:03,625
The captain's tired
of risking his life

394
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,829
so King's Landing
lords and ladies

395
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:08,932
can get drunk on better
wine than they deserve.

396
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,503
He's going to stay in Dorne.

397
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:15,873
Wait out the winter where
it's beautiful and warm.

398
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:19,676
I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.

399
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:21,679
Don't ruin the game.

400
00:32:21,713 --> 00:32:24,450
I told you,
I don't want to play.

401
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:27,585
What about that one there?

402
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,086
That one?

403
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,123
It's going to Volantis.

404
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,591
Why?

405
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,326
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,

406
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,895
it looked like that one.

407
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,730
That's not how the game works.

408
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:42,334
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

409
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:43,969
You've got to invent a story

410
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,439
about where the ship
is going and why.

411
00:32:47,474 --> 00:32:50,343
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

412
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:52,410
Because the truth

413
00:32:52,445 --> 00:32:54,979
is always either
terrible or boring.

414
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:57,783
Lovely day for it.

415
00:32:57,817 --> 00:32:59,719
Watching the ships.

416
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:02,722
Lord Baelish.

417
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:05,792
Might I speak with Lady Sansa

418
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:07,460
alone for a moment?

419
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:21,808
I saw your mother not long ago.

420
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,510
She's very eager to see you.

421
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,581
And your sister.

422
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:33,217
Arya's alive?

423
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:38,389
You said you'd take me home.

424
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:41,792
You said King's Landing
was your home.

425
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:44,361
You are the property
of the crown.

426
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:45,761
Stealing you would be treason.

427
00:33:45,796 --> 00:33:48,031
If you were to tell
just one person...

428
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:50,066
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

429
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,034
Because I'm a terrible liar.

430
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:54,704
You said so yourself.

431
00:33:54,738 --> 00:33:57,906
Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do. Tell me when.

432
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:02,677
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

433
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:05,913
that will take me far away
from the capital.

434
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:07,648
When I set sail,

435
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:10,217
I might be able
to take you with me.

436
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:13,253
But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

437
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,957
You're her handmaiden?

438
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:22,830
Yes.
And you're his...?

439
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:26,334
I help manage his affairs.

440
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:29,769
- He's an important person.
- So is she.

441
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:32,339
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

442
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:34,374
The day she was born,
they rang the bells

443
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,809
from sunrise till sunset.

444
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:41,815
We've both done
rather well, you and I.

445
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:46,152
Yes.

446
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:49,422
Given where we started.

447
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,692
And where is that?

448
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,227
It's not easy for girls like us

449
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,431
to dig our way out.

450
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:04,803
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

451
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:07,672
I always do.

452
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:10,409
Watch out for her with him.

453
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:04,797
They're growing fast.

454
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:09,534
Not fast enough.

455
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:12,971
I can't wait that long.

456
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:17,844
I need an army.

457
00:36:19,212 --> 00:36:21,646
We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.

458
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,717
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

459
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:28,554
The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.

460
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:30,890
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

461
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:32,759
Do those people
have any better ideas

462
00:36:32,793 --> 00:36:36,061
about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?

463
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:39,599
It's too beautiful
a day to argue.

464
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,936
You're right.

465
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,140
Another lovely day
on the high seas.

466
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,942
<i>Don't mock them.</i>

467
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:54,345
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

468
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,746
They followed me
across the poison water.

469
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,082
If they'll do it, others will.

470
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,648
And with a true
khalasar...

471
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:03,786
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

472
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:07,589
You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

473
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:09,825
And not before.

474
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:38,652
Your Grace.

475
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:52,234
I heard you were dead.

476
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:54,135
Not yet.

477
00:37:56,272 --> 00:37:59,141
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

478
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:02,211
We are alone.

479
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:15,392
Your Grace, you are
the rightful king.

480
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,294
<i>Not only by blood.</i>

481
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:21,298
You're an honorable man,
a just man.

482
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,633
And there is still
a war to fight.

483
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:26,367
I am fighting.

484
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:29,038
By burning prisoners alive?

485
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,109
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

486
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,578
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

487
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,714
If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea

488
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,483
before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.

489
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,218
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

490
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,558
Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?

491
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,363
<i>Did I set your ships ablaze?</i>

492
00:38:56,866 --> 00:39:01,004
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

493
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,676
I could have saved those men.

494
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,343
You would have taken the city,

495
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,253
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

496
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:10,948
and you would stand beside him.

497
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,517
<i>But I wasn't there</i>

498
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,221
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

499
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:28,432
Do you hear them screaming?

500
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,769
All those burning men
in the water

501
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:34,471
crying for their mothers,

502
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:37,374
for their gods for help?

503
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,142
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

504
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:49,418
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

505
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:51,819
What I told your son is true.

506
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:54,220
Death by fire

507
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:55,957
is the purest death.

508
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,094
This woman is evil!

509
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:01,795
She's the mother of demons.

510
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:04,665
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

511
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,200
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

512
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:07,501
You've chosen
the darkness, Ser Davos.

513
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:10,403
- She will destroy us all!
- I will pray for you.

514
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:12,440
<i>Your Grace!</i>

515
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:42,501
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

516
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,573
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

517
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,048
Why have we stopped?

518
00:40:54,082 --> 00:40:55,615
It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.

519
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:02,789
<i>What is she doing?
Who gave her permission?</i>

520
00:41:02,823 --> 00:41:06,726
My lady. We should
have guards, my lady.

521
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:09,129
Why?

522
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:14,033
Pardon me.

523
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:24,478
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.

524
00:41:24,512 --> 00:41:26,313
I have others.

525
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:34,521
Would you like to speak
with her, Your Grace?

526
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:39,492
No.

527
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,261
He was a soldier.

528
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:43,695
He went to fight on the walls

529
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,298
when the ships came
into Blackwater Bay.

530
00:41:46,332 --> 00:41:48,401
He never came back.

531
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:50,236
And your mother?

532
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,670
She died when she had me.

533
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,510
Bad men wanted
to come into this city

534
00:41:57,544 --> 00:42:01,212
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

535
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,221
Whenever you look
at this knight,

536
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:12,090
I want you to remember
your father.

537
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:16,560
He wasn't a knight.

538
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:18,528
He was just a soldier.

539
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:20,930
And what do knights
swear to do?

540
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:24,299
Protect the weak
and uphold the good.

541
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:28,069
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.

542
00:42:30,806 --> 00:42:33,974
Was your father a soldier, too?

543
00:42:35,043 --> 00:42:37,912
You should be proud, too.

544
00:42:39,781 --> 00:42:42,083
Under King Joffrey's
leadership,

545
00:42:42,117 --> 00:42:44,852
your fathers saved the city.

546
00:42:44,887 --> 00:42:47,187
They saved us all.

547
00:42:47,221 --> 00:42:50,591
From now on, we're going
to take care of you.

548
00:42:52,994 --> 00:42:55,029
All of you.

549
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:03,836
Come to me for whatever
you need to feed them,

550
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:05,937
clothe them, or house them.

551
00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:09,841
Directly to me.

552
00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:26,758
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

553
00:43:26,793 --> 00:43:28,392
Please, sit.
Sit.

554
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:30,894
I do apologize, my lady.

555
00:43:30,928 --> 00:43:33,266
Small council meetings.

556
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,400
At what point
does it become treason

557
00:43:35,434 --> 00:43:37,301
to waste the king's time?

558
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:43,742
That's a lovely gown, my lady.

559
00:43:43,777 --> 00:43:45,779
Yes, it suits you perfectly.

560
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:48,215
I imagine you might
be rather cold.

561
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:51,619
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

562
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:55,355
Shall I have them bring
you a shawl, my lady?

563
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,858
I am touched by your
concern, Your Grace.

564
00:43:57,893 --> 00:44:01,094
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

565
00:44:01,128 --> 00:44:03,096
- <i>Doesn't it, Loras?</i>
- Yes.

566
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,233
Loras, isn't the queen's
gown magnificent?

567
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:09,134
The fabric, the embroidery,
the metalwork.

568
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:10,804
I've never seen
anything like it.

569
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:12,739
You might find a bit
of armor quite useful

570
00:44:12,773 --> 00:44:15,374
once you become queen.
Perhaps before.

571
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:19,212
<i>Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom</i>

572
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:21,014
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

573
00:44:21,048 --> 00:44:25,417
Yes. I paid a visit
to an orphanage

574
00:44:25,451 --> 00:44:26,986
the High Septon told me about.

575
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,689
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

576
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:34,025
The lowest among us are no different from
the highest if you give them a chance

577
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:36,330
and approach them
with an open heart.

578
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:38,431
<i>An open heart is what
you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>

579
00:44:38,465 --> 00:44:40,032
<i>if you're not careful, my dear.</i>

580
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:43,902
Not long ago, we were
attacked by a mob there.

581
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,871
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

582
00:44:46,905 --> 00:44:49,874
The king barely escaped
with his life.

583
00:44:49,908 --> 00:44:53,378
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

584
00:44:53,445 --> 00:44:55,982
Facts become less and less
important to her

585
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:58,016
<i>as she grows older.</i>

586
00:44:58,084 --> 00:45:00,987
Our lives were never
truly in danger.

587
00:45:02,222 --> 00:45:03,955
You're right, of course.

588
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,225
But you are your father's son.

589
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,427
We can't all have
a king's bravery.

590
00:45:17,604 --> 00:45:19,804
Hunger turns men into beasts.

591
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,676
I'm glad House Tyrell has been
able to help in this regard.

592
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:27,547
They tell me 100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

593
00:45:27,582 --> 00:45:31,084
<i>Wheat, barley, apples.
We've had a blessed harvest.</i>

594
00:45:31,118 --> 00:45:33,787
And, of course, it's our
duty to assist the capital

595
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:35,855
in time of need.

596
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:37,589
Well, as Ser Loras said,

597
00:45:37,623 --> 00:45:40,760
Lady Margaery has done
this sort of...

598
00:45:40,794 --> 00:45:43,480
charitable work before.

599
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:45,898
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

600
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:49,302
I'm sure she does.

601
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:20,536
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

602
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,705
with no food or water.

603
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:31,215
They will stand
until they drop.

604
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,451
Such is their obedience.

605
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:39,556
They may suit my needs.

606
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,557
Tell me of their training.

607
00:47:01,406 --> 00:47:03,671
They begin their
training at five.

608
00:47:04,174 --> 00:47:06,143
Every day they drill
from dawn to dusk

609
00:47:06,178 --> 00:47:08,346
until they have mastered
the shortsword,

610
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,780
the shield,
and the three spears.

611
00:47:10,815 --> 00:47:14,418
Only one boy in four survives
this rigorous training.

612
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:20,489
<i>Their discipline
and loyalty are absolute.</i>

613
00:47:20,523 --> 00:47:22,293
<i>They fear nothing.</i>

614
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:25,361
Even the bravest men
fear death.

615
00:47:46,517 --> 00:47:49,485
<i>My master says
the Unsullied are not men.</i>

616
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:51,886
Death means nothing to them.

617
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:03,364
He begs you attend to this
carefully, Your Grace.

618
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:20,346
Tell the good master
there is no need.

619
00:48:27,788 --> 00:48:30,755
<i>My master points out
that men don't need nipples.</i>

620
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:48,740
To win his shield,

621
00:48:48,774 --> 00:48:52,511
an Unsullied must go to the
slave marts with a silver mark,

622
00:48:52,545 --> 00:48:57,517
find a newborn and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

623
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,286
<i>This way, my master says,
we make certain</i>

624
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:04,422
<i>there is no weakness
left in them.</i>

625
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:08,560
You take a babe
from its mother's arms,

626
00:49:08,594 --> 00:49:12,897
kill it as she watches, and pay
for her pain with a silver coin?

627
00:49:26,811 --> 00:49:29,414
My master would like you to
know that the silver is paid

628
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:32,016
to the baby's owner,
not the mother.

629
00:49:38,157 --> 00:49:40,123
How many do you have to sell?

630
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:47,132
8,000.

631
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,708
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

632
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:57,576
Many other buyers
are interested.

633
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,889
8,000 dead babies.

634
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,492
The Unsullied
are a means to an end.

635
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:15,860
Once I own them,
these men...

636
00:50:15,928 --> 00:50:18,429
They're not men.
Not anymore.

637
00:50:18,463 --> 00:50:21,832
Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?

638
00:50:21,866 --> 00:50:23,933
Do you think these slaves
will have better lives

639
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:27,404
serving Kraznys and men
like him or serving you?

640
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:42,618
You'll be fair to them.

641
00:50:42,653 --> 00:50:45,421
You won't mutilate them
to make a point.

642
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:52,195
You won't order them
to murder babies.

643
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,064
You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.

644
00:50:55,098 --> 00:50:57,934
A great injustice
has been done to them.

645
00:50:59,103 --> 00:51:01,637
Closing your eyes
will not undo it.

646
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:00,359
The warlocks.

647
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:06,699
I owe you my life, ser.

648
00:52:06,733 --> 00:52:08,370
The honor is mine,

649
00:52:08,404 --> 00:52:10,604
my queen.

650
00:52:13,975 --> 00:52:16,243
You know this man?

651
00:52:16,277 --> 00:52:18,078
I know him

652
00:52:18,112 --> 00:52:22,582
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

653
00:52:22,616 --> 00:52:24,185
and as the Lord Commander

654
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:26,987
of Robert Baratheon's
Kingsguard.

655
00:52:28,522 --> 00:52:30,457
King Robert is dead.

656
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:33,361
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

657
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:35,929
to ask your forgiveness.

658
00:52:35,963 --> 00:52:38,999
I was sworn to protect
your family.

659
00:52:40,735 --> 00:52:42,669
I failed them.

660
00:52:48,076 --> 00:52:50,343
I am Barristan Selmy,

661
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:52,680
Kingsguard to your father.

662
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:55,114
<i>Allow me to join
your Queensguard</i>

663
00:52:55,149 --> 00:52:58,219
and I will not fail you again.
