3
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:20,498
Where you gonna go?

4
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,218
South.

5
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:26,254
What are you gonna do?

6
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,089
Get warm.

7
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:37,649
I was with you
at Hardhome.

8
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:41,269
We saw
what's out there.

9
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:42,771
We know
it's coming here.

10
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:45,273
How can you
leave us now?

11
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,909
I did everything I could.
You know that.

12
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:49,243
You swore a vow.

13
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:51,267
Aye, I pledged my life
to the Night's Watch.

14
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:53,331
- I gave my life.
- For all nights to come.

15
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,867
They killed me, Edd!
My own brothers.

16
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:57,836
You want me
to stay here after that?

17
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:01,456
<i>Riders approaching!</i>

18
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:03,625
<i>Open the gate!</i>

19
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:39,220
This is good soup.

20
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:44,859
Do you remember those kidney pies
Old Nan used to make?

21
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:47,529
- With the peas and onions?
- Mmm.

22
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,151
We never should
have left Winterfell.

23
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:56,037
Don't you wish we could
go back to the day we left?

24
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:01,709
I want to scream at myself,
"Don't go, you idiot."

25
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:03,878
How could we know?

26
00:05:03,964 --> 00:05:08,082
I spent a lot of time thinking about
what an ass I was to you.

27
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:12,086
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>change everything.</i>

28
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:13,338
We were children.

29
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,056
I was awful,
just admit it.

30
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,644
You were
occasionally awful.

31
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:21,563
I'm sure I can't
have been great fun.

32
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:24,432
Always sulking in the corner
while the rest of you played.

33
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:26,351
- Can you forgive me?
- There's nothing to forgive.

34
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,436
- Forgive me.
- All right.

35
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:30,572
All right,
I forgive you.

36
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:49,757
You'd think after
thousands of years,

37
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:52,427
the Night's Watch would have learned
how to make a good ale.

38
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,131
Where will you go?

39
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,469
Where will <i>we</i> go?

40
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:02,707
If I don't watch over you,

41
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:04,553
Father's ghost will come
back and murder me.

42
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:09,277
Where will we go?

43
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:11,863
I can't stay here,
not after what happened.

44
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:13,982
<i>There's only one place</i>
<i>we can go.</i>

45
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:16,200
Home.

46
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:19,537
Should we tell the Boltons
to pack up and leave?

47
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,289
We'll take it back
from them.

48
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:25,710
I don't have an army.

49
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,912
How many wildlings
did you save?

50
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:29,631
They didn't come here
to serve me.

51
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:32,000
They owe you
their lives.

52
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:35,253
You think they'll be safe here if
Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?

53
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:37,722
- Sansa.
- Winterfell is our home.

54
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:41,342
It's ours and Arya's
and Bran's and Rickon's.

55
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:43,561
Wherever they are,
it belongs to our family.

56
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,013
We have to fight for it.

57
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:47,231
I'm tired of fighting.

58
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:52,020
It's all I've done
since I left home.

59
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:54,022
I've killed brothers
of the Night's Watch.

60
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:56,824
I've killed wildlings.
I've killed men that I admire.

61
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,361
I hanged a boy
younger than Bran.

62
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:07,201
I fought and I lost.

63
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,542
If we don't take back the North,
we'll never be safe.

64
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:18,429
I want you to help me.

65
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:22,550
But I'll do it myself
if I have to.

66
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:27,772
My lady.

67
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:30,475
Ser Davos.

68
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:35,480
Will you stay here
at Castle Black?

69
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:39,317
I will do
as Jon Snow commands.

70
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:41,235
You serve Jon Snow now?

71
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:44,622
He's the prince
that was promised.

72
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:49,127
Forgive me, my lady, I thought
that was Stannis.

73
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:01,222
What happened
down there?

74
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:06,477
There was a battle.
Stannis was defeated.

75
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,598
And Shireen?

76
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:12,266
What happened
to the princess?

77
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:15,069
I saw what happened.

78
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:17,989
I saw Stannis' forces
defeated in the field.

79
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:19,991
My lady,
I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.

80
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,693
We've met before.

81
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:23,528
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.

82
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:27,782
Before Renly was assassinated
with bloodmagic.

83
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:30,585
That's in the past now.

84
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:33,871
Yes, it's in the past.

85
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:36,507
It doesn't mean
I forget.

86
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:39,594
Or forgive.

87
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:43,097
He admitted it,
you know.

88
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:44,966
Who did?

89
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,135
Stannis.

90
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,387
Just before
I executed him.

91
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:37,351
The Defender of the Vale!

92
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:39,103
Uncle Petyr!

93
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,578
My lord.

94
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:49,247
Come and see.

95
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:51,999
I missed your name day.
Go on.

96
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:56,370
A falcon!

97
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:57,872
A gyrfalcon.

98
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,423
The greatest and rarest
of birds.

99
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:02,210
Last time
I saw you, Baelish,

100
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:06,547
you told me you were taking
Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.

101
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:07,882
Indeed I was.

102
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:10,218
And yet not long ago,
we received reports

103
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,387
that she has been married to
Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.

104
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:14,580
On our way to the Fingers,

105
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,927
we were set upon by a large
force of Bolton men.

106
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:18,956
Seemed to know exactly when

107
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,297
we were traveling and exactly
whom we were transporting.

108
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:23,447
Do you take me
for a fool?

109
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:26,400
Tell me, Lord Royce,

110
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:29,904
how many people knew
of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?

111
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:33,291
I shared my intentions
with you

112
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:35,543
<i>and no one else.</i>

113
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:39,413
Slander a man
in his own home,

114
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:42,300
you might find yourself
crossing swords with him.

115
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:47,054
Your home is the Vale.
The Lord of the Vale stands before us.

116
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,924
And only his judgment
concerns me.

117
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:58,015
<i>Shall we throw him</i>
<i>through the Moon Door?</i>

118
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:07,191
My lord.

119
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:11,863
My lord, I have always been
faithful to House Arryn.

120
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:14,949
To your father, to your mother,
and now to you.

121
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:17,535
Do you believe him,
Uncle Petyr?

122
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:28,963
Lord Royce has served
the Vale well.

123
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:32,800
He's enjoyed a distinguished
military career.

124
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:36,437
If we could trust
his absolute loyalty,

125
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:39,106
he would make a capable commander
in the wars to come.

126
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:46,197
You can trust my absolute loyalty,
my lord.

127
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:49,116
I think he deserves one more chance.
What do you say?

128
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:57,708
Fine.

129
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:07,251
I bring good news.

130
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:09,921
My friends in the North
tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.

131
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:11,806
I expect she's headed
to Castle Black

132
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,225
where her brother serves
as Lord Commander.

133
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:18,512
But she won't be safe there,
not with the Boltons after her.

134
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,433
She's my cousin.

135
00:12:25,188 --> 00:12:26,270
We should help her.

136
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:29,023
That was my instinct
as well.

137
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:31,692
Our lord has spoken.

138
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,196
Gather the Knights
of the Vale.

139
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:38,366
The time has come
to join the fray.

140
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:44,705
<i>You invite the enemy</i>
<i>into our city?</i>

141
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:46,507
I did.

142
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:49,043
As a clever man
once told me,

143
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:51,846
"We make peace with our enemies,
not our friends."

144
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:54,882
I don't make peace
with the queen's enemies.

145
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:56,100
I kill
the queen's enemies.

146
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:57,685
Yes, that's
the military approach.

147
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,353
And how has that worked
here in Meereen?

148
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,722
I represent
the diplomatic approach.

149
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:03,975
Our queen tried to make
peace with the Masters

150
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,060
and they tried
to murder her.

151
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:09,063
We enter these negotiations
with open eyes.

152
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:12,483
Trust me. My own recent
experience with slavery

153
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:14,485
has taught me the horrors
of that institution.

154
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,987
How many days
were you a slave?

155
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:18,072
Long enough to know.

156
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:21,208
Not long enough
to understand.

157
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:31,252
I bought this dwarf
for a single gold honor.

158
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:33,421
And somehow you've risen

159
00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:36,424
to the top of the
Great Pyramid of Meereen.

160
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,342
It's most impressive.

161
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:41,262
And now you speak
for the Good Masters of Astapor.

162
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:43,731
Here's to reversals
of fortune.

163
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:45,399
We came here
to meet the queen

164
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:47,902
and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.

165
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:51,772
Let's make this simple, shall we?
Tell me what you want.

166
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:54,825
We want you to leave
Slaver's Bay.

167
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:58,612
Take your dragons
and your mercenaries and go.

168
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:01,282
Queen Daenerys won't stay
in Meereen forever.

169
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,167
Her path takes
her westward.

170
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:05,619
When we last met,
I offered her ships

171
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:09,590
so she could return to Westeros
where she belongs. She refused them.

172
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:11,792
She refused them because
hundreds of thousands

173
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:13,844
of men, women, and children
still lived in chains.

174
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:16,380
As they have
since the dawn of time.

175
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:19,633
- Not anymore.
- You think you're a free man now?

176
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:21,602
You still follow orders.

177
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:24,221
Just because your master
has silver hair and tits

178
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:26,057
doesn't mean
she's not a master.

179
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:29,610
Friends, friends,
friends, please.

180
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:31,111
There have always been

181
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:34,063
those with wealth and power
and those with nothing.

182
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:35,413
That is the way of the world.

183
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,437
I'm not here to change
the way of the world.

184
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:39,904
Slavery is the way
of our world.

185
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:43,491
You don't need slaves
to make money.

186
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:46,460
There haven't been slaves in Westeros
for hundreds of years

187
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:48,496
and I grew up richer
than any of you.

188
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,168
But our queen recognizes
that she erred

189
00:14:54,303 --> 00:14:56,921
by abolishing slavery

190
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,840
without providing
a new system to replace it.

191
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:03,727
So here
is the queen's proposal.

192
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:06,680
Slavery will never
return to Meereen,

193
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:09,517
but she will give
the other cities of Slaver's Bay

194
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:11,602
time to adjust
to the new order.

195
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,020
What does that mean?

196
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:16,240
Instead of abolishing
slavery overnight,

197
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:19,076
we will give you seven years
to end the practice.

198
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,033
Slaveholders
will be compensated

199
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:28,869
for their losses,
of course, at fair prices.

200
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:31,455
In exchange,
you will cut off

201
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,290
your support for
the Sons of the Harpy.

202
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:34,936
We do not support
the Sons of the Harpy.

203
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:38,095
Fine, fine, but you will
cut it off all the same.

204
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:42,216
I do hope you accept,
my friends.

205
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:44,218
You will not receive
a better offer.

206
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,524
Let us sail
on the tide of freedom

207
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,860
instead of being
drowned by it.

208
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,314
And as a parting gift
to our honored guests...

209
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:08,075
Give freedom a chance.

210
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:11,545
See if it doesn't taste every bit as good
as what came before.

211
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,360
My friends!

212
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,696
Large sorry...

213
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,574
...you wait so fat time.

214
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:34,485
Perhaps I should
translate for you.

215
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:36,187
<i>We speak</i>
<i>the Common Tongue.</i>

216
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:39,773
- Excellent.
- You met with the slavers today.

217
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:41,275
<i>I did.</i>

218
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Our brothers and sisters
died fighting this scum.

219
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:46,614
<i>Now you invite them</i>
<i>to our city and drink wine with them.</i>

220
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:52,703
I imagine
this room was built

221
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:55,839
so the rulers could
intimidate the ruled.

222
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,710
But I am not your ruler.

223
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:02,129
I'm not
the Breaker of Chains.

224
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:04,381
I'm not the Unburnt.

225
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:08,686
And I am certainly not
the Mother of Dragons.

226
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:10,804
You are a stranger here.

227
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,857
So why do you represent
Meereen in these talks with our enemies?

228
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:17,394
Because our queen
chose me as her advisor.

229
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,613
Until she returns
from her travels--

230
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:21,198
When does she return?

231
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:23,734
Soon.
You have my word.

232
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,488
We don't know you. We don't trust you.
We know Torgo Nudho.

233
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:29,540
We fight with him
against the Masters. We trust him.

234
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:33,494
And that is exactly why Grey Worm
took part in these negotiations.

235
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:37,214
<i>As commander of the Unsullied,</i>
<i>he knows how to defeat the slavers</i>

236
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,049
and he knows when
it is time to make peace.

237
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:42,002
You have made peace
with the slavers?

238
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:43,484
<i>We offered terms.</i>

239
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,524
And you, Grey Worm?

240
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,443
You want to drink wine with these men?

241
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:52,489
The men who tore us from our mothers' arms
and sold us at auction like cattle?

242
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,873
I am a soldier, not a politician.

243
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:03,250
But if there is a chance for peace --

244
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,918
a just peace --

245
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,795
we should take it.

246
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,089
Missandei,

247
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:13,343
you know what these men are.
How can you trust them?

248
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,805
I do not trust them.
I will never trust them.

249
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,772
But as a wise man once said,

250
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:31,320
"We make peace with our
enemies, not our friends."

251
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:39,360
- Do not use me for your lies.
- Those men respect you.

252
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,729
They respect me
because they know who I am.

253
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,864
- They know I am loyal.
- As do I.

254
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:46,233
I am loyal to my queen,
not you.

255
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,202
If you betray her work,
you are my enemy.

256
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:51,405
I am not betraying her work.
I am trying to save her city.

257
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,957
You promised the slavers
they could keep slavery.

258
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:55,242
For a short time.

259
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:58,078
Seven years is not a short time
for a slave.

260
00:18:58,214 --> 00:18:59,663
You're right.

261
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:02,216
Slavery is a horror
that should be ended at once.

262
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:04,835
War is a horror that should be ended
at once.

263
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,587
I can't do both today.

264
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:08,138
You are wrong
to trust these men.

265
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:11,675
I don't trust the Masters.
I trust their self-interest.

266
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:13,427
They're trustworthy
if they're convinced

267
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,729
that working with me
is in their self-interest.

268
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,682
You don't know them.
You don't understand them.

269
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:20,434
We are not human
in their eyes.

270
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:22,820
They look at me
and see a weapon.

271
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:24,938
They look at her
and see a whore.

272
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:27,775
They look at me and they see
a misshapen little beast.

273
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,943
Their contempt
is their weakness.

274
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:33,530
They'll underestimate us every time
and we will use that to our advantage.

275
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:36,700
You will not use them.

276
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:39,503
They will use you.
That is what they do.

277
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,276
You all right?

278
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:05,612
Why don't you sit
and catch your breath?

279
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:08,649
I'm fine.

280
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,984
I don't think you
could ride the dragon.

281
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,203
20 years ago, maybe.

282
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,572
- What?
- Our queen.

283
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:19,042
She's wild, you know.
Don't let her size fool you.

284
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:21,879
It's hard enough for me
and I'm a young man.

285
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:25,749
You, I don't think
your heart could take it.

286
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:31,922
Must make you angry
that our queen chose me.

287
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:35,175
Makes me sad.
You'll disappoint her before long.

288
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:37,678
- She'll move on.
- We'll all disappoint her before long.

289
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:40,647
We need each other right now.
After we're done needing each other--

290
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:44,184
Oh, I don't want to fight you,
Jorah the Andal.

291
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,986
What do I have to gain?

292
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,739
If I win, I'm the shit
who killed an old man.

293
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:51,992
If I lose, I'm the shit
who was killed by an old man.

294
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:56,864
You didn't get much
discipline as a child, did you?

295
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:58,699
None.

296
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,458
The road running
through the Horse Gate,

297
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,376
they call that
the godsway.

298
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:12,179
Eastern Market,
Western Market.

299
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:13,954
When Khal Drogo died,

300
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:16,178
she was supposed to come here
and join the Dosh Khaleen,

301
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:19,803
the widows
of the dead khals.

302
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:21,855
That's where they
would have taken her,

303
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:25,142
<i>the Temple</i>
<i>of the Dosh Khaleen.</i>

304
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:34,735
What are you doing?

305
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,404
It's forbidden to carry weapons
in the sacred city.

306
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,908
Isn't it forbidden to sneak into
their city and steal their khaleesi?

307
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:42,876
If they spot us
and we're unarmed,

308
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:45,412
we'll say we're traders heading
for the Western Market.

309
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:47,164
But if they see
weapons...

310
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:48,966
You're asking a dog
to hand over his teeth.

311
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:51,084
There's 100,000
of them down there.

312
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,669
We can't fight our way out.

313
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:55,506
We wait till dark,
and then we'll find her.

314
00:22:02,264 --> 00:22:04,181
Uh...

315
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:08,569
I'm very attached
to this knife.

316
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:21,949
Don't worry.
It didn't touch you.

317
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:25,536
You know what happens?

318
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:27,337
I know what happens.

319
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:31,091
I'll do it myself.

320
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,816
I should have been
born a Dothraki.

321
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:37,107
Come on.

322
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,543
My friends...

323
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,631
We wandered off from the
Western Market and got lost.

324
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,884
Could you show us the way back?

325
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,177
What do you sell?

326
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,345
Wine.

327
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,764
Come down to my stall tomorrow,

328
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:54,518
I'll give you a cask of the Arbor's finest.

329
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,691
You're not merchants.

330
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,110
Get the others.

331
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:57,404
Told you, I'm very attached
to this knife.

332
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:00,440
You all right?

333
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:02,743
If they find a body
with a stab wound,

334
00:25:02,828 --> 00:25:05,195
the whole city
will be looking for us.

335
00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:27,467
Huh.

336
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:37,829
Some of them don't think Dothraki
should breed with foreigners.

337
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:43,084
They are stupid old women. They don't realize
that we have always diluted our blood.

338
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,128
This one is Lhazareen.

339
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:48,423
Her Khal found her hiding in a well
after he burned her village.

340
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,634
How old were you?

341
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,261
Twelve.

342
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:57,974
A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter.
How did he show his happiness?

343
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,644
He broke my ribs.

344
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:06,983
We are not queens here, but the khals
depend on us for our wisdom.

345
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,319
Our lives have meaning.

346
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,239
That is more than most have.

347
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:16,076
When the khals meet
for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night,

348
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,328
I hope they let you live out your days with us.

349
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:21,831
The other possibilities are not so pleasant.

350
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,668
I need to make water.

351
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,546
You can't run from Dothraki.

352
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,340
You know this.

353
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,009
I will never run from Dothraki.

354
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,096
Go, show her.

355
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,683
I needed fresh air.

356
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,685
The old women stink.

357
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,645
They do stink.

358
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,982
You must have been very young
when your Khal died.

359
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,358
Sixteen.

360
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,653
Too bad he didn't die sooner.

361
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,657
Yes, too bad.

362
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,159
Is it true you have three dragons?

363
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:00,060
Mm-hmm.

364
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,623
And they breathe fire?

365
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,874
They do.

366
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,711
Would you like to see them one day?

367
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,213
I am Dosh Khaleen.

368
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:15,051
I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise
as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.

369
00:27:15,711 --> 00:27:17,878
- No, don't hurt her.
- She'll give us away.

370
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:19,713
We have to go now.

371
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:27,220
We will never get out
of Vaes Dothrak alive.

372
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:29,723
All we can do is try.

373
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:32,008
No.

374
00:27:32,094 --> 00:27:34,311
We can do more than that.

375
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:36,012
And you're going
to help me.

376
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,035
And you...

377
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,203
Have faith in me, Khaleesi.

378
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,247
Do not betray me.

379
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:49,169
If I were to let you leave right now,
where would you go?

380
00:28:49,254 --> 00:28:51,922
- <i> What would you seek out?</i>

381
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:56,343
I'd go to my brother,

382
00:28:56,478 --> 00:28:57,928
my husband, my family.

383
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:02,148
Of course, but for you,
that means seeking out money,

384
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:05,101
finery, power.

385
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:09,022
Seeking out your family
means seeking out sin.

386
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:11,024
<i>I'm not maligning you.</i>

387
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:14,027
I sought
those things out, too.

388
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:16,363
To the exclusion
of all else.

389
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
<i>My father was a cobbler.</i>

390
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:24,254
He died when I was young
and I took over his shop.

391
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:26,873
He was a simple man
and he made simple shoes.

392
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:30,377
But I found that the more work
I put into my shoes,

393
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:31,678
the more people
wanted them.

394
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:34,848
Fine leather,
ornamentation,

395
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:38,802
detailing,
and time.

396
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:40,603
Time most of all.

397
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:43,306
Dozens of hours
spent on a single pair.

398
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:45,141
Quality takes time.

399
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:47,193
Yes.

400
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,362
I imagine
you've worn a year

401
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:52,399
of someone's life
on your back.

402
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:54,868
<i>The highborn liked to cover</i>
<i>their feet with my time</i>

403
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:57,954
and they paid well
for the privilege.

404
00:29:58,073 --> 00:29:59,622
I used their money

405
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:02,459
to buy a taste
of their lives for myself.

406
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:04,711
<i>Each time I indulged,</i>

407
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:08,915
I felt myself ascending
to something better.

408
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:11,001
And one day you walked
through a graveyard

409
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:12,802
and realized it was
all for nothing

410
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:15,422
and set out on the path
to righteousness.

411
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:18,141
Book of the Stranger,
verse 25.

412
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,760
You know
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

413
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:23,563
Septa Unella reads it to me.
At me.

414
00:30:23,648 --> 00:30:27,484
Yes, yes, she does enjoy
reading at people.

415
00:30:29,187 --> 00:30:30,603
You're close.

416
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,773
But it wasn't
a graveyard.

417
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:35,692
It was a feast.

418
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:38,078
I bought old fine wine

419
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:40,196
and young pretty girls

420
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:44,000
and invited my friends
to come and share it all.

421
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:47,504
<i>We passed around the wine,</i>
<i>passed around the women,</i>

422
00:30:47,622 --> 00:30:50,340
<i>and soon we fell</i>
<i>into a stupor.</i>

423
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:56,429
I woke before dawn.

424
00:30:56,515 --> 00:30:59,632
I could barely stand.

425
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:04,471
Everyone else was asleep on
the couches or on the floor,

426
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:09,225
lying in heaps next
to their fine clothes.

427
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:11,778
The truth of their bodies
laid bare.

428
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:16,649
I could smell them

429
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:20,120
beneath the incense
and the perfume

430
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:23,907
and the fine food that had
already started to turn.

431
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:29,245
And I saw it
with perfect clarity.

432
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:32,665
I saw what my sins were.

433
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:37,003
The gold I had, the wine I drank,
the women I used,

434
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:41,341
my ceaseless struggle
to maintain my position.

435
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:48,264
It was all part
of a story.

436
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:53,736
A story I was telling
myself about who I was.

437
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,322
<i>A collection of lies</i>

438
00:31:56,408 --> 00:31:58,358
<i>that would disappear</i>
<i>in the light.</i>

439
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:02,362
The people I was trying
to climb away from,

440
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:03,947
the beggars
in the street,

441
00:32:04,032 --> 00:32:05,582
<i>the poor,</i>

442
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,452
they were closer
to the truth than I ever was.

443
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:12,088
So what did you do?

444
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:14,040
<i>I left to go</i>
<i>and find them.</i>

445
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:17,760
I didn't even
put on my shoes.

446
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:21,764
I walked out the door
and never went back.

447
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:29,472
Come, let's go
and see him.

448
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:32,976
- Who?
- Your brother.

449
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:50,326
Loras.

450
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:58,835
Loras.

451
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:19,606
Listen to me.

452
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:21,574
You need to stay strong.

453
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:27,447
I can't stay strong.

454
00:33:27,582 --> 00:33:29,332
I never was strong.

455
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:31,201
You are strong.

456
00:33:31,286 --> 00:33:33,620
You are the future
of our house,

457
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:35,121
the future
of our family.

458
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:37,790
- I don't care about that.
- Shh!

459
00:33:37,926 --> 00:33:39,676
Shh.

460
00:33:39,794 --> 00:33:42,045
Have you--
have you told them that?

461
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,630
That you don't care?

462
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:47,717
I just want it to stop.

463
00:33:50,138 --> 00:33:51,971
Help me.

464
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,314
They want me
to help you.

465
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:03,933
They want me to help
tear you down.

466
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:05,386
They want me to help
tear you down.

467
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:08,456
That's why he's letting me see you.
I know it is.

468
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:12,226
And if either of us give in to
what they want, then they win.

469
00:34:12,327 --> 00:34:14,028
Let them win.

470
00:34:15,964 --> 00:34:17,431
Just make it stop.

471
00:34:17,532 --> 00:34:19,733
Please.

472
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:23,270
All right.

473
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:31,645
<i>And now, how to avert disaster</i>
<i>with our current predicament.</i>

474
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:33,914
<i>This High Sparrow.</i>

475
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:36,984
<i>I have dealt with fanatics</i>
<i>of every description, Your Grace.</i>

476
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:40,721
Not setting them off,
that's the most important thing.

477
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:44,024
You are beset with enemies
both within and without.

478
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,793
What are you doing here?

479
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,932
I am advising the king
on our current predicament.

480
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:52,976
Leave.

481
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I am a member
of the small council.

482
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:56,737
The king--

483
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:59,473
Is this a small
council meeting?

484
00:34:59,574 --> 00:35:00,841
Obviously not.

485
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:04,044
I'm here to lend my wisdom
and my support.

486
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:07,381
Thank you for your counsel,
Grand Maester.

487
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,383
That will be all
for now.

488
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,252
Your Grace.

489
00:35:35,043 --> 00:35:38,579
Since I've missed
the past several small council meetings,

490
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,448
I wanted to speak to you
about a few things.

491
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:45,452
I've been thinking
about the High Sparrow.

492
00:35:45,554 --> 00:35:48,222
As have we all,
unfortunately.

493
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:51,225
We need to be careful
in dealing with such a man.

494
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:55,129
To prevent things from
escalating any further.

495
00:35:57,265 --> 00:35:59,500
We have to be careful
not to antagonize him.

496
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:02,002
He has Margaery.
We can't put her at risk.

497
00:36:02,103 --> 00:36:04,838
- He's dangerous.
- Look at me.

498
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,774
What did they do to me?

499
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,809
To the king's own mother?

500
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:16,016
It's all right.

501
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:18,552
It's done.
It's in the past.

502
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:20,888
And of course

503
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:23,691
Margaery's safety
is paramount.

504
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,929
You don't like Margaery,
do you?

505
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:33,767
Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

506
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,838
Margaery is the queen.

507
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:42,543
Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

508
00:36:42,644 --> 00:36:45,446
Not just for their own sake,
but for everyone's.

509
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:50,851
The High Sparrow has no respect for
kings or queens.

510
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:52,786
No respect for anything
in this world.

511
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:55,789
He has no use
for the things of this world.

512
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,526
He wants to knock them down
and replace them with what?

513
00:36:59,628 --> 00:37:01,729
With fantasies.

514
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,831
<i>With beggars</i>
<i>in the street.</i>

515
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:05,132
With nothing.

516
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:08,702
Mother...

517
00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:11,972
there's something
I want to tell you.

518
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,743
Something the High
Sparrow told me.

519
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:20,247
You've spoken with him?

520
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:25,653
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out I told--

521
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:28,555
It would be a breach of confidence which
he would not take lightly

522
00:37:28,657 --> 00:37:31,425
given his constant
prattling about the truth.

523
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:37,064
I am your mother.

524
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,134
You can always trust me.

525
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:51,512
The small council meeting has been
postponed on the king's orders.

526
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:53,973
I would have thought we were
perfectly clear the first time.

527
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:55,245
<i>You're not welcome.</i>

528
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:57,217
<i>You once spoke of your</i>
<i>respect for our father</i>

529
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:59,953
because he understood the necessity
of working with one's rivals.

530
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:04,858
My dear, you have been stripped of your
dignity and authority,

531
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:07,961
publically shamed,
and confined to the Red Keep.

532
00:38:08,063 --> 00:38:10,297
What's left to work with?

533
00:38:10,398 --> 00:38:12,800
<i>Cersei is the mother</i>
<i>of the king.</i>

534
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:15,602
She has the king's ear
and his trust.

535
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:17,638
And the king has been
speaking regularly

536
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:21,141
with the High Sparrow
about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

537
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:22,876
The High Sparrow
seized power

538
00:38:22,977 --> 00:38:24,945
knowing full well
we'd bicker amongst ourselves

539
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:26,747
instead of
seizing it back.

540
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,649
Here we are.
Well done to us.

541
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,851
Now the future
of the Seven Kingdoms

542
00:38:30,952 --> 00:38:32,786
rests in his dirty
peasant hands.

543
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:35,656
In a few days, he'll have
a trial for me.

544
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:39,326
But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

545
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:43,030
Yes, Margaery
will repent her sins

546
00:38:43,131 --> 00:38:45,099
before the good people
of the city.

547
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,668
Oh, no.

548
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:50,571
That cannot happen.

549
00:38:50,672 --> 00:38:52,473
That will not happen.

550
00:38:52,574 --> 00:38:54,241
I agree.

551
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:59,780
You've got the second largest
army in Westeros.

552
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:01,315
You'll bring them
into the city,

553
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:04,084
stop Queen Margaery's
humiliation before it starts,

554
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:06,587
and take her back
into Crown custody.

555
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:10,424
The king has ordered me to take
no action against the High Sparrow

556
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:13,627
or the Faith Militant out of fear
for the queen's safety.

557
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:15,562
You will take
no action at all.

558
00:39:15,663 --> 00:39:18,198
When the Tyrell armies come,
you will stand down.

559
00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:21,969
<i>Are you expressly</i>
<i>forbidden from standing down?</i>

560
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,938
No, but if the king
should call--

561
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,808
The whole thing will be over before
anyone can call on you to do anything.

562
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:32,045
When the High Sparrow is in custody
or dead, preferably,

563
00:39:32,147 --> 00:39:34,681
and Margaery's back
at Tommen's side,

564
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:36,884
do you think the king
will be angry at the outcome?

565
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:39,720
You hate these fanatics
as much as we do.

566
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:43,090
You hate what
they've done to your son.

567
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:45,058
Do you want Lancel back?

568
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,027
Or have you
given him up for good?

569
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,064
Of course
I want him back.

570
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:56,069
Then stand aside

571
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:59,373
and let the people
that took him from you be destroyed.

572
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:04,745
If it doesn't
go as planned,

573
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:07,214
the sparrows have
many friends in this city.

574
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:10,050
We'll have civil war.
Many will die.

575
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:12,553
Many will die
no matter what we do.

576
00:40:14,322 --> 00:40:16,056
Better them than us.

577
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,848
They told me you were home
and I didn't believe it.

578
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:19,653
"Theon Greyjoy?"
I said.

579
00:41:19,754 --> 00:41:22,089
"He's dead.

580
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,558
He's been dead
a long time."

581
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:29,663
He let you go?

582
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:31,231
I escaped.

583
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:35,602
I can't hear you.

584
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:37,371
I escaped.

585
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:41,475
Look at me.

586
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:51,551
Look at me.

587
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:55,656
Men died trying
to rescue you.

588
00:41:55,757 --> 00:41:57,357
Good men.

589
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,926
My men.

590
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:02,029
I'm sorry.

591
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,164
You were my brother.

592
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:07,301
You were a spoiled little cunt,
but you were my brother

593
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:09,369
and I risked
everything for you

594
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,837
and you betrayed me.

595
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:13,106
I know.
I know and I'm sorry.

596
00:42:13,207 --> 00:42:14,508
Stop saying that.

597
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:16,810
He broke me.

598
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:19,613
He broke me
into 1,000 pieces.

599
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:21,081
- I know.
- You don't know.

600
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:23,684
He sent us
one of those pieces.

601
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:25,752
That's why
I came for you.

602
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:33,694
Why did you come here?

603
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:35,395
Where else could I go?

604
00:42:35,496 --> 00:42:39,199
You heard Father was dead and you thought
you'd claim the crown?

605
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,268
No, no. I only heard he died
after we docked.

606
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:44,271
You happen to show up
on Pyke right before the kingsmoot?

607
00:42:44,372 --> 00:42:45,839
I didn't know.

608
00:42:48,843 --> 00:42:52,045
You think any ironborn
wants you to be king

609
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:53,947
after what you've done?

610
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:56,016
I don't want
to be king.

611
00:42:56,117 --> 00:42:59,353
What do you want?

612
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,494
I should have listened to you.
You're the only one--

613
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:03,924
That doesn't matter anymore.
Stop crying.

614
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:06,026
Look at me.

615
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:09,296
Tell me what you want.

616
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:16,336
You should rule
the Iron Islands.

617
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:19,573
Let me help you.

618
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,402
They've cleaned
you up nicely.

619
00:43:50,638 --> 00:43:52,406
You know who I am?

620
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:55,208
A lord.

621
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:57,244
Yes.

622
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,913
A lord.

623
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:01,948
You've seen my banners?

624
00:44:03,284 --> 00:44:05,419
The flayed man.

625
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,355
Does that worry
you at all?

626
00:44:08,456 --> 00:44:09,956
You eat them after?

627
00:44:13,628 --> 00:44:14,861
No.

628
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:17,964
Then I've seen worse.

629
00:44:42,123 --> 00:44:44,157
You served the Starks?

630
00:44:44,258 --> 00:44:46,793
Aye.
They put me in chains

631
00:44:46,894 --> 00:44:48,762
and put a sword
at my throat,

632
00:44:48,863 --> 00:44:50,130
so I served them.

633
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:53,600
The Starks have been
gone for a long time,

634
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:56,470
but you kept
protecting Rickon.

635
00:44:56,571 --> 00:45:00,073
He'd fetch a good price
to the right buyer.

636
00:45:00,174 --> 00:45:01,942
I served his family
a long time.

637
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:04,177
Didn't get no wages.

638
00:45:04,278 --> 00:45:07,414
Way I see it,
I'm owed.

639
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,152
Be that as it may,

640
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:14,721
Rickon's not yours
to sell anymore.

641
00:45:14,822 --> 00:45:16,490
He's mine.

642
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:19,626
So what use could I possibly
have for you?

643
00:45:22,029 --> 00:45:24,364
I can give you
what you want.

644
00:45:24,465 --> 00:45:26,700
And you're sure
you know what that is?

645
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:31,805
Same thing
men always want.

646
00:45:31,906 --> 00:45:36,109
And when they really want it,
they give it a bath first.

647
00:45:44,418 --> 00:45:46,686
You're a good talker.

648
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:50,824
I like that.

649
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:02,135
You're a much better talker
than Theon Greyjoy.

650
00:46:03,538 --> 00:46:05,338
That so?

651
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:07,741
I had to work hard
to get him talking.

652
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:10,343
But he talked.

653
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:12,112
They all do.

654
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:14,981
He told me everything.

655
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:17,918
All about the Stark boys,

656
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:20,253
who helped them escape,

657
00:46:20,354 --> 00:46:21,688
and how she did it.

658
00:46:50,151 --> 00:46:52,052
<i>Open the gate!</i>

659
00:47:39,033 --> 00:47:41,134
Sorry about the food.

660
00:47:41,235 --> 00:47:43,270
It's not what
we're known for.

661
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:45,839
That's all right.
There are more important things.

662
00:47:50,845 --> 00:47:52,679
A letter for you,
Lord Commander.

663
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:56,383
I'm not Lord
Commander anymore.

664
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:18,872
"To the traitor
and bastard Jon Snow.

665
00:48:18,973 --> 00:48:22,208
You allowed thousands
of wildlings past the Wall.

666
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:23,777
You have betrayed
your own kind.

667
00:48:23,878 --> 00:48:25,745
You have betrayed
the North.

668
00:48:25,846 --> 00:48:28,982
Winterfell is mine, bastard.
Come and see.

669
00:48:30,584 --> 00:48:32,652
Your brother Rickon
is in my dungeon.

670
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:43,330
His direwolf's skin
is on my floor.

671
00:48:43,431 --> 00:48:46,123
Come and see.
I want my bride back.

672
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:47,407
Send her to me, bastard,

673
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:49,703
and I will not trouble you
or your wildling lovers.

674
00:48:49,704 --> 00:48:52,806
Keep her from me
and I will ride north and slaughter

675
00:48:52,907 --> 00:48:56,409
every wildling man, woman,
and babe living under your protection.

676
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:59,157
You will watch
as I skin them living.

677
00:48:59,181 --> 00:49:01,181
You--"

678
00:49:02,283 --> 00:49:03,917
Go on.

679
00:49:04,018 --> 00:49:05,819
It's just more
of the same.

680
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:14,294
"You will watch as my soldiers
take turns raping your sister.

681
00:49:15,796 --> 00:49:17,097
<i>You will watch</i>
<i>as my dogs</i>

682
00:49:17,198 --> 00:49:19,799
devour your wild
little brother.

683
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:25,438
Then I will spoon your eyes from their
sockets and let my dogs do the rest.

684
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:29,476
Come and see.
Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell

685
00:49:29,577 --> 00:49:31,311
and Warden of the North."

686
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:38,752
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

687
00:49:38,853 --> 00:49:41,755
His father's dead.

688
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:43,390
Ramsay killed him.

689
00:49:43,491 --> 00:49:45,859
- <i>And now he has Rickon.</i>
<i>- We don't know that.</i>

690
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,361
Yes, we do.

691
00:49:48,462 --> 00:49:50,964
How many men does
he have in his army?

692
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,476
I heard him say 5,000

693
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,512
once when he was talking
about Stannis's attack.

694
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:59,239
How many do you have?

695
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,275
That can march and fight?

696
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:04,110
2,000.

697
00:50:05,413 --> 00:50:08,114
The rest are children
and old people.

698
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,755
You're the son of the last
true Warden of the North.

699
00:50:15,856 --> 00:50:19,492
Northern families are loyal.
They'll fight for you if you ask.

700
00:50:21,629 --> 00:50:25,832
A monster has taken
our home and our brother.

701
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:30,270
We have to go back
to Winterfell and save them both.

702
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:45,377
It is forbidden
to spill blood in the sacred city.

703
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,755
It is forbidden
to carry weapons in the sacred city.

704
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:50,632
So we don't spill blood!

705
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:53,468
Well... there's always a little blood.

706
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:56,805
Someone crushed his head with a rock.

707
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,099
Aggo belonged to my khalasar.

708
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,059
He served me well.

709
00:51:01,143 --> 00:51:03,520
He got his head smashed in by a rock.

710
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:04,646
Fuck Aggo.

711
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:13,655
Bring in Drogo's widow.

712
00:51:36,678 --> 00:51:40,015
Who cares about her? She's a midget.

713
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:41,850
I like her.

714
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,769
She's paler than milk.

715
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:46,438
I'd like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.

716
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,522
Good.

717
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:49,107
You can suck my dick.

718
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:52,778
She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.

719
00:51:52,861 --> 00:51:55,280
The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her.

720
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:58,241
They're offering ten thousand horses
in exchange.

721
00:51:58,325 --> 00:51:59,618
What's worth more,

722
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:02,329
one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?

723
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:05,749
Fuck the Wise Masters
in their perfumed asses.

724
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:08,376
I'll take their horses for myself.

725
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:11,588
Don't you want to know what I think?

726
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:16,426
You'd rather be sold into slavery?

727
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:20,138
Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko
here what you taste like?

728
00:52:20,222 --> 00:52:21,598
No.

729
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:23,475
I don't want either of those things.

730
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:25,310
We don't care what you want.

731
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:27,521
This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

732
00:52:27,604 --> 00:52:29,189
You have no voice here,

733
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:31,441
unless you are Dosh Khaleen.

734
00:52:31,525 --> 00:52:34,236
Which you are not, until we decide you are.

735
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:38,114
I know where I am. I have been here before.

736
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:42,994
This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced
my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.

737
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:44,996
And what happened?

738
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,499
You trusted a sorceress, like a fool.

739
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:51,211
Your baby is dead because of you.

740
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:53,588
And so is Khal Drogo.

741
00:52:55,465 --> 00:52:59,469
This is where Drogo promised to take his
khalasar west to where the world ends.

742
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:03,348
To ride wooden horses across the Black
Salt Sea as no khal has done before.

743
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:09,354
He promised to kill the men in their iron suits
and tear down their stone houses.

744
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:13,191
He swore to me
before the Mother of Mountains.

745
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:15,527
And you were dumb enough to believe him.

746
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:19,739
And here, now, what great matters
do the Great Khals discuss?

747
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:21,992
Which little villages you'll raid,

748
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:26,204
how many girls you'll get to fuck, how
many horses you'll demand in tribute.

749
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:28,540
You are small men.

750
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:32,127
None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki.

751
00:53:34,588 --> 00:53:37,048
But I am.

752
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:41,511
SO I Will.

753
00:53:50,604 --> 00:53:51,980
All right.

754
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:54,566
No Dosh Khaleen for you.

755
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:58,612
Instead we'll take turns fucking you.

756
00:53:58,695 --> 00:54:02,532
And then we'll let our bloodriders fuck you.

757
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:08,038
And if there's anything left of you,

758
00:54:08,622 --> 00:54:11,625
we'll give our horses a turn.

759
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:16,755
You crazy cunt.

760
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,800
Did you really think we would serve you?

761
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:29,100
You're not going to serve.

762
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,936
You're going to die.

763
00:57:26,343 --> 00:57:32,843
