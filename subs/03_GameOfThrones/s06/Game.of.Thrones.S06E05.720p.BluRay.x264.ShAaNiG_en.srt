1
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:01,663
Yes?

2
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,667
For you, my lady.

3
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:27,105
How far is Mole's Town?

4
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:36,448
Sansa.

5
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,203
Lady Brienne.

6
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:48,126
When I heard you had escaped
Winterfell, I feared the worst.

7
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,380
You have no idea how happy I am

8
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,132
to see you unharmed.

9
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:57,502
Unharmed?

10
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:59,304
What are you doing here?

11
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:02,273
I rode north with the Knights of
the Vale to come to your aid.

12
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:05,226
<i>They're encamped
at Moat Cailin as we speak.</i>

13
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:07,128
To come to my aid?

14
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:11,466
Did you know about Ramsay?

15
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,801
If you didn't know,
you're an idiot.

16
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:16,304
If you did know,
you're my enemy.

17
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:19,774
Would you like to hear
about our wedding night?

18
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,179
He never hurt my face.

19
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:27,782
He needed my face,
the face of Ned Stark's daughter.

20
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:34,873
But the rest of me,

21
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,091
he did what he liked
with the rest of me

22
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:40,462
<i>as long as I could
still give him an heir.</i>

23
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,463
What do you think he did?

24
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,172
I can't begin to contemplate...

25
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,514
What do you think he did to me?

26
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:04,702
Lady Sansa asked you a question.

27
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,271
He beat you.

28
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:07,655
Yes, he enjoyed that.

29
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:09,257
What else do you think he did?

30
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:11,493
- Sansa, I...
- What else?

31
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:15,663
Did he cut you?

32
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:20,502
- Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
- I didn't know.

33
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:22,504
I thought you knew
everyone's secrets.

34
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:25,924
I made a mistake,
a horrible mistake.

35
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:27,642
I underestimated a stranger.

36
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:30,711
The other things he did,

37
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:32,597
ladies aren't supposed
to talk about those things,

38
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:35,517
but I imagine brothel keepers
talk about them all the time.

39
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,355
I can still feel it.

40
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,575
I don't mean in my tender
heart it still pains me so.

41
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:47,529
I can still feel what he did in
my body standing here right now.

42
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:53,084
I'm so sorry.

43
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:55,086
You said you would protect me.

44
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:58,739
And I will. You must believe me
when I tell you that I will.

45
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:02,293
I don't believe you anymore.
I don't need you anymore.

46
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,212
You can't protect me.

47
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,180
You won't even be able
to protect yourself

48
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,550
if I tell Brienne
to cut you down.

49
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:12,520
And why shouldn't I?

50
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,692
Do you want me
to beg for my life?

51
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,111
If that's what you want, I will.

52
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:24,616
Whatever you ask
that is in my power,

53
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:25,933
I will do.

54
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:29,871
What if I want you
to die here and now?

55
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,608
Then I will die.

56
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:38,946
You freed me from the monsters
who murdered my family

57
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:43,084
and you gave me to other
monsters who murdered my family.

58
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:46,804
<i>Go back to Moat Cailin.</i>

59
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:49,307
My brother and I will take
back the North on our own.

60
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:50,958
I never want to see you again.

61
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:54,262
I would do anything to undo
what's been done to you.

62
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:58,933
I know that I can't.

63
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,738
Will you allow me to say
one more thing before I go?

64
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,911
<i>Your great-uncle
Brynden the Blackfish</i>

65
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:13,665
has gathered what remains of the
Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.

66
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,917
You might consider
seeking him out.

67
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:19,320
The time may come when you
need an army loyal to you.

68
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,422
I have an army.

69
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,457
Your brother's army.

70
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,016
Half-brother.

71
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:02,997
You're not ready.

72
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:08,219
You should go home
before it's too late.

73
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:08,196
You'll never be
one of us, Lady Stark.

74
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,079
She has a point.

75
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,555
None of the first Faceless Men
were born to lords and ladies.

76
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:37,625
They began as slaves
in the mines of Valyria.

77
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,260
Who was the first?

78
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:40,762
He was no one.

79
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:45,099
The Many-Faced God taught
him how to shed his face

80
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,818
and how to give the gift.

81
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:50,354
The man taught others in
exchange for their service.

82
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,908
Many served, many more
gifts were given.

83
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,861
Soon all the masters
and overseers were gone

84
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:59,163
and the Faceless Men fled.

85
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:01,082
Where did they go?

86
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,784
Here.

87
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:06,170
They founded the Free City of
Braavos and built this house.

88
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,508
These were the faces
they wore in life

89
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,160
when they were not
wearing others.

90
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:16,013
The first Faceless Men.

91
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,350
And now a girl is one of them,

92
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,636
if a girl desires.

93
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:25,306
A girl has no desires.

94
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,148
Who?

95
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,358
<i>An actress who calls
herself Lady Crane.</i>

96
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,328
She performs at the theater
in Sheelba Square.

97
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:52,049
<i>A girl has been given
a second chance.</i>

98
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:54,368
There will not be a third.

99
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,554
One way or another,

100
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:59,674
a face will be
added to the hall.

101
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:21,279
Ahh!

102
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,950
Oh, murdered by a boar.

103
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,619
The great big hairy whore.

104
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:32,290
He dug in his tusks
and dug out my guts

105
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,843
and soon I am no more.

106
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:38,846
Oh, come, Father,
in bed you must lie.

107
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:41,849
I love you, Father.
Please don't die.

108
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:45,603
Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.

109
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:49,440
I feel the winds of winter
as they lick across the land.

110
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:52,944
And our son alone
on that cold, cold throne

111
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:55,196
without a guiding hand.

112
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:58,566
Who will teach him strength?
Who will teach him grace?

113
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:02,570
To whom will he turn when it's time to
learn to look darkness in the face?

114
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:06,240
Ned Stark will do fine.
Now bring me more wine.

115
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:10,628
Ooh!

116
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:13,297
Ooh, what's happened here, then?

117
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,249
He brought you here, Ned Stark,

118
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:17,752
'cause you're the brightest
fellow in the land.

119
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:19,420
You should be king of us all

120
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,722
and I should be your Hand.

121
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:24,058
We men of the North
are right good hands

122
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:25,960
at keeping people lawful.

123
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:27,695
I'd ask him for permission,

124
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:29,964
but he smells too bloody awful.

125
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:35,019
<i>I die! I die!</i>

126
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:38,305
And here I now must lie.

127
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:41,993
Oh, woe.
Oh, no.

128
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:47,982
Oh, I am about to go.

129
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,086
Will you stay on
as Joffrey's Hand?

130
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,121
The Iron Throne's what I demand.

131
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:55,122
- You cannot.
- I can.

132
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,123
- You will not.
- I will.

133
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,875
- You dare not.
- I dare yes.

134
00:11:57,961 --> 00:12:00,094
<i>- The line of succession.
- What's that mean?</i>

135
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,963
<i>- The proper progression.
- What's that mean?</i>

136
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:04,498
- The lawful ascension.
- What's that mean?

137
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:19,697
So move along, give me my chair

138
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:21,899
and there won't be
no more trouble.

139
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,022
But we had a deal
all done and dusted.

140
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:31,325
I'm starting to think
you can't be trusted.

141
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,671
Save my father.

142
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:47,276
Truly you should.
Killing the man will do you no good.

143
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,560
- Save him, please.
- Show him mercy.

144
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,179
<i>Show the people what
a good king should be.</i>

145
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:54,515
Good people, you may all relax.

146
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,734
My father's friend
shall be spared the...

147
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:02,239
<i>Father! No!</i>

148
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:05,026
Oh, Father.
Oh!

149
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:15,736
<i>Worry not!</i>

150
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,338
<i>All is well.</i>

151
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:19,340
I have here a decree

152
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:22,209
from my father Tywin Lannister,

153
00:13:22,295 --> 00:13:24,411
the richest man you'll see.

154
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:27,048
He proclaims me
Hand of the King.

155
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,933
The position's mine for life.

156
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:31,418
And he's given me
permission to take

157
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,637
Sansa as my wife.

158
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,476
You'll learn that
what I lack in height,

159
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,811
I make up for in appetite.

160
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:43,280
<i>So let's forget
about your plight,</i>

161
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,483
and go rehearse
our wedding night.

162
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:57,711
It's a wart.
Two warts.

163
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,630
I've got two fucking
warts on my cock.

164
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:03,584
Well, don't worry, love. They usually
go away in five or six years.

165
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:06,954
Oh, wash this, darling.
It stinks of me.

166
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:10,290
You can do better, Bianca, dear.
You must do.

167
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:12,059
I had two lines.

168
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:14,361
There are no small parts.
You rang very false.

169
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,013
I rang very false?

170
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:19,016
What you need, love,
is for someone to ring you true.

171
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:23,487
You weren't complaining
about me last night.

172
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:25,566
<i>May I get you some wine,
Lady Crane?</i>

173
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:27,691
<i>I'm a rum girl, Bobono.</i>

174
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:30,027
You need to know that if
we're going to be intimate.

175
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,695
Of course we're going
to be intimate.

176
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:34,365
It's only a matter of time.

177
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,086
To our children.

178
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,172
May they have your talent.

179
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,174
And your filthy mind.

180
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:52,299
A girl will poison the rum.

181
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:54,635
Lady Crane is the only
one who drinks it.

182
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:01,725
If a girl could use one of
the faces from the hall...

183
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:03,978
A girl is not ready.

184
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:08,949
She's a good actress.

185
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:11,368
So a man has heard.

186
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:14,321
Seems like a decent woman.

187
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:20,744
Does death only come for the wicked
and leave the decent behind?

188
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:24,381
No.

189
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,703
Who wants her dead?

190
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,590
That does not matter.
The price was paid.

191
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,377
The younger actress.

192
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,814
She's jealous because
Lady Crane is better.

193
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,500
A girl must decide if she wants
to serve the Many-Faced God.

194
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:47,571
A girl has decided.

195
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,325
A servant does not
ask questions.

196
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,264
No! No! No!

197
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:28,656
It was you.

198
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:30,457
You made the white walkers.

199
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:32,676
We were at war.

200
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:35,179
<i>We were being slaughtered.</i>

201
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:37,715
<i>Our sacred trees cut down.</i>

202
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,534
We needed to defend ourselves.

203
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:42,136
From whom?

204
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:44,772
From you.

205
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,057
From men.

206
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:59,403
We speak in the presence
of the Drowned God.

207
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:01,572
In his name we gather today

208
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:05,292
to choose a new king
as our leader.

209
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:07,244
Who makes a claim?

210
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:14,418
I am Yara Greyjoy,

211
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:16,920
daughter of Balon Greyjoy,

212
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:19,256
King of the Iron Islands.

213
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:22,542
I claim the Salt Throne.

214
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:25,212
We've never had a queen.
Not once.

215
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,731
There are many things
we've never done.

216
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,567
We've never made our mark
upon the world.

217
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:34,104
The great lords of
Westeros pay us no mind

218
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,241
until our little raids
buzz through their kingdoms

219
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,992
<i>long enough
to become a nuisance.</i>

220
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,362
Then they swat us down.

221
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,948
They conquer us, humiliate us,

222
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:47,501
<i>and go right back
to forgetting we exist.</i>

223
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,503
Aye!

224
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,922
- We are a sea people.
- Aye!

225
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,292
- Our god is a sea god.
- Aye!

226
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:57,544
When I am queen, we will
build a fleet that...

227
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,346
- You shall not be queen!
- I am not finished!

228
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:02,015
Yes, you are!
A woman will not lead us.

229
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:05,436
Not when Balon's
own male heir has returned.

230
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,498
I am Theon Greyjoy...

231
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,886
last living son
of Balon Greyjoy.

232
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:49,513
And she is your rightful ruler.

233
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:50,848
Aye!

234
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,566
Those of you that have
sailed under her,

235
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,568
and there are many of you here,

236
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,271
- <i>you know what she is.</i>
- Aye!

237
00:19:57,356 --> 00:19:58,655
- She is a reaver.
- Aye!

238
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:00,991
- She is a warrior.
- Aye!

239
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,860
She is ironborn!

240
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:04,578
Aye!

241
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:07,247
We will find no better leader.

242
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:12,119
This is our queen.

243
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:21,328
<i>Yara! Yara! Yara!</i>

244
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,014
I'm Euron Greyjoy.

245
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,550
I claim the Salt Throne.

246
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,196
Niece.

247
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:41,783
Nephew.

248
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:45,452
Little Theon.

249
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:50,040
Heard you managed to fuck
things right into the ground.

250
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,544
<i>Captured a castle
you couldn't keep.</i>

251
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:56,663
Got yourself taken prisoner.

252
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:58,966
Even heard you have no cock.

253
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,222
Explains why you think
a woman can be king.

254
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,090
When did you return, Uncle?

255
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:09,393
A few days ago.

256
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:11,878
I had some things
to take care of.

257
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,730
Long overdue.

258
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm glad you're here.

259
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:22,356
Now I know what my first
act as queen will be.

260
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:25,275
To execute the man
who killed my father.

261
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,200
I did.

262
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:35,419
I killed him.

263
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:39,506
Threw him right over
a rope bridge

264
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:42,759
and watched him fall.

265
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:44,545
<i>He was leading us nowhere</i>

266
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,264
and we would still be heading
there if it weren't for me.

267
00:21:47,383 --> 00:21:50,434
<i>No one loved him.
No one wanted to follow him.</i>

268
00:21:50,553 --> 00:21:53,270
He led us into two wars
we couldn't win.

269
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:57,357
I apologize to you all for
not killing him years ago.

270
00:21:57,443 --> 00:21:59,643
That would have been hard to do.

271
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:01,728
You weren't here.

272
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:05,399
Last I heard, you were gallivanting
around the world having a grand old time.

273
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:06,950
Gallivanting?

274
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:08,768
That the sort of thing
you start to say

275
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:11,288
once your dick gets chopped off?

276
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:14,241
<i>Did the great lords of Westeros
teach you words like that?</i>

277
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:17,411
You were gone.

278
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:18,996
Yara was here.

279
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:21,798
<i>Being ironborn.
Leading ironborn.</i>

280
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:24,801
<i>Getting ready to bring us
back to glory.</i>

281
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,386
<i>And how will she do that?</i>

282
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:30,841
I will build the largest fleet
the world has ever seen.

283
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:37,264
Right idea, except I'm the one who's
going to build the Iron Fleet

284
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,650
<i>because I'm the one
who knows how to use it.</i>

285
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:41,234
<i>I've been all over the world.</i>

286
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,655
I've seen more of it
than all of you combined.

287
00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:47,691
And across the sea
there is a person

288
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:51,645
who hates the great lords of
Westeros just as much as we do.

289
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,331
Someone with a large army,

290
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,201
three large dragons,
and no husband.

291
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:00,537
<i>I'm going to build that fleet</i>

292
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:02,839
and I'm going to
gallivant right over

293
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,092
and give it
to Daenerys Targaryen

294
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,594
along with my big cock.

295
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
You're going to seduce
the Dragon Queen?

296
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,016
I'm not going to seduce her.
The Iron Fleet will seduce her.

297
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:15,936
And together we're going
to take the Seven Kingdoms.

298
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,389
I wasn't born to be king.

299
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:22,008
I paid the iron price

300
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,560
and here I stand.

301
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:29,116
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

302
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:33,153
Euron! Euron!
Euron! Euron!

303
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:35,405
Euron! Euron!

304
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:49,336
May Euron, your servant,
be born again

305
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:51,972
from the sea as you were.

306
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:55,142
<i>Bless him with salt.
Bless him with stone.</i>

307
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,144
<i>Bless him with steel.</i>

308
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,879
<i>Listen to the waves.
Listen to the god.</i>

309
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:03,100
<i>He is speaking to us and he says</i>

310
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:08,238
<i>we shall have no king
but Euron Greyjoy.</i>

311
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:11,558
Let the sea wash your follies
and your vanities away.

312
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,910
<i>Let the old Euron drown.</i>

313
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:16,830
<i>Let his lungs
fill with seawater.</i>

314
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:25,789
<i>Let the fish eat
the scales off his eyes.</i>

315
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:28,458
<i>What is dead may never die,</i>

316
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:32,212
but rises again
harder and stronger.

317
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,531
What is dead may never die.

318
00:25:41,617 --> 00:25:44,868
What is dead
may never die.

319
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:01,268
Where are my niece and nephew?

320
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:08,358
Let's go murder them.

321
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:30,630
<i>They stole our best ships.</i>

322
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:33,917
Won't be enough to save them.

323
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,871
Go back to your homes.

324
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,340
Chop down every tree
you can find.

325
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:43,009
Quarter-saw the timber
and start building.

326
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:45,178
I want every man bending planks.

327
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:48,765
I want every woman
spinning flax for sails.

328
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:51,184
Build me a thousand ships

329
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,737
and I will give you this world.

330
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,675
I banished you twice.

331
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:19,930
You came back twice.

332
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,185
And you saved my life.

333
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:31,808
So I can't take you back

334
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:34,027
and I can't send you away.

335
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,812
You must send me away.

336
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,279
Is there a cure?

337
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:55,665
I don't know.

338
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:58,635
How long does it take?

339
00:27:58,754 --> 00:28:01,254
I don't know that either.

340
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,820
But I've seen what happens
when it goes far enough.

341
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,300
I'll end things before that.

342
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:12,565
I'm sorry.

343
00:28:13,602 --> 00:28:14,818
I'm so sorry.

344
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:17,136
Don't be.

345
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,689
All I've ever wanted
was to serve you.

346
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:25,445
Tyrion Lannister was right.

347
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:30,667
I love you.

348
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,290
I'll always love you.

349
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,880
Good-bye, khaleesi.

350
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:51,554
Do not walk away
from your queen,

351
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,723
Jorah the Andal.

352
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:58,144
You have not been dismissed.

353
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:01,865
You pledged yourself to me.

354
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:05,285
You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

355
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:10,907
<i>Well, I command you
to find the cure</i>

356
00:29:10,993 --> 00:29:13,543
<i>wherever it is in this world.</i>

357
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,631
I command you to heal yourself

358
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:21,584
<i>and then return to me.</i>

359
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:27,424
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

360
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:30,010
I need you by my side.

361
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,385
In the last fortnight since
our pact with the Masters,

362
00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:15,772
how many killings have been carried
out by the Sons of the Harpy?

363
00:30:15,891 --> 00:30:17,440
None.

364
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,479
And how many Masters have been
butchered by the free men?

365
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:23,146
Two, but that was
the day of the pact.

366
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:24,981
<i>Since then, nothing.</i>

367
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:28,101
So it's safe to say that a
fragile peace has taken hold.

368
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,569
For now.

369
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:31,571
For now is the best we
get in our profession.

370
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:33,156
It's not enough.

371
00:30:33,241 --> 00:30:35,075
Considering the city was
on the brink of civil war,

372
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,720
I'd say it's a good start.

373
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:39,329
It's not enough
for Meereen to have peace.

374
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:41,898
They need to know Daenerys
is responsible for it.

375
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,784
The Sons of the Harpy
have a good story.

376
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:47,053
Resist the foreign invaders.

377
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,255
Our queen has
an even better story.

378
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:54,010
Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains and all that.

379
00:30:54,096 --> 00:30:56,479
The people know
who brought them freedom.

380
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:59,065
Yes, but do they know
who brought them security?

381
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,184
Who brought about
an end to the violence?

382
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:03,903
We need someone
the people trust,

383
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:07,407
someone they know cannot
be bought or influenced.

384
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:10,643
Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

385
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,996
Who said anything about "him"?

386
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,502
You stand in the presence of Kinvara,

387
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:21,422
High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis,

388
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,132
the Flame of Truth,

389
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:24,592
the Light of Wisdom,

390
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:28,471
the First Servant of the Lord of Light.

391
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:38,147
Welcome to Meereen.

392
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:42,692
That's about the extent
of my Valyrian.

393
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:51,284
Thank you for travelling
all this way.

394
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:55,205
I know from personal experience how
uncomfortable the journey can be.

395
00:31:59,828 --> 00:32:02,962
The truth is we need your help.

396
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,166
We had hoped that we could
somehow persuade you to...

397
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:08,532
You don't need to persuade me.

398
00:32:08,587 --> 00:32:10,386
I came to help.

399
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:13,673
Daenerys Stormborn is the
one who was promised.

400
00:32:13,758 --> 00:32:17,644
From the fire she was
reborn to remake the world.

401
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,729
Yes.

402
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:21,714
She has freed the slaves
from their chains

403
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:25,351
and crucified the Masters
for their sins.

404
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:27,220
She did indeed.

405
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:30,190
Her dragons are fire made flesh,

406
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:32,108
a gift from the Lord of Light.

407
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:35,111
But you heard all of this before,
haven't you?

408
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:37,580
On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

409
00:32:39,868 --> 00:32:43,253
<i>The dragons will purify
nonbelievers by the thousands,</i>

410
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:45,738
burning their sins
and flesh away.

411
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,543
Ideally we'd avoid purifying
too many nonbelievers.

412
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:53,630
The Mother of Dragons has followers
of many different faiths.

413
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:56,916
You want your queen to be
worshipped and obeyed.

414
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,802
And while she's gone,
you want her advisors

415
00:32:59,888 --> 00:33:01,587
to be worshipped and obeyed.

416
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,924
I'd settle for obeyed.

417
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:08,027
<i>I will summon
my most eloquent priests.</i>

418
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:10,730
They will spread the word.

419
00:33:10,815 --> 00:33:14,433
Daenerys has been sent to lead
the people against the darkness

420
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:18,621
in this war and in the
great war still to come.

421
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,206
That sounds most excellent.

422
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,276
A man named Stannis
Baratheon was anointed

423
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:26,129
as the chosen one
by one of your priestesses.

424
00:33:26,248 --> 00:33:29,082
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

425
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:32,335
He attacked King's Landing
and was soundly defeated

426
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,554
by the man standing beside me.

427
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:37,106
Last I had heard,
he had been defeated again,

428
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:41,394
this time at Winterfell
and this time for good.

429
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,597
We'd be most grateful for any support
you could provide the queen.

430
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:47,800
I suppose it's hard for a
fanatic to admit a mistake.

431
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:51,437
Isn't that the whole point
of being a fanatic?

432
00:33:51,523 --> 00:33:53,690
You're always right.

433
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:56,409
Everything is the Lord's will.

434
00:33:56,494 --> 00:34:00,163
Everything is the Lord's will.

435
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:03,032
But men and women make mistakes.

436
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:05,084
Even honest servants
of the Lord.

437
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,122
And you,
an honest servant of the Lord,

438
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:11,708
why should I trust you
to know any more

439
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:13,713
than the priestess
who counseled Stannis?

440
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:16,763
My friend has a healthy
skepticism of religion,

441
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:19,599
but we are all loyal
supporters of the queen.

442
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:26,693
Everyone is what they are

443
00:34:26,808 --> 00:34:30,509
and where they are for a reason.

444
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:33,780
Terrible things
happen for a reason.

445
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:37,533
Take what happened to you,
Lord Varys, when you were a child.

446
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:40,987
<i>If not for your mutilation</i>

447
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:42,989
<i>at the hand of
a second-rate sorcerer,</i>

448
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:46,326
<i>you wouldn't be here
helping the Lord's Chosen</i>

449
00:34:46,411 --> 00:34:49,528
<i>bring his light into the world.</i>

450
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,865
Knowledge has made you powerful.

451
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:56,052
But there's still
so much you don't know.

452
00:34:58,173 --> 00:35:01,174
<i>Do you remember
what you heard that night</i>

453
00:35:01,259 --> 00:35:04,811
<i>when the sorcerer tossed
your parts in the fire?</i>

454
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:10,516
You heard a voice call out from the flames.
Do you remember?

455
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:16,823
Should I tell you
what the voice said?

456
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:20,493
Should I tell you the name
of the one who spoke?

457
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:32,288
We serve the same queen.

458
00:35:32,374 --> 00:35:34,424
If you are her true friend,

459
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:37,176
you have nothing
to fear from me.

460
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,654
What?

461
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:14,410
He saw me, the Night King!

462
00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:16,679
- <i>He saw me!</i>
- He touched you.

463
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,349
I don't know.
He was close, but...

464
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:21,435
He touched you.

465
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:26,805
He knows you are here.
He'll come for you.

466
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,291
But he can't get in.

467
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:31,944
He can now.
His mark is on you.

468
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,110
You must leave, all of you.

469
00:39:38,036 --> 00:39:39,985
<i>Come on, Hodor.
Help me with the sledge.</i>

470
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:41,871
Hodor.

471
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:43,940
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

472
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:46,943
- The time has come.
- The time for what?

473
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:50,096
For you to become me.

474
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:54,283
But am I ready?

475
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:56,302
No.

476
00:39:58,222 --> 00:40:00,973
We can't defend the north
from the walkers

477
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:02,808
and the south from the Boltons.

478
00:40:02,894 --> 00:40:04,843
If we want to survive,
we need Winterfell

479
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:07,730
and to take Winterfell,
we need more men.

480
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:13,619
<i>Aside from the Starks
and the Boltons,</i>

481
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:16,405
the most powerful
houses in the North

482
00:40:16,491 --> 00:40:18,541
are the Umbers, the Karstarks,

483
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,292
and the Manderlys.

484
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:23,079
The Umbers and the Karstarks

485
00:40:23,164 --> 00:40:25,131
have already declared
for the Boltons,

486
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,849
so we're not doing
so well there.

487
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:29,585
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

488
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:31,921
But the Karstarks
declared for Ramsay

489
00:40:32,006 --> 00:40:34,540
without knowing
they had another choice.

490
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,976
I beg your pardon, my lady,

491
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:40,212
but they know that a Stark
beheaded their father.

492
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:42,674
I don't think we can
count on them either.

493
00:40:44,018 --> 00:40:46,702
How well do you know
the North, Ser Davos?

494
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:48,187
Precious little, my lady.

495
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:50,406
<i>My father always said
Northerners are different.</i>

496
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:54,226
More loyal,
more suspicious of outsiders.

497
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:55,894
They may well be loyal,

498
00:40:55,997 --> 00:40:57,947
but how many rose up
against the Boltons

499
00:40:58,032 --> 00:41:00,112
when they betrayed your family?

500
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,754
I may not know the North,
but I know men.

501
00:41:04,872 --> 00:41:07,373
They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world

502
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:10,376
and even the bravest of
them don't want to see

503
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:13,779
their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.

504
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:17,216
If Jon's going to convince
them to fight alongside him,

505
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:19,268
they need to believe
it's a fight they can win.

506
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:21,937
There are more than three
other houses in the North...

507
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:24,690
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,

508
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,392
<i>Mazin, Hornwood.</i>

509
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:30,095
Two dozen more.
Together they equal all the others.

510
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:32,148
We can start small and build.

511
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:34,700
<i>The North remembers.</i>

512
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,268
<i>They remember the Stark name.</i>

513
00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:38,270
People will still risk
everything for it,

514
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:40,573
from White Harbor
to Ramsay's own door.

515
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:42,875
I don't doubt it.

516
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,077
But Jon doesn't have
the Stark name.

517
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:47,246
No, but I do.

518
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:52,785
Jon is every bit
as much Ned Stark's son

519
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:54,670
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

520
00:41:54,756 --> 00:41:56,806
<i>And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,</i>

521
00:41:56,924 --> 00:41:59,892
<i>but they will back us against
the Boltons without question.</i>

522
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:01,510
I didn't know the Tullys
still had an army.

523
00:42:01,596 --> 00:42:03,562
My uncle the Blackfish
has reformed it

524
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:04,897
and retaken Riverrun.

525
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:07,066
How do you know that?

526
00:42:08,436 --> 00:42:11,437
Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

527
00:42:13,441 --> 00:42:15,191
That's good.

528
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:17,309
The Blackfish is a legend.

529
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:19,812
His support would mean
a great deal.

530
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:22,915
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

531
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,360
almost starts to look
like a winning side.

532
00:42:27,622 --> 00:42:29,705
I've sworn
to protect you, my lady.

533
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,590
You heard them.
We need more men

534
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:33,492
and my uncle has an army.

535
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,127
We can send
the Blackfish a raven.

536
00:42:35,213 --> 00:42:37,263
Can't risk Ramsay
intercepting it.

537
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:39,014
It has to be you.

538
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:41,414
Ride for Riverrun.
My uncle will talk to you

539
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:43,869
and you'll know
how to talk to him.

540
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,056
What is it?

541
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,910
I don't like leaving
you here alone.

542
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:52,294
With Jon?

543
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:55,180
Not him.
He seems trustworthy.

544
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:57,283
A bit brooding, perhaps.

545
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:59,451
I suppose that's
understandable, considering.

546
00:43:01,155 --> 00:43:03,038
The others, though.

547
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:08,861
Davos and the Red Woman helped
a man murder his own brother

548
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:10,563
with bloodmagic.

549
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:13,249
<i>And when Stannis paid for his crime,
where were they?</i>

550
00:43:13,351 --> 00:43:17,553
Already out looking for a
leader with better prospects.

551
00:43:17,672 --> 00:43:20,089
And that wildling fellow
with the beard...

552
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:23,494
Jon isn't Tormund.
Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman

553
00:43:23,544 --> 00:43:26,545
or Stannis for that matter.
Jon is Jon.

554
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:30,099
He's my brother. He'll keep me safe.
I trust him.

555
00:43:32,587 --> 00:43:36,505
Then why did you lie to him when he asked
you how you learned about Riverrun?

556
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,399
New dress?

557
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:50,235
I made it myself.
Do you like it?

558
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:54,340
Yeah, it's...
I like the wolf bit.

559
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:58,544
Good, because I made
this for you.

560
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:03,549
<i>I made it like the one
Father used to wear.</i>

561
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:06,552
As near as I can remember.

562
00:44:08,306 --> 00:44:10,022
Thank you, Sansa.

563
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:11,774
You're welcome.

564
00:44:31,996 --> 00:44:34,446
Don't knock it down
while I'm gone.

565
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:36,465
I'll do my best.

566
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:44,006
Good luck.

567
00:45:15,122 --> 00:45:17,673
Should we close the gate,
Lord Commander?

568
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:19,875
I'm not the Lord Comman...

569
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:28,600
Yeah, ahem,
close the bloody gate.

570
00:45:40,564 --> 00:45:42,347
<i>We can go home now, Hodor.</i>

571
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,017
Well, maybe not home home,

572
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,319
but somewhere that isn't a cave.

573
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:48,821
Hodor.

574
00:45:48,906 --> 00:45:50,956
Eat something that isn't moss.

575
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,494
I want an egg.
How do you like 'em?

576
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:58,530
Boiled? Fried up
with some butter?

577
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,215
Hodor.

578
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:03,886
With a rasher of bacon
and some blood sausage.

579
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:05,304
Hodor.

580
00:47:05,232 --> 00:47:07,449
Get Bran and run!

581
00:47:19,747 --> 00:47:21,713
Bran.
Bran, wake up.

582
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:24,833
- Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

583
00:47:24,919 --> 00:47:26,468
Bran, wake up.

584
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:39,131
<i>- Gods keep you on the kingsroad.
- Take it easy.</i>

585
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:40,349
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

586
00:47:43,604 --> 00:47:44,803
Hodor.

587
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,855
Hodor. Hodor.

588
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:49,441
Help me!

589
00:48:08,879 --> 00:48:10,359
<i>Go!</i>

590
00:48:11,132 --> 00:48:12,631
Go!

591
00:48:59,847 --> 00:49:02,097
<i>Remember that
you are a Stark.</i>

592
00:49:02,183 --> 00:49:04,566
Comport yourself
with dignity at the Vale

593
00:49:04,685 --> 00:49:07,052
<i>and try to stay out of fights.</i>

594
00:49:07,154 --> 00:49:09,521
Yes, Father.

595
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:14,076
But if you have to fight, win.

596
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:19,615
Bran!
Bran, wake up!

597
00:49:29,927 --> 00:49:33,011
Bran! Bran!
Bran, wake up.

598
00:49:33,097 --> 00:49:35,881
- Bran! Bran, wake up!
- Hodor. Hodor.

599
00:49:41,805 --> 00:49:43,045
You have to wake up.

600
00:49:43,107 --> 00:49:45,357
- We need Hodor.
- Hodor. Hodor.

601
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:47,092
<i>Bran, we need Hodor.</i>

602
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:49,594
<i>Bran, you have to wake up.
We need Hodor.</i>

603
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,949
Hodor. Hodor.

604
00:50:02,826 --> 00:50:04,442
Bran, we're all going to die!

605
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:06,161
<i>Bran, wake up!</i>

606
00:50:06,247 --> 00:50:09,748
<i>We're all going to die!
Bran! Bran!</i>

607
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:11,667
Bran, you have to wake up.
We need Hodor.

608
00:50:11,752 --> 00:50:13,335
Hodor. Hodor.

609
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,671
Warg into Hodor now!

610
00:50:15,756 --> 00:50:17,839
<i>Bran, wake up.
We need Hodor.</i>

611
00:50:17,925 --> 00:50:21,059
<i>We need Hodor.
Warg into Hodor now! Now!</i>

612
00:50:21,145 --> 00:50:23,178
Listen to your friend, Brandon.

613
00:50:24,565 --> 00:50:26,398
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

614
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:28,300
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

615
00:50:28,402 --> 00:50:30,485
Hodor.
Hodor.

616
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:08,273
- Summer!
<i>- Go.</i>

617
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:09,941
Go!

618
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:49,204
<i>The time has come.</i>

619
00:51:51,769 --> 00:51:54,069
Leave me.

620
00:52:19,797 --> 00:52:21,930
- What are you doing?
- Go!

621
00:53:11,098 --> 00:53:13,131
Hodor, hurry!

622
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:14,233
Hodor!

623
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,870
Hold the door!

624
00:53:34,955 --> 00:53:37,339
<i>Hold the door!</i>

625
00:53:40,844 --> 00:53:42,677
<i>Hold the door!</i>

626
00:53:44,932 --> 00:53:47,349
<i>Hold the door!</i>

627
00:53:55,392 --> 00:53:57,392
Hold the door!

628
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:05,951
<i>- Hold the door!
- Wylis!</i>

629
00:54:06,036 --> 00:54:07,702
What's the matter?

630
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:10,539
- <i>Hold the door!</i>
- Come on, son.

631
00:54:10,657 --> 00:54:12,290
Hold the door!

632
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:21,967
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

633
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:25,420
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

634
00:54:25,506 --> 00:54:27,506
Hold the door!

635
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:29,508
<i>Hold the door!</i>

636
00:54:57,371 --> 00:54:59,754
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

637
00:54:59,873 --> 00:55:02,507
<i>Hold the door!
Hold the door!</i>

638
00:55:02,593 --> 00:55:05,293
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

639
00:55:05,379 --> 00:55:08,013
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

640
00:55:08,098 --> 00:55:10,765
Hold the door!
Hold door!

641
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:13,218
<i>Hold door!
Hold the door!</i>

642
00:55:13,303 --> 00:55:17,556
Hold the door!
Hold door! Hold door!

643
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:20,442
Hold door!
Hodor!

644
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:23,228
Hodor!
Hodor!

645
00:55:23,313 --> 00:55:25,897
Hodor! Hodor!

646
00:55:25,983 --> 00:55:27,382
Hodor!
