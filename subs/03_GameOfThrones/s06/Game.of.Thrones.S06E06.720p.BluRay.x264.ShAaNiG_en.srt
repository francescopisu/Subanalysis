2
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:51,455
Burn them all!

3
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:53,023
Where's my sister?

4
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:56,794
Burn them all!

5
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:28,659
Please.

6
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:43,740
Burn them. Burn them all!

7
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,123
<i>Burn them all!</i>

8
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,201
Meera.

9
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:13,270
They found us.

10
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:23,447
I'm so sorry.

11
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,046
Come with me, now.

12
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:36,386
The dead don't rest.

13
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:03,914
It's so green.

14
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:05,682
Oh, yes.

15
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:07,584
Once you get south of the Riverlands,

16
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:10,587
very different sorts of
trees start to take over.

17
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:14,391
Maple, elm, beech, poplar.

18
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:19,863
The odd willow.

19
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:22,432
And of course now that summer's over,

20
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,335
you'll start seeing the
autumn colors coming in.

21
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:31,842
Still, you'll find more green
here than anywhere else.

22
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:35,612
You're nervous.
You're a nervous talker.

23
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:42,819
That's not any better
being a nervous mute.

24
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:45,389
I didn't think
I'd ever come back here

25
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:47,758
after my father made me
renounce my title

26
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,726
and inheritance

27
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:52,262
and, well, threaten
to kill me if I didn't.

28
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:56,199
A person just doesn't
feel welcome at that point.

29
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,505
And I certainly didn't expect to
be introducing him to my family.

30
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:05,442
So you know what to tell them.

31
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:07,411
That Little Sam is your baby.

32
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:09,079
Yes, now that's very important.

33
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:11,681
If he thinks that
Little Sam is his grandchild,

34
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:13,650
he'll take you in.

35
00:07:13,752 --> 00:07:17,154
He'll get an education.
He'll learn to read.

36
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:20,157
And you can help teach him. Huh?

37
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,193
What did you tell
your family about me?

38
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,066
I told them I met you in the North.

39
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:31,034
Did you tell them how far north?

40
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:34,237
Well, it wasn't a very
large piece of parchment.

41
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,019
You didn't tell them
where I'm really from?

42
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:37,908
You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

43
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,110
The thing is...

44
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,546
my father doesn't like wildlings.

45
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:47,017
He hoped I'd make a man of myself
by "killing some bloody wildlings,"

46
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:50,687
so it's probably a good subject
to avoid if at all possible.

47
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,926
I think we're here.

48
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:26,690
Sam.

49
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:29,025
Oh, Sam.

50
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:31,261
Oh, hello, Mother.

51
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:35,932
I never thought I'd see you again.

52
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:38,635
- You look wonderful.
- Oh.

53
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,873
Talla?

54
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:45,742
Gods, you're a woman now.

55
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:48,311
Father says I have
to marry Symun Fossoway.

56
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:51,448
- He has yellow teeth--
- That's enough, Talla.

57
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:57,821
Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.

58
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:02,359
Oh, my.

59
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:04,561
You are lovely.

60
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:09,065
I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

61
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:15,238
Oh, and this,

62
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,741
this is our son Samwell.

63
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:25,782
Hello, little one.

64
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:29,252
It's me, your grandmother.

65
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:32,455
May I hold him?

66
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:34,457
Yes, of course.

67
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:40,363
Oh.

68
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:42,899
You have a curious mind, I can tell.

69
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:46,269
You'll be a scholar like your father.

70
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:50,407
Where is Father?
And Dickon?

71
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,342
They're on a hunt.

72
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,579
<i>They'll join us for dinner.</i>

73
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:59,015
Come inside.
Such a journey.

74
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:00,817
You must be exhausted.

75
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,287
Come, you'll be wanting a
bath after all that travel.

76
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:06,489
Oh, and a dress for dinner.

77
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,258
You can wear one of mine.

78
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,193
What's your color?

79
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:12,662
Midnight blue or silver?

80
00:10:12,764 --> 00:10:14,864
Silver, maybe.
Come.

81
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,334
You can choose one of my
bedrooms if you want.

82
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:28,878
Is there no other way?

83
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,547
You're afraid for her?

84
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:33,416
Of course I'm afraid for her!

85
00:10:35,988 --> 00:10:39,589
It just seems very dangerous.

86
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:42,125
She'll be protected the entire way.

87
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:44,794
The Faith Militant are very stern

88
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:47,497
with those who overstep their bounds.

89
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:52,902
And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.

90
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:55,939
I suspect the gods will
predispose the common people

91
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,575
to gentleness on her behalf.

92
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:01,144
She's truly opened her heart to them.

93
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:05,015
She's always been very devoted
to the poor and the unfortunate.

94
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:07,951
And now she's devoted
to the gods as well.

95
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:12,389
Would you like to see her?

96
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:35,478
Have they hurt you?

97
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,980
Have they mistreated you?

98
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:40,150
- No, Your Grace.
- I've missed you.

99
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:41,951
More than you could know.

100
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,220
We'll be together again soon

101
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:47,057
and everything will be
better than it was before.

102
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,092
Better how?

103
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:50,560
Soon the--

104
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:54,831
walk of atonement.

105
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:58,468
He says there's no other way.

106
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,671
Have you spoken to him at
all, the High Sparrow?

107
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:05,141
Yes, a few times.

108
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:06,576
Have you?

109
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,178
Yes, I have.

110
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,947
He's not quite what we
thought he was, is he?

111
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:15,218
You think I'm mad.

112
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,387
I sound mad.

113
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,422
No.
No, you don't.

114
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:21,558
You--
you could never.

115
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,326
You're right, he's not.

116
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:25,128
He's a lot more--

117
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,763
He is.

118
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:28,965
There's something about him.

119
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,134
His way of looking at the world.

120
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:38,675
It's not an easy thing admitting
to yourself what you really are.

121
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:40,710
It's taken me a while.

122
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:42,846
He's helped me.

123
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:44,848
What are you talking about?

124
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,285
You're a good person. You've
always been a good person.

125
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:52,555
You're the best person I know.

126
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:55,658
I was just telling him about
your devotion to the poor.

127
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:57,560
Ah, yes, I visited their hovels

128
00:12:57,662 --> 00:13:01,064
and I fed them soup and I made
sure I was seen doing it.

129
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:05,869
I never gave them what
they really needed, though.

130
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:10,640
I've had lots of time to think about
how good I was at seeming good.

131
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:14,844
All those stories I told
myself about who I was

132
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:17,580
and why I did the things I did.

133
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:21,484
There were so many lies
in those stories.

134
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:24,988
I don't understand.

135
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,257
It's all right.
It really is.

136
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:30,827
It's such a relief
to let go of those lies.

137
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:37,767
What about Loras?

138
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:41,304
I love my brother.

139
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:45,241
I will always love my brother.

140
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,646
His soul is pure and perfect.

141
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:52,248
His sins don't erase that purity,

142
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,384
they only obscure it.

143
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:58,888
He just needs to atone for them.

144
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,424
We all do.

145
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:04,727
Sooner or later, one way or another.

146
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:09,098
The gods have a plan for us all.

147
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:27,283
It's hard to walk in this.

148
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:31,387
It's beautiful.

149
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:35,058
You're beautiful.

150
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,109
This venison, it's very tasty.

151
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,745
Is it from today's hunt?

152
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:30,747
Well, no.

153
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,782
We haven't been able
to cure that one yet.

154
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:34,784
<i>This is last week's.</i>

155
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:38,421
Oh, of course.
Sorry.

156
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:40,490
Long journey.

157
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:43,092
Brought it down from 70 yards.

158
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:44,794
One shot.

159
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:48,331
Oh, that's a fair distance.

160
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:51,301
So do you do much hunting
up at the Wall?

161
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:54,070
Oh, yes.
Yes.

162
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,738
A good amount.

163
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:58,474
North of the Wall,

164
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:00,710
you don't hunt, you don't eat.

165
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:02,278
Mm-hmm.

166
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,247
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

167
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,951
Rabbits.

168
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:10,320
<i>Sometimes squirrels.</i>

169
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:17,327
I say "we," it's my
friend Jon mostly.

170
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,228
Sometimes Edd.

171
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:20,997
<i>Oh, and Gilly.</i>

172
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:24,067
She's-- she's quite
a good hunter as well.

173
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:27,403
Um, huntress.

174
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,706
<i>I imagine it's
common where you're from.</i>

175
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:33,242
We once met a man, Lord Umber from
Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,

176
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,578
<i>who said he taught all
his daughters how to hunt.</i>

177
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,181
Your father
taught you to hunt?

178
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:40,116
Our father would never teach us.

179
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:44,220
I think our father could learn a
thing or two from your father.

180
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:45,622
That's enough of that.

181
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:50,660
Samwell, would you care
for more bread?

182
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:53,730
Oh, yes.
Yes, please.

183
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:55,398
Thank you, Mother.

184
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:01,638
Not fat enough already?

185
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:16,419
I travelled south under orders
from the Lord Commander.

186
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:18,755
- He wants me to--
- I read your letter.

187
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:22,558
You're to be a maester.

188
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:23,993
Yes.

189
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:25,862
And once I have my chain,

190
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:28,464
I'll return to Castle Black.

191
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:31,768
I thought the Night's Watch
might make a man of you.

192
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:35,571
Something resembling a man at least.

193
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:40,510
You managed to stay soft and fat.

194
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:45,014
Your nose buried in books.

195
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:49,552
Spending your life reading about
the achievements of better men.

196
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:53,122
I'll wager you still can't sit
a horse or wield a sword.

197
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:56,325
Randyll, to be maester of the
Night's Watch is a great honor.

198
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:58,761
He can wield a sword.

199
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:02,198
He killed a Thenn.

200
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,435
He killed a white walker.

201
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:08,938
There's no such thing.

202
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:14,077
I saw it with my own eyes on
our way down to Castle Black.

203
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,814
He drove a dagger
into the walker's heart.

204
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:21,417
He risked his own life
to save mine more than once.

205
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,121
He's a greater warrior than
either of you will ever be.

206
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:30,460
Your way down to Castle Black?

207
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:35,531
<i>Where did he kill a white walker?</i>

208
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:40,236
Where are you from?

209
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:42,672
How'd you come to meet my son?

210
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:47,176
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

211
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:49,278
- Where?
- Gilly.

212
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,547
- North of the Wall.
- <i>North of the Wall?</i>

213
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:58,020
You're a wildling.

214
00:19:05,263 --> 00:19:09,432
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war
against these savages for centuries

215
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:13,069
and here I sit hosting one in my hall

216
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:16,272
<i>thanks to my son.</i>

217
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:20,042
See that sword?

218
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:25,848
It's called Heartsbane.

219
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,652
It's been in our family
for 500 years.

220
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:31,821
<i>It's Valyrian steel.</i>

221
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:34,390
<i>Only a handful of them
left in the world.</i>

222
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:38,361
It's supposed to go to my
firstborn son after I die.

223
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:40,096
To him.

224
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:44,767
He will never wield that sword.

225
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:48,971
If he were to become
Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,

226
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:51,374
it would be the end of this house.

227
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:57,013
I took you for a Mole's
Town whore when I saw you

228
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:58,681
and I made my peace with that.

229
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:00,550
Who else would have him?

230
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,120
But I overestimated him.

231
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:07,390
<i>No.</i>

232
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:13,329
It was a wildling whore
that seduced my son.

233
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,600
This you getting back at me, boy?

234
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:23,940
Hmm? Bringing that to my table
and making me dine with it?

235
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:28,845
<i>And you got what you
were after, didn't you?</i>

236
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:33,216
A bastard.
A half-breed bastard.

237
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:35,885
Your invitation into our home.

238
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:39,021
Come, my dear.
Talla.

239
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:42,191
I've lost my appetite.

240
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:43,659
He dishonors us.

241
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:46,629
You dishonor yourself.

242
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:54,003
Your mother's a fine woman.
You're not worthy of her.

243
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:01,110
To please her, I'll take the wildling in.
She can work in the kitchens.

244
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:04,213
The bastard will be raised here.

245
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:10,620
But this will be the last night
you ever spend at Horn Hill.

246
00:21:18,396 --> 00:21:21,597
I'm sorry I let him
treat you that way.

247
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:25,067
I was afraid he'd turn
you and Little Sam away.

248
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:28,070
I'm not angry at you.

249
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:30,206
I'm angry that horrible people

250
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,808
can treat good people that
way and get away with it.

251
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:40,349
When do you have to go?

252
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,354
First light.

253
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,733
Say good-bye
to him for me.

254
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,111
You're not what
he thinks you are, Sam.

255
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:11,681
He doesn't know what you are.

256
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:17,019
Good-bye, Gilly.

257
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,232
- Sam?
- We're leaving.

258
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:05,167
- What?
- Get your things.

259
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:08,304
I don't have any things.

260
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:11,240
- What are you doing?
- We belong together.

261
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:13,242
All of us.

262
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:15,878
What about your mother and sister?

263
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,913
Oh, they'll understand.

264
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,682
Your sister's dress.

265
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:21,650
She won't mind.

266
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:25,454
Looks better on you anyway.

267
00:23:25,556 --> 00:23:27,523
Sam.

268
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,692
That's your father's sword.

269
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:31,827
It's my family's sword.

270
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:38,401
Sam.

271
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:41,003
Won't he come for it?

272
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,807
He can bloody well try.

273
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,247
The lion and the rose are one.

274
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:53,382
I thank the gods above.

275
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:55,985
And to you, my beauteous bride,

276
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:58,120
I pledge undying love.

277
00:23:58,222 --> 00:24:02,525
Hail King Joffrey.
Hail Queen Margaery.

278
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:05,261
I'll drink a toast to my new queen,

279
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:07,696
for there is no one fairer.

280
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:12,001
Dear Uncle, will you share my
joy and be my royal cupbearer?

281
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:14,870
Drink long and deep, my noble king,

282
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,206
from this cup of sweet wine.

283
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:19,842
The last drink he shall ever take.

284
00:24:19,944 --> 00:24:21,877
And vengeance shall be mine.

285
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:35,691
Poison!

286
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:37,560
Murder!

287
00:24:37,662 --> 00:24:40,062
I gasp.
I-- I die.

288
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,000
I limp.

289
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:47,236
And it was he...

290
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:50,439
<i>...that poisoned me.</i>

291
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,442
My evil Uncle Imp.

292
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:01,250
Calm down, dear.

293
00:25:05,623 --> 00:25:07,590
My firstborn son.

294
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:10,092
My golden lion

295
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:12,695
foully, falsely slain.

296
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:16,966
I pray you found a lasting peace

297
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:19,235
free from strife and pain.

298
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:23,973
Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.

299
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:25,908
<i>Take my life instead.</i>

300
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,879
For I cannot face another day
when my sweet boy is dead.

301
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:32,882
<i>Oh, woe.</i>

302
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:34,950
Oh, grief.

303
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:39,722
Oh, darkest day,
my heart is full of sorrow.

304
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,660
All hope is lost.

305
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,796
All joy is gone.

306
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:53,903
And there is no tomorrow.

307
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,525
What is that I hear and smell?

308
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:19,295
<i>Someone I'll soon send to hell.</i>

309
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:21,964
It's time to see if truth they told

310
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:25,701
who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

311
00:26:27,939 --> 00:26:29,905
You beast.
You beast.

312
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:34,843
You killed my wife and now
you've taken your father's life.

313
00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:37,713
<i>No worse child
ever stained this land.</i>

314
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:40,316
Curse the day I named you.

315
00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:53,395
My greatest crime.
Now I must flee.

316
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:56,298
<i>Then sail across the Narrow Sea</i>

317
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,536
<i>to do unto you more treachery.</i>

318
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:04,340
Don't fear winter.
Fear me!

319
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:10,212
<i>Thank you.</i>

320
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:13,882
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Bianca,</i>

321
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:15,918
<i>Clarenzo.</i>

322
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,655
I give you Bobono.

323
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:22,191
I give you Camello.

324
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:24,560
<i>And last but not least,</i>

325
00:27:24,662 --> 00:27:26,795
sweet Lady Crane.

326
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:41,610
Give this a good beating. Shake
those fleas out. That's a dear.

327
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:43,846
That crowd was shit.

328
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,252
Girl.

329
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:52,688
What are you doing back here?

330
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,189
Nothing.

331
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:57,660
I saw you the other day
in the audience.

332
00:27:57,762 --> 00:28:00,696
How many times have you
seen this stupid play?

333
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:03,666
Three times.

334
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:05,467
Did you pay?

335
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:07,736
No.

336
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:13,542
I remember when the players
came to my village.

337
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:16,245
I didn't have any money,
so I snuck in.

338
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:18,514
Just like you.

339
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:20,716
Saw the painted faces, the costumes,

340
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:22,384
listened to the songs,

341
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:25,921
cried when the young lovers
died in each other's arms.

342
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:29,792
I ran off and joined them the
next day, never looked back.

343
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:32,728
You're very good.

344
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,563
My final speech is shit.

345
00:28:34,665 --> 00:28:37,933
But to be fair to myself,
which I always like to be,

346
00:28:38,035 --> 00:28:40,269
the writing's no good.

347
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:42,271
So change it.

348
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,842
It would all just be farting,
belching, and slapping without you.

349
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,412
How would you change it?

350
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,021
The queen loves her son
more than anything.

351
00:28:59,123 --> 00:29:02,157
And he was taken from her
before she could say good-bye.

352
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:04,259
She wouldn't just cry.

353
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:10,766
She would be angry.

354
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:13,435
She would want to kill the
person who did this to her.

355
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:18,807
What's your name?

356
00:29:20,544 --> 00:29:22,644
Mercy.

357
00:29:22,747 --> 00:29:25,447
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

358
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:28,117
<i>Wonderful eyebrows.</i>

359
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,353
Do you like pretending
to be other people?

360
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:35,824
I have to go. My
father's waiting for me.

361
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:46,735
Lady Crane, they loved you.

362
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:49,605
They were sweet.
Or drunk.

363
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:51,774
Drunkenly sweet.

364
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:53,442
No laugh for Ned's death.

365
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:57,246
These people are worse than animals.

366
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:01,150
But they loved her.
They all love her.

367
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:05,020
Yes, you are adored
by people and animals alike.

368
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:07,656
I do what I can with what I'm given.

369
00:30:07,758 --> 00:30:09,658
With what you're given?

370
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,593
Well, I was thinking--

371
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:13,195
<i>Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?</i>

372
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:16,098
Full to the tits with ideas.

373
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,501
- I didn't mean--
- You have ideas, I have ideas,

374
00:30:19,603 --> 00:30:21,370
he has ideas.

375
00:30:21,472 --> 00:30:24,173
Why should my ideas have
any more value than yours

376
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:27,576
simply because I've been
doing this my whole life?

377
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:29,878
Who is anyone to judge my work?

378
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,748
This is my profession.
I know what I'm doing.

379
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,783
You have no right to an opinion.

380
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:50,365
Careful of that one.

381
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:56,238
She wants you dead.

382
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:37,079
And?

383
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:39,414
As I expected.

384
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:42,851
A shame.

385
00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:44,953
A girl had many gifts.

386
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:49,825
You promised me.

387
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:58,000
Don't let her suffer.

388
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,521
Company, halt!

389
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:55,390
My lord.

390
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:57,326
My lord.

391
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:02,731
My friends, the hour has come.

392
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:06,568
Madness has overtaken this city

393
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,273
and grasped in its claws my children.

394
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:14,543
But now we must drive it back

395
00:33:14,645 --> 00:33:17,713
under the rocks whence it came.

396
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:22,351
Madness has had its day!

397
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:27,856
<i>Forward, march!</i>

398
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:34,162
Rich or poor, noble or common,

399
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:38,433
if we sin, we must atone.

400
00:33:40,004 --> 00:33:42,504
Margaery of House Tyrell

401
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:45,040
<i>came to us a sinner.</i>

402
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:47,509
She stood before the gods

403
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:50,078
in the holy sept and lied.

404
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,215
She turned a blind eye
to her brother's sins.

405
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:55,884
She disgraced her house,

406
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:59,254
her king, and herself.

407
00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:32,721
<i>Company, halt!</i>

408
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:35,090
Face front!

409
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:36,925
Turn!

410
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,596
<i>Lord Tyrell.</i>

411
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,965
Ser Jaime.

412
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:45,967
Sorry to interrupt.

413
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,770
<i>We're here for Queen Margaery
and Ser Loras Tyrell.</i>

414
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:52,140
Give them to us
and we'll be on our way.

415
00:34:52,242 --> 00:34:56,344
I don't have the authority
to give them to you.

416
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:59,281
And you don't have
the authority to take them.

417
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:01,216
That's right.

418
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:04,653
Hyah.

419
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:12,961
<i>Lock spears!</i>

420
00:35:13,063 --> 00:35:17,232
I speak for King Tommen of House
Baratheon, First of His Name.

421
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:20,402
The gods don't recognize
his authority in this matter.

422
00:35:20,504 --> 00:35:23,238
You've already insulted
one great house.

423
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,307
<i>It won't happen twice.</i>

424
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:27,642
Every last sparrow will die

425
00:35:27,745 --> 00:35:30,212
before Margaery Tyrell
walks down that street.

426
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:32,814
To die in the service of the gods

427
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:35,117
would please
each and every one of us.

428
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:37,552
We yearn for it.

429
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:49,097
But there is no call for it today.

430
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:54,970
There will be no walk of atonement.

431
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:13,355
<i>Order up.</i>

432
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:16,424
Queen Margaery has already
atoned for her sins

433
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:19,528
<i>by bringing another</i>

434
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,730
into the true light of the Seven.

435
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:54,930
Together we announce

436
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:57,566
<i>a new age of harmony.</i>

437
00:36:58,602 --> 00:37:00,535
A holy alliance

438
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:04,172
between the Crown and the Faith.

439
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:23,325
<i>Long live King Tommen
and bless you, Queen Margaery!</i>

440
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:25,827
The Crown and the Faith

441
00:37:25,929 --> 00:37:29,664
are the twin pillars
upon which the world rests.

442
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:34,870
Together we will restore
the Seven Kingdoms to glory.

443
00:37:53,257 --> 00:37:55,390
What's happening?

444
00:37:55,492 --> 00:37:57,492
He's beaten us.

445
00:37:57,594 --> 00:37:59,461
That's what's happening.

446
00:38:14,344 --> 00:38:17,345
When you attack the Faith,
you attack the Crown.

447
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:20,415
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit

448
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:23,118
to serve as Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

449
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,155
I've been a member of the Kingsguard
since before you were born.

450
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:32,093
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do anything.

451
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:36,431
I have to answer to the gods.

452
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:38,767
Not when you're sitting
in that chair.

453
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,507
The Crown's decision
on this matter is final.

454
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:50,578
Will I be walking naked
in the streets?

455
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:53,181
Or will I spend a few months
in the sept dungeons first

456
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:55,417
to teach me about the gods' mercy?

457
00:38:59,623 --> 00:39:03,925
You have served your house and your
king faithfully for many years.

458
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:06,261
And you will continue to do so.

459
00:39:08,031 --> 00:39:09,965
But not in this city.

460
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:16,604
You've lost it?

461
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:19,641
Yes, Father.

462
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:22,677
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

463
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:25,947
Presumably you still
know where it is.

464
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:27,649
You didn't lose Riverrun.

465
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:29,884
You let the Blackfish
take it from you.

466
00:39:29,987 --> 00:39:32,954
He surprised us. He knows the
castle better than anyone.

467
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:36,424
You did lose the Blackfish
after the Red Wedding.

468
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:39,527
You had him right here in this
hall and you let him leave.

469
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:42,130
Then when I told you to
hunt him down and kill him,

470
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:43,598
you couldn't find him.

471
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,800
That's what it means
to lose something.

472
00:39:45,902 --> 00:39:49,337
Now he's come back
and taken Riverrun.

473
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:51,606
I don't think it's fair
to blame us--

474
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,976
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

475
00:39:55,078 --> 00:39:58,980
swore oaths to them and their
stinking fish banners.

476
00:39:59,082 --> 00:40:01,316
Not again.
Riverrun is ours.

477
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:03,752
Take it back.

478
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:05,387
We don't have the men.

479
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:08,823
We've got 10 times as many
men as the damn Blackfish.

480
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:11,960
<i>The Mallisters have
risen against us. And the Blackwoods.</i>

481
00:40:12,062 --> 00:40:15,263
<i>The Brotherhood Without Banners
is rallying the commoners against us,</i>

482
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:17,298
<i>raiding our supply trains and camps.</i>

483
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:20,435
<i>Riverrun can
withstand a siege for a year.</i>

484
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:23,872
If I want excuses,
I'll put her in charge.

485
00:40:23,974 --> 00:40:25,740
They're laughing at us.

486
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:27,709
All across the Riverlands

487
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:29,544
right down to King's Landing,

488
00:40:29,646 --> 00:40:31,279
<i>they're laughing at us.</i>

489
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:33,915
I hear it in my sleep!

490
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:37,018
I'm not dead yet,
unfortunately for you.

491
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,856
And I'll not leave this world until
they all choke on that laughter.

492
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:44,492
Take that castle back.

493
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:48,463
He'll never yield, Father.

494
00:40:48,565 --> 00:40:51,066
Oh, he'll yield.

495
00:40:55,572 --> 00:40:58,306
You'll show him the knife you used

496
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:02,110
to kill Robb Stark's child
in his whore mother's belly,

497
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,479
and you'll show him
the knife you used

498
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:06,714
<i>to open his niece's throat.</i>

499
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:08,783
<i>And you'll remind him who it was</i>

500
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:12,754
that got married at the Red
Wedding in the first place.

501
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:14,522
His nephew.

502
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:32,407
<i>Cheer up, Lord Edmure.</i>

503
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:34,576
You're going home.

504
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:38,179
I'm being sent to deal
with the Blackfish.

505
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:41,149
Apparently Walder Frey
can't manage it on his own

506
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,051
because he's 400 years old.

507
00:41:43,153 --> 00:41:45,653
<i>Sent me with an army
to the Riverlands</i>

508
00:41:45,755 --> 00:41:47,622
and a siege that could last months.

509
00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:50,158
Better you're elsewhere
at the head of an army

510
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,826
than in the sept dungeons.

511
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:54,796
I'm not going to the Riverlands.

512
00:41:57,868 --> 00:41:59,100
What, then?

513
00:41:59,202 --> 00:42:00,635
I'm going to give Bronn

514
00:42:00,737 --> 00:42:02,804
the largest bag of gold
anyone's ever seen

515
00:42:02,906 --> 00:42:06,274
and have him gather
the best killers he knows.

516
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:09,744
I'll take them to the sept and I'll
remove the High Sparrow's head

517
00:42:09,846 --> 00:42:11,679
and every other
sparrow head I can find.

518
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:15,350
- You can't.
- He has our son! He stole our son!

519
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:17,452
He's torn our family apart.

520
00:42:17,554 --> 00:42:19,888
How should we treat people
who tear us apart?

521
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:24,058
We should treat them
without mercy and we will.

522
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:26,995
But if you kill the High Sparrow,
you won't leave the sept alive.

523
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:30,131
And without you,
this is all for nothing.

524
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:33,601
Stand at the head of our army
where you belong,

525
00:42:33,703 --> 00:42:36,004
where Father wanted you.

526
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:38,473
Show our men where
their loyalties belong.

527
00:42:38,575 --> 00:42:40,575
Show them what Lannisters are,

528
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:42,610
what we do to our enemies.

529
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,214
And take that stupid
little castle back

530
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:48,516
because it's ours
and because you can.

531
00:42:48,618 --> 00:42:51,719
You'll stand trial soon.
I need to be here for you.

532
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:55,990
It will be a trial by combat.

533
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:58,459
I have the Mountain.

534
00:43:00,697 --> 00:43:03,364
They've made us both
stronger, all of them.

535
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:06,768
They have no idea how strong we are.

536
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,170
No idea what we're going
to do to them.

537
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:22,183
We've always been together.

538
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:24,852
We'll always be together.

539
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:27,388
We're the only two
people in the world.

540
00:43:47,344 --> 00:43:49,177
Why did you help us?

541
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:54,215
The Three-Eyed Raven
sent for me.

542
00:43:54,317 --> 00:43:55,516
The Three-Eyed
Raven's dead.

543
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:57,685
Now he lives again.

544
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,067
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

545
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:16,337
A fearless boy.

546
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:19,507
Loved to climb the castle
walls, frighten his mother.

547
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:22,010
Who are you?

548
00:44:39,529 --> 00:44:41,296
Uncle Benjen.

549
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:44,132
<i>The last letter Jon wrote me</i>

550
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:46,067
said you had been
lost beyond the Wall.

551
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:51,639
I led a ranging party
deep into the North

552
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:54,475
to find white walkers.

553
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:56,177
They found us.

554
00:44:56,279 --> 00:45:00,114
A white walker stabbed me in
the gut with a sword of ice.

555
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:04,118
Left me there to die.

556
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,620
To turn.

557
00:45:05,722 --> 00:45:08,289
The Children found me.

558
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:11,592
Stopped the walker's
magic from taking hold.

559
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:12,994
How?

560
00:45:13,096 --> 00:45:15,396
The same way they made the
walkers in the first place.

561
00:45:15,498 --> 00:45:16,831
You saw it yourself.

562
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:20,635
Dragonglass.

563
00:45:20,737 --> 00:45:23,738
A shard of dragonglass
plunged into your heart.

564
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:28,743
You are the Three-Eyed
Raven now.

565
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:31,779
I didn't have time to learn.
I can't control anything.

566
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,851
You must learn to control it

567
00:45:36,953 --> 00:45:38,853
before the Night King comes.

568
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:43,124
Drink.

569
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:48,329
One way or another,

570
00:45:48,431 --> 00:45:51,132
he will find his way
to the world of men.

571
00:45:51,234 --> 00:45:53,634
When he does,

572
00:45:53,737 --> 00:45:56,904
you will be there waiting for him.

573
00:45:57,006 --> 00:46:00,274
And you will be ready.

574
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,087
<i>Everything all right?</i>

575
00:46:23,189 --> 00:46:25,223
<i>How many days' ride to Meereen?</i>

576
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:27,158
<i>A week at best.</i>

577
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,662
How many ships will I need to
bring my khalasar to Westeros?

578
00:46:30,764 --> 00:46:32,864
Dothraki and all their horses,

579
00:46:32,966 --> 00:46:35,300
the Unsullied,
the Second Sons--

580
00:46:35,402 --> 00:46:37,268
1,000 ships easily.

581
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,504
- Probably more.
- And who has that many?

582
00:46:39,606 --> 00:46:41,105
Nobody.

583
00:46:41,207 --> 00:46:43,241
Nobody yet.

584
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:48,813
So we ride for Meereen and after
that we sail for Westeros.

585
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:50,415
And what then?

586
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:53,284
I take what is mine.

587
00:46:53,386 --> 00:46:56,220
You weren't made to sit
on a chair in a palace.

588
00:46:56,323 --> 00:46:58,656
What was I made for?

589
00:46:58,758 --> 00:47:02,427
You're a conqueror,
Daenerys Stormborn.

590
00:47:11,605 --> 00:47:13,104
Wait here.

591
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:50,869
I'm going after her.

592
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:52,412
Wait for me here.

593
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:51,179
Every khal who ever lived
chose three blood riders

594
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:54,766
to fight beside him and guard his way.

595
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:57,561
But I am not a khal.

596
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:00,981
I will not choose three blood riders.

597
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:04,318
I choose you all.

598
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,906
I will ask more of you than any khal

599
00:49:10,616 --> 00:49:12,868
has ever asked of his khalassar!

600
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:18,081
Will you ride the wooden horses
across the black salt sea?

601
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:23,920
Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits

602
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:26,548
and tear down their stone houses?

603
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:31,970
Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms,

604
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:35,557
the gift Khal Drogo promised me

605
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:37,976
before the Mother of Mountains?

606
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:43,315
Are you with me?

607
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,402
Now

608
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:52,324
and always?

609
00:50:07,514 --> 00:50:15,514
