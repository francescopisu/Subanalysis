2
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:06,832
Easy, easy.

3
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,467
Easy.

4
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,475
What do you remember?

5
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:25,650
They stabbed me.

6
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,940
Olly...

7
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:36,194
he put a knife in my heart.

8
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:44,419
I shouldn't be here.

9
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:48,707
The lady brought you back.

10
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:52,544
Afterwards, after they stabbed you,

11
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,796
after you died, where did you go?

12
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:56,848
What did you see?

13
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:03,105
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:07,859
There was nothing at all.

15
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,950
The Lord let you
come back for a reason.

16
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:19,538
Stannis was not the prince
who was promised,

17
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:21,239
but someone has to be.

18
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,963
Could you give us a moment?

19
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,069
You were dead.

20
00:04:51,188 --> 00:04:52,854
And now you're not.

21
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:58,193
That's completely
fucking mad, seems to me.

22
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:00,745
I can only imagine
how it seems to you.

23
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,417
I did what I thought was right.

24
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,538
And I got murdered for it.

25
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:12,874
And now I'm back.

26
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,376
Why?

27
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:16,094
I don't know.

28
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:18,597
Maybe we'll never know.

29
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:20,682
What does it matter?

30
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:24,436
You go on.

31
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:28,723
You fight for as long as you can.

32
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:31,726
You clean up as much
of the shit as you can.

33
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:34,779
I don't know how to do that.

34
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:38,533
I thought I did, but...

35
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:44,322
I failed.

36
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:49,377
Good.

37
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:50,962
Now go fail again.

38
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:49,721
They think you're some kind of god.

39
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:52,641
The man who returned from the dead.

40
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,309
I'm not a god.

41
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:57,112
I know that.

42
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,615
I saw your pecker.

43
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:03,618
What kind of god would
have a pecker that small?

44
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:31,930
Your eyes are still brown.

45
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:33,815
Is that still you in there?

46
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,817
I think so.

47
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:41,022
Hold off on burning my body for now.

48
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,527
That's funny.

49
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:49,414
You sure that's still you in there?

50
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:22,864
You all right?

51
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,567
Yes.
Yes, I'm fine.

52
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:32,374
Did I ever tell you I used to
think the sea was called the see

53
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,410
because it was nothing but water
as far as the eye could see?

54
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:36,795
I don't think so.

55
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:39,297
Sea, see.

56
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,217
They're spelled different,
but they sound the same.

57
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,303
Yeah, they do.

58
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:48,390
It was before I learned
how to read, obviously.

59
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:54,646
Sam, are you going to be sick?

60
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:12,113
Won't be long.
We'll be in the south soon.

61
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:14,282
I'm excited to see Oldtown.

62
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:19,871
Captain says it's the most
beautiful city in Westeros.

63
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,374
Are you going to vomit again?

64
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,677
No.
No, no, no.

65
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,964
The Citadel doesn't admit women.

66
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,134
There won't be a place for
you there or for Little Sam.

67
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,688
I stayed at Castle Black.
There's no women allowed there.

68
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:38,857
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.

69
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:42,360
I don't have a Jon Snow
or Maester Aemon

70
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:45,280
to help me bend the rules.

71
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,198
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.

72
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:48,983
By yourself?

73
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,785
With a baby and no money?

74
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:54,155
So if we're not going to Oldtown,

75
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,406
where are you taking me?

76
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,160
To my home.

77
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:00,495
Horn Hill.

78
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,083
My father's--
well, my father,

79
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:08,753
but my mother's a kind woman
and my sister's lovely.

80
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,556
They'll take care of you both.

81
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:14,926
"Wherever you go,
I go, too."

82
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:16,761
<i>That's what you said.</i>

83
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:36,414
I said that because I want
you and Little Sam to be safe.

84
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:38,783
That's all I want--

85
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:42,420
to become a maester so I can
help Jon when the time comes

86
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:44,172
so you'll be safe.

87
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:45,874
Us and everyone else in the world.

88
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,092
I don't care about them.

89
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:52,096
Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

90
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,600
I care about you and him.

91
00:10:57,888 --> 00:11:00,054
I know that, Sam.

92
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,390
And he does, too.

93
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:07,695
You're the only one who ever has.

94
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,907
If you think it's for the best,

95
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:21,626
we trust you.

96
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:24,629
I'd feel better if you threw
something at me and stormed off.

97
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:28,216
I'd never do that
to the father of my son.

98
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,309
That's my father.

99
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:30,812
The man beside him is Howland Reed,

100
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,447
Meera's father.

101
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:45,994
Ser Arthur Dayne.

102
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,212
The Sword of the Morning.

103
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:51,082
Father said he was the best
swordsman he ever saw.

104
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,231
Lord Stark.

105
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,518
I looked for you on the Trident.

106
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:12,603
We weren't there.

107
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,272
Your friend the usurper

108
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:17,358
would lie beneath the
ground if we had been.

109
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:19,494
The Mad King is dead.

110
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,663
Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.

111
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:24,165
Why weren't you there
to protect your prince?

112
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,167
Our prince wanted us here.

113
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:35,543
Where's my sister?

114
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:40,848
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come.

115
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:50,308
And now it begins.

116
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:56,898
No.

117
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:58,950
Now it ends.

118
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:38,166
He's better than my father.

119
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,801
Far better.

120
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:46,841
But Father beat him.

121
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,010
Did he?

122
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:51,095
I know he did.

123
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:52,847
Heard the story a thousand times.

124
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,783
He stabbed him in the back.

125
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:33,554
What's in the tower?

126
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,356
That's enough for one day.

127
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,141
We'll visit again another time.

128
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:39,810
- I want to see where he's going.
- Time to go.

129
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:42,563
Father!

130
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:10,675
Why did you do that?

131
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,843
Take me back there.
I want to go back.

132
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,228
No.

133
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,816
- He heard me.
- Maybe.

134
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:22,236
- Maybe he heard the wind.
- He heard me.

135
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:25,323
The past is already written.
The ink is dry.

136
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:27,742
What's in that tower?

137
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,160
<i>I want to go back there.</i>

138
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,029
I've told you many times,
stay too long

139
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:34,582
where you don't belong
and you will never return.

140
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,450
Why do I want to return?

141
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:38,336
So I can be a cripple again?

142
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:40,871
<i>So I can talk
to an old man in a tree?</i>

143
00:17:40,957 --> 00:17:43,007
You think I wanted to sit
here for 1,000 years

144
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,959
watching the world from a distance

145
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:46,460
as the roots grew through me?

146
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:48,262
So why did you?

147
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:51,132
I was waiting for you.

148
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:53,017
I don't want to be you.

149
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:55,770
I don't blame you.

150
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:59,307
You won't be here forever.

151
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:02,026
You won't be an old man in a tree.

152
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:04,562
<i>But before you leave,</i>

153
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:07,648
you must learn.

154
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,567
Learn what?

155
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:12,286
Everything.

156
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:36,366
Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.

157
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,904
Welcome home, Khaleesi.

158
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,514
Go.

159
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,442
What are you doing?!

160
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,861
Take your hands off me!

161
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,529
I will have your heads!

162
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,385
You have made a mistake.

163
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,554
One you will regret.

164
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,264
I am the wife of the Great Khal.

165
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,765
We know who you are.

166
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:26,810
I remember you eating the stallion's heart.

167
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:32,774
Why didn't you come to us
after Khal Drogo died?

168
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,068
Because I am Daenerys Stormborn,

169
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,570
the Breaker of Chains,

170
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,739
the Queen of Meereen
and the Mother of Dragons.

171
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,824
My place is not here with you.

172
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,493
You were the wife of the Great Khal.

173
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:48,248
You thought he would conquer the
world with you at his side.

174
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:49,791
He didn't.

175
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,378
I was the wife of the Great Khal.

176
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,005
Khal Savo.

177
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,969
I thought he would conquer the world
with me at his side.

178
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,098
You're young.

179
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,352
We were all young once.

180
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,688
But we all understand the way things are.

181
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,191
You will learn as well,

182
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,235
if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.

183
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,571
Where else would I go?

184
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,741
Every Khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.

185
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,787
Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal.

186
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,622
But you went out into the world.

187
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,540
That is forbidden.

188
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:35,921
All the khalasars have returned
for the Khalar Vezhven.

189
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:42,052
They will decide which cities will be sacked
and which tribes will be enslaved.

190
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:46,723
And now they must decide what to do
with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow.

191
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,686
With luck, your place will be here
with us, Mother of Dragons.

192
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,730
It is the best you can hope for, now.

193
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:08,972
I don't know how you stand
it in all that leather.

194
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,065
If we could have the room.

195
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:31,195
You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

196
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,488
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

197
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:36,785
If you're going to torture me,

198
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,919
just call them back
and get on with it.

199
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:41,088
I am not a torturer.

200
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,976
Though it so often is
what people deserve.

201
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:49,930
And it does provide answers.

202
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:52,900
But they're usually
the wrong answers.

203
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:56,487
My job is to find the right answers.

204
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:58,689
Do you know how I do that?

205
00:22:58,774 --> 00:23:02,076
I do it by making people happy.

206
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,778
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

207
00:23:04,914 --> 00:23:08,115
That's your name, isn't it, Vala?

208
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,501
That's all right.

209
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,754
I know who you are
and what you've done.

210
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:16,824
You've done a lot.

211
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:19,470
You've sacrificed
your body for a cause,

212
00:23:19,495 --> 00:23:22,830
which is more than most people do.

213
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:26,093
And you've helped
the Sons of the Harpy

214
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,980
murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.

215
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:32,339
The Unsullied and the Second
Sons are foreign soldiers

216
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,458
brought here by a foreign queen

217
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:37,261
to destroy our city and our history.

218
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,214
I understand.

219
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,967
Well, that makes perfect sense

220
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:45,803
from your perspective.

221
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:49,690
I have a different
perspective, of course.

222
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:53,227
I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective

223
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,729
just as I will try
to see them from yours.

224
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:58,032
Because that is the only way

225
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:01,035
that I can make you and Dom happy.

226
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:07,908
That is how
you pronounce it-- Dom?

227
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:11,045
I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

228
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:14,465
Such a handsome boy.

229
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:18,085
Those big, brown eyes. Good
luck keeping the ladies away.

230
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:22,339
Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?

231
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:25,309
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

232
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:27,845
Children are blameless.

233
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:31,098
I have never hurt them.

234
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,517
Your boy is in no immediate danger,

235
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,185
this I swear to you.

236
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:39,073
But between us, dear,

237
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:42,276
you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.

238
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,945
We both know the penalty
for that crime.

239
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:53,754
How will poor Dom
get on without his mother?

240
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,873
And with his breathing problem.

241
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,292
If I tell you anything,
they'll kill me.

242
00:24:58,427 --> 00:25:00,594
So either you kill me or they do.

243
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,214
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

244
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:07,801
There is a third option, though.

245
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:11,105
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

246
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,809
I've already booked passage for
a woman and her young son.

247
00:25:15,945 --> 00:25:19,363
I'll even throw in a bag of
silver to help you start again.

248
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:21,231
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask

249
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:25,035
one of our leather-clad
friends back in to carry it.

250
00:25:25,154 --> 00:25:26,820
Far too heavy for me.

251
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,074
The boat sails at dawn.

252
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,960
You need to decide now.

253
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,829
A new life for you and Dom

254
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:37,548
or...

255
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,399
What should we do while we wait?

256
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:57,318
To pass the time, what should we do?

257
00:25:57,403 --> 00:25:59,737
<i>What should we talk about?</i>

258
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:03,857
You speak 19 languages.

259
00:26:03,943 --> 00:26:07,277
You must occasionally use some
of them to talk about things.

260
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:10,614
You two, you spend a great
deal of time together.

261
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,867
What would you be talking
about if I weren't here?

262
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:16,920
Patrol.

263
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,673
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

264
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,343
What we see on patrol.

265
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:24,378
Who we captured on patrol.

266
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:26,930
That's good.
That's very good.

267
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:31,435
But that's a report.

268
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:33,721
I was thinking more
of a conversation.

269
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,890
A wise man once said the
true history of the world

270
00:26:36,976 --> 00:26:40,394
is the history of great
conversations in elegant rooms.

271
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,396
Who said this?

272
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:44,865
Me.

273
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,900
Just now.

274
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:55,492
All right, no conversations.

275
00:26:55,578 --> 00:26:57,461
Let's play a game.

276
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:02,193
You don't play games,
either one of you, ever?

277
00:27:02,218 --> 00:27:03,527
Games are for children.

278
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,169
<i>My master Kraznys</i>

279
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:07,208
would sometimes make us play games.

280
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:09,256
There, that's a start.

281
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:13,060
- Only the girls.
- No, no, no.

282
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:15,095
Not that.
Of course not that.

283
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:18,732
Innocent games.
Fun games.

284
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:20,317
Drinking games.

285
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:22,603
<i>We do not drink.</i>

286
00:27:22,738 --> 00:27:24,738
Until you do.

287
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:28,379
All right.
No drinking.

288
00:27:28,404 --> 00:27:30,244
We can play without drinking.

289
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:32,590
It's a wonderful game.
I invented it.

290
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,114
Here's how it works.

291
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,260
I make a statement about your past.

292
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:37,918
If I'm wrong, I drink.

293
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:41,121
And if I'm right--

294
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:44,625
maybe we can't play without drinking.

295
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:48,846
Oh, you took your time.

296
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,931
Sorry.

297
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:54,745
I was busy learning who funds
the Sons of the Harpy.

298
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,804
- Some things you can't rush.
- You found out?

299
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:59,022
The Good Masters of Astapor

300
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:01,308
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

301
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,394
With help from their
friends in Volantis.

302
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,946
<i>You see?</i>

303
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:08,532
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

304
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:10,261
We only have to worry about

305
00:28:10,286 --> 00:28:12,486
the three rich foreign
cities paying for it.

306
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:14,204
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.

307
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:16,156
We will do it again
and execute the Masters.

308
00:28:16,242 --> 00:28:19,660
If the Unsullied march off to
reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,

309
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:21,245
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

310
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,881
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

311
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,666
We cannot.

312
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:28,552
The Masters speak only one language.

313
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:30,337
They spoke it to me for many years.

314
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:32,172
<i>I know it better
than my mother tongue.</i>

315
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:35,976
If we want them to hear us, we
must speak it back to them.

316
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:38,228
May it be the last
thing they ever hear.

317
00:28:38,347 --> 00:28:40,397
You may be right.

318
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:42,483
<i>So we will fight them?</i>

319
00:28:42,568 --> 00:28:44,518
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

320
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:47,521
It's a conversation.

321
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:49,907
Tell me, can your little
birds get a message

322
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:53,243
to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

323
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:55,913
and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

324
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:58,665
Of course.
Men can be fickle,

325
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:01,869
but birds I always trust.

326
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,094
Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

327
00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:12,546
How's your mother's jaw?

328
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,181
Better.

329
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:15,693
And your father?

330
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:18,185
No one's seen him.

331
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,553
And no one will.

332
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:21,271
That worked out rather nicely.

333
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,390
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

334
00:29:23,526 --> 00:29:25,559
I don't think so.

335
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:27,477
Do you miss him?

336
00:29:27,563 --> 00:29:30,147
He was nice.

337
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:32,566
He called us his little birds.

338
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:34,234
He gave us sweets.

339
00:29:36,488 --> 00:29:39,206
It's funny you should mention that.

340
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,912
Guess what I happened to find today.

341
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:48,582
Candied plums from Dorne.

342
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:54,254
Now remember, if any of your friends

343
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,591
like sweets or need help,
they can always come to me.

344
00:29:57,726 --> 00:30:02,095
All I need in return are whispers.

345
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:11,355
<i>No need to be afraid.</i>

346
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,357
This is Ser Gregor.

347
00:30:13,442 --> 00:30:15,692
He's friends with all my friends.

348
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,250
Run along now.

349
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:29,923
Varys's little birds?

350
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:31,508
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

351
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:33,543
What did you do to him exactly?

352
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:35,295
I haven't been able
to get a clear answer.

353
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:37,464
Oh, a number of things.

354
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,049
Does he understand what we're saying?

355
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:41,385
I mean, to the extent
that he ever understood

356
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,720
complete sentences
in the first place.

357
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,608
He understands well enough.

358
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:49,726
So tell him to march into the sept

359
00:30:49,812 --> 00:30:52,446
and crush the High Sparrow's
head like a melon.

360
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:55,949
The High Sparrow has hundreds of
Faith Militant surrounding him.

361
00:30:56,035 --> 00:30:58,318
Ser Gregor can't face them all.

362
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:00,320
And he won't have to.

363
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:02,456
He'll only have to face one.

364
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:06,994
Has the Faith leveled
official charges yet?

365
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,745
Not yet.

366
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:11,999
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

367
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:14,001
Don't stop at the city.

368
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:16,420
I want little birds in Dorne,

369
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:19,172
in Highgarden, in the North.

370
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:22,342
If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

371
00:31:22,478 --> 00:31:24,311
I want to hear it.

372
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:27,014
If someone is laughing at the queen

373
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:29,733
who walked naked through
the streets covered in shit,

374
00:31:29,852 --> 00:31:31,601
I want to hear.

375
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:34,488
I want to know who they are.

376
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:36,690
I want to know where they are.

377
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:46,010
<i>As bad as Lord
Varys was, Qyburn is worse.</i>

378
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:48,418
I told them all.
I told them.

379
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:50,420
He's arrogant, dangerous.

380
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:53,540
You don't get thrown out of the
Citadel without good reason.

381
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:55,375
And no one listened to my advice.

382
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,594
<i>So here we are.</i>

383
00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:00,013
And what he's done to Gregor Clegane

384
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:02,049
<i>is an abomination.</i>

385
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:05,218
We never sanctioned this experiment.

386
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:07,888
I for one think it will
be in our best interest

387
00:32:08,023 --> 00:32:09,690
to have the beast dest--

388
00:32:14,563 --> 00:32:17,064
- Can I help you?
- Why are you here?

389
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:19,566
- My mother--
- I was invited, my dear,

390
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:22,319
to help deal with several
troublesome issues,

391
00:32:22,404 --> 00:32:24,738
such as the queen's imprisonment.

392
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:27,240
Thank you for bringing it up.

393
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:31,078
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

394
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:33,380
Margaery is the queen.

395
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:35,248
You are not the queen

396
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:37,384
<i>because you're not
married to the king.</i>

397
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:39,169
I do appreciate these things

398
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:42,889
can get a bit confusing
in your family.

399
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:45,142
This is a small council meeting.

400
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,394
You have no position
on the small council.

401
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,262
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

402
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:50,788
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

403
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:52,599
does have a position
on the small council.

404
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:55,268
Grand Maester Pycelle, would
you sanction that statement?

405
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:57,437
Well, um...

406
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:00,524
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower

407
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:02,692
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

408
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:05,362
<i>Of course, that was the Mad King.</i>

409
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:07,080
King Robert saw things differently.

410
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,865
And King--

411
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:15,005
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

412
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:17,290
Do you consider the
murder of your own blood

413
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:19,376
a troublesome issue?

414
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:21,405
The same women who murdered Myrcella

415
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,880
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

416
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:25,682
We've got a lot to discuss.

417
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:28,185
All of us together.

418
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:31,972
And seeing as you cannot make us
leave, we best get on with it.

419
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:36,643
No, we cannot make you leave.

420
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,863
And you cannot make us stay.

421
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:43,567
Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

422
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:26,776
Your Grace.

423
00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:30,030
My mother would like to see her
daughter's final resting place.

424
00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:32,699
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

425
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:34,701
That's not possible.
Not yet.

426
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:36,453
When will it be possible?

427
00:34:36,538 --> 00:34:38,872
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

428
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:41,541
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked

429
00:34:41,627 --> 00:34:44,044
through the streets
in front of the whole city.

430
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,846
That wasn't the full atonement?

431
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:47,714
No.

432
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:50,934
She must stand trial
before seven septons

433
00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:53,186
so we can learn the true
extent of her sins.

434
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:57,440
I want you to let her see
Myrcella's resting place.

435
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,109
I am the king.

436
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:00,694
You are.

437
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,564
And what does that mean to you?

438
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,066
<i>It means a great deal to me.</i>

439
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:08,068
The Crown and the Faith

440
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:10,287
are the twin pillars of the world.

441
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:12,405
<i>Do you know who told me that?</i>

442
00:35:13,886 --> 00:35:15,219
Your mother.

443
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:17,744
My mother who is unclean?

444
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:21,798
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

445
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,820
How do you think the Mother
Above first came to us?

446
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:46,606
How did men and women

447
00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:50,193
first come to feel
the Mother's presence, hmm?

448
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:53,413
It was through their own mothers.

449
00:35:56,118 --> 00:35:59,502
There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

450
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:03,790
But when she speaks of you, the
Mother's love outshines it all.

451
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:08,795
Her love for you is more real

452
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,797
than anything else in this world

453
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:13,883
because it doesn't
come from this world.

454
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:15,936
But you know that.

455
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:18,638
You've felt it.

456
00:36:18,724 --> 00:36:20,941
You've seen her
when she talks to you.

457
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:24,811
Yes.

458
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:27,113
<i>It's a great gift.</i>

459
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,199
One I never had.

460
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,819
Envy.

461
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:35,372
One more thing for me to atone for.

462
00:36:36,825 --> 00:36:38,708
Your Grace,
do you-- may I?

463
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:40,377
Do you mind?

464
00:36:40,495 --> 00:36:41,828
It's my knees.

465
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:43,797
Of course.

466
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:53,006
When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

467
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:55,342
she did it to get back to you.

468
00:36:55,427 --> 00:36:58,178
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

469
00:36:58,313 --> 00:37:00,063
through any more than
she's already endured.

470
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:03,516
It's not what I want.
It's what the gods want.

471
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:06,236
<i>They make their will known
to us and it's up to us</i>

472
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:08,772
to either accept or reject it.

473
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:12,525
Please.

474
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:21,084
If we're to be just and good,

475
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:23,920
then we accept it,
all of us, even kings.

476
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:28,291
A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

477
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:30,844
And no one is wiser than the gods.

478
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:36,549
My grandfather once said
something similar.

479
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:38,518
Except for the part about the gods.

480
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:42,522
The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

481
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:45,809
As they work through your mother.

482
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:50,113
There's so much good in all of us.

483
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:53,900
The best we can do is to help
each other bring it out.

484
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:23,930
Who are you?

485
00:38:24,015 --> 00:38:25,432
No one.

486
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,819
<i>Who were you
before you came here?</i>

487
00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:31,571
<i>Arya Stark.</i>

488
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:36,109
<i>Tell me about
Arya Stark's family.</i>

489
00:38:36,244 --> 00:38:39,112
Her father was Eddard Stark.

490
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:41,748
Her mother was Catelyn Stark.

491
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,168
She had one sister, Sansa,

492
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:47,170
and four brothers.

493
00:38:56,882 --> 00:38:58,631
Three brothers.

494
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,551
<i>Robb, Bran, Rickon.</i>

495
00:39:03,522 --> 00:39:06,439
And a half-brother Jon.

496
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:09,943
And where are they now?

497
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,979
<i>They may be dead
for all a girl knows.</i>

498
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,707
Tell me about the Hound.

499
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:28,328
<i>Also dead.</i>

500
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:41,724
<i>Arya Stark left him to die.
He was on her list.</i>

501
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:47,313
He was not on her list anymore.

502
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:49,149
She had taken him off it.

503
00:39:49,234 --> 00:39:53,319
Why? Didn't she want
him dead any longer?

504
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,409
<i>She did and she did not.</i>

505
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:06,032
She sounds confused.

506
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:14,541
Yes, she was.

507
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:21,514
Who else was on Arya
Stark's funny little list?

508
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,601
<i> Cersei Lannister.</i>

509
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:27,353
<i>Gregor Clegane.</i>

510
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:30,690
<i>Walder Frey.</i>

511
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:37,197
<i>That's a short list.</i>

512
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:43,703
<i>That can't be everyone
you want to kill.</i>

513
00:40:46,374 --> 00:40:48,992
Are you sure you're not
forgetting someone?

514
00:40:51,997 --> 00:40:55,081
Which name would you
like a girl to speak?

515
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:33,169
<i>If a girl tells me her name,</i>

516
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:35,672
I will give her eyes back.

517
00:41:38,627 --> 00:41:40,593
A girl has no name.

518
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:45,299
Come.

519
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:21,000
If a girl is truly no one,

520
00:42:21,086 --> 00:42:23,503
<i>she has nothing to fear.</i>

521
00:42:48,863 --> 00:42:50,997
Who are you?

522
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:56,252
No one.

523
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:08,965
The Umbers are
a famously loyal house.

524
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,551
Famously loyal to the Starks.

525
00:43:11,636 --> 00:43:14,687
And you, Lord Karstark.

526
00:43:14,773 --> 00:43:17,557
Your people share blood with
the Starks, don't they?

527
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:20,309
But here we are.
Times change.

528
00:43:20,395 --> 00:43:22,729
When my father became
Warden of the North,

529
00:43:22,814 --> 00:43:24,814
<i>your house refused
to pledge their banners.</i>

530
00:43:24,899 --> 00:43:26,699
Your father was a cunt.

531
00:43:29,904 --> 00:43:32,121
My beloved father,
the Warden--

532
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,375
Your father was a cunt
and that's why you killed him.

533
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,388
<i>I might have done
the same to my father</i>

534
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:40,963
if he hadn't have done me
the favor of dying on his own.

535
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:43,883
My father was poisoned
by our enemies.

536
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:45,718
Mmm.

537
00:43:45,804 --> 00:43:49,088
Why have you come to
Winterfell, Lord Umber?

538
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:53,059
The bastard Jon Snow led an army
of wildlings past the Wall.

539
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,561
We're farther north
than any of you fuckers.

540
00:43:55,647 --> 00:43:58,931
<i>Wildlings come down, we always
have to fight them first.</i>

541
00:43:59,017 --> 00:44:02,268
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.

542
00:44:02,353 --> 00:44:05,104
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

543
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,074
So now you've come seeking help?

544
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,493
We need to help each other.

545
00:44:10,612 --> 00:44:14,163
The colder it gets, the farther
south those goat fuckers will roam.

546
00:44:14,282 --> 00:44:16,249
Won't take them long to get here.

547
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:19,168
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

548
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:20,887
If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.

549
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:23,423
<i>He knows this place
better than we ever will.</i>

550
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:28,678
Pledge your banners to House Bolton.

551
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:31,297
Swear loyalty to me
as Warden of the North

552
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:33,933
and we will fight together
to destroy the bastard

553
00:44:34,018 --> 00:44:35,518
and all his wildling friends.

554
00:44:35,637 --> 00:44:37,804
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

555
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:40,523
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

556
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:42,642
I'm not doing that either.

557
00:44:42,777 --> 00:44:45,695
Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

558
00:44:45,814 --> 00:44:48,648
Your father honored tradition.

559
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:50,950
<i>Knelt for Robb Stark.</i>

560
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:53,453
Called him King of the North.

561
00:44:53,538 --> 00:44:55,705
<i>Was Robb Stark right
to trust your father?</i>

562
00:44:55,824 --> 00:44:57,623
Then it appears we're
at a bit of an impasse.

563
00:44:57,709 --> 00:45:00,827
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.

564
00:45:00,962 --> 00:45:02,545
I've got a gift for you.

565
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,251
A girl, I hope.
I prefer redheads.

566
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:11,337
A girl, aye.

567
00:45:12,674 --> 00:45:14,724
<i>A wild one.</i>

568
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,233
I like them wild.

569
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,821
And the boy, nice and young.

570
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:31,073
The way Karstark likes them.

571
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:38,364
Who's this?

572
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:40,833
Rickon Stark.

573
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:50,209
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

574
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:23,743
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

575
00:46:35,223 --> 00:46:36,973
It's time.

576
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:17,463
If you have any last
words, now is the time.

577
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,849
You shouldn't be alive.

578
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:21,884
It's not right.

579
00:47:23,054 --> 00:47:24,854
Neither was killing me.

580
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:31,811
My mother's still
living at White Harbor.

581
00:47:31,946 --> 00:47:33,813
Could you write her?

582
00:47:33,948 --> 00:47:36,232
Tell her I died
fighting the wildlings.

583
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:48,377
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

584
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:52,465
Betray you or betray
the Night's Watch.

585
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:55,635
You brought an army of
wildlings into our lands.

586
00:47:57,505 --> 00:48:00,339
An army of murderers and raiders.

587
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:04,176
If I had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,

588
00:48:04,262 --> 00:48:07,680
I pray I'd make
the right choice again.

589
00:48:07,815 --> 00:48:09,849
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

590
00:48:09,934 --> 00:48:12,935
I fought, I lost.

591
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:16,689
Now I rest.

592
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:21,610
But you, Lord Snow,

593
00:48:21,696 --> 00:48:24,113
you'll be fighting
their battles forever.

594
00:50:11,305 --> 00:50:13,222
We should burn the bodies.

595
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:16,225
You should.

596
00:50:24,986 --> 00:50:27,286
What do you want me to do with this?

597
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:29,071
Wear it.

598
00:50:29,157 --> 00:50:31,490
Burn it.

599
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:33,793
Whatever you want.

600
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:35,377
You have Castle Black.

601
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,386
My watch is ended.

602
00:50:53,687 --> 00:51:04,300
