00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,924
What are they doing with the bodies?

3
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,684
Get back to work.

4
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,371
No. I've been here for weeks.

5
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,650
I'm not scrubbing one more corpse
until you tell me why I'm doing it.

6
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,768
You will know why.

7
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,049
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

8
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,246
Get back to work.

9
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,210
- When do I get to play the game?
- Game?

10
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,090
The game. The Game of Faces.

11
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,491
You tried already. You failed.

12
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,686
I didn't even know I was playing.

13
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,364
Who are you?

14
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,841
No one.

15
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,601
Get back to work.

16
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,126
Who are you?

17
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,206
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

18
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,808
I'm from Westeros, just like you.

19
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,440
Daughter of a lord, just like you.

20
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,369
Except I was an only child.

21
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,808
Heir to his fortune.

22
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,451
My mother died.

23
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,281
My father remarried,
and his new wife gave birth to a girl.

24
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,805
My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

25
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,202
so she tried to kill me with poison.

26
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,330
I found out.

27
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,607
Sought help from the Faceless Men.

28
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,766
And my father was widowed again.

29
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,642
I've been serving them ever since.

30
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,129
Was that true or a lie?

31
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,161
What?

32
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,208
Did you believe every word I said?

33
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,441
Get back to work.

34
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,368
Who are you?

35
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,605
Who are you?

36
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,121
Arya.

37
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,602
And where did you come from?

38
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,841
Westeros.

39
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,209
My family home is Winterfell.

40
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,927
I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,
Eddard Stark.

41
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,481
He died in battle.

42
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,246
A lie.

43
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,369
After he was executed, I fled the capital.

44
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,609
Had to kill a stable boy.

45
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,205
Drove my sword through his back.

46
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,287
A lie.

47
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,491
I stabbed him in the gut.

48
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,647
I tried to find my mother and brother,
but I never did.

49
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,041
They were murdered by Walder Frey.

50
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,806
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

51
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,082
A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.

52
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,602
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

53
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,208
He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.
I left him in the mountains to die.

54
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,807
I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.

55
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,567
I hated him.

56
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,890
That's not a lie!

57
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,244
A girl lies to me,

58
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,722
to the Many-Faced God, to herself.

59
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,968
Does she truly want to be no one?

60
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,081
Yes.

61
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,044
I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!

62
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,163
We never stop playing.

63
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,127
So, those villages we were supposed to find?

64
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,009
We can't live on berries and roots.

65
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,081
I can.

66
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,206
You're not hungry?

67
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,411
Of course I'm hungry.

68
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,521
You're an awful traveling companion,
do you know that?

69
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,489
Possibly the least charming
man I've ever met.

70
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,130
I'm not your traveling companion.

71
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,522
We are traveling together
in each other's company, therefore...

72
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,011
Do you ever shut up?

73
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,884
I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos
in a crate

74
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,846
without ever saying a word.

75
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,921
Why?

76
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,290
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

77
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,969
You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister
decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?

78
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,323
I'm sure you visited many brothels
in many cities.

79
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,921
I killed my father.

80
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,042
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

81
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,682
And he was fucking the woman I loved.

82
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,723
As miserable as you are, Mormont,
at least your father was a good man.

83
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,290
What do you know about my father?

84
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,011
I met him. I visited the Wall.

85
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,087
When I asked him about his men,

86
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,441
he knew all their stories, every one of them.

87
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,969
He actually cared about the people
under his command.

88
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,251
How do they put it in the Watch?

89
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,971
"We shall never see his like again."

90
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,209
Oh, you didn't know.

91
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,571
I'm sorry. I am.

92
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,407
How?

93
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,931
I only know what I heard.

94
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,281
How?

95
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,601
He was leading
an expedition beyond the Wall.

96
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,530
There was a mutiny.

97
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,450
He was murdered by his own men.

98
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,810
We better keep moving.

99
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,520
Valar Morghulis.

100
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,490
Valar Dohaeris.

101
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,284
I have nowhere else to go.

102
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,926
I've taken her to every healer in Braavos.

103
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,281
I've spent every penny I had.

104
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,125
She suffers every day of her life.

105
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,004
I just want it to end.

106
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,845
It hurts.

107
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,087
I know.

108
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,124
Don't be afraid.

109
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,003
I used to be like you.

110
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,165
I was sick.

111
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,090
I was dying.

112
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,526
But my father never gave up on me.

113
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,524
He loved me

114
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,246
more than anything in the world,
just like your father loves you.

115
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,690
So he brought me here.

116
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,091
My father prayed to the Many-Faced God,

117
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,049
and I drank the water from his fountain.

118
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,484
It healed me.

119
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,367
I've devoted my life to him now.

120
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,048
You don't want to hurt anymore?

121
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,800
Drink.

122
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,050
Is a girl ready?

123
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,564
To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue?

124
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,051
Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates?

125
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,930
All that makes a girl who she is?

126
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,930
Forever?

127
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,000
No.

128
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,926
A girl is not ready to become no one.

129
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,081
But she is ready to become someone else.

130
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,763
Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?

131
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,806
As I recall,

132
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,208
the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens
during Robert's Rebellion.

133
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,728
Do you believe in anything?

134
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,040
I believe in lots of things.

135
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,043
In something greater than ourselves, I mean.

136
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,248
The gods, destiny.

137
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,651
Do you believe there's a plan for this world?

138
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,042
- No.
- Neither did I.

139
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,566
I was a cynic, just like you.

140
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,085
Then I saw a girl step into a great fire
with three stone eggs.

141
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,803
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

142
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,846
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

143
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,891
alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.

144
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,960
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

145
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,601
No.

146
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,003
It's hard to be a cynic after that.

147
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,288
Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.

148
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,408
No, it doesn't.

149
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,801
The Targaryens are famously insane.

150
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,611
What if she conquers the world? Then what?

151
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,047
A thousand years of peace and prosperity?

152
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,248
First we have to conquer the world.

153
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,685
We?

154
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,001
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

155
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,529
She's ecstatic when
you bring her this enemy dwarf.

156
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,604
She hacks off my head
and restores your position.

157
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,366
You command her army, sail to Westeros,
defeat all your enemies,

158
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,284
and watch her climb those steps
and sit on the Iron Throne.

159
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,761
Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?

160
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,247
Then she rules.

161
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,168
So, a woman who has not spent
a single day of her adult life in Westeros

162
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,368
becomes the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

163
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,007
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

164
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,766
Because her father, who burned
living men for amusement, was the king?

165
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,481
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

166
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,325
They probably came ashore for...

167
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,805
Water.

168
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,249
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

169
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,845
Salt mines?

170
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,723
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

171
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,809
He looks strong enough.

172
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,769
What about the dwarf?

173
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,447
Worthless.

174
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,041
Cut his throat.

175
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,646
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

176
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,165
And then chop off his cock.

177
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,331
We'll sell it for a fortune.

178
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,442
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

179
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,846
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, Wait!

180
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,448
You can’t just hand a dry cock to a merchant
and expect him to pay for it.

181
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,369
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

182
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,762
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

183
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,604
It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

184
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,603
Guess again.

185
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,883
The dwarf lives until we
find a cock merchant.

186
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,602
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

187
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,763
We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.

188
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,326
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

189
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,165
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

190
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,569
The fighting pits in Meereen?

191
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,081
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

192
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,969
You are looking at one of the great warriors
in the Seven Kingdoms.

193
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,201
Him.

194
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,041
Him?

195
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,842
He's got to be 60 years old.

196
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,929
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

197
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,891
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

198
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,122
They wrote songs about him.

199
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,880
That true?

200
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,209
He won the tournament at Lannisport,
unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

201
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,446
The Kingslayer.

202
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,683
Jousting. You're talking about jousting.

203
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,286
A fancy game for fancy lads.

204
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,931
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

205
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,571
I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

206
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,846
Liar.

207
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,651
It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

208
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,041
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

209
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,606
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

210
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,886
I'll prove my worth.

211
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,083
For my children. Money.

212
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,767
Lord Baelish.

213
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,887
Yes?

214
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,408
Lancel Lannister.

215
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,529
Brother Lancel.

216
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,011
We abandon our family names.

217
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,844
That's quite a family to abandon.

218
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,090
The city has changed
since you were here last.

219
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,924
We flooded the gutters with wine,

220
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,680
smashed the false idols,

221
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,569
and set the godless on the run.

222
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,447
Well done.

223
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,328
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

224
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,001
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

225
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,730
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

226
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,691
You'll find there's little tolerance for
flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.

227
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,730
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.

228
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,246
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

229
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,331
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,

230
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,565
arresting the heir to Highgarden?

231
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,405
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

232
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,529
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

233
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,290
The king's orders.

234
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,488
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras' perversion?

235
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,483
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

236
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,808
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

237
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,728
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.

238
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,327
Ser Loras was promised to me.
Instead, he chose the company of boys.

239
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,687
One's choice of companion is a curious thing.

240
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,001
Most curious.

241
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,602
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

242
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,444
A thoroughly repellant woman.

243
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,330
Forgive me.

244
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,763
I know you're still in mourning.

245
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,570
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

246
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,291
She was neither of those things.
We both know it.

247
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,169
Still, I pity her son.

248
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,209
How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale
has a new father to counsel him.

249
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,521
I know how hard it can be

250
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,967
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

251
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,010
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights of the Vale fight for their king?

252
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,606
Young Lord Robin heeds my advice,

253
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,564
and I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

254
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,211
Good.

255
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,525
If there's nothing else.

256
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,690
There is another matter, Your Grace.

257
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,286
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

258
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,251
You once charged me with finding Arya Stark.

259
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,363
To my shame, I failed you.

260
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,409
But I have found Sansa Stark.

261
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,842
Alive and well and home again

262
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,001
living at Winterfell.

263
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,289
That's not possible.

264
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,647
My sources are well placed.

265
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,489
They tell me Roose Bolton
plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay,

266
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,040
a bastard recently legitimized
by King Tommen.

267
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,847
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

268
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,891
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

269
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,481
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

270
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,526
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks
gives him more legitimacy in the North

271
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,762
than an alliance with a hated southern house.

272
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,166
I will skin him and his bastard
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

273
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,890
I would counsel patience, Your Grace.

274
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,485
Patience?

275
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,691
Sansa helped murder my son.
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

276
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,646
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,
marching with his army on Winterfell.

277
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,646
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

278
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,563
Let the enemies of the throne
slaughter each other.

279
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,361
And when they're done, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

280
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,002
Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.
The weather has already begun to turn.

281
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,529
That is why it is critical to strike soon,
while the victor still licks his wounds.

282
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,407
Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.

283
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,723
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

284
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,165
Ser Jaime, then.

285
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,084
Jaime's away
on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

286
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,927
I have no idea when he'll be back.

287
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,650
Perhaps I can help.

288
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,882
The Knights of the Vale
are some of the best fighters in Westeros,

289
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,928
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

290
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,968
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

291
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,648
you have a reputation as a moneylender
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

292
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,203
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier
or a single coin from the royal treasury.

293
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,280
What do you have to lose?

294
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,689
A brothel keeper?

295
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,280
And if you succeed?

296
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,408
Name me Warden of the North.

297
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,328
I'll speak to the king this evening,

298
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,562
have him issue a royal decree.

299
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,605
I'll not rest until the
lion flies over Winterfell.

300
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,887
I'll know you're a man of your word

301
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,804
when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

302
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,927
As I said,

303
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,849
I live to serve.

304
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,526
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

305
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,843
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

306
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,764
We've waited long enough.

307
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,801
I want you to be my wife.

308
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,291
Now.

309
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,767
What is it?

310
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,643
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

311
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,051
Or do you...

312
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,441
We can't. Not yet.

313
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,567
Why not?

314
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,762
You know why not. Someone will see.

315
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,207
You are going to be my wife.

316
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,080
I am going to be your husband.

317
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,086
We're allowed
to walk through the gardens together.

318
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,683
How many other girls
have you walked through these gardens?

319
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,366
I like the way your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

320
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,966
They do not go squinty,
and you didn't answer the question.

321
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,208
They make a lovely couple.

322
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,881
A Lannister and a Martell.

323
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,889
They have no idea how dangerous that is.

324
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,329
We must protect them.

325
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,289
Yes, my prince.

326
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,770
You haven't had to use
that ax of yours in a long time.

327
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,165
I hope you remember how.

328
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,763
I remember how.

329
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,401
The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun

330
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,451
And her kisses were warmer than spring

331
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,690
The Dornishman's blade
It was made of black steel

332
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,809
And its kiss was a terrible thing

333
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,007
The Dornishman's wife
Would sing as she bathed

334
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,887
In a voice that was sweet as a peach...

335
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,564
All right, that's enough.

336
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,404
I'm coming to the best part.

337
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,528
We're trying to blend in.

338
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,409
Don't want everyone in Dorne
to hear your accent.

339
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,209
This song really is all about the ending.

340
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,681
It can wait. There.

341
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,885
That's the Water Gardens.

342
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,531
And once we've got the princess,
then what?

343
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,770
I like to improvise.

344
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,161
That explains the golden hand.

345
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,720
Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.

346
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,681
For Oberyn.

347
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,367
For Oberyn.

348
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,681
Well, she's made herself at home.

349
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,491
Myrcella.

350
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,091
Uncle Jaime?

351
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,881
I...

352
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,889
I don't understand. What are you doing here?

353
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,450
Let's speak in private.

354
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,885
I am Trystane Martell.

355
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,211
Trystane is my intended.

356
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,769
Excellent. Good to meet you.

357
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,610
We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime.

358
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,684
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

359
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,284
Let's not do something stupid.

360
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,721
That was something stupid.

361
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,370
We have to go, Myrcella, now.

362
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,527
You hurt him!

363
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,204
He'll be fine, I promise. But we have to...

364
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,481
Oh, for fuck's sake.

365
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,167
Take her!

366
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,525
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

367
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,523
I wasn't asking, princess.

368
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,171
Drop your weapons!

369
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,727
I am Obara Sand.

370
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,564
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

371
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,290
I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?

372
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,328
Drop your weapons.

373
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,563
When you were whole,
it would have been a good fight.

374
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,323
You fight pretty good for a little girl.

375
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,611
Halt!

376
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,527
Oh.

377
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,887
You can smell the shit from five miles away.

378
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,131
Well, why have we stopped? Go on.

379
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,205
Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got.

380
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,203
It's theater, nothing more.

381
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,648
If they arrested
all the pillow biters in King's Landing,

382
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,530
there'd be no room left in the dungeons
for anyone else.

383
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,329
Everyone knew about him and Renly.

384
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,967
Renly Baratheon shagged
half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

385
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,804
Everyone knew, no one cared.

386
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,245
But he was the king's brother.

387
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,209
And Loras is the queen's brother.

388
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,647
No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable.

389
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,047
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yes, of course she is.

390
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,125
She wants to drag our name through the dirt,
put us in our place.

391
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,123
Get some rest, dear. You look appalling.

392
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,328
And let me deal with Cersei Lannister.

393
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,009
Your Grace, I have traveled a long way.

394
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,524
You must be exhausted.

395
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,123
Put the pen down, dear.
We both know you're not writing anything.

396
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,124
Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued
Queen of Thorns.

397
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,204
And the famous tart, Queen Cersei.

398
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,726
I beg your pardon?

399
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,202
I know you're behind
this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

400
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,762
If you apologize for that comment,
perhaps I'll...

401
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,684
You'll get your apology when I get Loras.

402
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,090
I was as shocked as anyone
when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.

403
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,087
I have no love for these fanatics,

404
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,731
but what can a Queen Mother do?

405
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,087
Has the crown suddenly stopped needing

406
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,323
the troops, gold,
and wheat my house supplies?

407
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,490
I can assure you,
our alliance with House Tyrell remains...

408
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,884
Do you expect the alliance to continue
after you've thrown our future into prison?

409
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,246
As I said,

410
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,642
I didn't imprison anyone.

411
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,324
As for your veiled threats...

412
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,561
What veil?

413
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,488
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace
to a war-torn country.

414
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,723
Do you really want to see
the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

415
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,570
I didn't trust your father.

416
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,527
I didn't particularly like him.

417
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,803
But I respected him. He was no fool.

418
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,442
He understood that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

419
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,090
rather than destroy them.

420
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,248
House Lannister has no rival.

421
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,242
The High Septon has called for an inquest,
not a trial.

422
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,848
Just a small hearing to determine
whether the charges against Loras have merit,

423
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,843
which I'm sure they don't.

424
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,208
Loras will be freed,
our happy alliance will continue,

425
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,009
and we'll forget
this unfortunate conversation ever happened.

426
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,320
Good day, Lady Olenna.

427
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,963
You are aware of
the rumors concerning you and Renly?

428
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,560
I don't pay attention to rumors.

429
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,723
You were said
to be despondent when he died.

430
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,364
Witnesses state that you
refused to leave his bedside,

431
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,011
even as Stannis' army closed in.

432
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,720
He was my friend.

433
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,841
He was my king.

434
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,490
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

435
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,571
He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly.

436
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,208
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

437
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,164
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

438
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,082
I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.

439
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,091
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

440
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,685
Why does it matter what I wore?

441
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,445
Do you deny all the charges against you?

442
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,567
Fornication.

443
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,241
Buggery. Blasphemy.

444
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,731
Of course I deny them.

445
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,768
You never lay with Renly Baratheon?

446
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,566
Never.

447
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,804
Nor any other man?

448
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,521
Never.

449
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,971
That will be all, Ser Loras.

450
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,567
Well, I think that's quite enough of that.

451
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,206
The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.

452
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,201
You call me forward?

453
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,647
Yes, we have some questions for you.

454
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,565
- I am the queen.
- You are.

455
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,241
And according to the law of the Seven,

456
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,804
neither kings nor queens are exempt
from testimony at a holy inquest.

457
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,207
How do you respond to
these charges against your brother?

458
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,170
They are lies.

459
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,605
- All of them?
- All of them.

460
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,931
Queen Margaery,

461
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,527
in the presence of the gods,
do you swear that your brother is innocent

462
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,649
of these charges against him,
to the best of your knowledge?

463
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,685
Yes, I swear it.

464
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,962
Thank you, Your Grace.

465
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,930
Do you know this man?

466
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,801
Yes.

467
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,651
Very well.

468
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,765
He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.

469
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,730
How did you come to meet?

470
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,488
I squired for him.

471
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,450
He took a liking to me.

472
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,807
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

473
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,084
And what occurred in his chamber?

474
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,643
We engaged in intimate relations.

475
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,005
You lay with him?

476
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,366
That night and many others.

477
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,841
Liar. He's a liar.

478
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,248
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

479
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,650
Yes.

480
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,331
Yes, Queen Margaery.

481
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,969
She walked in on us once, not long ago.

482
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,044
She didn't seem surprised.

483
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,890
This testimony is an insult to a great house.

484
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,005
Why should the Faith or anyone else

485
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,289
take the word of a squire
over the heir to Highgarden?

486
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,488
He has a birthmark, Your Grace.

487
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,002
Quite high on his thigh.

488
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,524
Wine-colored
and roughly the shape of Dorne.

489
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,485
No! Liar!

490
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,723
What are you doing? Let us pass.

491
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,406
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

492
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,244
to bring a formal trial

493
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,450
for Ser Loras

494
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,371
and Queen Margaery.

495
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,771
What?

496
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,409
Bearing false witness before the gods
is as grave a sin as any, my lady.

497
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,887
Take her.

498
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,685
No.

499
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,121
Tommen.

500
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,367
Tommen!

501
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,127
You can't do this. I am the queen.

502
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,801
Tommen! Tommen!

503
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,884
I am your queen. How dare you?
Take your hands off me!

504
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,449
Tommen!

505
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,087
What do you want?

506
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,929
Lord Ramsay sent me
to draw your bath, my lady.

507
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,931
You want to be clean and fresh
for your new husband, don't you?

508
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,324
You're so beautiful,

509
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,804
but you need to keep him happy.

510
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,601
Ramsay gets bored easily.

511
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,245
You don't want to end up like...

512
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,966
Well, like the others.

513
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,490
What others?

514
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,960
I shouldn't gossip.

515
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,490
Oh, it's good to see the red again.

516
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,245
No point hiding anymore.

517
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,810
What others?

518
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,681
Let's see, there was Kyra,
the blacksmith's daughter.

519
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,286
She was tall like you, lovely figure.

520
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,809
But she talked and talked and talked,

521
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,088
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

522
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,409
Then there was Violet.

523
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,131
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

524
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,090
But she got pregnant.

525
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,010
And, well, that was boring.

526
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,766
Then Tansy.

527
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,649
Such a sweet girl.

528
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,681
Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull

529
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,728
after a while, don't they?

530
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,207
Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

531
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,486
Hunt?

532
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,721
Mmm.

533
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,886
Have you ever seen a body
after the dogs have been at it?

534
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,604
Not so pretty.

535
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,207
But, well, it's your wedding day.

536
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,321
Why am I talking about such things?

537
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,290
What was your name again?

538
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,885
Myranda.

539
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,884
And how long have you loved him, Myranda?

540
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,365
Did you imagine that he would
be with you forever, is that it?

541
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,329
And I came along and ruined it.

542
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,325
I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.

543
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,291
This is my home, and you can't frighten me.

544
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,927
Are you done with your bath, my lady?

545
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,411
Go. I can finish on my own.

546
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,406
Yes?

547
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,091
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

548
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,730
If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?

549
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,881
No.

550
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,811
Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

551
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,166
I'm not touching you.

552
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,811
Please.

553
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,211
He'll punish me.

554
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,806
You think I care what he does to you?

555
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,801
Who comes before the Old Gods this night?

556
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,084
Sansa of the House Stark

557
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,250
comes here to be wed.

558
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,245
A woman grown, trueborn and noble.

559
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,891
She comes to beg the blessings of the gods.

560
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,251
Who comes to claim her?

561
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,164
Ramsay of House Bolton.

562
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,848
Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell.

563
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,290
Who gives her?

564
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,242
Theon of House Greyjoy, who was...

565
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,404
Who was her father's ward.

566
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,128
Lady Sansa, will you take this man?

567
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,084
I take this man.

568
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,529
Are you pleased, my lady?

569
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,604
Good. I want you to be happy.

570
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,201
My father said you're still a virgin.

571
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,481
Uh, yes.

572
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,891
Why?

573
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,648
Why are you still a virgin?

574
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,560
Afraid of dwarves?

575
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,369
Lord Tyrion was kind.

576
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,762
He was gentle. He never touched me.

577
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,051
You're not lying to me?

578
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,006
No, my lord.

579
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,401
Lying to your husband on his wedding night,

580
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,130
that would be a bad way to start a marriage.

581
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,123
We're man and wife now.

582
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,686
We should be honest with each other.

583
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,966
Don't you think?

584
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,765
Yes.

585
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,600
Good.

586
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,765
Take off your clothes.

587
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,690
Oh, no, no, no.

588
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,524
You stay here, Reek.

589
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,965
You watch.

590
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,808
Do I need to ask a second time?

591
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,129
I hate asking a second time.

592
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,687
Reek.

593
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,843
I told you to watch.

594
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,565
You've known Sansa since she was a girl.

595
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,849
Now watch her become a woman.

596
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:23,500
