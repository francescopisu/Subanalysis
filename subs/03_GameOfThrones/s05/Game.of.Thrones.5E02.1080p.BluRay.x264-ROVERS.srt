<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,044
We're going to Braavos!

3
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,960
In the old times,
whenever Braavos stood in danger,

4
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,522
the Titan would step with fire in his eyes.

5
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,487
He'd wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

6
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,645
He's just a statue.

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,846
Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.

8
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,082
I'm not afraid.

9
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,884
The House of Black and White.

10
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,410
This is where you'll find the man you seek.

11
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,447
Here I leave you.

12
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,370
Thank you for bringing me.

13
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,011
Any man of Braavos
would have done the same.

14
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,161
Valar Morghulis.

15
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,523
Valar Dohaeris.

16
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,405
Hello.

17
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,763
Valar Morghulis.

18
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,921
Um...

19
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,085
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

20
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,009
No one here by that name.

21
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,881
Please.

22
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,964
I crossed the Narrow Sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

23
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,963
You have everywhere else to go.

24
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,730
But wait...

25
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,564
Cersei.

26
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,930
Walder Frey.

27
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,524
The Mountain.

28
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,210
Meryn Trant.

29
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,444
Cersei.

30
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,331
Walder Frey.

31
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,245
The Mountain.

32
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,531
Meryn Trant.

33
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,490
Cersei. Walder Frey.

34
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,130
The Mountain.

35
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,490
Meryn Trant.

36
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,684
Cersei.

37
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,370
Walder Frey.

38
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,170
The Mountain.

39
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,890
Meryn Trant.

40
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,170
Cersei.

41
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,809
Walder Frey.

42
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,849
The Mountain.

43
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,930
Meryn Trant.

44
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,520
Must be good food if it's crowded.

45
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,320
Ale?

46
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,330
Ale?

47
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,011
Before we left,
a maester gave you a raven scroll.

48
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,207
You are becoming an observant young lady.

49
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,006
My mother used to say,
"Dark wings, dark words."

50
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,522
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

51
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,530
Excuse me.

52
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,886
So, it was good news?

53
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,682
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

54
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,645
I thought you still mourned
the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

55
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,801
Ale?

56
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,527
I'll have some.

57
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,841
My lady.

58
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,327
What is it?

59
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,686
Sansa Stark. Don't look.

60
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,561
You sure?

61
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,165
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

62
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,685
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

63
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,046
Littlefinger?

64
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,645
A bunch of knights with him.

65
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,603
A bunch? What's a bunch, Podrick? Six? 20?

66
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,961
Ten, I think. Too many.

67
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,451
My lady, I don't think this is the right...

68
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,364
- Ready the horses.
- We only have one horse.

69
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,249
Find more.

70
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,849
Do you like the taste?

71
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,922
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

72
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,046
Why do men love it so much?

73
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,168
It gives some men courage.

74
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,522
Does it give you courage?

75
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,201
That's far enough.

76
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,090
Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa.

77
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,408
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

78
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,687
We've met with Renly Baratheon.

79
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,002
What did he say about you?

80
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,048
He said

81
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,885
your loyalty came free of charge.

82
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,806
Someone appears to have
paid quite a bit for it since then.

83
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,164
Lady Sansa,

84
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,124
before your mother's death,

85
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,726
I was her sworn sword.

86
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,724
I gave my word
I would find you and protect you.

87
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,010
I will shield your back and keep your counsel

88
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,765
and give my life for yours if need be.

89
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,969
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

90
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,048
Please, Lady Brienne,

91
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,407
no need for such formality.

92
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,608
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?

93
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,762
- I was.
- Strange.

94
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,330
I knew Cat from the time we were children.

95
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,169
She never mentioned you.

96
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,163
It was after Renly's murder.

97
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,321
Ah. Yes.

98
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,130
You were accused of killing him.

99
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,766
- I tried to save him.
- But you were accused.

100
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,922
By men who didn't see what happened.

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,490
And what did happen?

102
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,283
He was murdered by a shadow.

103
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,001
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

104
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,170
A shadow?

105
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,848
With the face...

106
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,202
This woman
swore to protect Renly.

107
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,651
She failed.

108
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,883
She swore to protect your mother. She failed.

109
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
Why would I want somebody
with your history of failure

110
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,121
guarding Lady Sansa?

111
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,362
Why should you have any say in her affairs?

112
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,805
Because I am her uncle.

113
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,362
I married her Aunt Lysa
shortly before my beloved's untimely death.

114
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,444
We're family now, and you are an outsider.

115
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,567
Forgive me, Lady Brienne,

116
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,166
but experience has made me
wary of outsiders.

117
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,326
Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone...

118
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,401
No.

119
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,609
Please, my lady. If I could explain...

120
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,206
I saw you at Joffrey's wedding
bowing to the king.

121
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,886
Neither of us wanted to be there.

122
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,491
Sometimes we don't have a choice.

123
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,483
And sometimes we do.

124
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,604
You should leave.

125
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,565
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

126
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,608
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

127
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,841
Why don't you stay?

128
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,050
The man asked you to stay...

129
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,370
Hyah! Hyah!

130
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,291
Hyah! Hyah!

131
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,925
After her!

132
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,126
- Yah! Hah!
- Oh!

133
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,088
- Stop!
- I'll take him!

134
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,249
Podrick!

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,684
Hold on to her!

136
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,650
Take her!

137
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,691
Keep moving!

138
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,569
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

139
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,083
That's a good boy. Come on. Come on.

140
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,044
No, no, no, stop!

141
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,210
I guess that means you're unarmed.

142
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,971
Down, Podrick! Down!

143
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,761
Podrick.

144
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,926
Yes. my lady?

145
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,164
You can stand now.

146
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,241
Yes, my lady.

147
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,603
Sansa Stark?

148
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,527
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

149
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,967
I saw her riding on the East Road
with Littlefinger.

150
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,087
We'll follow them.

151
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,729
My lady,
If both Stark girls refused your service,

152
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,325
maybe you're released from your vow.

153
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,688
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

154
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,761
But if they don't want your protection...

155
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,047
Do you think she's safe with Littlefinger?

156
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,330
No, my lady.

157
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,129
Get your horse.

158
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,488
A summons from the queen.

159
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,767
There are only
two like it in the world.

160
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,206
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

161
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,011
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

162
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,250
Our daughter's alone in Dorne
surrounded by people who hate our family.

163
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,482
"It's a threat."

164
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,081
No note?

165
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,209
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

166
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,443
and every other tragedy
that's befallen their cursed country.

167
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
I will burn their cities to the ground
if they touch her.

168
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,889
- Softer.
- What?

169
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,961
Not so loud.

170
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,884
Our daughter's in danger
and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly?

171
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,247
The world can't know she's our daughter.

172
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,927
Then don't call her your daughter.

173
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,530
You've never been a father to her.

174
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,080
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the street.

175
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,202
And what has your caution brought?

176
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,724
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

177
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,207
Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.

178
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,764
Our baby boy set to marry
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

179
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,921
I'm going to make things better.

180
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,490
You've never made anything better.

181
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,042
I'm going to Dorne
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

182
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,961
You can’t just ask Prince Doran
to give her back.

183
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,405
She's promised to his son.

184
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,406
I'm not going to ask him anything.

185
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,482
You go down there with an army,
it's an act of war.

186
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,289
No army.

187
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,521
Do you know where they're keeping her?

188
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,404
- Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
- I’ll find her.

189
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,923
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

190
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,804
You're going to Dorne?

191
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,367
A one-handed man, alone.

192
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,602
I never said I was going alone.

193
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,365
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

194
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,602
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

195
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,366
And music. I adore music.
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

196
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,488
We can have a harp if you like,
but no flutes.

197
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,881
Then there's the food.
Food is the most important thing.

198
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,531
Don't you agree?
We're going to need pigeon pies.

199
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,807
That's what they eat in
the capital, don't they?

200
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,004
Don't they?

201
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,327
Don't who?

202
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,370
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

203
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,529
They certainly do, my dear.

204
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,121
It's a fine place, isn't it?

205
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,645
A fine place.

206
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,291
I never thought I'd end up
settling down in a place like this.

207
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,966
You won't.

208
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,041
Pardon?

209
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,088
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

210
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,448
When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

211
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,931
She hates me.

212
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,321
She calls me mean names,
and sometimes, even still,

213
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,290
she pulls my hair when Mother's not looking.

214
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,842
You know what I think?

215
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,048
I think you're a good person.

216
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,122
And your sister is a mean person.

217
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,690
She is.

218
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,603
I've been all over the world,

219
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,728
and if there's one thing I've learned,

220
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,962
it's that meanness comes around.

221
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,809
People like your sister,

222
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,362
they always get
what's coming to them eventually.

223
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,408
One way or another.

224
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,204
Who's that?

225
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,162
Jaime fucking Lannister.

226
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,810
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

227
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,480
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

228
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,005
Thank you.

229
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,125
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

230
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,886
A pleasure.

231
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,404
Run along, love.

232
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,802
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

233
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,004
When were you planning on getting married?

234
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,401
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

235
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,970
What you're here for.

236
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,970
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

237
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,084
It's very good for you.

238
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,243
- Lollys will be marrying Ser Willis Bracken.
- Mmm.

239
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,641
We made a deal, your sister and I.

240
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,241
I would have advised against that.

241
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,761
How is this good for me?

242
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,969
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

243
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,485
And when we return,

244
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,087
I'm going to give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

245
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,282
Return from where?

246
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,562
As far south as south goes.

247
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,962
My future queen.

248
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,723
You are beautiful.

249
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,768
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

250
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,688
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take
that long ax and I'll shove it up your...

251
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,330
Captain.

252
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,007
Let her pass.

253
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,807
Your brother was murdered,

254
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,329
and you sit here in the Water Gardens,
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

255
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,610
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
By law, that is not murder.

256
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,081
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

257
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,004
He was my brother
long before he was anything to you.

258
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,006
What will you do about his death?

259
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,606
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

260
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,727
And then?

261
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,285
You would have me go to war?

262
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,725
The whole country would have you go to war.

263
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,644
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

264
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,884
The Sand Snakes are with me.

265
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,650
They have the love of their people.

266
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,443
They will avenge their father while
you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

267
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,691
Oberyn is dead,

268
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,565
and this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens,

269
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,446
eating our food, breathing our air.

270
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,646
How many of your brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

271
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,765
Let me have her.

272
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,327
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

273
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,122
I loved my brother.

274
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,402
And you made him very happy.

275
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,610
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

276
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,088
But we do not mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

277
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,445
Not here.

278
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,171
Not while I rule.

279
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,643
And how long will that be?

280
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,922
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

281
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,290
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

282
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,283
Of course you haven't found
any Sons of the Harpy.

283
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,763
You haven't, have you?

284
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,524
My Second Sons, on the other hand,

285
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,331
they drink, whore,

286
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,209
fight in the streets,

287
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,691
they blend in.

288
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,161
They overhear things in taverns,

289
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,926
follow people to nice, quiet alleys,

290
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,048
break a few fingers,

291
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,849
overhear a few more things.

292
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,124
Before you know it...

293
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,601
No one here.

294
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,285
We go.

295
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,125
In a hurry? You're afraid?

296
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,168
Unsullied fear nothing.

297
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,685
Right.

298
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,131
That's your problem.

299
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,171
You understood fear once long ago,
but you've forgotten what it means.

300
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,526
Someone who's forgotten fear

301
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,610
has forgotten how to hide.

302
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,887
Fear is useful that way.

303
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,323
Sons of the Harpy,
they want to put a collar back on my neck.

304
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,083
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

305
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,446
It would send a message.

306
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,161
I think you should exercise restraint,
Your Grace.

307
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,287
Why?

308
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,084
For one thing,
he may have valuable information.

309
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,050
The Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

310
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,440
How do you know that?

311
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,443
Because I questioned him.

312
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,042
And the information you did get,
he is young and poor.

313
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,161
He is born free.

314
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,481
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

315
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,925
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

316
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,849
was knowing that
there was someone lower than he was.

317
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,967
They pay him.

318
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,123
Great families afraid to do a thing.

319
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,931
They pay poor men to do it for them.

320
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,843
- And how do you know this?
- Everyone know this.

321
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,968
I don't know it,
and I'm the head of a great family.

322
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,361
We do not know
what this man did or didn't do.

323
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,001
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

324
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,285
Show all the citizens of Meereen

325
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,761
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

326
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,921
Teach them a better way.

327
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,447
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

328
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,923
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

329
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,002
But here in Meereen,

330
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,004
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

331
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,401
So we learn much about them,

332
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,608
or we do not live long.

333
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,808
They teach me what they are.

334
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,125
Mercy, fair trial, these
mean nothing to them.

335
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,441
All they understand is blood.

336
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,762
Thank you all for your counsel.

337
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,721
Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

338
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,491
- About what?
- About your father.

339
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,528
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

340
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,125
You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies?

341
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,486
Consider me reminded.

342
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,449
Your Grace,

343
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,000
I served in his Kingsguard.

344
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,605
I was at his side from the first.

345
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,122
Your enemies did not lie.

346
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,251
Go on.

347
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,805
When the people rose in revolt against him,

348
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,407
your father set their
towns and castles aflame.

349
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,802
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

350
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,201
He burned men alive with wildfire

351
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,009
and laughed as they screamed.

352
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,642
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

353
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,044
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen except two.

354
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,685
I'm not my father.

355
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,525
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

356
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,530
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

357
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,400
And each time,
it made him feel powerful and right.

358
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,051
Until the very end.

359
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,880
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

360
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,482
Your Grace.

361
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,046
There's a bug.

362
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,610
Yes, best be careful.

363
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,490
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

364
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,361
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

365
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,766
Besides,

366
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,482
what else is there for me to do
inside this fucking box?

367
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,607
You don't like it?

368
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,728
- I want to take a walk.
- You can't.

369
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,447
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

370
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,488
She ought to offer her cunt.

371
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,767
Best part of her for the best part of me.

372
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,491
Well, I suppose a box
is as good a place for me as anywhere.

373
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,206
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

374
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,282
talking about the futility of everything?

375
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,566
You're right. No point.

376
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,483
The road to Volantis?

377
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,530
You said we were going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

378
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,011
The road to Meereen.

379
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,562
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

380
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,842
I told you. A ruler.

381
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,206
We've already got a ruler.

382
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,731
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

383
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,124
Every pile of shit on the side of every road
has someones banner hanging from it.

384
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,451
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

385
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,484
During your brief tenure as Hand.

386
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,085
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

387
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,527
Still, a man of talent.

388
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,085
Managed to kill a lot of people.

389
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,131
Yes, but you showed great promise
in other areas as well.

390
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,410
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

391
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,609
She begged me.

392
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,841
I wouldn't go.

393
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,481
Why?

394
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,050
'Cause I liked it.

395
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,729
Power.

396
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,882
Even as a servant.

397
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,042
People follow leaders.

398
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,521
And they will never follow us.
They find us repulsive.

399
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,926
I find us repulsive.

400
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,923
And we find them repulsive,

401
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,288
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

402
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,486
to keep them away.

403
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,488
And yet,

404
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,767
no matter what we do,

405
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,243
people like you and me
are never really satisfied inside the box.

406
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,924
Not for long.

407
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,929
You're right.

408
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,321
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

409
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,609
How many dwarves are there in the world?

410
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,365
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

411
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,845
Not him.

412
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,849
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

413
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,601
Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

414
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,806
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

415
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,210
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

416
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,805
Mistakes will be made.

417
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,609
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

418
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,324
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

419
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,402
I would take it, if you don't mind.

420
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,721
It could prove useful for my work.

421
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,761
Very good.

422
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,248
Over there will be fine.

423
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,560
You heard the man. Over there.

424
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,725
You're the Hand of the King?

425
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,290
No, Uncle.

426
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,046
Clearly it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

427
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,168
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

428
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,844
and chooses a Hand for himself.

429
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,364
Your Grace,
I would be willing to serve provisionally

430
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,602
as the King's Hand
until he becomes old enough...

431
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,125
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

432
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,605
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

433
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,527
In addition to being Master of Ships,

434
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,331
the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

435
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,967
Oh, Your Grace.

436
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,442
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

437
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,211
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the crown's interests in the same.

438
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,282
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

439
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,643
Your Grace, in the past on several occasions,

440
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,246
a grand maester has served
as the King's Hand.

441
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,120
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

442
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,731
Your Grace, him? This man?

443
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,009
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

444
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,086
Your Grace, what qualifications
can he possibly have for this post?

445
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,282
The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester.

446
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,888
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

447
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,482
Far more than many ever have.

448
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,323
I must say, I cannot see...

449
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,724
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position
as commander of the Lannister armies,

450
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,322
it would please the king
if you would serve as his Master of War.

451
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,563
No man living better deserves the title.

452
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,842
That is kind of you to say.

453
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,207
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

454
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,566
The king is very busy at this moment.

455
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,081
He should be here
learning what it means to rule.

456
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,605
He is learning.

457
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,368
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

458
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,127
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother.

459
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,289
And to you. And to serve the king.

460
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,250
I did not return to serve as your puppet.

461
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,646
To watch you stack the Small Council
with sycophants.

462
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,771
Sending your own brother away
so he wouldn't be...

463
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,610
My brother has left the capital to

464
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,923
lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

465
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,001
What mission?

466
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,845
That is not your concern as Master of War.

467
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,566
I do not recognize your authority
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

468
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,169
You are the Queen Mother, nothing more.

469
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,611
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

470
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,963
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

471
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,043
At Casterly Rock.

472
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,120
Come on, you know this one.

473
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,529
It looks like an animal.

474
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,043
Snake.

475
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,208
Snake.S.

476
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,926
- It's an S.
- Right, very good.

477
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,041
Huh!

478
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,049
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark,

479
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,690
was elected at the age of 10?

480
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,603
I know S.

481
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,330
You'll learn, I promise.

482
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,483
I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

483
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,688
Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

484
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,406
Very patient.

485
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,290
I only said that the more time
that you spend practicing,

486
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,566
the faster you'll be able to read.

487
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,450
That's all right. We're doing just fine.

488
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,481
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

489
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,247
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

490
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,810
- Three.
- Three?

491
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,291
Who taught you, your mother?

492
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,124
No, old Maester Cressen did.

493
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,690
I had a lot of time to practice.

494
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,922
My mother kept me inside because...

495
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,411
What do you call it in the south,
what happened to your face?

496
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,403
Greyscale.

497
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,289
What do you call it north of the Wall?

498
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,769
I don't know.

499
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,890
But two of my sisters had it.

500
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,724
They both died.

501
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,961
How did they cure you?

502
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,091
I don't remember. I was a baby.

503
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,242
Lots of people came and tried, I think.

504
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,488
Whatever they did, it went away.

505
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,005
What happened to your sisters?

506
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,161
My father made them move out of the keep
into the hut outside.

507
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,447
None of us were allowed to go near them.

508
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,007
But we heard them, especially at night.

509
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,727
They started to sound not like themselves.

510
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,206
Did you ever see them?

511
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,727
Only once at the end.

512
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,525
They were covered with it.

513
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,049
Their faces, their arms.

514
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,811
They acted like animals.

515
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,529
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

516
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,008
What did he do with them in the woods?

517
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,882
- Mother.
- Leave us.

518
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,807
Your Grace.

519
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,290
You need to stay away from that girl.

520
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,725
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

521
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,963
Her name is Gilly. She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

522
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,362
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

523
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,205
He executed their king for treason.

524
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,124
They could strike at him by striking at you.

525
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,089
Gilly wouldn't do that.

526
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,847
You have no idea what people will do.

527
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,927
All your books and you still don't know.

528
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,726
I ordered Mance Rayder
burned at the stake.

529
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,041
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

530
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,441
You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

531
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,121
A king's word is law.

532
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,125
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

533
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,882
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

534
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,883
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

535
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,801
With respect, Your Grace,

536
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,362
the free folk will never follow you
no matter what you do.

537
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,330
You're the man who burned their king alive.

538
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,685
Who, then?

539
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,281
You?

540
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,405
No.

541
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,968
Only one of their own.

542
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,288
Do you know this wretched girl,

543
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,367
Lyanna Mormont?

544
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,369
The Lord Commander's niece.

545
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,887
Lady of Bear Island and a child of 10.

546
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,523
I asked her to commit her house to my cause.
That's her response.

547
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,604
"Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

548
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,887
"whose name is Stark."

549
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,684
That amuses you?

550
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,642
I apologize, Your Grace.

551
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,808
Northerners can be a bit like the free folk.

552
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,644
Loyal to their own.

553
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,841
I know.

554
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,363
My brother, Robert, went on often and loudly
about how difficult it was to control them.

555
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,682
Even with your father's help.

556
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,405
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elects a new Lord Commander.

557
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,209
Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.

558
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,806
- Most likely.
- Unpleasant man.

559
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,451
He thinks you're a traitor.

560
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,410
What's your life going to be like here
at the Wall with Thorne in command?

561
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,891
Unpleasant, I expect.

562
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,008
Your bravery made him look weak.

563
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,844
He'll punish you for it.

564
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,649
I don't punish men for bravery.

565
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,644
I reward them.

566
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,848
I don't doubt it, Your Grace.

567
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,768
But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

568
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,968
I pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.

569
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,210
I don't know what I have left to give you.

570
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,847
You can give me the North.

571
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,370
I can't.

572
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,047
Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard, a Snow.

573
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,326
Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.

574
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,529
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

575
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,443
Lord of Winterfell.

576
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,491
He'll make you a Stark
with the stroke of a pen?

577
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,131
It's the first thing I ever remember wanting.

578
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,884
I'd daydream that my father
would ask the king

579
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,248
and just like that, I would never be
the Bastard of Winterfell again.

580
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,607
You deserve this. You do.

581
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,331
I couldn't be happier for you.

582
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,607
I'm going to refuse him.

583
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,086
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

584
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,481
I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.

585
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,281
If I don't take my own word seriously,
what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?

586
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,808
Crowded. You'd think
we were serving venison stew.

587
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,288
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates

588
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,205
before we cast our tokens

589
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,003
for the 998th Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

590
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,843
Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight,
he's a man of true nobility.

591
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,364
He was acting commander
when the Wall came under attack

592
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,204
and led us to victory against the wildlings.

593
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,281
Hear, hear.

594
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,691
He's a veteran of 100 battles

595
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,969
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

596
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,485
Aye.

597
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,131
He's the only true choice.

598
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,281
Yes!

599
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,247
Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy

600
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,690
and has served loyally,
longer than any other ranger.

601
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,449
Through 10 winters he served.

602
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,002
As commander of the Shadow Tower,
he kept the wildlings away.

603
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,721
We could do no better.

604
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,842
If there is no one else,
we will begin the voting.

605
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,326
The triangular tokens
count for Ser Alliser Thorne.

606
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,321
The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.

607
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,165
- Each brother will...
- Maester Aemon.

608
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,849
Samwell Tarly. Go on.

609
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,648
Sam the Slayer.

610
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,445
Another wildling lover
just like his friend Jon Snow.

611
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,161
How's your lady love, Slayer?

612
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,208
Her name is Gilly.

613
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,170
Brother Slynt knows her quite well.

614
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,490
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

615
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,608
Lies!

616
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,890
A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos.

617
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,049
I found him there after the battle was over
in a puddle of his own making.

618
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,607
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
with the women and children,

619
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,727
Jon Snow was leading.

620
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,362
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true.

621
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,171
And when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

622
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,889
He took charge of the Wall's defense.
He killed the Magnar of the Thenns.

623
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,207
He went north to deal with Mance Rayder

624
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,250
knowing it almost certainly
meant his own death.

625
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,131
Before that,

626
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,642
he led the mission to
avenge Lord Commander Mormont.

627
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,050
Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward.

628
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,681
He saw something in Jon
and now we've all seen it, too.

629
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,084
He may be young.

630
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,288
But he's the commander we turned to
when the night was darkest.

631
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,649
I can't argue with any of that.

632
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,127
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

633
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,205
Night's Watch,

634
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,285
or the wildlings?

635
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,322
Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl,

636
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,323
he spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

637
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,166
What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends

638
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,322
if Stannis' army hadn't come along?

639
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,968
We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall
out of his misery.

640
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,962
Do you want to choose a man
who has fought the wildlings all his life,

641
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,204
or a man who makes love to them?

642
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,811
It is time.

643
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,769
It appears to be a tie, Maester.

644
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,603
Jon Snow!
Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

645
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,804
You. You.

646
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,761
What have you got there?

647
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,084
- I said...
- Turn around and go.

648
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,091
Turn around and go.

649
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,003
That's a nice little sword.

650
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,367
Worth 100 pigeons, a sword like that.

651
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,642
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

652
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,451
Come on. Quickly, go! Go!

653
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,211
Who are you?

654
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,285
Why were they scared of you?

655
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,490
You lost this.

656
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,649
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

657
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,491
There isn't.

658
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,801
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

659
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,009
Well, who are you, then?

660
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,565
No one.

661
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,484
And that is who a girl must become.

662
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,928
She doesn't belong here.

663
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,727
And no matter how many of you traitors
call her "Mhysa",

664
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,289
she will never be your mother.

665
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,211
Why?

666
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,530
For you, Mhysa.

667
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,767
You wanted the Harpy dead,

668
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,082
but your hands were tied.

669
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,245
I set you free, as you did all of us.

670
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,404
He was our prisoner, awaiting trial.

671
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,246
You had no right.

672
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,405
He would rather rip your city apart
than see slaves lifted from the dirt.

673
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,120
There are no more slaves.

674
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,761
There are no more Masters.

675
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,082
Then who lives in the pyramids?

676
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,765
Who wears gold masks
and murders your children?

677
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,642
When Grey Worm came to us,

678
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,401
I was the first to take up the knife for you.

679
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,164
I remember the look on my father's face
as I struck down his Master,

680
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,371
who had traded his infant son for a dog.

681
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,686
My father died in the fighting.

682
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,926
If we allow the Sons of the Harpy
to return us to chains,

683
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,727
he never lived.

684
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,651
The Harpy's life was not yours to take.

685
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,766
Once, the Masters were the law-

686
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,251
And now you are the law.

687
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,163
The law is the law.

688
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,611
Take him.

689
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,649
Mhysa! Mhysa!

690
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,530
Mhysa! Mhysa!

691
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,205
Mhysa! Mhysa!

692
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,006
Mhysa!

693
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,728
She should have cut off the traitor's head
in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.

694
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,928
Which is what I keep
telling her to do to you.

695
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,201
Mhysa! Mhysa!

696
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,368
You opened your gates to me

697
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,087
because I promised you freedom and justice.

698
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,484
One cannot exist without the other.

699
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,563
- Brother! Brother!

700
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,889
Mhysa, please!

701
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,566
Forgive me.

702
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,246
A citizen of Meereen was awaiting
trial and this man murdered him.

703
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,245
The punishment is death.

704
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:17,047
- Mercy, mercy

705
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,801
Mhysa.

706
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,047
Mhysa!

707
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,366
I'll stand guard outside your door tonight,
Your Grace.

708
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,050
