<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,124
Brace the wind.

3
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,726
The Lord of Light
has made good on his promise, my king.

4
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,804
His fires have melted the snows away.

5
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,291
The way ahead is clear.

6
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,010
We ride for Winterfell.

7
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,246
And you will take it.

8
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

9
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,449
You will receive what is yours by right.

10
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,844
Your Grace?

11
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,410
Prepare to form up.

12
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,845
Your Grace?

13
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,841
Tell me.

14
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,206
The men,

15
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,931
many deserted before dawn.

16
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,724
How many?

17
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,723
Nearly half.

18
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,485
All the sellswords with all the horses.

19
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,481
Your Grace?

20
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,807
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

21
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,005
Cut her down.

22
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,531
Your Grace?

23
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,648
The Lady Melisandre
was just seen riding out of camp.

24
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,603
Get the men into marching formation.

25
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,648
On to Winterfell.

26
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,084
He raised his hands,

27
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,927
and they all stood up at once.

28
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,087
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

29
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,202
So what are you gonna do?

30
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,843
I'm gonna hope they don't learn
how to climb the Wall.

31
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,400
But the dragonglass...

32
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,570
No one's ever getting that back now.

33
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,564
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

34
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,325
But you killed a White Walker.

35
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,731
With Longclaw.

36
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,561
I saw them shatter steel axes
like they were glass.

37
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,689
- But Longclaw...
- Is Valyrian steel.

38
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,240
How many Valyrian steel swords
are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

39
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,810
Not enough.

40
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,091
The first Lord Commander in history

41
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,882
to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers
to save the lives of wildlings.

42
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,603
How's it feel to be friends
with the most hated man in Castle Black?

43
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,489
You were friends with me
when I first came here.

44
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,006
And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

45
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,849
Here's to us, then.

46
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,285
Long may they sneer.

47
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,641
What?

48
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,281
I wanted to ask you something.

49
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,408
To ask something of you.

50
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,124
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown

51
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,441
so I can become a maester.

52
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,122
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

53
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,168
I need you here, Sam.

54
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,563
If you leave,
who's left to give me advice I trust?

55
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,881
Well, there's Edd.

56
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,851
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

57
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,248
More use to everyone
now that Maester Aemon is gone.

58
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,484
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

59
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,404
I'll learn about history, strategy, healing.

60
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,802
And other things,
things that will help when...

61
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,401
When they come.

62
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,526
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

63
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,247
And the baby that she
named after me will die.

64
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,244
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

65
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,564
Which means that the last thing
that I'll see in this world

66
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,689
will be the look in her
eyes when I fail them.

67
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,368
And I'd rather see 1,000 White Walkers
than see that.

68
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,565
Thank you.

69
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,561
You know at the Citadel
they'll make you swear off women, too.

70
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,246
On, they'll bloody try.

71
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,361
Sam.

72
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,246
What?

73
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,011
Sam.

74
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,248
You had just been beaten half to death.
How did you...

75
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,401
Oh, very carefully.

76
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm glad the end of the world's
working out well for someone.

77
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,570
I'll come back.

78
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,090
To your return.

79
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,285
To my return.

80
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,170
Aye, this way.

81
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,721
My lady!

82
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,525
Stannis.

83
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,887
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

84
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,126
How do you know it's Stannis?

85
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,249
He's carrying his flaming heart banners.
From the Blackwater.

86
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,129
I'll never forget it.

87
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,371
Trench here.

88
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,560
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.
Hurry them along.

89
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,446
- Right, Curlew.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,885
Dig between those two rises.

91
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,291
- Spread out.
- I'm with you.

92
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,128
- Archers!
- Spread out!

93
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,490
And send out a foraging party immediately.
Siege begins at sunrise.

94
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,407
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

95
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,084
We've got no chance!

96
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,764
No, please, please.

97
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,962
Bolton has women fighting for him?

98
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,407
I don't fight for the Boltons.

99
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,642
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

100
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,531
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

101
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,361
I was there when he was murdered
by a shadow with your face.

102
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,802
You murdered him with blood magic?

103
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,526
I did.

104
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,571
In the name of Renly of House Baratheon,

105
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,282
First of His Name, rightful King
of the Andals and the First Men,

106
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,409
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

107
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,571
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

108
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,442
Do you have any last words?

109
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,203
Go on, do your duty.

110
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,568
Looks like we're done here.

111
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,404
I surrender! I surrender!

112
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,648
And I accept your surrender.

113
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,010
Let's head back.

114
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,009
My wife must be lonely.

115
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,165
My lady.

116
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,567
I've come to escort you back to your chamber.

117
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,166
Go with her, please.

118
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,729
I know what Ramsay is.

119
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,009
I know what he'll do to me.

120
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,567
If I'm going to die,

121
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,008
let it happen
while there's still some of me left.

122
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,161
Die?

123
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,689
Who said anything about dying?
You can't die.

124
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,491
Your father was Warden of the North.
Ramsay needs you.

125
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,162
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

126
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,322
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

127
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,688
until you've given him a boy or two,
and he's finished using them.

128
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,366
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.

129
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,571
So, shall we wait for him to come back
or should we begin now?

130
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,042
You're leaving it to me?

131
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,361
Good.

132
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,240
Let's begin.

133
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,969
Reek! Stop!

134
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,564
Open the gate!

135
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,447
He's coming back.

136
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,645
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

137
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,409
You two, out.

138
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,043
You were the first person
on my list, you know.

139
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,051
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

140
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,771
Probably not.

141
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,401
I've gotten a few of the others.

142
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,290
The Many-Faced God
stole a few more from me.

143
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,447
But I'm glad he left me you.

144
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,763
Do you know who I am?

145
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,730
I can't hear you.

146
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,927
You know who I am.

147
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,805
I'm Arya Stark.

148
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,122
Do you know who you are?

149
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,490
You're no one.

150
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,684
You're nothing.

151
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,647
A girl has taken a life.

152
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,050
The wrong life.

153
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,128
I was right about her.

154
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,367
You were.

155
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,970
You're not ready.

156
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,524
Not at all.

157
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,006
That man's life was not yours to take.

158
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,402
A girl stole from the Many-Faced God.

159
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,929
Now a debt is owed.

160
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,284
Only death can pay for life.

161
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,802
No! No!

162
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,451
No, you don't die! Don't die!

163
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,244
Why are you crying?

164
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,810
He was my friend.

165
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,804
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

166
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,721
He was no one.

167
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,284
But if you're...

168
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,521
Who's this?

169
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,249
No one at all.

170
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,970
Just as a girl should have been
before she took a face from the hall.

171
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,481
The faces are for no one.

172
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,367
You are still someone.

173
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,969
And to someone,
the faces are as good as poison.

174
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,045
I can't see.

175
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,930
What's happening?

176
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,962
What's happening?

177
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,846
- I wish you a safe journey home.
- Thank you.

178
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,161
Forgive me, child.

179
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,484
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

180
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,330
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

181
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,964
Maybe I'll come visit you.

182
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,371
Don't wait too long.

183
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,164
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

184
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,087
You want a good girl,
but you need the bad pussy.

185
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,121
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

186
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,644
Try not to lose it this time.

187
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,167
I'll never take it off again.

188
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,804
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,

189
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,087
but I'm glad you're coming home.

190
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,571
Your mother's desperate to see you.

191
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,969
I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.

192
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,121
He seems like a nice boy.

193
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,647
You're lucky.

194
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,368
Arranged marriages are rarely so...

195
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,044
So well arranged.

196
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,884
Do you think Mother will like him?

197
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,363
If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

198
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,369
And you really believe that?

199
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,243
Have you ever known your mother
to like anyone aside from her children?

200
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,529
She likes you.

201
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,762
I'm not so sure about that.

202
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,731
Listen...

203
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,605
There's something I wanted to tell you.

204
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,204
Something I should have told you long ago.

205
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,040
So...

206
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,120
Now that you've seen more of the world,

207
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,610
you've learned how complicated
things can be, people can be.

208
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,523
The Lannisters and the Martells
have hated each other for years,

209
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,682
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

210
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,570
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

211
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,804
You happen to fall in love with the man
you were assigned to marry?

212
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,365
My point is,

213
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,961
we don't choose whom we love.

214
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,681
It just, well...

215
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,442
It's beyond our control.
I sound like an idiot.

216
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,561
No, you don't.

217
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,440
What I'm trying to say...
What I'm trying and failing to say...

218
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,521
I know what you're trying to say.

219
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,125
No, I'm afraid you don't.

220
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,010
I do.

221
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,280
I know.

222
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,161
About you and Mother.

223
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,570
I think a part of me always knew.

224
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,890
And I'm glad.

225
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,406
I'm glad that you're my father.

226
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,925
Myrcella?

227
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,531
Myrcella?

228
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,011
Myrcella? Myrcella?

229
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,482
You love her, don't you?

230
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,290
How could you not?

231
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,964
Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you.

232
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,761
A sellsword from the fighting pits
and a disgraced knight.

233
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,683
Neither one of you is fit
consort for a queen.

234
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,487
But we always want the wrong woman.

235
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,250
Does he always talk so much?

236
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,326
Jorah the Andal.

237
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,125
He should not be here.

238
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,531
No, but he is.

239
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,080
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

240
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,481
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

241
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,650
It's true. And I would be
dead if not for the...

242
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,526
little man.

243
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,126
Dwarf.

244
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,167
I believe that's the word.

245
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,886
Apologies.

246
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,645
My Valyrian is a bit nostril.

247
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,685
A bit rusty.

248
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,767
Thank you.

249
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,486
I am sorry.

250
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,046
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

251
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,566
You missed a good scrap.

252
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,971
None of that matters now.

253
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,724
The longer we sit here bantering,

254
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,286
the longer Daenerys is out there
in the wilderness.

255
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,567
He's right. The dragon headed north.

256
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,563
If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.

257
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,761
We?

258
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,885
You're a Lannister.

259
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,486
The queen intends to remove
your family from power.

260
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,324
And I intend to help her do it.

261
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,727
You've been here
for how many days now?

262
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,441
I've fought for her for years.
Since she was little more than a child.

263
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,363
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.

264
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,920
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

265
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,490
The second time, thanks to you.

266
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,006
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

267
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,566
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

268
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,486
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

269
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,929
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.
Perhaps not.

270
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,570
The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

271
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,767
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

272
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,611
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

273
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,003
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.

274
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,765
Forgive me,
but why would we bring you?

275
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,521
Pardon me?

276
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,523
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

277
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,531
Not precisely,
but I have other skills that would be useful.

278
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,090
Can you fight?

279
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,011
I have fought.

280
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,684
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

281
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,966
Are you good on a horse?

282
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,281
Middling.

283
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,600
So mainly you talk.

284
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,841
And drink. I've survived so far.

285
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,766
Which I respect,
but you would not help us on this expedition.

286
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,929
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

287
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,202
None of us have experience
governing a city except for him.

288
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,523
You want to prove your value to the queen?
Prove it right here in Meereen.

289
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,206
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.

290
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,850
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

291
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,410
They wouldn't.

292
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,604
They will listen to Grey Worm.

293
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,330
I'll come with you.

294
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,329
I'll find our queen.

295
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,841
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

296
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,287
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

297
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,803
But you still can't go.

298
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,851
The people believe in you.

299
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,968
They know you speak for the queen.

300
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,806
It's true.

301
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,962
Only the Unsullied
can keep the peace in Meereen.

302
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,409
If you leave,
half this city will consume the other half.

303
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,931
And Missandei.

304
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,684
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

305
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,570
Certainly not me.

306
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,410
The queen's closest confidante,

307
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,847
the commander of the Unsullied,

308
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,847
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

309
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,685
Good fortune, my friends.

310
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,603
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

311
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,601
Try not to ruin her.

312
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,170
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

313
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,685
Let's find some good horses.

314
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,801
We have so much to talk about.

315
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,530
Hello, old friend.

316
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,046
I thought we were so happy together
until you abandoned me.

317
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,686
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

318
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,331
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

319
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,448
if one knows how to listen.

320
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,645
They tell me you've already found favor
with the Mother of Dragons.

321
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,485
Well, she didn't execute me,

322
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,722
so that's a promising start.

323
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,171
Now the heroes are off to find her,

324
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,527
and I'm stuck here

325
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,610
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

326
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,410
Any advice for an old comrade?

327
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,851
Information is the key.

328
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,651
You need to learn
your enemy's strengths and strategies.

329
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,200
You need to learn
which of your friends are not your friends.

330
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,561
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

331
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,005
If only.

332
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,328
A grand old city,

333
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,443
choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

334
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,890
Who could possibly have any experience
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

335
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,127
I did miss you.

336
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,129
Oh, I know.

337
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,289
We have to go home.

338
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,644
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

339
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,970
Does it hurt?

340
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,689
We have to go home.

341
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,160
Drogon.

342
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,647
Can you take me back to Meereen?

343
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,082
How far did you carry me?

344
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,925
Drogon, we need to return.

345
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,365
My people need me.

346
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,563
Well, there's no food.

347
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,483
At the very least,
you could hunt us some supper.

348
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,405
Confess.

349
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,731
Confess.

350
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,651
I have sinned.

351
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,090
I see that now.

352
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,645
How can I have been so blind for so long?

353
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,127
I want to be clean again.

354
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,930
I want absolution.

355
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,764
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

356
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,807
And by its holy light...

357
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,325
You wish to make a confession?

358
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,167
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

359
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,602
Your Grace will be dealt with
according to her sins.

360
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,728
The Mother have mercy, then.

361
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,010
I lay with a man outside
the bonds of marriage. I confess.

362
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,930
Name him.

363
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,281
Lancel Lannister.

364
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,410
Your cousin and the king's squire.

365
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,048
- I was lonely and afraid.
- You had a husband.

366
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,487
A husband off whoring every chance he...

367
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,642
His sins do not pardon your own.

368
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,768
May the gods forgive me.

369
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,244
Other men?

370
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,841
No.

371
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,840
No others?

372
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,920
No.

373
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,087
Speaking falsehoods
before the gods is a great crime.

374
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,571
You understand this?

375
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,290
I do.

376
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,841
There are those that say your children
were not fathered by King Robert,

377
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,760
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

378
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,080
A lie.

379
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,604
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

380
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,729
He wants the throne,
but his brother's children stand in his way.

381
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,531
So he claims they are not his brother's.

382
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,491
That filth.

383
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,686
There is not one shred of truth to it.

384
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,205
I deny it.

385
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,926
Good.

386
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,407
But these are terrible charges.

387
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,481
And the realm must know the truth of them.

388
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,168
If Your Grace has given honest testimony,
your trial will prove your innocence.

389
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,208
Trial? I have confessed.

390
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,603
To a single sin.

391
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,881
Others you have denied.

392
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,161
Your trial will separate the truths
from the falsehoods.

393
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,727
I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness.

394
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,410
But if I might beg

395
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,560
for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.

396
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,883
I haven't seen my son...

397
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,247
I don't know how long it's been.

398
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,608
I need to see him, please.

399
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,241
You have taken the first step
on the path back to righteousness.

400
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,282
In light of this,

401
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,727
I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.

402
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,771
Thank you.

403
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,566
Thank you.

404
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,610
The Mother is merciful.

405
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,884
It is her you should thank.

406
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,724
I will. I will.

407
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,528
I swear it, day and night.

408
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,560
Good.

409
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,764
Am I free to go?

410
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,083
After your atonement.

411
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,170
My atonement?

412
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,368
A sinner comes before you.

413
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,730
Cersei of House Lannister.

414
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,882
Mother to His Grace King Tommen.

415
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,761
Widow of His Grace King Robert.

416
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,567
She has committed the acts
of falsehood and fornication.

417
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,491
She has confessed her sins

418
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,329
and begged for forgiveness.

419
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,007
To demonstrate her repentance,

420
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,130
she will cast aside all pride, all artifice,

421
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,610
and present herself as the gods made her

422
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,531
to you,

423
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,527
the good people of the city.

424
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,964
She comes before you with a solemn heart,

425
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,443
shorn of secrets,

426
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,245
naked before the eyes of gods and men,

427
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,291
to make her walk of atonement.

428
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,327
Shame. Shame.

429
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,245
Shame.

430
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,331
Shame.

431
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,281
Shame.

432
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,725
Shame.

433
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,284
Shame.

434
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,971
Shame.

435
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,487
Shame.

436
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,526
Shame.

437
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,801
Shame.

438
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,009
Shame.

439
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,561
Shame.

440
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,851
Shame.

441
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,364
Shame.

442
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,365
Shame.

443
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,247
Shame.

444
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,609
Shame.

445
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,721
Shame.

446
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,761
Shame.

447
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,404
Shame.

448
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,600
Shame.

449
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,445
- Cunt!
- Shame.

450
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,760
- Sinner!
- Whore!

451
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,365
- Shame.
- Whore!

452
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,051
Shame.

453
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,687
- Whore!
- Whore!

454
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,886
Shame.

455
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,961
Bitch.

456
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,686
Shame.

457
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,486
Shame.

458
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,766
- Whore!
- Sinner!

459
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,207
- Shame.
- Bitch! Brother fucker!

460
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,810
- Whore!
- Shame.

461
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,962
- Fuck off!
- Shame.

462
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,001
Shame.

463
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,321
- All hail the royal tits.
- You're a bitch!

464
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,561
Shame.

465
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,801
- Get her!
- Whore!

466
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,450
- Bitch!
- Fucker!

467
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,170
- Fucker!
- You bitch!

468
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,730
- Shame.
- Cunt!

469
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,245
Shame.

470
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,727
Shame. Shame.

471
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,208
- Brother fucker!
- Bitch!

472
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,167
I've had half as many cocks as the queen.

473
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,561
Shame.

474
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,329
- Whore! Sinner!
- Slut!

475
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,601
Shame.

476
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,366
Shame. Shame.

477
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,605
- Whore!
- Whore, whore.

478
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,605
I'm a Lannister. Suck me off!

479
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,884
- Suck me off, you bitch!
- Back!

480
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,729
- Whore!
- Shame.

481
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,806
Shame.

482
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,205
Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!

483
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,006
Shame.

484
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,120
Shame.

485
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,560
Shame.

486
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,886
Shame.

487
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,681
Shame.

488
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,961
Shame.

489
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,371
- Bitch!
- Shame.

490
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,330
Brother fucker!

491
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,523
Shame. Shame.

492
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,046
Shame.

493
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,528
- Brother fucker!
- Whore!

494
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,284
- Whore!
- Shame.

495
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,726
Shame. Shame.

496
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,051
Shame.

497
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,481
Shame.

498
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,321
Shame.

499
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,291
Shame.

500
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,286
Shame.

501
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,122
- Shame.
- Fucker!

502
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,841
Shame. Shame.

503
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,441
Shame.

504
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,561
Shame.

505
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,521
Shame.

506
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,441
Shame. Shame.

507
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,651
Shame.

508
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,524
Shame. Shame.

509
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,521
Shame.

510
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,485
Shame.

511
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,891
Shame.

512
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,805
Shame.

513
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,761
Shame.

514
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,206
Shame.

515
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,441
Shame.

516
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,645
Shame.

517
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,485
Shame. Shame.

518
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,971
Shame.

519
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,966
Your Grace.

520
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,282
It's good to have you back.

521
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,610
Come.

522
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,205
We'll take you inside.

523
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,611
I need to have a look at those feet.

524
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,122
May I have the honor of presenting
the newest member of the Kingsguard?

525
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,966
If it please Your Grace,
he has taken a holy vow of silence.

526
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,929
He has sworn that he will not speak

527
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,810
until all His Grace's enemies are dead,

528
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,770
and evil has been driven from the realm.

529
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,881
Who came to your aid? Stannis.

530
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,086
Now he needs you.

531
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,685
We don't have enough men
to make any difference.

532
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,250
The wildlings will make a difference.

533
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,890
The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.

534
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,691
- I told him before...
- You saved their bloody lives.

535
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,562
If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms,

536
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,962
safe behind our Wall,
they ought to fight for the damn place.

537
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,691
- It's not their fight.
- Open the gates!

538
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,681
Stannis?

539
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,771
Shireen? The princess?

540
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,727
Lord Commander.

541
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,489
It's one of the wildlings you brought back.
Says he knows your Uncle Benjen.

542
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,205
Says he's still alive.

543
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,924
Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?

544
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,771
Said he was First Ranger.

545
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,441
