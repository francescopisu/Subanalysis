<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,121
I'm so sorry, my queen.

3
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,005
He was a good man.

4
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,560
"Barristan the Bold,"
they called him.

5
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,331
He crossed a continent to serve me.

6
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,481
He was a loyal friend.

7
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,126
And he died in an alley,

8
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,244
butchered by cowards
who hide behind masks.

9
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,725
We could pull back to the pyramid district,

10
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,770
secure it, and use it as a base
from which to operate.

11
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,123
Then we clean the city out,

12
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,962
neighborhood by neighborhood,
street by street,

13
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,122
until the rats have nowhere left to hide.

14
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,485
I prefer your earlier suggestion.

15
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,366
Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's
great families and bring them to me.

16
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,528
But... I'm the leader
of my family.

17
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,726
No, Your Grace...

18
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,566
I had nothing to do with this.

19
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,449
Your Grace!

20
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,081
Walk forward.

21
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,610
You cannot do this.

22
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,441
Another step.

23
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,370
They will eat you

24
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,731
if I tell them to.

25
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,688
They may eat you even if I don't.

26
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,524
Children.

27
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,887
Some say I should give up on them.

28
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,531
But a good mother
never gives up on her children.

29
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,203
She disciplines them if she must.

30
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,609
But she does not give up on them.

31
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,044
Who is innocent?

32
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,961
Maybe all of you are,

33
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,921
maybe none of you are.

34
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,164
Maybe,

35
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,205
I should let the dragons decide.

36
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,609
All men must die.

37
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,805
Don't want to overfeed them.

38
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,769
Tomorrow perhaps.

39
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,282
"And though Daenerys
maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay,

40
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,682
"forces rise against her
from within and without.

41
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,402
"She refuses to leave until the freedom
of the former slaves is secure."

42
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,609
She sounds like quite a woman.

43
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,489
And she's alone,

44
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,130
under siege,

45
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,682
no family to guide her or protect her.

46
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,646
Her last relation thousands of miles away,

47
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,842
useless, dying.

48
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,561
Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

49
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,685
A Targaryen alone in the world

50
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,123
is a terrible thing.

51
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,204
Maester Aemon.

52
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,044
Lord Commander.

53
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,570
Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.

54
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,245
How are you feeling?

55
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,361
Oh, like a 100-year-old man
slowly freezing to death.

56
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,410
I need your advice.

57
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,686
There's something I want to do,
something I have to do.

58
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,081
But it'll divide the Night's Watch.

59
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,601
Bitterly.

60
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,207
Half the men will hate me
the moment I give the order.

61
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,767
Half the men hate you already,
Lord Commander.

62
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,285
Do it.

63
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,810
But you don't know what it is.

64
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,530
That doesn't matter.

65
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,806
You do.

66
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,726
You will find little joy in your command.

67
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,203
But with luck,

68
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,842
you will find the strength
to do what needs to be done.

69
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,765
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

70
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,083
Winter is almost upon us.

71
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,009
Kill the boy,

72
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,850
and let the man be born.

73
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,168
Where are the rest of the free folk now?

74
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,524
Where have they gone?

75
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,882
Who leads them?

76
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,281
They followed Mance.

77
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,931
They won't follow anyone else.

78
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,130
What about you?

79
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,487
Hard to lead when you're in chains.

80
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,765
What if I unchained you?

81
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,683
Why would you do that?

82
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,044
Because you are not my enemy.

83
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,451
And I'm not yours.

84
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,444
You sure seemed like my enemy
when you were killing my friends.

85
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,921
For 8,000 years
the Night's Watch have sworn an oath

86
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,606
to be the shield
that guards the realms of men.

87
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,410
And for 8,000 years,
we've fallen short of that oath.

88
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,526
You belong to the realms of men.

89
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,881
All of you.

90
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,768
And now everything is going to change?

91
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,524
- It is.
- Why now?

92
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,366
Because now
I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

93
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,888
What would you have me do,
Lord Commander?

94
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,962
I'd have you go north of the Wall.

95
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,284
Gather the remaining free folk,
wherever they are, and bring them back here.

96
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,409
I'll open the gates for them
and let them through.

97
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,165
I'll find them lands to
settle south of the Wall.

98
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,881
They won't kneel for you, and neither will l.

99
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,805
I don't want them to kneel for me.

100
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,406
I want them to fight with me
when the time comes.

101
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,171
The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows

102
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,971
is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly

103
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,451
and make me eat them.

104
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,330
And how many of your people can't fight?

105
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,327
The women, the children, the old, the sick,
what happens to them?

106
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,402
You're condemning them to death.

107
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,047
Worse than death
because you're too proud to make peace.

108
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,768
Or maybe you're not proud.

109
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,090
Maybe you're just a coward.

110
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,090
Easy thing to say to a man in chains.

111
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,364
Your people need a leader.

112
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,769
And they need to get south of the Wall
before it's too late.

113
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,729
We don't have much time, and they have less.

114
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,644
The Walkers are coming,
and they'll hit your people first.

115
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,331
I'm not asking you to make peace
to save your skin.

116
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,002
Make peace to save your people.

117
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,086
Most of them are at Hardhome.

118
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,161
You know where that is?

119
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,651
Up on Storrold's Point.

120
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,125
I can give you 10 horses and nine other men.
You can get there in a week.

121
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,690
We'll need ships.

122
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,811
I'll talk to King Stannis
about lending you his fleet.

123
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,721
All right, then.

124
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,691
You're coming with me.

125
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,571
You're the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

126
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,888
They need to hear it from you.

127
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,281
They need to know
the ships they are boarding

128
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,522
won't be torched in the middle of the sea.

129
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,963
You come with me,

130
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,525
or I don't go.

131
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,285
You'd bring wildlings here,
through our gates?

132
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,046
Men, women, and children
will die by the thousands if we do nothing.

133
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,250
Let them die. We got our own to worry about.
Less enemies for us.

134
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,125
Fewer.

135
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,720
- What?
- Nothing.

136
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,284
Look, well, there is
good farmland in the Gift.

137
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,807
Land that no one uses now.
A dozen abandoned villages.

138
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,121
And why do you think
the farmers abandoned those villages?

139
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,566
Because the wildlings raided them for years.

140
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,003
Cut them down
just like they did this boy's people.

141
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,766
Aye!

142
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,369
We've been fighting them
for thousands of years.

143
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,608
They've slaughtered villages.

144
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,963
They've slaughtered our brothers.

145
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,610
And we've slaughtered theirs.

146
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,004
I will follow you anywhere, you know that.

147
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,286
- But they killed Grenn.
- Yes.

148
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,761
- And they killed Pyp.
- Aye.

149
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,368
They killed 50 of our brothers.
I can't forget that.

150
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,205
I can't forgive it.

151
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,726
You were at the Fist of the First Men.

152
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,610
If we abandon them,
you know what they become.

153
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,208
We can learn to live with the wildlings,
or we can add them to the army of the dead.

154
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,486
Whatever they are now,
they're better than that.

155
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,161
Thank you.

156
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,490
Olly.

157
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,529
If you have something you want to say to me,

158
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,170
say it.

159
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,165
It's all right.

160
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,202
You don't mean it, do you?

161
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,571
Telling the wildlings you want to make peace.

162
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,529
You're just doing it to trick them.

163
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,126
It's not a trick.

164
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,605
They burned my village.

165
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,684
They put an arrow through my father's head
right in front of me.

166
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,442
They butchered my mother,
everyone I ever knew.

167
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,608
I know what it's like
to lose the people you love.

168
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,488
I know this is hard for you.

169
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,923
But winter is coming.

170
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,249
We know what's coming with it.

171
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,364
We can't face it alone.

172
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,403
Will there be anything else you need,
Lord Commander?

173
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,890
No.

174
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,806
She's far away from the Lannisters.

175
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,921
This is her home.

176
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,924
Maybe Lady Sansa's better off here.

177
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,441
Better off with the Boltons,
who murdered her mother and brother?

178
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,886
Sansa's in danger,
even if she doesn't realize it.

179
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,764
Thank you.

180
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,086
You've lived here a long time?

181
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,891
Aye.

182
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,450
Did you know Lord Eddard?

183
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,527
I knew him,

184
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,561
and his father before him.

185
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,562
The Starks are gone now.

186
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,369
Not all of them.

187
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,206
I know who's inside that castle.

188
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,044
Everyone knows.

189
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,925
The Boltons.

190
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,843
I'm not talking about the Boltons.

191
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,924
I need to get a message to her.

192
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,331
To Sansa Stark.

193
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,171
Who are you?

194
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,164
Someone who swore to keep her safe.

195
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,930
Swore to who?

196
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,001
Her mother.

197
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,130
Her mother's dead.

198
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,726
That doesn't release me from an oath.

199
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,360
I served Lady Catelyn.

200
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,683
I serve her still.

201
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,689
Who do you serve?

202
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,770
Come back here.

203
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,881
Myranda.

204
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,083
I saw you staring at her.

205
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,730
I'm going to marry her.

206
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,884
That will involve looking at her
from time to time.

207
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,050
You said you'd marry me.

208
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,204
And I meant it.

209
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,203
When I was a bastard named Snow.

210
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,769
But I'm a Bolton now.

211
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,969
What I want is no longer
the primary consideration.

212
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,923
I'm furthering a dynasty.

213
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,407
Do you think she's pretty?

214
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,367
Of course I do. I'm not blind.

215
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,321
You think she's pretty, too.

216
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,443
I'm looking forward to our wedding night.

217
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,002
But don't worry,
I'll have plenty of time for you.

218
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,847
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

219
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,208
You're the kennel master's daughter.

220
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,844
Who are you going to marry,
the stable keeper's son?

221
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,005
You're mine.

222
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,969
You're not going anywhere.

223
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,522
Unless I have to listen
to more of your jealousy.

224
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,002
Jealousy bores me. You remember
what happens to people who bore me.

225
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,441
You're not going to bore me,
are you, Myranda?

226
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,450
Never.

227
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,367
Beg pardon, my lady.
I've come to refill the wash basin.

228
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,249
Oh, I don't need...

229
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,881
You still have friends in the North.

230
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,804
If you're ever in trouble,

231
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,805
light a candle
in the highest window of the broken tower.

232
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,160
- But who...
- You're not alone.

233
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,285
I like your dress.

234
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,131
Who made it for you?

235
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,764
Uh, I made it myself.

236
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,491
Really?

237
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,730
Who... Who are you?

238
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,969
I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter.

239
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,361
May I?

240
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,531
Oh, wonderful.

241
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,491
The stitching.

242
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,810
- Who taught you?
- My mother.

243
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,207
I'm sorry for what happened to her.

244
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,327
Thank you.

245
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,721
It's good that she taught you.

246
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,926
It was a gift.

247
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,962
Now every time you wear
something you made,

248
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,407
you can remember her.

249
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,481
I'd rather have a mother.

250
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,048
I know. It's not the same.

251
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,167
Still, it's good to remember.

252
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,928
Remember the way things were.

253
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,484
I almost forgot.

254
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,051
There's something else

255
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,325
to help you remember.

256
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,606
Down there, at the end.

257
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,411
What is it?

258
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,284
That would spoil the surprise.

259
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,808
Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.

260
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,922
You won't believe it when you see it.

261
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,561
Theon?

262
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,207
You shouldn't be here.

263
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,280
You smell particularly ripe this evening.

264
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,610
Pour me some wine.

265
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,202
Do you have something to tell me?

266
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,005
No, my lord.

267
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,485
Reek.

268
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,803
She saw me.

269
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,366
Who?

270
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,886
Sansa. Lady Sansa.

271
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,485
She came to the kennels.

272
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,286
She saw you?

273
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,931
Yes. I'm sorry, master.

274
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
Forgive me. I didn't think...

275
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,321
Come here.

276
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,526
You mustn't keep
secrets from me, Reek.

277
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,161
Get on your knees.

278
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,724
Give me your hand.

279
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,606
I forgive you.

280
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,131
I trust you find
your chamber suitable, my lady?

281
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,363
Yes, thank you.

282
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,601
Allow me.

283
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,921
Mother.

284
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,569
Thank you, Ramsay.

285
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,680
My lady, we are all a family, we northerners.

286
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,730
Our blood ties go back thousands of years.

287
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,686
So, I'd like to drink to our wedding.

288
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,290
May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin
to the Last Hearth.

289
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,931
- To your wedding.
- To your wedding.

290
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,282
It must be difficult for you,
being in a strange place.

291
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,170
This isn't a strange place,
this is my home.

292
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,004
It's the people who are strange.

293
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,291
You're right.

294
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,801
Very strange.

295
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,650
More wine, please.

296
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,971
I heard you two had been reunited.

297
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,241
A fitting place for it.

298
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,368
I like to imagine that
the last time you spoke

299
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,169
was in this very room.

300
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,728
Are you still angry with him after he...

301
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,446
What he did?

302
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,770
Don't worry.

303
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,848
The North remembers.

304
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,009
I punished him for it.

305
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,921
He's not ironborn anymore.

306
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,243
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

307
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,084
He's a new man.

308
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,689
A new person, anyway.

309
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,407
Aren't you, Reek?

310
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,045
Yes, master.

311
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,043
That's his new name, Reek.

312
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,124
Why are you doing this?

313
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,205
Because Reek has something to say to you.

314
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,881
Don't you, Reek?

315
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,044
An apology?

316
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,690
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

317
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,244
Apologize for murdering her two brothers.

318
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,487
I'm sorry.

319
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,009
Look at her, Reek.

320
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,450
An apology doesn't mean anything
if you're not looking the person in the eye.

321
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,885
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about what?

322
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,685
For killing your brothers.

323
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,848
There, over and done with.

324
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,571
Doesn't everyone feel better? I do.

325
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,650
That was getting very tense.

326
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,887
Whew.

327
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,123
You know what, my lady?

328
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,085
What with him having murdered your brothers

329
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,448
and the rest of your family gone,

330
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,044
Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin

331
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,009
that you have left.

332
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,761
Reek.

333
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,971
You will give away the bride.

334
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,567
Someone has to. What better person?

335
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,926
Good?
Good?

336
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,327
Yes, yes, very good.

337
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,011
Wonderful.

338
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,687
Walda and I have some good news as well,
since we're all together.

339
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,401
We're going to have a baby.

340
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,764
I'm very happy for you.

341
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,243
From the way she's carrying,
Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

342
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,565
How can you be sure?

343
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,880
Sure of what?

344
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,291
That she's pregnant.

345
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,450
I mean...

346
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,530
How can you tell?

347
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,326
Maester Wolkan
has assured us beyond all doubt.

348
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,642
So, how did you manage it?

349
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,324
Manage what?

350
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,686
Getting her pregnant.

351
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,808
I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.

352
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,044
Of course, but how did you find it?

353
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,367
You disgraced yourself at dinner,

354
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,242
parading that creature before the Stark girl.

355
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,725
And if it's a boy?

356
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,650
You're worried about your position.

357
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,722
My position is quite clear.

358
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,770
I'm your son

359
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,361
until a better alternative comes along.

360
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,011
You've never asked me about your mother.

361
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,051
Why would I?

362
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,441
She had me, she died.

363
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,165
And here we are.

364
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,204
She was a peasant girl.

365
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,009
Pretty in a common sort of way.

366
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,124
She was the miller's wife.

367
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,482
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent,

368
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,925
so I had him hanged,

369
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,609
and I took her
beneath the tree where he was swaying.

370
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,324
She fought me the whole time.

371
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,648
She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.

372
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,365
A year later she came to my gates
with a squalling baby in her arms.

373
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,562
A baby she claimed was mine.

374
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,564
I nearly had her whipped,

375
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,642
and the child thrown in the river.

376
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,731
But then I looked at you,

377
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,567
and I saw then what I see now.

378
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,651
You are my son.

379
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,243
Stannis Baratheon
has an army at Castle Black,

380
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,483
but he won't stay for long.

381
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,206
He wants the Iron Throne,

382
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,682
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

383
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,364
He means to take the North.

384
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,162
But the North is ours.

385
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,005
It's yours and mine.

386
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,443
Will you help me defeat him?

387
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,926
Yes.

388
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,681
Is this every book there is?

389
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,723
Every book there is?

390
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,051
In the world.

391
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,841
Well, no.

392
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,720
There are thousands
and thousands of books out there.

393
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,644
This library is rather small, actually.

394
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,688
Where you grew up, were there more books?

395
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,366
My father's not the most literate man.

396
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,641
They say the Citadel
has the largest library in the world.

397
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,881
Where's that?

398
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,521
The Citadel?

399
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,331
In Oldtown.

400
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,043
I'm sorry I don't know things.

401
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,811
Oh, Gilly, look at me.

402
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,444
You know how to do
a hundred things I can never do.

403
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,887
You can build a fire with wet wood.

404
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,440
You can cook. You can stitch a wound.

405
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,251
I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.

406
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,321
Well...

407
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,767
Why does the Citadel
have the biggest library?

408
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,561
It's where they train the maesters.

409
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,684
Like Maester Aemon?

410
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,001
I wanted to be one when I was young.

411
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,084
Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch.

412
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,241
Far more adventure up here anyway.

413
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,969
I wouldn't have met you.

414
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,608
Ah, Your Grace.

415
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,483
You're Samwell Tarly?

416
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,569
I am, Your Grace.

417
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,763
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

418
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,371
Defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford.

419
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,201
Only battle Robert ever lost.

420
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,769
I told him he shouldn't go
so far west so soon,

421
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,171
but he never listened.

422
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,804
Fine soldier, your father.

423
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,565
You don't look like a soldier.

424
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,560
But I'm told you killed a White Walker.

425
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,845
I did, Your Grace.

426
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,007
How?

427
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,003
With a dagger made of dragonglass.

428
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,326
Dragonglass?

429
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,606
What the maesters call obsidian.

430
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,490
I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone.

431
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,449
Why would obsidian kill a Walker?

432
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,124
I don't know.

433
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,770
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

434
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,080
hoping to find something,

435
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,286
and all I've learned

436
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,489
is that the Children of the Forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

437
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,121
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

438
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,851
I've seen it, Your Grace.

439
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,010
Seen what?

440
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,889
The army of the dead.

441
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,047
And when they come...

442
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,248
We have to know how to fight them.

443
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,964
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

444
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,891
It's time.

445
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,405
Uh, Your Grace.

446
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,803
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

447
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,043
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

448
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,169
If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.
We can't wait that long.

449
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,926
We have the advantage,
more men, more horses, all fed and rested.

450
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,970
But every day we wait,
the odds shift in Bolton's favor.

451
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,042
This could turn to winter at any moment.

452
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,203
We have to act now. Give the order.
We march at sunrise.

453
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,649
I'll choose a dozen men to stay
and guard the queen and the princess.

454
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,131
No need. They're coming with us.

455
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,529
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

456
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,762
- Won't they be safer...
- Here?

457
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,087
Half these Watchmen are killers and rapists.

458
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,569
No, they march with us.

459
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,088
As you wish, Your Grace.

460
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,048
Do you think Father
will let me go down into the crypt?

461
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,121
Beg your pardon?

462
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,565
At Winterfell.

463
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,406
All the kings in the North are buried there.
Bran the Builder, and King Dorren, and...

464
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,290
First things first. It's a long march ahead.

465
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,964
And then we have to take the castle.

466
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,445
Is there going to be a battle?

467
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,887
Aye, princess,
but you won't be anywhere near...

468
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,287
That's enough talk of battle,
Ser Davos.

469
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,446
You'll scare the child.

470
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,851
Yes, my queen.

471
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,244
I'm not scared.

472
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,401
Well, I am.

473
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,401
When the battle comes,
promise you'll protect me.

474
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,846
I promise.

475
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,650
I hope you know
what you're doing with these wildlings.

476
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,004
I need those ships.

477
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,204
You'll get them back, I swear it.

478
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,082
Have a safe journey, Your Grace.

479
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,169
And thank you.

480
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,923
Mount up!

481
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,604
Colors!

482
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,286
No.

483
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,721
You're still too weak.

484
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,680
How long have I been here?

485
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,447
Three days.

486
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,601
Ser Barristan?

487
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,325
I failed him.

488
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,962
I failed my men.

489
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,324
I failed my queen.

490
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,608
You failed no one.

491
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,921
You fought bravely.

492
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,162
You'll fight again.

493
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,490
Are you ashamed?

494
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,045
You were ambushed, outnumbered.

495
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,610
There was no way you could have known.

496
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,682
This is not why.

497
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,648
Wounded in war,

498
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,126
there is no shame for this.

499
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,083
I am ashamed

500
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,931
because when the knife go in

501
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,002
and I fall to the ground,

502
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,930
I am afraid.

503
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,603
All men fear death.

504
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,365
No, not death.

505
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,329
I fear

506
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,084
I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

507
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,930
Now you have given the Masters
what they deserve.

508
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,322
If I give everyone what they deserve,
I'll have no one left to rule.

509
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,964
Ser Barristan counseled mercy
when I took this city,

510
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,883
right up to the morning he died.

511
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,891
Daario Naharis thinks
I should kill the former Masters,

512
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,088
and let the rest of the city fend for itself.

513
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,000
What do you think?

514
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,084
Your Grace, I am not fit to have
an opinion on these matters.

515
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,447
You are as fit as anyone I know.

516
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,527
You know why I'm here,

517
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,410
and who will suffer the most
if this all falls apart.

518
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,167
So, what do you think?

519
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,323
I can only tell you what I have seen,
Your Grace.

520
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,769
I have seen you listen to your counselors.

521
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,007
I have seen you lean on their experience
when your own was lacking,

522
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,443
and weigh the choices they put before you.

523
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,088
And I have seen you ignore your counselors

524
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,285
because there was a better choice.

525
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,362
One that only you could see.

526
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,490
My queen, please do not do this.

527
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,768
What about "Valar Morghulis"?

528
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,286
I did not want to die a coward.

529
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,930
Apparently I do not want to die at all.

530
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,008
It takes courage to admit fear.

531
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,687
And to admit a mistake.

532
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,761
I came here to tell you that I was wrong.

533
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,291
I was wrong, and you were right.

534
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,002
About tradition.

535
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,611
About bringing the people
of this city together.

536
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,889
I will reopen the fighting pits.

537
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,769
To free men only.

538
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,846
Slavery will never return to Meereen,
not while I live.

539
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,122
Yes, my queen.

540
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,286
And in order to forge a lasting bond
with the Meereenese people,

541
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,961
I will marry the leader of an ancient family.

542
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,211
Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.

543
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,365
Don't worry.

544
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,769
I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think.

545
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,765
Where are we now?

546
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,208
Not the Rhoyne.

547
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,566
Long, sullen silences

548
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,564
and an occasional punch in the face.

549
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,081
The Mormont way.

550
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,925
Let's start over.

551
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,760
I apologize for before.

552
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,605
My mouth sometimes runs away from me.

553
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,287
This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.

554
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,723
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.

555
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,801
We are.

556
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,844
What would make our time together
truly enjoyable

557
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,325
would be some wine.

558
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,641
No wine.

559
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,007
I am a person who drinks.

560
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,201
People who drink need to keep drinking.

561
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,930
Otherwise, they're not...

562
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,091
I know where we are.

563
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,402
You're taking us through Valyria.

564
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,047
I am.

565
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,245
Have you sailed this route before?

566
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,321
No.

567
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,650
You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir

568
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,882
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

569
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,768
I think you'll be plenty.

570
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,722
You know what they say.

571
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,727
The Doom still rules Valyria.

572
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,847
What about the demons and the flames?

573
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,969
Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

574
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,441
No.

575
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,601
But the pirates are.

576
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,241
Oh.

577
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,682
The Smoking Sea.

578
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,331
How many centuries before we learn
how to build cities like this again?

579
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,205
For thousands of years, the Valyrians were

580
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,363
the best in the world at almost everything.

581
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,611
And then...

582
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,810
And then they weren't.

583
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,570
And then they weren't.

584
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,931
"They held each other close
And turned their backs upon the end

585
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,931
"The hills that split asunder
And the black that ate the skies

586
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,811
"The flames that shot so high and hot
That even dragons burned

587
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,970
"Would never be the final sights
That fell upon their eyes

588
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,443
"A fly upon a wall

589
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,360
"The waves the sea wind
Whipped and churned"

590
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,091
"A city of a thousand years

591
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,282
"And all that men had learned

592
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,967
"The Doom consumed it all alike

593
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,282
"And neither of them turned"

594
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,446
I would clap.

595
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,802
I suppose this is it, then.

596
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,408
This is what remains.

597
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,081
What was that?

598
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,681
Stone men!

599
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,684
Don't let them touch you!

600
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,650
Get behind!

601
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,210
Mormont, cut me free!

602
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,361
Mormont!

603
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,371
Mormont!

604
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,240
Mormont!

605
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,720
Tyrion.

606
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,085
Tyrion.

607
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,010
Tyrion.

608
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,610
Tyrion.

609
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,284
You're all right.

610
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,849
You're heavier than you look.

611
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,603
Did any of them touch you?

612
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,200
You?

613
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,763
I've seen greyscale before.

614
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,126
Nothing like that.

615
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,041
I suppose that's why
they send them there.

616
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,562
It'd be kinder to put daggers
in their hearts and be done with it.

617
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,405
Thank you for saving me.

618
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,001
Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving
if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place.

619
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,769
So, what now?

620
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,686
We walk up the coast.
With luck, we'll find a fishing village.

621
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,840
Maybe another boat.

622
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,685
Without luck?

623
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,641
We've got a long walk ahead of us.

624
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,606
I'll get some wood for a fire.

625
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,725
Try to get some rest, huh?

626
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,328
That's the best idea you've had all day.

627
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:43,500
