<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,646
Your Grace, I want to say...

3
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,085
You will not speak.

4
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,689
How do I know you are who you say you are?

5
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,330
If only I were otherwise.

6
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,324
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

7
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,971
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

8
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
You want revenge against the Lannisters?

9
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,167
I killed my mother, Joanna Lannister,
on the day I was born.

10
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,843
I killed my father, Tywin Lannister,
with a bolt to the heart.

11
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,761
I am the greatest Lannister
killer of our time.

12
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,002
So I should welcome you into my service

13
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,208
because you murdered members
of your own family?

14
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,444
Into your service?

15
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,607
We have only just met.

16
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,368
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

17
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,485
If you'd rather return to the fighting pits,
just say the word.

18
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,048
When I was a young man, I heard a story

19
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,964
about a baby born
during the worst storm in living memory.

20
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,488
She had no wealth, no lands, no army,
only a name

21
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,086
and a handful of supporters,
most of whom probably thought

22
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,891
they could use that name
to benefit themselves.

23
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,440
They kept her alive,
moving her from place to place,

24
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,410
often hours ahead
of the men who'd been sent to kill her.

25
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,802
She was eventually sold off to some warlord
on the edge of the world

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,689
and that appeared to be that.

27
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,325
Then, a few years later,
the most well-informed person I knew

28
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,246
told me that this girl
without wealth, lands, or armies

29
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,722
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,564
along with three dragons.

31
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,841
He thought she was our best,
last chance to build a better world.

32
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,641
I thought you were worth meeting,
at the very least.

33
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,404
And why are you worth meeting?

34
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,403
Why should I spend my time listening to you?

35
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,165
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

36
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,086
You have no one at your side
who understands the land you want to rule,

37
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,084
the strengths and weaknesses of the houses
that will either join or oppose you.

38
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,322
I will have a very large army.

39
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,560
And very large dragons.

40
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,160
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,411
When I served as Hand of the King,
I did quite well with the latter,

42
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,806
considering the king in question

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,168
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

44
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,167
I could do an even better job
advising a ruler worth the name.

45
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,649
If that is indeed what you are.

46
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,329
So you want to advise me?

47
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,205
Very well.

48
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,530
What would you have me do with him?

49
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,405
I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.

50
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,771
I know.

51
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,967
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

52
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,250
Whomever Ser Jorah was
when he started informing on you,

53
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,169
he is no longer that man.

54
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,727
I can't remember ever seeing a sane man
as devoted to anything

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,529
as he is to serving you.

56
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,600
He claims he would kill for you
and die for you

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,684
and nothing I have witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,570
And yet he did betray you.

59
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,846
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,247
Yes.

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,082
Many opportunities.

62
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,763
- And did he?
- No.

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,081
Not until forced to do so.

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,168
He worships you.

65
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,361
He is in love with you, I think.

66
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,002
But he did not trust you with the truth.

67
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,442
An unpleasant truth to be sure,
but one of great significance to you.

68
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,523
He did not trust that you
would be wise enough to forgive him.

69
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,483
So I should kill him?

70
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,843
A ruler who kills those devoted to her
is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

71
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,689
And you're going to need to inspire devotion,
a lot of it,

72
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,730
if you're ever going to rule
across the Narrow Sea.

73
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,528
But you cannot have him by your side
when you do.

74
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,802
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

75
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,721
Confess.

76
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,086
My son...

77
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,325
Let me speak to...

78
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,565
Confess.

79
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,846
I meant it.

80
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,922
My face will be the last thing you see...

81
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,763
My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.

82
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,891
When I was eight, I begged enough money
to buy my first bucket of oysters.

83
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,850
I sold that bucket and made enough money
to buy two more.

84
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,089
It took a While,

85
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,607
but I finally saved enough
to buy myself an oyster cart.

86
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,849
Now every morning,
I make my way down to the canals.

87
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,844
I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.

88
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,610
I usually see Lhara,

89
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,331
my first customer of the day,
on her way home.

90
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,567
Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane...

91
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,609
Turn left onto Ragman Lane,
where I do most of my trade.

92
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,969
Lanna is very impressive.

93
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,804
Very industrious.

94
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,285
She will make a fine servant
for the Many-Faced God.

95
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,485
How will she serve him?

96
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,325
She will no longer
turn left onto Ragman Lane.

97
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,730
She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.

98
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,006
What will she do there?

99
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,725
She will see.

100
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,487
See what?

101
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,566
How can a man tell a girl this?

102
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,928
If he knew what she would see,
there would be no reason to send her.

103
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,006
Oysters, clams and cockles!

104
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,364
Oysters, clams and cockles!

105
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,601
Oysters, clams and cockles!

106
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,284
Your oysters fresh?

107
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,521
Best in the city.

108
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,489
You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you?

109
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,727
Mmm.

110
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,242
Very nice. Give me four with vinegar.

111
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,120
It's my 18th voyage.

112
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,769
Returned from all of them
without a scratch on me.

113
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,570
Can't do it.

114
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,403
Please, I've three children.
Without me...

115
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,249
Here, take it. You have to.
I've three children.

116
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,651
- What will they do?
- Come on.

117
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,484
They've nothing without me.

118
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,210
Please, you have to!

119
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,487
Please, you don't understand!

120
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,643
The man is a gambler.

121
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,521
He wagers that a sailor's ship
will make it to its destination.

122
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,371
It is a strange wager for the captain.

123
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,522
He only wins if he loses his life.

124
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,851
So why would a captain
make the wager in the first place?

125
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,609
A girl tells a man that she has seen.

126
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,248
If the captain dies,

127
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,322
the thin man pays his family a lot of money.

128
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,844
But perhaps the gambler loses his bet

129
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,082
and decides he does not
have to pay after all.

130
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,122
A destitute woman and her small child,
what can they do to such a man

131
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,726
if he keeps their money for himself?

132
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,040
To whom can they turn for recourse?

133
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,491
The Many-Faced God.

134
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,762
You said you didn't know
what I would see at the docks.

135
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,481
A man had no idea what a girl would see
and what she would not.

136
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,409
A girl named Lanna will return to the docks.

137
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,891
She will watch the gambler.

138
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,123
She will come to know as much about him
as she knows about herself.

139
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,440
And then what?

140
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,922
A gift for the thin man.

141
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,645
She's not ready.

142
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,041
Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.

143
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,845
And if she's not?

144
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,684
It is all the same to the Many-Faced God.

145
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,562
The trial will take place soon.

146
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,841
The High Sparrow will be presenting
a substantial case against you.

147
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,001
The charges?

148
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,926
Fornication, treason, incest,
the murder of King Robert.

149
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,647
- All lies.
- Of course.

150
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,406
My concern is that the Faith does not adhere

151
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,166
to the same standards of proof as the crown.

152
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,689
I hope you'll excuse me for saying it,
but belief is so often the death of reason.

153
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,808
I wish you had said it sooner.

154
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,691
Is there any word from Jaime?

155
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,004
No, I'm afraid not.

156
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,484
Grand Maester Pycelle

157
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,208
has summoned your Uncle Kevan
back from Casterly Rock

158
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,930
to serve as Hand of the King.

159
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,566
He now presides over the Small Council.

160
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,368
Tell him I need to speak to him.

161
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,727
I implored him to visit you,
but he would not.

162
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,129
What about my son, the king?

163
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,368
If you can visit me, then surely the king...

164
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,727
Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest...

165
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,211
The king has not taken them well.

166
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,045
He remains in his chambers.

167
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,249
His servants often find his food
in the hall, left untouched.

168
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,570
You need to talk to him.

169
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,722
You need to talk to my son
and tell him to come and see me,

170
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,961
come and see his mother.

171
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,726
He... I tried. He wouldn't see me.

172
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,529
He won't see anyone.

173
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,290
I can't stay here.

174
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,606
There is a way.

175
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,960
A way out.

176
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,601
Confess?

177
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,201
To the High Sparrow? I won't.

178
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,090
I made him.

179
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,249
I rose him up from nothing.

180
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,005
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

181
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,730
and beg his forgiveness.

182
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,363
Good bye.

183
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,521
The work continues.

184
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,240
Why?

185
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,891
Why, Theon?

186
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,249
Not Theon. There is no Theon.

187
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,651
- Reek.
- Reek.

188
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,007
Why did you tell him, Reek?

189
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,090
I was helping you.

190
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,045
You wanted to escape.

191
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,770
There is no escape.

192
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,366
Not ever.

193
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,602
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

194
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,924
The master knew.

195
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,445
He knows everything.

196
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,445
He hunted him and caught him
and strapped him to a cross

197
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,611
and cut away piece after piece
until there was no Theon left.

198
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,525
Good.

199
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,969
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

200
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,690
If I could do what Ramsay did to you

201
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,963
right here, right now, I would.

202
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,484
I deserved everything.

203
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,483
I deserve to be Reek.

204
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,809
I did terrible things.

205
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,645
Turned on Robb.

206
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,289
Captured Winterfell.

207
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,762
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

208
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,127
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

209
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,725
You'd known them since they were born.

210
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,211
They weren't. They were only...

211
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,327
Only what?

212
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,046
- I can't.
- Tell me.

213
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,565
I can't, not unless the master says.

214
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,801
- Tell me. They weren't what?
- They weren't...

215
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,289
Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone
while you still breathe the air.

216
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,409
Tell me to my face, Theon.
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

217
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,005
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

218
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,970
I couldn't find them.

219
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,690
It was two farm boys.

220
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,800
I killed them and burned them
so no one would know.

221
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,880
You didn't...

222
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,604
Do you know where they went,
Bran and Rickon?

223
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,647
I can't talk to you anymore.

224
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,121
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where...

225
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,362
Not Theon! Reek!

226
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,162
Our scouts tell us
he's got no more than 6,000 men.

227
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,163
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

228
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,481
And how high do Stannis' horses jump?

229
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,405
Our walls have been fully repaired.
The gates have been reinforced.

230
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,691
We have enough food for six months.

231
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,809
We are more prepared for a siege
than they could ever be.

232
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,245
All we have to do is wait for them
to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

233
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,651
You disagree?

234
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,202
Stannis isn't from the North.
You are, Father.

235
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,169
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

236
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,971
how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

237
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,166
And what do you recommend?

238
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,924
That we not sit and wait
for Stannis to decide

239
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,128
what sort of fight this is going to be.

240
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,330
That we hit first and hit hard
and leave a feast for the crows.

241
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,483
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

242
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,164
As long as we stay behind these walls,
they can't touch us.

243
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,924
Not to mention that the snow is so deep,

244
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,083
we couldn't get an army through
to engage them even if we wanted to.

245
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,009
I don't need an army.

246
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,968
I need 20 good men.

247
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,884
So, have you decided yet?

248
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,122
Whether I'm worthy of your service?

249
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,883
Have you decided yet
whether you're going to have me killed?

250
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,883
It's probably my safest option.

251
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,803
I could see why you would think so.

252
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,284
It's what your father would have done.

253
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,845
And what would your father have done?

254
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,091
My father, who publically
sentenced me to death?

255
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,609
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

256
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,806
Is that why you killed him?

257
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,290
Someday, if you decide not to execute me,

258
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,047
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

259
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,521
And on that day, should it ever come,

260
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,448
we'll need more wine than this.

261
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,251
I know what my father was.

262
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,805
What he did.

263
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,882
I know the Mad King earned his name.

264
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,407
So, here we sit.

265
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,851
Two terrible children of
two terrible fathers.

266
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,610
I'm terrible?

267
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,011
I've heard stories.

268
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,205
Why did you travel to the
far side of the world

269
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,089
to meet someone terrible?

270
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,123
To see if you were the
right kind of terrible.

271
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,281
Which kind is that?

272
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,330
The kind that prevents your people
from being even more so.

273
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,048
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

274
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,930
Under my rule, murder will once again
become entertainment.

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,843
Yes, that was wise.

276
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,083
And you agreed to marry someone you loathe
for the greater good.

277
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,241
Very impressive.

278
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,845
My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,

279
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,081
though not by choice,

280
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,289
and certainly not for the greater good,
gods forbid.

281
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,771
She ended up having him killed.

282
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,201
Perhaps it won't come to that.

283
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,729
It's not impossible that Varys was right
about you after all.

284
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,810
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

285
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,406
Yes, he's the one who convinced me
to come find you.

286
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,486
He was my traveling companion,
before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

287
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,688
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

288
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,083
For 20 years, the spider
oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

289
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,845
He did what he had to do to survive.

290
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,003
He did a lot of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

291
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,721
I suspect he's the main reason
you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

292
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,121
- But you trust him?
- Yes, oddly.

293
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,090
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

294
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,490
Except my brother.

295
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,848
The brother who killed my father?

296
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,561
That's the one.

297
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,529
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

298
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,125
Your queenly prerogative.

299
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,770
I had given up on life

300
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,284
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

301
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,050
You chop off my head, well,
my final days were interesting.

302
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,409
I'm not going to kill you.

303
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,006
No?

304
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,483
- Banish me?
- No.

305
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,010
So if I'm not going to be murdered
and I'm not going to be banished...

306
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,605
You're going to advise me.

307
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,727
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

308
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,646
- Advise you on what?
- How to get what I want.

309
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,490
The Iron Throne.

310
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,248
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

311
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,926
If I want jokes, I'll get
myself a proper fool.

312
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,002
I'm not entirely joking.

313
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,845
There's more to the world than Westeros.

314
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,050
How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

315
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,602
Perhaps this is where you belong,
where you can do the most good.

316
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,731
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

317
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,849
would ever know what it meant
to be bought or sold.

318
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,810
I will continue that fight here and beyond.

319
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,324
But this is not my home.

320
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,131
When you get back to your home,
who supports you?

321
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,690
The common people.

322
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,411
Let's be generous
and assume that's going to happen.

323
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,608
Here in Slaver's Bay,
you had the support of the common people

324
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,921
and only the common people.

325
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,047
What was that like?

326
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,609
Ruling without the rich?

327
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,482
House Targaryen is gone.

328
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,484
Not a single person who shares your blood
is alive to support you.

329
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,283
The Starks are gone as well.
Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

330
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,081
The remaining members of House Lannister
will never back you, not ever.

331
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,761
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

332
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,049
His entire claim to the throne rests on
the illegitimacy of yours.

333
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,963
That leaves the Tyrells.

334
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,411
Not impossible.

335
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,641
Not enough.

336
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,202
Lannister, Targaryen,
Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

337
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,282
They're all just spokes on a wheel.

338
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,203
This one's on top, then that one's on top.

339
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,524
And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

340
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,571
It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.

341
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,251
You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

342
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,242
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

343
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,042
I'm going to break the wheel.

344
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,611
You said whoever wins will fight
at the Great Pit in front of the queen.

345
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,966
I won.

346
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,521
You struck me.

347
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,887
Have me flogged if it makes you happy.

348
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,168
But I'm the best you've got.

349
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,249
If I win at the Great Pit,

350
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,804
how much can you sell me for?

351
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,883
You're a free man.
You could have gone anywhere.

352
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,205
Why did you come back?

353
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,727
Let me fight for her and I belong to you.

354
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,125
Thirsty?

355
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,846
Confess.

356
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,003
I'll get out of here before long.

357
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,081
Confess.

358
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,481
I can make you a wealthy woman.

359
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,245
A lady of the court.

360
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,685
Confess.

361
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,245
Or I can make sure you die
in the most hideous way imaginable.

362
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,962
And all I do is sit here
imagining hideous ways for you to die.

363
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,410
Does it hurt?

364
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,486
No.

365
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,561
Good.

366
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,090
How are you?

367
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,448
I'm not the one who got punched
and kicked in the face.

368
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,405
You know what I mean.

369
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,246
I'm good.

370
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,281
Are you scared?

371
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,764
- A little.
- Me, too.

372
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,364
- Who's there?
- Olly.

373
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,081
Ch.

374
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,046
Come in.

375
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,770
I heard what happened.

376
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,610
Oh, not to worry.

377
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,923
Men brawl from time to time.
It's only natural.

378
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,010
Figured you were hungry.

379
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,370
Oh, you're a good lad.

380
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,082
Wanted to ask you something
if you've got the time.

381
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,443
I need to check on baby Sam.

382
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,044
Now then, how can I help?

383
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,768
- It's about the Lord Commander.
- Yes?

384
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,049
He's going up to Hardhome
to save all them wildlings.

385
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,406
Wildlings killed my mum and dad.

386
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,449
- They killed everyone in my village.
- We've been fighting them for years.

387
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,204
This wasn't a fight.

388
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,044
We were farmers.

389
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,645
They slaughtered us.

390
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,525
So why is he saving them?

391
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,122
Wildlings are people.

392
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,605
Just like us, there are good ones
and bad ones.

393
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,042
The one he's traveling with,
with the red beard,

394
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,600
he led the raid on my village.

395
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,330
- Oh, Olly...
- How can he trust him?

396
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,531
I've seen the army of the dead.

397
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,887
I've seen the White Walkers.

398
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,930
And they're coming for us,
for all the living.

399
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,683
And when it's time,

400
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,525
we'll need every last man we can find.

401
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,771
But what if we let the wildlings
through the gates

402
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,649
and they cut our throats while we sleep?

403
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,530
Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.

404
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,841
We don't stand a chance otherwise.

405
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,769
Sometimes, a man has to make hard choices,

406
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,683
choices that might look wrong to others,

407
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,525
but you know are right in the long run.

408
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,450
You believe that?

409
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,369
With all my heart.

410
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,328
Try not to worry.

411
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,687
I've been worrying about Jon for years.

412
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,285
He always comes back.

413
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,445
Watch your bow!

414
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,049
You trust me, Jon Snow?

415
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,362
Does that make me a fool?

416
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,488
We're fools together now.

417
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,245
Lord of Bones.

418
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,168
Been a long time.

419
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,124
Last time I saw you,
the little crow was your prisoner.

420
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,567
The other way around now. What happened?

421
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,246
War.

422
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,926
You call that a war?

423
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,287
The greatest army the North has ever seen

424
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,290
cut to pieces by some southern king.

425
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,089
We should gather the elders,

426
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,523
find somewhere quiet to talk.

427
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,250
You don't give the orders here.

428
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,288
I'm not giving an order.

429
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,850
Why aren't you in chains?

430
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,610
He's not my prisoner.

431
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,805
No?

432
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,445
What is he?

433
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,090
We're allies.

434
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,241
You fucking traitor.

435
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,727
You fight for the crows now?

436
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,041
I don't fight for the crows.

437
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,962
We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.

438
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,407
Is that right?

439
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,962
You and the pretty crow
do a lot of talking, Tormund?

440
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,929
And when you're done talking,

441
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,685
do you get down on your knees
and suck his cock?

442
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,164
Gather the elders, and let's talk.

443
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,124
My name's Jon Snow.

444
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,328
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

445
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,484
We're not friends.

446
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,163
We've never been friends.

447
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,447
We won't become friends today.

448
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,883
This isn't about friendship.

449
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,049
This is about survival.

450
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,009
This is about putting a 700-foot wall

451
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,208
between you and what's out there.

452
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,408
You built that wall to keep us out.

453
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,404
Since when do the crows give two shits
if we live?

454
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,563
In normal times we wouldn't,
but these aren't normal times.

455
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,883
The White Walkers don't care
if a man's free folk or crow.

456
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,089
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

457
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,288
But together, we can beat them.

458
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,000
Beat the White Walkers?

459
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,166
Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.

460
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,845
It's not a trick.

461
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,844
It's a gift, for those who join us.

462
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,365
Dragonglass.

463
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,484
A man of the Night's Watch

464
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,245
used one of these daggers to kill a Walker.

465
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,810
- You saw this?
- No.

466
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,925
But I trust the man.

467
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,520
There are old stories about dragonglass.

468
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,201
There are old stories
about ice spiders big as hounds.

469
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,482
And with the things we've seen,
you don't believe them?

470
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,207
Come with me
and I'll share these weapons.

471
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,805
Come with you where?

472
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,644
There are good lands south of the wall.

473
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,449
The Night's Watch
will let you through the tunnel

474
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,921
and allow your people to farm those lands.

475
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,048
I knew Mance Rayder.

476
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,090
He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch.

477
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,766
He wanted a new life for his people, for you.

478
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,286
We're prepared to give you that new life.

479
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,687
If?

480
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,730
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

481
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,241
Where is Mance?

482
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,922
- He died.
- How?

483
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,966
I put an arrow through his heart.

484
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,966
Hey.

485
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,929
Hey.

486
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,571
Hey.

487
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,042
I say we send the Lord Commander
back to Castle Black.

488
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,531
With no eyes.

489
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,081
Hey, none of you saw Mance die.

490
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,045
I did.

491
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,329
The southern king,
who broke our army, Stannis,

492
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,210
wanted to burn him alive to
send us a message.

493
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,726
Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.

494
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,169
His arrow was mercy.

495
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,770
What he did took courage.

496
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,370
And that's what we need today,

497
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,968
the courage to make peace
with men we've been killing for generations.

498
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,929
I lost my father, my uncle, and two brothers
fighting the damn crows.

499
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,809
I'm not asking you to forget your dead.

500
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,282
I'll never forget mine.

501
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,926
I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance
attacked the wall.

502
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,731
But I'm asking you

503
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,684
to think about your children now.

504
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,321
They'll never have children of their own
if we don't band together.

505
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,687
The Long Night is coming,

506
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,603
and the dead come with it.

507
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,368
No clan can stop them.

508
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,090
The free folk can't stop them.

509
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,525
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

510
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,968
And all the southern kings can't stop them.

511
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,161
Only together...

512
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,920
All of us.

513
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,411
And even then, it may not be enough.

514
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,165
But at least we'll give the fuckers a fight.

515
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,364
You vouch for this man, Tormund?

516
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,644
He's prettier than both my daughters,

517
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,963
but he knows how to fight.

518
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,646
He's young, but he knows how to lead.

519
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,803
He didn't have to come to Hardhome.

520
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,528
He came because he needs us.

521
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,201
And we need him.

522
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,162
My ancestors would spit on me
if I broke bread with a crow.

523
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,771
So would mine, but fuck 'em. They're dead.

524
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,091
I'll never trust a man in black.

525
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,160
But I trust you, Tormund.

526
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,328
If you say this is the way,

527
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,530
we're with you.

528
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,451
This is the way.

529
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,243
I'm with Tormund.

530
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,522
We stay here, we're dead men.

531
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,324
At least with King Crow, there's a chance.

532
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,002
Tormund.

533
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,844
Keep that new life you want to give us.

534
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,201
And keep your glass, King Crow.

535
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,209
As soon as you get on his ships,
they're gonna slit your throats,

536
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,602
and dump your bodies
to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.

537
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,010
That's our enemy.

538
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,087
That has always been our enemy.

539
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,650
I fucking hate Thenns.

540
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,841
- Move it.
- Be careful.

541
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,049
- Move 'em along, now.
- We'll catch the tides.

542
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,169
That's it, come on!

543
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,480
How many are with us? Five thousand?

544
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,365
I'm not good at counting.

545
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,370
We're leaving too many behind.

546
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,771
The free folk are stubborn.

547
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,650
You know how long it took Mance
to band them together?

548
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,961
Twenty fucking years.

549
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,361
And he knew them better than I ever will.

550
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,405
They're running out of food,
and there's nothing to hunt.

551
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,010
They'll come around.

552
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,889
- Get yourselves ready.
- Aye!

553
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,124
Johnna is gonna look after you.

554
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,806
She's in charge. You listen to her.

555
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,520
Take her.

556
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,120
I want to go with you.

557
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,885
I need to get the old folks on the boats.

558
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,923
I'm right behind you. I promise.

559
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,201
Go on.

560
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,721
Another one.

561
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,641
Keep moving.
We'll meet you out there.

562
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,611
Won't be able to take that on the boat.
It's too big.

563
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,843
- That's the last one!
- Three more! Move on!

564
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,448
There's more
dragonglass everywhere.

565
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,247
I've got some more daggers
over here.

566
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,769
Put that dagger in his bag.

567
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,761
Uh...

568
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,922
The fuck you looking at?

569
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,284
Steady!

570
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,930
Shut the gate.

571
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,684
Shut the gate!

572
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,684
Shut the gate!

573
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,682
- Open the gate!
- Let us in!

574
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,688
Open the gate!

575
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,091
Ready your arrows!

576
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,043
- Wait!
- Keep in line! Get in line!

577
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,250
Get in line!

578
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,489
Get to the front!

579
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,970
Go on, shoot it!

580
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,368
- Wait!
- Duncan, hold the line!

581
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,206
Lord Commander!

582
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,641
Get them to the ship and come back for me!

583
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,643
- But you'll never make...
- Now!

584
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,327
- Let me on!
- Let me on!

585
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,209
- Bloody fucking move!
- Let go!

586
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,170
You should be on one of those boats.

587
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,164
So should you. My little girls got on.

588
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,402
They're gonna let them pass the Wall
even if you're not there?

589
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,847
You have my word. I've given orders.

590
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,403
Don't think you're gonna be there
to enforce those orders.

591
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,207
If they get through, everyone dies!

592
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,530
Night's Watch!

593
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,683
With me! Move!

594
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,811
Move!

595
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,121
No!

596
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,761
- Tormund, the sleigh!
- Okay!

597
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,330
The dragonglass.

598
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,640
You and me, then!

599
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,046
Go!

600
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,481
Get the glass.

601
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,165
Come on!

602
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,368
- The dragonglass.
- Fuck the glass!

603
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,010
We are gonna die here!

604
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,004
Oh, fuck!

605
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,086
Here they come!

606
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,490
Wun Wun, to the sea!

607
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,765
In the boats! Quickly!

608
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,087
- Faster, faster!
- Run!

609
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,651
Quickly!

610
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,889
- Go! Row!
- Go, come on!

611
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,761
Let's go! Now!

612
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:50,500
