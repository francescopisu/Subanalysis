<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,923
You have command of Castle Black.

3
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,407
It is my duty to tell you

4
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,962
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

5
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,965
and an insult to all the brothers
who have died fighting the wildlings.

6
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,042
Thank you for your honesty.

7
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,204
Safe travels.

8
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,441
Thank you, Sam.

9
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,166
Oh, um...

10
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,451
It's dragonglass.

11
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,290
It's what I used to kill the White Walker.

12
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,965
I hope you don't need them.

13
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,241
Me, too.

14
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,645
There he is.

15
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,885
That laugh.

16
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,161
Egg.

17
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,764
Egg laughed like that.

18
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,605
One of the first things I remember.

19
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,601
His little brother, Aegon. He became king.

20
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,444
And before that, he was a jolly fellow,

21
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,211
like this one.

22
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,404
Get him south, Gillyflower.

23
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,961
Before it's too late.

24
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,406
Theon, wait.

25
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,721
Not Theon. Reek.

26
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,605
Help me.

27
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,450
You're his wife now.

28
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,681
Theon.

29
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,121
Do what he says,

30
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,805
or he'll hurt you.

31
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,888
He already hurts me every night.

32
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,611
All day I'm locked in this room,
and every night he comes...

33
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,086
It can't be any worse.

34
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,161
It can.

35
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,005
It can always be worse.

36
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,890
- What did he do to you?
- Please.

37
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,731
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry!

38
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,041
You have to help me.

39
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,282
He'll see us. You don't know him.

40
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,090
My family still has friends in the North.

41
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,811
All I need to do is give a signal,
and they'll rescue me.

42
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,283
Climb to the top of the broken tower.

43
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,843
Light this candle, and put it in the window.

44
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,810
- Promise me, Theon.
- My name is Reek.

45
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,086
Your name is Theon Greyjoy.

46
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,360
Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

47
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,930
Do you hear me?

48
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,206
Theon.

49
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,407
Promise me.

50
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,280
Yes, Reek?

51
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,891
Egg.

52
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,486
Egg.

53
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,442
Mother's looking for you.

54
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,326
Egg.

55
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,365
Get some sleep, Sam.

56
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,729
You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.

57
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,251
You don't know that.

58
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,651
Get some sleep.

59
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,450
I'll watch over him.

60
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,051
I'm staying, too.

61
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,129
He's always been good to me.

62
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,885
I can't leave him now.

63
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,651
Egg!

64
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,721
Egg,

65
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,445
I dreamed

66
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,286
that I was old.

67
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,167
His name was Aemon Targaryen.

68
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,164
He came to us from King's Landing.

69
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,690
A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn,

70
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,851
and sworn brother of the Night's Watch,
ever faithful.

71
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,170
No man was wiser, or gentler, or kinder.

72
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,011
At the Wall,

73
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,081
a dozen lord commanders
came and went during his years of service,

74
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,128
but he was always there to counsel them.

75
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,284
He was the blood of the dragon,

76
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,203
but now his fire has gone out.

77
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,970
And now his watch is ended.

78
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,488
And now his watch is ended.

79
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,686
You're losing all your friends, Tarly.

80
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,930
My beautiful wife.

81
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,767
When my father told me we were marrying,
I half expected a fat, bearded beast.

82
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,411
Do you know how pleased I was
when I saw you?

83
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,962
You've made me very happy.

84
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,968
Our scouts report
that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell.

85
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,764
He's a respected commander.

86
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,322
His troops are loyal and battle-tested.

87
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,882
He's hired thousands of foreign sellswords
to bolster his army.

88
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,803
But this storm is a stroke of luck
for us northerners.

89
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
Our people are used to fighting in the frost.

90
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,525
His army is out there now,
suffering in the snow.

91
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,849
One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

92
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,287
You'll be my lady and Wardeness.

93
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,522
But isn't your stepmother pregnant?

94
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,161
What of it?

95
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,408
What happens if she has a boy?

96
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,723
Then I'll have a baby brother.

97
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,251
But he'll be the heir.

98
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,288
I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

99
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,121
But you're a bastard.

100
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,521
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

101
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,480
I've been naturalized by
a royal decree from...

102
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,846
Tommen Baratheon?

103
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,726
Another bastard.

104
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,246
Bastards can rise high in the world.

105
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,844
Like your half-brother, Jon Snow.

106
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,723
Born the Bastard of Winterfell,

107
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,406
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

108
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,365
You didn't know?

109
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,441
Yes, he's done very well for himself.

110
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,401
Ch.

111
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,168
I nearly forgot why I asked you to join me.

112
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,006
Come, my lady.

113
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,130
Your northern friend.

114
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,608
Reek told me you wanted to leave.

115
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,931
Why?

116
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,731
Winterfell is your home,
and I am your husband.

117
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,486
Tough old bird.

118
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,441
Everyone talks when I start peeling them.

119
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,961
But this one,

120
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,400
her heart gave out
before I even got to her face.

121
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,681
We do breed them tough in the North.

122
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,122
Bring my wife back to her chamber.

123
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,968
It's far too cold out here for a lady.

124
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,042
You should hold on to your candles.

125
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,167
The nights are so long now.

126
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,247
Forty horses died in the night.

127
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,283
We'll lose more come sunset.

128
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,806
We're running out of food.

129
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,526
We can't open the supply line
until the snow clears.

130
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,001
What else?

131
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,891
The Stormcrows rode off last night.

132
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,931
Five hundred men.

133
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,480
Sellswords.

134
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,723
Loyal to nothing but gold.

135
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,729
We still have a hard march to Winterfell,

136
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,609
and we won't be marching anywhere
in this weather.

137
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,321
And?

138
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,890
This isn't our time.

139
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,490
We should head back to Castle Black
when the snow clears.

140
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,927
I retreated from King's Landing.

141
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,402
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.

142
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,608
- Your Grace...
- Winter is coming.

143
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,843
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.

144
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,721
If we march back to Castle Black,
we winter at Castle Black.

145
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,646
And who can say how many years
this winter will last?

146
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,643
It's better to wait for the right time
than risk everything.

147
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,041
This is the right time,
and I will risk everything.

148
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,521
Because if I don't, we've lost.

149
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,771
We march to victory, or we march to defeat,

150
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,921
but we go forward. Only forward.

151
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,281
Your Grace.

152
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,127
I've trusted in your visions,

153
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,965
in your prophecies for years.

154
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,926
You saw it yourself,
when you stared into the flames.

155
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,244
A great battle in the snow.

156
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,209
- I don't know what I saw.
- You do know.

157
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,601
Trust yourself.

158
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,804
And you? Do you trust yourself?

159
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,131
I trust in the Lord.

160
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,330
Are you sure?

161
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,002
I have seen myself
walk along the battlements of Winterfell.

162
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,321
I have seen the flayed man banners
lowered to the ground.

163
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,122
But sometimes sacrifices must be made
to ensure victory.

164
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,727
I have shown you the power of king's blood.

165
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,131
The usurper, Robb Stark.

166
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,449
The usurper, Joffrey Baratheon.

167
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,841
We don't have Robert's bastard here.

168
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,921
No,

169
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,880
we have someone better,

170
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,321
and your blood runs through her veins.

171
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,045
Have you lost your mind?

172
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,690
Do you doubt me?

173
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,405
Still?

174
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,885
After all that you've seen.

175
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,930
There must be another way.

176
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,401
- Leeches or...
- There is only one way.

177
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,690
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

178
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,401
Only you can lead the
living against the dead.

179
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,285
All your life has led us to this moment.

180
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,769
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

181
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,647
Get out.

182
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,329
There's always some sort of grub on.

183
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,004
A bit of mutton would be nice.

184
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,610
A beauty from beyond the Wall.

185
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,771
Where you going, love?
Aren't we better-looking than the fat man?

186
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,844
No, the question is,
"Is she pretty down south in the real world,

187
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,888
"or is she pretty
'cause she's the only girl here?"

188
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,809
Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss.

189
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,684
Come on, love, give us a kiss.

190
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,807
Leave me alone.

191
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,769
Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

192
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,330
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

193
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,170
A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.

194
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,601
There's no need to be rude.

195
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,286
We just want a little affection.

196
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,641
Ooh.

197
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,801
Get your hands off her.

198
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,446
Brother Derek, Brother Brant,

199
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,484
I believe you both have guard duty tonight.

200
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,170
Sam the Slayer.

201
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,850
You gonna slay me with that sword?

202
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,331
Look at his hand shake.

203
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,289
Gilly, go on.

204
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,489
Get back to your room, lock the door.

205
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,048
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.

206
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,167
Come on.

207
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,161
Sam!

208
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,008
You lying sack of shit.

209
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,403
Killed a White Walker, eh?

210
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,686
You fat-ass fuck.

211
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,683
Come on, get up.

212
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,051
- No!
- This your hero? This hog?

213
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,841
Leave him alone!

214
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,641
Stubborn little wildling bitch, aren't you?

215
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,085
- Come on!
- No!

216
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,890
- Sam!
- Come on!

217
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,762
- Sam!
- Come on.

218
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,001
Right.

219
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,411
Hold still.

220
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,760
- Turn her over.
- All right.

221
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,691
I said, get your hands off her.

222
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,285
You're gonna get yourself killed.

223
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,806
Your lover Jon Snow's not here to save you.

224
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,451
I killed a White Walker, I killed a Thenn.

225
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,170
I'll take my chances with you.

226
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,081
Sam!

227
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,449
- I'm all right.
- You're not.

228
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,725
Just a bit woozy.

229
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,491
The next time you see something like that,
you leave it alone.

230
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,370
I will not. They would have...

231
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,568
I don't know what they would have done.

232
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,961
I know they would have killed you
if Ghost hadn't come.

233
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,249
No. They were tiring out.

234
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,928
I had them in the palm of my hand.

235
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,409
Don't be stupid. You're not a fighter.

236
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,725
What kind of man would I be

237
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,808
if I ran away
when I saw someone hurting you?

238
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,920
Just promise me,

239
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,810
whatever happens,
you'll take care of Little Sam.

240
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,730
But of course I will.

241
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,601
And

242
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,609
I'll take care of you, too.

243
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,810
I need more water.

244
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,806
Stay.

245
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,764
Please.

246
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,450
Am I hurting you?

247
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,847
Are you sure?

248
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,691
Oh, my!

249
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,764
A rare find for the fighting pits,
my friend.

250
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,449
Not your usual street
tough or drunken pirate.

251
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,766
This one's a Westerosi knight

252
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,211
from an ancient house
trained in sword and lance.

253
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,089
He fought beside the stag king Robert
on the far side of the Narrow Sea.

254
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,522
He was first through the breach
during the Siege of Spike,

255
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,888
slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword.

256
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,681
He killed the great Khal Drogo
in single combat.

257
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,204
Betrayed by his woman,

258
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,682
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.

259
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,969
Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.

260
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,566
Thirteen. Do I have 14?

261
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,202
Fifteen? 15 gold honors.

262
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,489
Do I hear 16? 16.

263
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,324
Twenty.

264
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,846
Sold.

265
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,641
Wait!

266
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,560
- You have to buy me as well.
- Why?

267
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,245
We're a team.

268
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,924
I'm a great fighter, too.

269
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,967
He's funny. You have to give him that.

270
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,441
You're right, he's funny.

271
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,650
Thank you.

272
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,767
Yes.

273
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,288
My lord, if I may.

274
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,801
I've heard Meereen has become a free city.

275
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,645
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

276
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,848
Now, if you were to fight freed men
who'd be paid a wage...

277
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,283
There's your wages, funny man.

278
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,284
Should last the rest of your life.

279
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,760
These are warrior hands,
not a serving girl's.

280
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,130
Five, going once...

281
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,842
How long before the King of Meereen
comes to claim my pillow?

282
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,285
Don't be ridiculous.

283
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,924
My marriage to Hizdahr is political.

284
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,608
I think he's smart enough to understand that.

285
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,648
I think the Sons of the Harpy
have stopped killing

286
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,922
because their leader was made king.

287
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,570
Are you jealous?

288
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,722
Do you think I'm petty enough to
speak ill of a man

289
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,962
just because he represents competition?

290
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,126
I do.

291
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,730
You're right.

292
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,371
My motivations are entirely impure.

293
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,004
Doesn't make me wrong.

294
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,889
You told me yourself
I can't fight enemies within and without.

295
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,443
So when enemies without come knocking,
I need the city of Meereen behind me.

296
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,931
I have no choice.

297
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,325
Everyone has a choice.

298
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,364
Even slaves have a choice,

299
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,005
death or slavery.

300
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,489
So what else can I do, hmm?

301
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,925
Marry me instead.

302
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,087
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

303
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,443
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

304
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,128
You are queen. You can do what you like.

305
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,330
No, I can't.

306
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,810
Then you are the only person in Meereen
who's not free.

307
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,689
And I know I'm here to serve my queen
and not give advice,

308
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,843
but can I make one more suggestion?

309
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,761
Of course.

310
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,409
On the day of the great games,

311
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,207
gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters
and Worthy Masters you can find,

312
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,845
and slaughter them all.

313
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,007
I am a queen, not a butcher.

314
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,883
All rulers are either butchers or meat.

315
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,527
You there.

316
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,481
Where would I find
the High Septon, or High Sparrow,

317
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,642
or whatever bloody fool name he's got?

318
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,970
It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns,
I'll admit.

319
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,164
You should have the decency
to stand when you speak to a lady.

320
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,481
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

321
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,610
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

322
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,447
For me, it's the knees.

323
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,649
- You?
- Hips.

324
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,161
Ah.

325
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,611
A man of the people. Is that your game?

326
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,487
It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.

327
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,011
A man of the people

328
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,331
who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

329
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,362
The people always do the dirty work.

330
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,569
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

331
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,041
Useful talent.

332
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,964
I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.

333
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,847
Your grandson and granddaughter
swore sacred vows and lied.

334
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,121
The Father judges us all.

335
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,882
Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.

336
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,564
If you break his laws, you will be punished.

337
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,565
Don't you walk away from me.

338
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,768
You don't give commands here.

339
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,285
What is it you want?

340
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,200
Gold?

341
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,405
I'll make you the richest septon
who ever lived.

342
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,246
What, then?

343
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,488
I imagine this is strange for you.

344
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,566
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive,
and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.

345
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,649
But I'm telling you a simple truth.

346
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,685
I serve the gods.

347
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,883
The gods demand justice.

348
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,447
How do they communicate their demands?

349
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,126
By raven or horse?

350
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,851
By the holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star.

351
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,962
If you don't have one in your library,
I'll give you my own.

352
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,566
I've read The Seven-Pointed Star.

353
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,964
Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.

354
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,283
Your grandchildren will be punished

355
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,002
in the same manner
as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

356
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,881
Half the men, women, and children
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

357
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,329
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

358
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,804
and yet you punish Loras
for shagging some perfumed ponce,

359
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,042
and Margaery for defending her brother?

360
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,531
Yes.

361
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,446
The gods' laws must be
applied to all equally.

362
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,248
If it's equality you want, so be it.

363
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,285
When House Tyrell stops sending our crops
to the capital,

364
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,563
everyone here will starve.

365
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,641
And I'll make sure
the hungry know who's to blame.

366
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,531
Have you ever sowed the field?

367
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,370
Have you ever reaped the grain?

368
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,565
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

369
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,562
A lifetime of wealth and power
has left you blind in one eye.

370
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,966
You are the few,

371
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,730
we are the many.

372
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,927
And when the many stop fearing the few...

373
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,486
Lady Olenna.

374
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,321
Starving yourself won't make things
any better for her, my love.

375
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,287
She's in a prison cell,
and there is nothing I can do.

376
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,564
I am the king!

377
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,803
The queen is in prison,
and there is nothing I can do!

378
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,209
No matter who you are,

379
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,760
no matter how strong you are,
sooner or later,

380
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,406
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

381
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,170
Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated
or prevented, even if you had.

382
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,601
You cannot blame yourself for fate.

383
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,931
Your father,

384
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,571
your brother, your grandfather...

385
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,246
I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,
and what could I do?

386
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,844
Hold them as they left this world.

387
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,489
Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

388
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,923
I'll call in the army.

389
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,564
I'll take back the sept,
and kill every last one of them.

390
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,807
I'll start a war if I have to.

391
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,327
You know as well as I do
who the first casualty of that war would be.

392
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,726
I love her.

393
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,765
I love her,

394
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,165
and I can't help her.

395
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,723
We must be strong for those we love.
We cannot give in to despair.

396
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,847
I will speak with the High Sparrow.

397
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,640
There must be something he...

398
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,529
Let me talk to him on your behalf.

399
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,927
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

400
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,324
You will try to help her?

401
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,843
I'll do everything I can
to win her freedom and her brother's.

402
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,526
Your happiness is all I want in this world.

403
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,286
I know.

404
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,125
No, you don't.

405
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,204
You can't possibly.

406
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,328
Not until you have children of your own.

407
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,050
I would do anything for you.

408
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,204
Anything to keep you from harm.

409
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,042
I would burn cities to the ground.

410
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,684
You are all that matters.

411
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,840
You

412
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,360
and your sister.

413
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,763
From the moment you came into this world.

414
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,291
My boy.

415
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,685
My only boy.

416
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,609
Prince Doran hopes this satisfies
your concerns about the princess' well-being.

417
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,005
You looked different when I left.

418
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,928
You had more hair.

419
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,481
And more hands.

420
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,846
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

421
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,921
I'm sorry for that.

422
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,531
It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

423
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,325
Why is it happening at all?

424
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,683
Your mother's worried about you.

425
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,251
Threats have been made.
Dame's too dangerous for you.

426
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,682
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

427
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,886
This has been my home for years.

428
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,767
I didn't want to come here, but she told me to.
I did what she said.

429
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,605
I did my duty,
and now she's forcing me to go back?

430
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,650
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

431
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,007
No, it's not complicated at all. It's simple.

432
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,971
I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him,
and we're staying right here.

433
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,804
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

434
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,441
You don't know me.

435
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,364
Brothers, oh, brothers,
my days here are done

436
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,850
The Dornishman's taken my life

437
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,844
But what does it matter
For all men must die

438
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,481
And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife

439
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,846
I have

440
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,369
I've tasted the Dornishman's wife

441
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,125
He's got a good voice.

442
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,970
We're lucky he's a singer.

443
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,327
If he were a fighter,
we might have been in trouble.

444
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,442
It's against my code to hurt a woman.

445
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,603
It's amazing how many men we beat
seem to have this code.

446
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,290
I wouldn't say you beat me.

447
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,087
How's your arm?

448
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,571
Wonderful.

449
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,006
Wouldn't feel right to leave Dome
without a new scar.

450
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,205
You think you're leaving Dome?

451
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,091
No great hurry.

452
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,086
Dornish women
are the most beautiful women in the world.

453
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,681
Thank you.

454
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,604
I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

455
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,800
I'm not the most beautiful woman
you've ever seen?

456
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,324
I've seen quite a few women
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

457
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,645
Name one more beautiful than I am.

458
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,290
Well, now,

459
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,402
in King's Landing,
there was an absolutely gorgeous...

460
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,126
There was a what?

461
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,802
In King's Landing, you were saying?

462
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,607
Was I?

463
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,641
There was a woman more beautiful than I am.

464
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,491
Was there?

465
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,962
My memory's not what it was earlier.

466
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,801
How's your arm now?

467
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,651
You seem concerned with it.

468
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,650
You must really like me.

469
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,920
And how about your head?

470
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,570
My head.

471
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,765
My head?

472
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,530
You don't even want to know
what's going on in...

473
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,205
Your nose is bleeding.

474
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,205
It's nothing. It's the dry air.

475
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,968
My dagger was coated
with a special ointment from Asshai.

476
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,849
They call it the Long Farewell.

477
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,051
It takes time to work,

478
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,640
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

479
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,721
death.

480
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,043
The only antidote.

481
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,481
Who's the most
beautiful woman in the world?

482
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,251
You.

483
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,565
Sorry? Who?

484
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,081
You.

485
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,407
Don't drop it.

486
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,162
I think you're very handsome as well.

487
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,606
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

488
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,971
It felt like the safest place.

489
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,722
Not for your clientele, clearly.

490
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,801
It was an establishment like no other.

491
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,162
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

492
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,169
Desires that didn't even exist

493
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,650
until we invented them.

494
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,164
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

495
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,165
The past is the past.

496
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,922
The future is all that's worth discussing.

497
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,045
The future of House Tyrell.

498
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,771
Don't pretend to have any concern
for my house,

499
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,569
my grandchildren, or me.

500
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,089
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

501
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,686
as soon as things started to go wrong.

502
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,967
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

503
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,890
that our fates are joined.

504
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,770
Together we murdered a king.

505
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,329
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

506
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,647
And if I should meet with some accident here
at your broken little flesh market,

507
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,126
they'll never even find what's left of you.

508
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,725
So...

509
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,050
Do you deny a part in all this?

510
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,291
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

511
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,081
I dared not refuse her.

512
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,010
And what did she want?

513
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,726
A piece of information she knew that I had.

514
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,204
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

515
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,645
But I have other information

516
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,925
of which she is unaware.

517
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,284
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

518
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,806
I have a gift for you.

519
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,771
What kind Of gift?

520
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,770
The same kind I gave Cersei.

521
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,005
A handsome young man.

522
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,723
Many worthy fighters have died
trying to make it to the great games.

523
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,410
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

524
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,404
it will represent a significant rise
in your station.

525
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,645
But if you do happen to triumph here,

526
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,964
you will fight at the Great Pit of
Daznak itself, in front of the queen.

527
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,926
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled upon you today.

528
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,765
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

529
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,328
You and you. You.

530
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,521
You two.

531
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,325
You, you, and you.

532
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,806
Up.

533
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,650
- Valar Morghulis.
- Valar Dohaeris.

534
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,960
Prepare yourselves.

535
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,201
Sitting through the great games
will be bad enough.

536
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,170
For generations,
in the days leading up to the great games,

537
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,648
it has been customary for our ruler
to make the rounds of the lower pits

538
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,041
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

539
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,520
Move yourselves.

540
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,605
Your Grace.

541
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,360
Your future Grace.

542
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,205
You honor us all.

543
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,487
Stand there.

544
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,842
Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.

545
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,489
We fight and die for your glory,

546
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,245
O glorious queen.

547
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,001
We fight and die for your glory,
O glorious queen.

548
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,005
Fight!

549
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,007
I think I've seen enough.

550
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,163
Your Grace, it is a tradition

551
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,164
for the queen to stay
until the victor has emerged.

552
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,044
I've sacrificed more than enough
for your traditions.

553
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,601
What are you doing?

554
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,929
Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth.

555
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,005
Get him out of my sight.

556
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,323
Khaleesi, please.

557
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,687
I just need a moment of your time.

558
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,565
I brought you a gift.

559
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,561
It's true.

560
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,966
He has.

561
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,806
Who are you?

562
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,845
I am the gift.

563
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,084
It's a pleasure to meet you.

564
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,610
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

565
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,045
This is horrible.

566
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,685
Unacceptable.

567
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,763
Are they feeding you enough at least?

568
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,931
I brought you this.

569
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,521
Venison.

570
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,611
It's quite good.

571
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,810
I had it myself for supper only last night.

572
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,162
We did everything we could
from the moment they took your brother.

573
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,562
Tommen even went to the sept himself
to confront the High Sparrow.

574
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,411
But I fear the Faith has left reason behind.

575
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,448
I know you did this.

576
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,531
We are making every effort on your behalf.

577
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,721
I swear to you by all the seven gods.

578
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,280
Lies come easily to you.

579
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,486
Everyone knows that.

580
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,604
But innocence,

581
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,648
decency, concern,

582
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,648
you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.

583
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,564
Perhaps that's why your son was
so eager to cast you aside for me.

584
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,326
You're upset.

585
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,684
You're not thinking clearly.

586
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,527
I'll visit again when you've had a chance
to calm down.

587
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,603
I don't want to see you again.

588
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,967
I do hope you change your mind about that.

589
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,161
I've been told men often go mad
in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.

590
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,449
Though I suppose your isolation will end
when your trial begins.

591
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,881
Leave.

592
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,806
Yes.

593
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,848
I'm afraid I must.
My son needs me now more than ever.

594
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,483
Get out, you hateful bitch!

595
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,166
Sleep well, sister.

596
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,641
Thank you, Boake.

597
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,610
- You saw her?
- Yes.

598
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,287
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

599
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,566
What happens to her now?

600
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,447
Well, she and her brother are both being held
under fair suspicion.

601
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,451
A trial will be held for each of them
to determine if they're guilty of any acts

602
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,241
that might constitute
a violation of the tenets of the faith.

603
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,090
Who will stand judge?

604
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,370
Seven septons, as it was in all trials
before the Targaryens.

605
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,921
Will you be one of them?

606
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,965
I will.

607
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,363
If one or both of them were to
confess before the trial...

608
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,204
Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.

609
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,448
And what does the Mother's mercy entail?

610
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,408
It depends upon the situation.

611
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,730
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

612
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,643
Thank you, High Septon,

613
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,160
for bringing them
whatever justice they deserve

614
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,845
in the eyes of the Seven.

615
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,245
Did you know this chapel is
one of the oldest structures

616
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,446
in King's Landing?

617
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,044
I think I may have heard at one point.

618
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,768
Baelor built his sept around it.

619
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,240
But men worshipped here long before him.

620
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,090
Who carved this altar?

621
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,008
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

622
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,811
No one does.

623
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,002
There's no name on it,
or anywhere else in the chapel.

624
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,402
No, the people who built this place

625
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,367
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them,

626
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,885
the way Baelor did
with that great gilded monstrosity up there.

627
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,961
Hmm.

628
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,170
Their faith was clean.

629
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,525
Strip away the gold and the ornaments,

630
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,567
knock down the statues and the pillars,

631
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,165
and this is what remains.

632
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,603
Something simple,

633
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,602
solid, and true.

634
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,483
The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.

635
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,042
Their lies knocked down.
Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.

636
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,809
And so it will be for all of us.

637
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,842
High and low alike.

638
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,925
What will We find

639
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,247
when we strip away your finery?

640
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,491
A young man came to us not long ago,

641
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,683
broken in body and spirit.

642
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,402
He had so much to strip away.

643
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,244
So much weighing him down.

644
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,283
But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.

645
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,290
Let go of vanity,

646
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,002
pride, sin.

647
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,689
Now his soul is so light,

648
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,649
he will float through
the seven heavens like a bird.

649
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,041
Hmm.

650
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,927
And he has much to say about you.

651
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,921
Move.

652
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,527
Let me go immediately.

653
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,322
You will order her to let me go.

654
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,286
I am the queen!

655
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,044
Have you lost your mind?

656
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,481
Let me go!

657
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,001
...your filthy hands off me!
Are you out of your mind?

658
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,406
I am the queen! Let me go!

659
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,365
Look at me.

660
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,565
Look at my face.

661
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,205
It's the last thing you'll
see before you die.

662
