1
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:22,540
<i>- Miss Welbeck.
- Yes, Mr. Mockridge?</i>

2
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,500
<i>Has Edward Nygma come in yet?</i>

3
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>I don't think so.</i>

4
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,338
<i>Good. If you need me,
I'll be down on the eighth floor.</i>

5
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,012
What's going on here?

6
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:26,687
Where's my office?
My door was right here.

7
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,147
"Was" is right.

8
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,569
What's the meaning of this?

9
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,253
What does it look like,
Eddie?

10
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,618
You're out of here. You're history.
You're fired. <i>Comprende?</i>

11
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:43,579
Have you lost what passes for your mind?

12
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,873
You can't afford
to do without me, Mockridge.

13
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:48,376
I can if you're gonna
sue me for royalties.

14
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,587
I created
the <i>Riddle of the Minotaur</i> game.

15
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,256
This company is making millions
from my genius.

16
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:58,135
Competitron Software's success
didn't come from the product, Nygma.

17
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,137
Competitron has a corporate attitude.

18
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,307
Its strength is in the boardroom,
the deal, the contract.

19
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,686
Specifically the work-for-hire contract
you signed.

20
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:13,901
You are a fool, Mockridge,
to think you can get away with this.

21
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:18,072
Your amoral greed is no match
for an intellect like mine.

22
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,741
Oh, yeah? Then tell me something, Eddie.

23
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,953
If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?

24
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,083
So I've made sure that Competitron

25
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,836
owns all rights to
<i>Riddle of the Minotaur</i> free and clear.

26
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,005
Considering all the licensing
and merchandising,

27
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,175
well heck, we just built a <i>Minotaur</i>
amusement park outside this city.

28
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,761
And if we'd had to pay royalties
on all that to the creator...

29
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,513
You can stop pitching, Mockridge.

30
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:45,516
I want this deal
so I can move Competitron to Gotham.

31
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,269
This city desperately needs
the jobs it'll create.

32
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,692
What's he trying to...

33
00:03:56,694 --> 00:04:02,783
What did you say?
Mockridge, are you okay? Mockridge!

34
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,292
We'll have to wrap this up later, guys.
Something's come up.

35
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,087
Excuse me.

36
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:21,886
Well, whatever that meant,
it sure rattled his cage.

37
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:28,142
"Why do multi-million dollar
deals break down in the wasteland?"

38
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,154
It has to have a double meaning.

39
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:43,407
Master Dick,
that must be quite a computer game

40
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,993
to be worth tying up
a $50 million computer.

41
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:50,331
Not a game, Alfred, the game.
<i>Riddle of the Minotaur.</i>

42
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:51,916
It's really cool, look.

43
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,627
Not only do you have to avoid
all these traps,

44
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,715
but you've gotta solve
all these riddles.

45
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,389
Well, a straight line. What else?

46
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,187
Begging your pardon, young sir,

47
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,566
but mightn't the answer on a globe
be a curved line?

48
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,612
Wasteland, wasteland.

49
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:29,954
- My word.
- Oh, that. That's the Hand of Fate.

50
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:31,664
When you make a mistake, it picks you up

51
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,415
and takes you
to another part of the maze.

52
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:38,546
Doesn't Mockridge own a club downtown
called The Wasteland?

53
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,049
The Wasteland!

54
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:43,133
Right.

55
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,220
- The Wasteland.
- I mean in the game.

56
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:47,596
It's a dead end, see?

57
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,390
Come on.

58
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:51,767
Daniel Mockridge is walking into a trap.

59
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,035
Nygma?

60
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,081
Nygma.

61
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:17,585
Decode that message
all by yourself, Mockridge,

62
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,503
or did you have help?

63
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,673
You're trespassing, Nygma. Get out.

64
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,008
You can't kill this deal.

65
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,175
I'm selling out to Wayne,

66
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,094
and there's nothing you can do
to stop me.

67
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,930
Of course there isn't.
You don't understand.

68
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,224
I have a proposition for you.

69
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,226
You've come up with a new game?

70
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,939
This? No, this puzzle is far more
than any mere game.

71
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,651
Wouldn't you agree?
Or do you need to try it yourself?

72
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,487
Solve it. Then we'll talk.

73
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,698
Oh, for crying out loud.

74
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:01,921
What is this,
some kind of extortion scheme?

75
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,340
You think I want money?

76
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:08,969
Not anymore. What I want now is you.

77
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,899
Empty.

78
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,865
Well, well.
"Bat" something-or-other, isn't it?

79
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,617
Who invited you?

80
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,704
You know what happens to gatecrashers?

81
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,667
They have to match wits with...

82
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,710
The Riddler.

83
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,220
The Riddler?

84
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,557
What is that, Nygma,
some kind of joke on your name?

85
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,684
Nygma?

86
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,229
My, my. Can we actually have a brain

87
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,481
beneath that pointy cowl of ours?

88
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:06,360
So tell me, have you brawn to match?

89
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,594
I love that trick,
but I can never make it work.

90
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,821
Let's consider you
handled for now, shall we?

91
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,540
Coming through!

92
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,429
Well done, Batman.

93
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,517
But have you wits enough to save
two people at the same time?

94
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,899
It's my own variation
on the Chinese finger puzzle.

95
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,169
Batman, you gotta help me.

96
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,945
I can pay you, Batman!

97
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:14,321
Anything you want!

98
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,157
Batman!

99
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:31,255
Hey, it's getting hot in here.

100
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,298
Get me out of this thing!

101
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:37,678
What did you mean, a joke on his name?

102
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,221
You know who he is?

103
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,306
I figured the creator
of the <i>Minotaur</i> game

104
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,059
was behind this
the minute I saw that billboard.

105
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,895
I read all about him
in the company records I examined.

106
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,150
His name's Nygma, Edward Nygma.

107
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,694
I get it. E. Nygma.

108
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:56,697
Meaning a puzzle or riddle. An enigma.

109
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,866
At least we know who we're looking for.

110
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,035
Hey, Bruce, look.

111
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,723
The lights.
Why are they all flashing?

112
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,308
It's Morse code.

113
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,744
That should get their attention.

114
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:49,666
But why? You got the guy you wanted.

115
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:55,839
Batman knows who I am.

116
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:58,967
We'll have to put him
and his snot-nosed cohort

117
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,302
out of the way first.

118
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:02,804
Come on.

119
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:05,849
What did it say?

120
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,811
"When is the Minotaur's owner
as high as an elephant's eye?"

121
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,315
Hmm.

122
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,404
Well, Mockridge owns the Minotaur,
but what's as high as an elephant's eye?

123
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,697
Corn.

124
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,704
Corn?

125
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,707
It's from an old song lyric,
before your time.

126
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,919
So, what's he saying?
"When Mockridge is corny"?

127
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:36,129
"When Mockridge is in the corn"?

128
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,091
What's another word meaning "corn"?

129
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:43,053
- Uh... Kernel? Cob?
- Maize!

130
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,347
"When Mockridge is in the maize."

131
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,474
<i>The maze at the amusement park.</i>

132
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:48,767
<i>Exactly.</i>

133
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,775
Where's Mockridge?

134
00:12:56,858 --> 00:13:00,696
<i>In the center of the maze,
along with the Minotaur robot.</i>

135
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:06,118
<i>I've programmed it to destroy him
at exactly 4:30 a.m.</i>

136
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,915
<i>Which gives you less than 10 minutes
to run the maze and find him.</i>

137
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,210
<i>But first, throw down
your utility belts.</i>

138
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,797
<i>It'll be more interesting that way,
don't you think?</i>

139
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:21,758
<i>Now you may enter.</i>

140
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,645
<i>Oh! And by the way,</i>

141
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,940
<i>you'll have to answer
the Riddle of the Minotaur too.</i>

142
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,608
I can't wait.

143
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,611
How far did you say you got in the game?

144
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,739
I'm not sure. Maybe halfway.

145
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,490
Already I love this.

146
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,998
- Now where to?
- I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

147
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,711
Could you do it more quickly?

148
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:02,174
Oh, the Griffin. Well, that just blocks
off the way you came, that's all.

149
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:10,057
<i>Except I've added
an improvement of my own.</i>

150
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,868
"Losers ahead"?

151
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,161
Duck!

152
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,831
Loses a head.

153
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,001
I don't know what's worse,
the traps or the puns.

154
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,593
I guess this isn't
a good time to tell you.

155
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,595
Nobody's ever made it
to the center of the maze.

156
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:15,497
I'll find Mockridge if I have to tear
this place apart, Nygma.

157
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,290
<i>I doubt it.</i>

158
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,751
<i>I made sure the perils are quite lethal.</i>

159
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,838
<i>You have eight minutes, gentlemen.</i>

160
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:26,383
<i>Then Mockridge becomes
the only good corporate shark.</i>

161
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:27,801
<i>A dead one.</i>

162
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:33,140
Great.

163
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,350
You don't happen to know Arabic, do you?

164
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,520
No, but I can translate it.

165
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,193
Oh, terrific.

166
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:47,070
Let's just pick one and move!

167
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,369
We're going the wrong way!
'Cause here comes the Hand of Fate!

168
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,673
Of course! We went to the left,

169
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:09,718
but in the Arab world,
you always eat with your right hand.

170
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,348
We've gotta use one of these keys.

171
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,225
Yes, but which one?

172
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,395
And why are they labeled A, C and D?

173
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,730
Don't look at me.

174
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,398
Let's try D.

175
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,113
Look out!

176
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,034
Try another one.

177
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:35,118
Okay.

178
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,745
A this time.

179
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,330
No, wait!

180
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,875
Turn that key
and there'll be three blades.

181
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,503
- But how do you...
- It's the C key. Trust me.

182
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,639
It's a musical puzzle.

183
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:57,474
They key of D has two sharps.

184
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,100
The key of A has three.

185
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,853
But the key of C has no sharps.

186
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,288
The shortest distance
between two points on a globe.

187
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,873
That one I remember.

188
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,125
<i>One minute, Batman.</i>

189
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,379
Stay here.

190
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,214
- But that's the wrong door.
- I know.

191
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,550
- But the Hand!
- That's what I want.

192
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,822
Batman! Batman, where are you?

193
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:57,701
<i>Forget it, kid.
I handed him his walking papers.</i>

194
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,454
Get on.

195
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,876
Just one question. How?

196
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,045
I linked it to my palmtop computer.

197
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,674
<i>That is grand-scale cheating, Batman.</i>

198
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,719
<i>You're not allowed
to tamper with the Hand of Fate.</i>

199
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:18,179
I don't believe in fate.

200
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,141
<i>You probably don't believe
in minotaurs either.</i>

201
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,143
<i>But you'll still have to answer
the riddle.</i>

202
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:28,231
<i>I have billions of eyes,
yet I live in darkness.</i>

203
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,067
<i>I have millions of ears,</i>

204
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,320
<i>yet only four lobes.</i>

205
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:38,408
<i>I have no muscle,
yet I rule two hemispheres.</i>

206
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,744
<i>What am I?</i>

207
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,580
That's simple. The human brain.

208
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,752
It has billions of optic
and auditory nerves

209
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,754
four lobes and two hemispheres.

210
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:54,341
And it's the only thing
Edward Nygma respects.

211
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,218
<i>A lucky guess, that's all.</i>

212
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,512
<i>But it won't save you, Batman.</i>

213
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,097
<i>Destroy them!</i>

214
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,329
I solved your riddle, Nygma.

215
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,747
Now here's one for you.

216
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,334
How do you take out a minotaur
with a single blow?

217
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:31,336
Like this!

218
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,774
You're through, Nygma.

219
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,735
<i>Sorry, boys, but you'll never find me.</i>

220
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,029
<i>I'm not even in the amusement park.</i>

221
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:02,951
<i>And by the time you get out of the maze,
I'll be out of the city.</i>

222
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,128
I guess the mayor's happy about this.

223
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:18,133
Bringing in $5.5 million a year
in new jobs will do that.

224
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:22,178
But that creep Mockridge got to pocket
a cool 10 mil from the buyout.

225
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,055
What a burn.

226
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,559
Maybe. But we've been searching
for The Riddler for months,

227
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,602
<i>and he's still out there.</i>

228
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,622
<i>Mockridge may have his money,</i>

229
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,332
<i>but he won't be sleeping well.</i>

230
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,771
<i>How much is a good night's sleep worth?</i>

231
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:16,065
<i>Now there's a riddle for you.</i>
