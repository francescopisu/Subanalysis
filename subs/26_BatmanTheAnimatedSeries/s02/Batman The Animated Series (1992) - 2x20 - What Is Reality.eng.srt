1
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,348
Huh?
"Where does a 500-pound gorilla sleep?"

2
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,712
What is this, some kind of joke?

3
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,522
Listen, you stupid machine,
I want my money.

4
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:59,994
Hey! Stupid machine,
give me back my money.

5
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:02,538
Hey! Who's in there? Anybody in there?

6
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,503
- Sell any market.
- Fill or kill.

7
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,048
- Bid me 20,000.
- The market's on fire.

8
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,883
We're taking a bath on that one.

9
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:16,945
What's with the bell?
The market doesn't close

10
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:18,387
for another 15 minutes.

11
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,726
"What's worse than a millipede
with flat feet?"

12
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:27,271
Good Lord, we've got a computer vandal
on our hands.

13
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,983
Stop whining, Alfred.

14
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,278
If you think the ticket's a mistake,
you'll get a chance tell the whole story

15
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,821
to the clerk when we get up there.

16
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:37,782
If I live that long.

17
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,408
I'm sorry, folks,

18
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,202
you'll just have to be patient.

19
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,037
The computers are still down.

20
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,542
"How do you get five elephants
into a compact car?"

21
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,558
- There he is.
- Commissioner, look here.

22
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:07,120
Is it true about the clue?
What about the riddles?

23
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,706
- Have any new proof?
- Any truth to the riddles?

24
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,530
Commissioner, can you give me
just one answer?

25
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,860
So, what's the story on this?

26
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,530
We're doing everything we can.
No more questions.

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,407
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,123
Looks like Edward Nygma's
making a comeback.

29
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,961
Yeah, Nygma.

30
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,843
He's deleting all his files from
every police database we can access.

31
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,178
Look, he's left no trace

32
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,222
of any driver's license
or social security number.

33
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,226
No bank accounts, credit cards,
not even a birth certificate.

34
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:48,936
As if he never existed.

35
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,938
But what about the hard copies of...

36
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:53,899
Gordon here.

37
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,529
What? Someone just delivered
a crate downstairs

38
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:00,448
with question marks painted on it.

39
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:03,367
And it's ticking.

40
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:09,415
Move it, people. Gordon's orders.
We need this area cleared now.

41
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,412
Gently, gently.

42
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,372
We'll never get it open this way.

43
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:54,835
What we've got here is a variation
on the ancient Chinese puzzle box.

44
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,338
- Can you solve it?
- You kidding?

45
00:04:57,421 --> 00:05:01,759
You're looking at the guy who solved
the Baxter's box puzzle in 37 seconds.

46
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,637
Of course, this time
I don't have a sledgehammer.

47
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,226
A-ha!

48
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,164
- Some kind of threat?
- More like an invitation.

49
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,754
Careful, vigilante.
You know what they say,

50
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,006
curiosity killed the Bat.

51
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,510
These the papers you wanted,
Mr. Nygma?

52
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:49,932
Of course, they are.

53
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:53,143
Did you make certain
these are the only existing copies?

54
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,814
They'd better be.

55
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,908
Any idea what these are?

56
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,036
That's what we were hoping
you could tell us.

57
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,163
I've got other leads to follow.

58
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,958
Meantime, I want you to search
every inch of that mainframe.

59
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,628
And if you find anything unusual,
inform me immediately.

60
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:29,263
"Where does a 500-pound gorilla sleep?"

61
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,057
"What's worse than a millipede
with flat feet?"

62
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,269
And, "How do you get five elephants
into a compact car?"

63
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,813
Anywhere it wants,
a giraffe with a sore throat,

64
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,442
and two in the front seat, two in back,
and one in the trunk.

65
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:43,235
Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

66
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,906
Any schoolboy knows those.
But brainteasers are the Riddler's M.O.,

67
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,949
not corny old jokes like these.

68
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,411
Perhaps the questions are the clues,
not the answers.

69
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,623
For example, they all seem
to involve animals.

70
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,499
Also numbers.

71
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,418
A 500-pound gorilla.

72
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,879
A millipede, meaning 1,000 legs.

73
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,797
And five elephants.

74
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,925
Now, let's convert them
to Roman numerals.

75
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,969
- Look.
- D-M-V.

76
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,764
Department of Motor Vehicles.

77
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,224
But I recall you mentioning

78
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,602
he'd already
obliterated his records there,

79
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,228
so why return?

80
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,022
For the hard copy.

81
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,246
Come on, we're out of here.

82
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,899
<i>Now, well, I never was any good
at parallel parking.</i>

83
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:50,195
<i>And I'm not too clear on the laws
about pedestrian right-of-way either.</i>

84
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:13,719
<i>Now, while you're disabling
my van, you might wish to consider</i>

85
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,931
<i>the effect of the imminent collision
on the nitroglycerin inside.</i>

86
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,408
Your message sounded urgent.
Found something?

87
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,827
You bet your... I mean, yes, sir.

88
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,662
It's a virtual-reality program.

89
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,791
Instead of using a keyboard or joystick,
you put this puppy on

90
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,627
and enter a whole
computer-generated world

91
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,797
and interact with everything in it,
as if it actually existed.

92
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,006
What do you mean?

93
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,426
Just watch the screen.

94
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,726
A pixel is worth 1,000 words.

95
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,728
Care to try it, Commissioner?

96
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:20,786
Sort of like playing a computer game
from the inside, isn't it?

97
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,914
Amazing, it even feels real.

98
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,750
The military's been experimenting
with virtual reality

99
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,210
for combat simulation.

100
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:31,088
- And what's Nygma doing with it?
- Nothing now.

101
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,216
He can't access this computer,
it's not hooked up to a phone line.

102
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:37,177
- Why'd he want us to find it?
- Good question.

103
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,389
But there's no way to know
till I go through all the files.

104
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,850
Guess I should get back to work
after I grab a snack.

105
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,893
- You hungry?
- No, thanks.

106
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,078
Batman's young friend is fairly clever,
but he doesn't have all the answers.

107
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,588
<i>Ask me no questions,
I'll tell you no tales.</i>

108
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:56,757
Another riddle, Nygma?

109
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,136
<i>It all makes sense when you add it up.</i>

110
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,812
<i>Four quarters and a penny, sir?</i>

111
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:16,193
Penny, penny. Cent, red cent.

112
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:18,737
Copper, it's made of copper.

113
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,698
And "copper" is another word
for "policeman."

114
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:24,868
And "no tails" would be heads.

115
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,829
Police, head, quarters.

116
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,665
<i>Police headquarters.</i>

117
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,375
Bravo, sir.

118
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,044
It does make sense when you add it up.

119
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:38,006
And four quarters and one penny
make 101 cents.

120
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:39,508
So...

121
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,679
Police headquarters, room 101.

122
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,815
The commissioner.

123
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,290
Virtual reality?

124
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,667
<i>Quite so, Batman.</i>

125
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:17,462
<i>And everything your commissioner
is experiencing in here</i>

126
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,966
<i>seems so real to him,
it might as well be real.</i>

127
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:24,678
<i>I'd give his heart
another 15 minutes, at most.</i>

128
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,305
He can't be online.

129
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,394
I searched through every file.

130
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,146
<i>You searched the software.</i>

131
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:36,523
<i>Had you bothered
to examine the hardware,</i>

132
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:39,443
<i>you would have discovered
a cordless modem line.</i>

133
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,778
<i>I wouldn't do that, Batman.</i>

134
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,948
<i>Disconnecting Gordon would be fatal.</i>

135
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:49,411
<i>The sudden stop would be like
slamming into a brick wall at 400 mph.</i>

136
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,623
<i>No, if you wish to get
Gordon out alive, Batman,</i>

137
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,584
<i>you'll have to come in here and get him.</i>

138
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,045
Forget it.
The Riddler controls that world.

139
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,296
You wouldn't last a minute.

140
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,589
We'll use these.

141
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,716
They'll let me keep one ear in reality,

142
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,259
so stay in touch.

143
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:22,110
One door leads to a plane
where kings and queens contend.

144
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,091
Can you find it?

145
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,699
- Suggestions, partner?
- I'm working on it.

146
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,104
<i>A pity you can't earn
extra lives in this game.</i>

147
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,571
Quite an experience, being riddled
with questions, isn't it, Batman?

148
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,955
<i>Batman, don't open that door.</i>

149
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,290
"Crazy intent" means...

150
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,792
<i>"Loco motive."</i>

151
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,342
I suppose you expect me to believe
you planned that.

152
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:31,721
But you still haven't found
the right door.

153
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,224
<i>Batman, I think I figured out the clue.</i>

154
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,103
The plane where kings and queens contend
could mean a chessboard.

155
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>Is there a door marked
"checkmate" or "black and white"?</i>

156
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,360
"4096."

157
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,736
Wait a minute.

158
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,614
There are 64 squares
on a chessboard, right?

159
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,324
<i>Yeah. So?</i>

160
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,120
So, 4096 is 64 squared.

161
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,299
Only you can put the king
in check, vigilante.

162
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:21,188
Move according to the rules,
or it's the end of the day.

163
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,292
Wrong move, Batman.

164
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:57,557
I've got it.
They call you the Dark Knight, right?

165
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,726
<i>Then you have to move like a knight.</i>

166
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,064
That's it. Two up, one across,

167
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:07,275
'cause a wrong move means
"the end of the day," or...

168
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,528
"Knight fall," of course.

169
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,994
Nygma, what are you up to now?

170
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,998
And why this?

171
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:25,835
That is for me to know
and you to deduce, Dark Knight.

172
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,214
If this is a clue,

173
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,841
could it have something
to do with the Pegasus?

174
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,554
Don't look at me.
I flunked Greek mythology, remember?

175
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:37,889
His clues always have a double meaning.

176
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,684
So, if Pegasus is also
the name of a constellation...

177
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,352
Now, astronomy I do know.

178
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,145
<i>You're in Orion now.</i>

179
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,653
<i>So you wanna keep going past Taurus,</i>

180
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,863
then hang a sharp right at Andromeda.

181
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:05,917
<i>And that should put you
right in the constellation Pegasus.</i>

182
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:24,019
Welcome to Riddlerville, Batman.

183
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,856
Things are a little mixed-up here,
but I'm sure you can fix that.

184
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,192
Your commissioner is contained
within this cube.

185
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,321
Solve the puzzle, and you gain access.

186
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,448
No problemo, Batman.

187
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,034
That's a Baxter's box.
I can guide you through it...

188
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:42,829
<i>No coaching from the peanut gallery.</i>

189
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:48,209
You have one minute, Batman.
Then the clock strikes two.

190
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,171
If you can do it, so can I.

191
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,052
I should've known you'd cheat.

192
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,938
Nice try, Batman, but in my world,
you play by my rules.

193
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,566
You may control this world, Nygma,

194
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:14,569
but I still control myself.

195
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:20,617
The name is Riddler.
Edward Nygma no longer exists.

196
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,746
You might recall that he was once fired
by an ungrateful employer.

197
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,957
That was a private matter,
and should've remained one.

198
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,795
Attempted homicide is never
a private matter, Nygma.

199
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,255
But it would've been
if you hadn't interfered

200
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,049
and turned Nygma into a fugitive.

201
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,093
So I deleted Nygma,

202
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,388
just like I'm about to delete you,
Batman.

203
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,480
We can keep this up as long as you can.

204
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:53,817
Any number you can think of,
we can double.

205
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,696
Tell me, Riddler, how can you split
your focus in 32 directions

206
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:01,116
and sustain the concentration it takes
to keep your world together?

207
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:03,993
- You can't.
- No!

208
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,288
No!

209
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,354
Huh? What happened?

210
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:43,450
I can escape that easily, too.

211
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>But then, if the planet were equitable,
I'd still have my old job.</i>

212
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,586
<i>No, no, not yet. No!</i>

213
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,968
Looked like he suffered
some kind of attack.

214
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:04,804
Like a sensory overload or something.

215
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:08,266
But we'll never know for sure
because we'll never find him.

216
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:12,145
Oh, no? Come on.
I think he left us a clue.

217
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:19,569
"If the planet were equitable,
I'd still have my old job."

218
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:24,824
Of course. "If the world's fair,
I'd still have my ex-position."

219
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,659
Oh. Give me a break.

220
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:35,001
Looks like he didn't escape
his virtual reality in time.

221
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:39,047
You mean he's been trapped
inside his own program?

222
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:45,178
Could be. And how to get him out
may be a riddle no one can solve.
