1
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:23,499
Ah, Audubon. My personal favorite.

2
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,929
Sorry about the intrusion, sir,
but at least you've been ransacked

3
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,348
by a man of impeccable taste.

4
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,315
Huh?

5
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:54,572
Two days out of prison and you're
back to your old games, Penguin?

6
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,742
You again, and again and again!

7
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,295
No!

8
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,766
So today's the day, huh?

9
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,560
Planning on making a big splash?

10
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,606
No need.
They never forget the true elite.

11
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,777
Well, they got a lot to remember you by.

12
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:20,366
Ah, but this time, I'll reclaim my perch
in high society as an upstanding bird.

13
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,869
I've learned my lesson. Never again.

14
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,873
Come. The cream of society awaits.

15
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,501
A limousine is no doubt at the ready.

16
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,031
Oh, what's the matter, Penguin?

17
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,851
Maybe the cream of society
has curdled, huh?

18
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,233
You coming or not?
I got a schedule, you know.

19
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:57,111
And a lovely disposition to go with it.

20
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:05,953
Well, this is hardly the style
to which I am accustomed.

21
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,371
Glad you like it.

22
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,828
I'm slipping, Pierce.

23
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,050
Only 24 invitations this month.

24
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,887
My dear, you're practically out.

25
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,055
It's high time you threw a party.

26
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,808
And make it the biggest bash ever.

27
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,685
Yes, yes, but how?

28
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,146
I'm out of charities
until spring at least,

29
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,523
and there are
no interesting celebrities.

30
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,941
Hmm.

31
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,320
Remember when the Joker crashed
Muffy Van Alten's last affair?

32
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,822
He robbed us blind,
but hey, what a giggle.

33
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:47,495
Yeah, it was amusing.
But the Joker's yesterday's news.

34
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:49,538
Then have a peek at today's.

35
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:53,459
Ooh.

36
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:55,544
I love it!

37
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,595
I'd best prepare myself
for the welcoming throngs.

38
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,853
Well, fellow rogues,
it's great to be back.

39
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:22,530
If you're trying to surprise me,
you're doing an excellent job.

40
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:27,076
Say, who's there? Two-Face? Croc?

41
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,953
Joker, old shoe.

42
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,788
None of the above, Penguin.

43
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,419
Oh, no! Not you.

44
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,921
Get used to it.

45
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,091
Wherever you go,
I'll be right behind you.

46
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,051
Precisely where you belong.

47
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,180
But you needn't bother.
Haven't you heard? I've reformed.

48
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,183
Paid my debt to society and all that.

49
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:53,018
We'll see.

50
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,354
I just came to tell you
to keep your beak clean.

51
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,150
As long as you're here,

52
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,027
won't you stay for a cappuccino?

53
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:20,379
Just what I need, a bat in my belfry.

54
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,637
Hold on. Hold on, I'm coming. Hello.

55
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,308
Mr. Cobblepot? Veronica Vreeland here.

56
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,351
Veronica Vreeland?

57
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:36,437
The Veronica Vreeland?

58
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:41,275
Yes. And I'm sure there's
only one Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.

59
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:43,402
I've so wanted to meet you.

60
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,695
You have?

61
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:49,116
Are you free for dinner tomorrow?
7:00-ish at Angelo's?

62
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,076
<i>They do a darling calamari.</i>

63
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,457
Oh, <i>certainement,</i> my dear.
I'll see you there.

64
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,468
And get this.

65
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,596
Then I said,
"But, Warden, those aren't my pants."

66
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,519
Oh, Ozzie, you are such a rogue.

67
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,029
Ah, <i>si, signore,</i> a table for two?

68
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:29,198
Is that who I think it is?

69
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,622
Come along, Binky. We've already
been robbed once this year.

70
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,256
Such an enchanting evening.

71
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:49,843
But tell me, my dear,
what are you hatching?

72
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,512
Whatever do you mean?

73
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:56,225
There's more to our encounter
than meets my eagle eye, isn't there?

74
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,186
Why, Oswald,
how could you think such a thing?

75
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:03,565
I've always been captivated
by your... Your rapacious wit.

76
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,611
Not to mention that fine Roman nose.

77
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:16,870
Naturally. Come, let us fly, my dove.

78
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:21,458
<i>Garçon,</i> the check, if you please.

79
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:26,046
With respect, <i>signore,</i> the management
offers the meal with his compliments

80
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,923
if you will just leave.

81
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:33,303
They seem to know you quite well.
Have you eaten here before?

82
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,516
I've been known to stop by
for a quick carryout.

83
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,402
Hey, I smell money.

84
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:52,740
By the by, Ozzie, in two days,
I'm throwing a small do,

85
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:57,077
intimate almost, just 100 or so
of my dearest friends.

86
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,456
I'd be delighted.
You are inviting me, aren't you?

87
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,832
Yes!

88
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:07,379
Okay, you know the drill, fatso.
Wallet, jewels, cough them up.

89
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,675
You insolent curs.
Don't you know who I am?

90
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,928
Not with that ugly mask you're wearing.

91
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:18,640
Take him, boys.

92
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,569
<i>En garde!</i>

93
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:50,172
That's too fine a collar
for a mongrel like you.

94
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:23,789
Come on, you rotten...

95
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:37,094
I knew you couldn't stay clean
for more than one day.

96
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,180
Let him go. He didn't do anything.
It was those brutes.

97
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,850
He wasn't with them?

98
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,435
That's right, you vulgar vigilante.

99
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,814
In my day, I associated with
a much higher class of riffraff.

100
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:50,983
I'm so sorry, Ozzie.

101
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,111
As long as you weren't bruised,
my peach.

102
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:56,446
"Peach"?

103
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,576
Why don't you be a good masked man
and ride off into the night.

104
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:03,245
This time, I'll clean up after you.

105
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,377
He fenced with his umbrella?
How droll.

106
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,463
This Penguin will
absolutely make your party.

107
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,841
You know, it was
quite touching actually.

108
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,760
It's not often that a man
rushes to my rescue.

109
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,763
Unfortunately, he wants to see me again.

110
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,473
Who's that, Veronica?

111
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,799
I've heard you're running around
with a dangerous crowd.

112
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,811
Well, keep it under your hat, Brucie,

113
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,439
but, I've just snagged
the Penguin for my party.

114
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:31,523
Why?

115
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,859
For the entertainment, dodo.

116
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:38,197
Can't you just see their faces
when that stuffed capon waddles in?

117
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,532
I'd think twice if I were you.

118
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,826
Oh, lighten up, Wayne.

119
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,412
After all, he is NOKD.

120
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,123
"Not our kind, dear."

121
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:54,338
Better be careful that your little joke
doesn't come home to roost.

122
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,916
So you're the president
of Gotham First Federal.

123
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,335
I hope you've beefed up your security.

124
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:19,381
Those time locks were easy
to circumnavigate, as I recall.

125
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,592
Sir, you leave me at a loss for words.

126
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,595
I certainly left you
at a loss for funds.

127
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:31,018
Lovely dress. Prison chic?

128
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,938
Makes her look like
a gathering of Cell Block 3.

129
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,692
Say, isn't that Mayor Hill? Hey, Hammy!

130
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,278
He's beautiful.

131
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,864
Can you imagine tomorrow's papers?

132
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:47,576
There's not enough ink
to print all his faux pas.

133
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:51,455
I don't know, Pierce.
I've got a bad feeling about this.

134
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:05,510
Admiring the Vreeland jewelry,
Mr. Cobblepot?

135
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,929
Ah, Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

136
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:11,433
Actually, I was thinking of
adding this to her collection.

137
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:14,978
I'm sorry.

138
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,148
Maybe the rumors of your reform
are not exaggerated.

139
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,193
Anything's possible
when love is involved.

140
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:22,861
If you'll excuse me.

141
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,745
Oh, will you relax?

142
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,080
You've done him a favor.

143
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,581
But, Pierce...

144
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,377
You said it yourself.

145
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:41,630
That fat bird would never get invited
to a party like this,

146
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,634
not with those clothes,
that waddle, those flippers.

147
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,260
Oswald!

148
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:50,931
Did she mention my fine Roman nose?

149
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,374
- Who was that?
- What happened?

150
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,199
- What's going on?
- Good heavens.

151
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,068
Pierce?

152
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,156
He took her.

153
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,682
Well, it's been over 24 hours.

154
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,437
I assure you that every available man
is on this case, Mr. Chapman.

155
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,898
It's times like these when I wonder
why we pay you people.

156
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,900
Listen here, you simpering little twit!

157
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,069
You were foolish enough
to invite the Penguin.

158
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,404
Now it's his party.

159
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:57,956
What is it?

160
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:02,752
The ransom note.

161
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:06,089
He wants $1 million from her trust.

162
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,341
Petty cash. Easily done.

163
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:10,385
There's just one catch, Mr. Chapman.

164
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,097
- He wants you to make the drop.
- The drop?

165
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,820
Huh?

166
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,095
"Go to the corner
of Barr and Englehart."

167
00:16:58,099 --> 00:16:59,434
Look sharp, boys.

168
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:00,852
Shouldn't be long now.

169
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,200
Hello?

170
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>Boo!</i>

171
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:18,578
<i>Penguin, is that you?</i>

172
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,081
It's Pierce. I've got the money.

173
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,251
I knew I could count on your kind.

174
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,461
Right, I'll just leave it here,

175
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,505
and you can pick it up
at your convenience.

176
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,298
Not quite, my friend.

177
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,717
<i>Take exactly one step out of the booth,</i>

178
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:35,303
<i>turn left and start walking.</i>

179
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:36,846
How far?

180
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,890
You'll know when you get there.

181
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:57,993
We lost him in the sewers.

182
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:10,797
Time to disembark.
Don't forget your luggage.

183
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,427
That's right,
just follow my mellifluous chirp.

184
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,269
What's happening?

185
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,985
Pierce!

186
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,321
Oh, my Lord!

187
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,531
Help!

188
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,576
I believe you two know each other.

189
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,120
Hey, what is this?

190
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:47,125
The end of the show,
when the fat bird sings.

191
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,921
Ah!

192
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,092
Please, Oswald. If it's money you want,
I can get you more.

193
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,886
Shut up!

194
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:01,014
All I wanted from you, dearie,
was a little friendship.

195
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:05,435
That would've cost you nothing.
But now you'll pay.

196
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,771
Huh?

197
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:13,777
I believe this calls for
an acceleration of my plans.

198
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,618
It's been smashing.

199
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:23,995
Oswald, it needn't end this way.

200
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,957
I truly was growing fond of you.
We might've been friends.

201
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,211
- We still might.
- Yes, we all might.

202
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:32,837
Sorry.

203
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,881
"'Tis better to have loved and lost,"

204
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:36,257
and made a small profit,

205
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,551
"than never to have loved at all."

206
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,807
Fashionably late, I see.

207
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,318
On to Act 2.

208
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,757
Tally-ho!

209
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,182
And who says opera has to be boring?

210
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,816
- No!
- Help!

211
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,467
We'll end this on a high note.

212
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,809
Whoa!

213
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,900
No!

214
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,113
Careful. Careful.

215
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,408
Oswald,

216
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,037
I really was growing fond of you.

217
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,247
It's too bad this had to happen.

218
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,958
I suppose it's true what they say.

219
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,002
Society is to blame.

220
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,421
High society.
