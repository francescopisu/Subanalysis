1
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,157
Hand it over, Judge Vargas.

2
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,660
The doctor said a trade.

3
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:03,623
Then let's trade.

4
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,005
We had a deal.

5
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,341
Numbers.

6
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:16,886
Crunch it.

7
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,893
Twenty grand short, Snap.

8
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,898
The price just went up another 100 thou.

9
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,610
Please, I can't pay that much.

10
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,737
Nah, you'll pay.

11
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,281
You make a mistake. You always pay.

12
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,408
My sentiments exactly.

13
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,048
Judge Vargas!

14
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,301
Judge Vargas!

15
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,636
Stop!

16
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,247
Help.

17
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,905
Thank heavens she's not badly hurt.

18
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,736
But they don't know
when she'll regain consciousness.

19
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:07,163
I've known Maria Vargas for 20 years.
The best judge on the circuit.

20
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,497
It can't be blackmail.

21
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:12,835
There was something on that videotape
she didn't want anyone to see.

22
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,920
I had dinner with her a week ago.

23
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,714
She was just back from vacation.

24
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:18,674
Looked so relaxed.

25
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:24,472
<i>Commissioner, that limo's plate
is registered</i>

26
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,932
<i>to the Yucca Springs Resort corporation.</i>

27
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,685
Yucca Springs
is where Maria took her vacation.

28
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,271
Some sort of executive
relaxation program.

29
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,983
That's one of Roland Daggett's
subsidiary companies.

30
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,944
What are you going to...

31
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,208
Do I look stressed out to you?

32
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,294
You? Get outta town.

33
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,881
Exactly. I think I need a vacation.

34
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:12,353
Now that you've enrolled
in the stress management program

35
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,023
Judge Vargas took,
may I ask what your next step is, sir?

36
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,400
That's up to Dr. Hugo Strange.

37
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,529
I think he's the same doctor
Judge Vargas mentioned.

38
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,490
My first session with him
is in 15 minutes.

39
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,786
In that case, perhaps I should lay out
your evening clothes.

40
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,334
Are you sure
this will help me relax, Doc?

41
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:36,752
But of course.

42
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,130
My radiopathic monitoring device
is infallible.

43
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,758
It works by lowering your defenses.

44
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,973
What defenses might those be?

45
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,686
The defenses we create to hide the truth
from ourselves and others.

46
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:56,689
For when we do this, we create stress.

47
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,232
Is it not so?

48
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,359
Some secrets are worth keeping.

49
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:05,114
If you feel so, there must be
considerable stress in your life.

50
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,243
So, we should start
with your childhood, yes?

51
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,455
I don't have much to say
about my childhood.

52
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:18,586
Is there some past tragedy
you did not wish to acknowledge?

53
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,819
<i>Perhaps, the loss of your parents?</i>

54
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,578
Were they taken from you by violence?

55
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:56,957
What happened
to my parents is no secret.

56
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,003
But no one knows that you feel
it was your fault. Yes?

57
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,546
I was only a child.

58
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,590
There was nothing I could do.

59
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,052
But you wanted to do something.

60
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,929
You were filled with anger.

61
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,181
You desired what?

62
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:14,391
A need filled you.

63
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,227
All-consuming. All-controlling.

64
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,688
What was it, Mr. Wayne?

65
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,107
What was it?

66
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,027
I wanted...

67
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,199
Yes?

68
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,785
Revenge!

69
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:42,711
Your relaxation therapy doesn't seem to
be working too well on me, Dr. Strange.

70
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,130
The first session is ofttimes traumatic.

71
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:47,132
We will continue tomorrow, yes?

72
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,055
I'll have to think about it.
Good day, Doc.

73
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,560
And good day to you,

74
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,896
Batman.

75
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,954
<i>Boy, did you get a wrong number.</i>

76
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:19,498
<i>Leave your message
at the sound of the shriek.</i>

77
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,251
<i>No, please, don't!</i>

78
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,256
<i>I am speaking, I trust, to the Joker?</i>

79
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,676
Your number was not easy to find.

80
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,721
This is Dr. Hugo Strange.

81
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:39,518
I am arranging an auction for an item,
I believe you will find most enticing.

82
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,875
Master Bruce, Dr. Strange
has just left the grounds.

83
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,626
Good.

84
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:09,339
This is my chance
to get a closer look at his machine.

85
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,968
I've got bad feelings about it, Alfred.

86
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,869
Judge Vargas.

87
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:44,500
<i>Let us begin with your childhood.</i>

88
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,752
<i>I'd rather not, Doctor.</i>

89
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,671
<i>Hiding secrets can lead to stress.</i>

90
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:52,007
<i>What secrets are you hiding?</i>

91
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,383
<i>Let me guess.</i>

92
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,721
<i>You liked to play with matches?</i>

93
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,598
<i>- Yes?
- Yes.</i>

94
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,308
<i>I mean, no. No.</i>

95
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:05,687
<i>Playing with matches,
my parents told me it was wrong.</i>

96
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,736
<i>I didn't mean to!
It was an accident!</i>

97
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,240
<i>So, you were the one responsible</i>

98
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:20,035
<i>for the great Gotham Dock fire
30 years ago?</i>

99
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,663
<i>All this guilt
you have carried inside you.</i>

100
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,706
<i>Do you not feel better now?</i>

101
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,169
It can see thoughts.

102
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,654
Ah...

103
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,198
Sunshine. Clean air.

104
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,660
I hate it.

105
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,791
This Dr. Strange
better have a good reason

106
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,294
for dragging us out
to the middle of nowhere.

107
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:16,717
Have you no poetry
in your soul my dichotomous friend?

108
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,512
There is a certain stark beauty
to this environment.

109
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,931
It's too brown.

110
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:25,976
I prefer green, as in money.

111
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,895
You have a point.

112
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,278
Hey, what's in this one?

113
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:42,409
Why, just what the doctor ordered.

114
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:55,631
Good heavens.

115
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:57,549
Master Bruce.

116
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,218
<i>You must get out immediately.</i>

117
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,553
Almost through, Alfred.

118
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:03,305
Has Strange come back?

119
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,474
<i>It's much worse than that, sir.</i>

120
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:19,821
Hey, bucko, I'd be a little more careful
with the luggage if I were you.

121
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,573
Otherwise, you might lose your tip.

122
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,784
Not to mention your head.

123
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,578
Yes, sir, Mr. Joker, sir.

124
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:30,374
It's so hard to find good help
these days.

125
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,336
How true. How true.

126
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:42,261
The Joker, Two-Face and the Penguin
have just arrived

127
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,179
<i>with large quantities of cash.</i>

128
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,558
So, that's it. Strange isn't planning
to blackmail me.

129
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,602
He's going to auction my tape.

130
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,104
Tape, sir?

131
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,523
I'll explain later. Keep me informed.

132
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:11,290
You are Bruce Wayne's butler,
are you not?

133
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,584
- Yes.
- Most excellent.

134
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,951
Remove him.

135
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,791
It took me years to build that device.

136
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,336
But no matter.

137
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,173
You were, perhaps, looking for this?

138
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,717
Your butler told us you would be here.

139
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,512
It took a dose of sodium pentothal
to persuade him to talk.

140
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,514
He is quite loyal to you.

141
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,934
You are a valuable commodity,
Bruce Wayne.

142
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,312
Or should I say

143
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,481
"Batman"?

144
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,483
Take him away.

145
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,448
Oh, Master Bruce, I'm so sorry.

146
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,158
This is all my fault.

147
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,077
Nonsense, Alfred.

148
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:34,331
Believe it or not, this is working out
just as I planned.

149
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,792
How reassuring.

150
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,840
First, I would like to thank you
for coming all this way...

151
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,342
Get to the point!

152
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,181
Very well. I have here

153
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:56,686
incontestable proof
of Batman's secret identity.

154
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,605
Now, gentlemen,

155
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:01,274
how much am I bid?

156
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:11,827
Does Dr. Strange truly have proof
of your identity, sir?

157
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,495
I'm afraid so.

158
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,588
Five hundred thousand.

159
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:27,050
Chicken feed.
I'll bid a million.

160
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,635
Two million!

161
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:31,471
I have two million. Do I hear three?

162
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:34,516
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

163
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,561
Get out of my face, clown.

164
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:39,229
Which one?

165
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:45,735
Gentlemen, it behooves us
not to fight amongst ourselves.

166
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,488
Well put, sardine breath.

167
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,408
I think we should pool
our resources on this.

168
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:55,328
Fifity-one million,
two hundred forty thousand,

169
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,873
six hundred and eighty-five dollars

170
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,459
and

171
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,003
fifty-three cents.

172
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,089
Sold.

173
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,720
And now I give you
Batman's secret identity.

174
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,973
And after the show,
you shall meet its star.

175
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:27,194
Focus, focus! Focus!

176
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,618
It's a perfect plan.

177
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:35,994
With this machine,

178
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:39,789
I can imagine Batman to be
anyone I choose.

179
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,918
And these fools
will pay a fortune for it.

180
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,089
Wait! It's not the right tape!

181
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:52,010
Fellow miscreants, we've been had.

182
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:56,348
I'm gonna use your head
for a bowling ball, Strange.

183
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:57,557
Get him!

184
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,812
I should have known better than
to deal with the likes of you.

185
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,423
I spoke to Master Dick, sir,
as you requested.

186
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,050
Excellent, Alfred.

187
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,593
To the airport.

188
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,231
Bailing out
of the resort business, Hugo?

189
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,484
Joker, I swear, it was the wrong tape.

190
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,736
You're telling me.

191
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,408
Come on, Hugo, time to fly
the unfriendly skies.

192
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,817
Why, Hugo.

193
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:35,280
Why didn't you tell us
about your fear of flying?

194
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,867
Joker, please! I was set up!

195
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,577
Bruce Wayne is Batman!

196
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,413
That's absurd. I know Bruce Wayne.

197
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:46,666
If he's Batman, I'm the King Of England.

198
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,169
And people say I'm crazy.

199
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,343
Say, is it hot in here
or is it just me?

200
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:00,347
Harv, open that door
so we can get a breeze.

201
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,515
Good idea.

202
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,767
No!

203
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:11,941
Remember, it's not the fall,

204
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,110
it's the sudden stop!

205
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:31,503
Man, things haven't been the same
since deregulation.

206
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:05,662
What a rush.

207
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,832
Stay where you are.

208
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:16,464
You may notice, my masked friend,
that we have the guns.

209
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,764
Ah, well,

210
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:27,517
Arkham is nice this time of year.

211
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,026
Maria told me everything when
she woke up in the hospital.

212
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:38,987
The dock fire was an accident.

213
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,614
She had nothing to fear from the truth.

214
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,616
But you do, Batman.

215
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,870
Soon, the whole world will know
that you are really Bruce Wayne.

216
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:50,957
You created that tape in the theater
by imagining me saying those lies.

217
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,169
But the tape of your thoughts
is the truth.

218
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,254
I know your secret.

219
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:58,298
What secret is that?

220
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:00,592
No, it is impossible.

221
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:03,845
Strange, I knew from the start
your machine could read minds.

222
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:07,098
That's why I asked Bruce Wayne
to help me expose you.

223
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,850
And I was glad to do it.

224
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,186
Maria Vargas is a friend of mine.

225
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,065
Let's go. You'll have lots of time
to think about it in prison.

226
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,536
Not bad, huh?

227
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,539
Maybe I'll shuck this crime fighting gig
and try Hollywood.

228
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,544
Wish you weren't so tall though.

229
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:39,923
Walking in these leg extension braces
is a pain.

230
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,383
Where to now, Master Bruce?

231
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:43,843
Home, Alfred.

232
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:47,889
I've had enough vacation
to last me a long time.
