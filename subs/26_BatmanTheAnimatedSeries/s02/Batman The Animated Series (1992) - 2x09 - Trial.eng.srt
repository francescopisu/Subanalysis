1
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,373
The prisoner will stand.

2
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,752
Pamela Lillian Isley,

3
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,130
District Attorney Van Dorn has asked

4
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:32,425
that the maximum sentence of life
imprisonment be imposed upon you.

5
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,928
However, as your apprehension came
at the hands of the Batman,

6
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,014
and not a recognized agent of the law,

7
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:42,351
this court has no choice
but to return you to Arkham Asylum,

8
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,896
where it is hoped you will complete
your rehabilitation.

9
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:57,450
Hi, Red. Hi. Welcome home.

10
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:00,828
Hi, Harley.

11
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,183
Aw, things didn't go too good, huh?

12
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,518
- Nope.
- Well, cheer up.

13
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,146
Word is we're gonna throw
a little party.

14
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,815
And old Jervis here has the invitations.

15
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:39,575
<i>Not only does Batman create
these so-called super-criminals,</i>

16
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,745
<i>he takes it upon himself
to be their judge and jury</i>

17
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:44,955
<i>with no regard for the legal system.</i>

18
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:47,833
<i>It sounds like
you want to put Batman on trial.</i>

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,086
<i>Believe me, I'd like nothing better.</i>

20
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,382
- Strong words.
- It's got to stop, Jim.

21
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,384
As Gotham's new district attorney,

22
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:00,096
I can't allow your pet nut
to run loose in my city.

23
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,430
I mean it.

24
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,101
Janet, it's a war zone out there,
and Batman is our best weapon.

25
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:10,481
And I say he's a drug the city keeps
taking to avoid facing reality.

26
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:15,111
Speak of the devil.

27
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:18,823
The East Side Skulls are ready
to declare war on the other gangs.

28
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,825
Old news. My department's already

29
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,910
planning a sting to catch
the Skulls' leader.

30
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:24,245
Don't bother.

31
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,623
Very cute, mister.

32
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,317
You want to support law and order?

33
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,585
You take off that mask
and put on a uniform.

34
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:38,384
You hear me, Batman?
This is the last time!

35
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,765
The next time I see him,
it will be a whole different story.

36
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,483
Hello, Bruce.

37
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,862
Janet, I'm so glad we're able to meet
on such short notice.

38
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:02,199
It seems every place I look
there's our crusading DA

39
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,618
leading the campaign
to rid our city of Batman.

40
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,873
Oh, please. He's the last person
I want to talk about tonight.

41
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,791
Oh, sorry.

42
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,211
Still, even you have to admit
Batman's come through now and then.

43
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,589
But look at the lunatic fringe
he's created.

44
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,300
The Joker, Two-Face, Poison Ivy,
and the rest.

45
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:21,343
Batman's responsible
for every one of them.

46
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,096
Excuse me, Ms. Van Dorn,
but your office just called.

47
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,015
They said it's an emergency.

48
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,225
I'm sorry, Bruce. I won't be a minute.

49
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,063
Take your time.

50
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,409
Uh, excuse me,
have you seen Ms. Van Dorn?

51
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,995
- Not in the last half-hour, sir.
- Look.

52
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,872
Must be trouble.

53
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,227
- Look at that.
- I've never seen that before.

54
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,801
It's Van Dorn's.

55
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,512
It was dropped on the front desk
20 minutes ago.

56
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:06,305
Along with this.

57
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:11,936
"Batman, come alone to where
lives hang in the balance"

58
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,979
"or the law in Gotham dies."

59
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,409
You there! Come into the light.

60
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,204
I said...

61
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,065
Oh, no, you don't.

62
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:01,819
Ta-da!

63
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:16,500
Let me out. Do you hear me?

64
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,836
Whoever you are, let me out this second.

65
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,510
Welcome to Arkham, Van Dorn.

66
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:28,178
Two-Face.

67
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,640
Don't bother screaming for help.

68
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,018
The white coats can't hear you.

69
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,635
Matter of fact,
they can't do much of anything,

70
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,691
thanks to the Mad Hatter.

71
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:45,446
You're going to escape?

72
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:47,114
Eventually.

73
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,701
We've got some legal business
to settle first.

74
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:54,914
- What do you mean?
- I'm talking about a trial.

75
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,291
Me, the prosecutor.

76
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,335
You, the defense.

77
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,337
And your client...

78
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,258
Is Batman.

79
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,144
This is insane. Me defending you?

80
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,730
As far as I'm concerned,
you belong in here with them.

81
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,441
Whatever.

82
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,111
You've gotta go through with it.
It's their game and their rules.

83
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,822
Let's go. Move it.

84
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,449
Indeed.

85
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:32,743
Can't keep the judge waiting.

86
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,455
You've said it yourself, lady.

87
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,083
Batman made every one of us.

88
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:43,796
So, we're placing him before the bar
to face our justice.

89
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:45,130
And me?

90
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,383
Basic 50/50 option.

91
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,636
You get him off. You both go free.

92
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,805
He goes down,

93
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,182
you take the fall with him.

94
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,226
Amusing idea, what?

95
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,020
Kidnapping you to be Batman's attorney?

96
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:03,691
Personally, I suggested a quick slug
between the eyes.

97
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,317
But I lost the coin toss.

98
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:34,138
I borrowed your belt, Bats,
but it doesn't do a thing for me.

99
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,890
Sit down.

100
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:47,109
Oyez. Oyez.

101
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:53,073
He says, "Oyez," dirt bags! Dummy up.

102
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:54,533
Sheesh!

103
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:56,285
I gotta do everything for you.

104
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,662
Court is now in session.

105
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,206
The good people of Arkham Asylum

106
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,586
versus the self-righteous vigilante
called Batman.

107
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,047
Our prosecutor is ready.

108
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,634
Likewise, our fair and impartial jury.

109
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,428
- Hang him.
- Shoot him.

110
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,055
Hit him with a rock.

111
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:22,061
And now all rise for the most honorable,
most benevolent, most merciful

112
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,188
Judge Joker.

113
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,903
Guilty!

114
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,990
I was promised a chance
to defend my client.

115
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,909
Oh, very well.

116
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,994
Like it'll make a difference.

117
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,915
Mr. Prosecutor,
make your opening statement.

118
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:49,963
Look at us.

119
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,800
We're all freaks and monsters.

120
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,968
And who made us this way?

121
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,054
Batman.

122
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,363
Go on, lady. Defend him if you can.

123
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,073
Call the first witness.

124
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,700
Yo, Hat. On the stand.

125
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,418
Proceed, counselor.

126
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:35,050
I suppose you, like your friends,

127
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,636
claim that Batman
drove you to be a criminal?

128
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,929
He did.

129
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:41,974
And yet, as I recall your case,

130
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:45,686
you brainwashed and kidnapped
a woman who rejected you.

131
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,312
Batman forced me to do it.

132
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,566
He was going to take her away from me.
I had no choice.

133
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,111
You could have respected her wishes
and left her alone.

134
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:55,737
I'd have killed her first!

135
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:57,739
Ooh.

136
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,388
I'd like that last statement
stricken from the record, please.

137
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,163
Record? Is someone supposed
to be writing this down?

138
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,125
This is crazy.

139
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,211
That's beside the point.
Just keep it going.

140
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,762
Looks like Batman's hunch was wrong.
There's no sign of him or Ms. Van Dorn.

141
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,598
But he was here, all right.

142
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,350
I object to this witness.

143
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,853
She's obviously trying
to influence the judge.

144
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,067
- What makes you say that?
- Never mind.

145
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,611
Do you have a statement?

146
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,323
I just wanna say,
if there was no Batman,

147
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:40,991
there'd be no Joker.

148
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:44,077
And I'd never have met my pudding.

149
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:46,997
Thank you, Batman.

150
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,292
Sad, isn't it?

151
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,128
Harleen Quinzel was a doctor
here at Arkham

152
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,255
until the Joker twisted her mind.

153
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,342
Ha! You're just jealous
because you don't have a fella

154
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:02,888
who's as loving and loyal to you
as my pudding is to me.

155
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:07,392
Uh-huh.

156
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,479
And I suppose it was
that same loyalty I saw

157
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:13,232
the last time you escaped,
and pudding here...

158
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,860
Finked on you
in hopes of getting time off.

159
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,365
Is that true, pudding?

160
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:25,827
"Finked" is such an ugly word.

161
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,373
You lousy scum-sucking creep!

162
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:32,251
The witness is excused.

163
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,545
Slimy rat!

164
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,386
Knock it off, lady.

165
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:47,307
I'll kick that grin off your silly face.

166
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:54,523
And so it's Batman's fault
you lead a life of crime.

167
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,567
He should have let me bump off
Harvey Dent.

168
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,946
We'd all have been better off,
wouldn't we, Harv?

169
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,448
Why, you rotten little...

170
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,825
But, Ms. Isley,

171
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,411
isn't the real motivation
for your crimes

172
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:08,954
your obsession with plants?

173
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,831
That you prefer them to people?

174
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:14,918
I love plants, honey,
but a rose is a rose.

175
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,587
Then it doesn't bother you when someone,

176
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,008
let's say the judge here,
ruthlessly plucks

177
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:26,096
a defenseless flower
from the warm green earth?

178
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:27,222
No.

179
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,100
Even knowing he's given it
his death sentence?

180
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,394
That its petals must die?

181
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,938
- Stop it.
- One by one.

182
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,523
Withering, falling.

183
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,069
One by one, until it's all gone. Honey.

184
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,744
Ms. Ivy, please.

185
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,915
You're beautiful when you're angry.

186
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,808
I used to believe Batman
was responsible for you people.

187
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:15,604
But now I see nearly everyone here
would've ended up exactly the same,

188
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,897
Batman or not.

189
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,791
Oh, the gimmicks might be different.

190
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:23,111
But you'd all be out there in some form
or another, bringing misery to Gotham.

191
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,365
The truth is you created him.

192
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,258
It's working.

193
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,205
Looks like a tracking device.

194
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,749
It's pointing north.

195
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:37,501
The Somerset District.

196
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,419
Nothing much out there except...

197
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,505
Arkham.

198
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,890
Jury, you've heard the evidence.

199
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,267
Consider your verdict.

200
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:08,365
Your Honor, in light
of Ms. Van Dorn's stirring defense,

201
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,952
we have no choice
but to find the defendant...

202
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:14,996
Not guilty.

203
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,752
Amazing.

204
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:26,967
Well done, counselor.

205
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,345
You've proven that Batman
didn't create us.

206
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,974
That we, in fact,
messed up our own rotten lives.

207
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:38,562
And as we are so rotten,
vile and depraved,

208
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:41,982
we're going to waste you anyway.

209
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,290
That's all, folks.

210
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,125
Let's mambo.

211
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,617
Help us! Please!

212
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,230
Let me go.

213
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,026
Anything you say, Jannie-poo.

214
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:22,165
And now
for the final confession.

215
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,378
The big secret you've kept from us
for so many years.

216
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:29,881
Brothers and sisters,
at long last, I give you

217
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,509
the man behind the bat.

218
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,606
What?

219
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,169
- What's going on?
- He's gone.

220
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,367
Everyone, spread out.
Don't let him get away.

221
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,744
Who says I'm leaving?

222
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,083
What's going on?

223
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,585
Get the light.

224
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,925
Nobody panic.

225
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,266
Okay, start panicking.

226
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,355
The only way out is through me.

227
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,823
Hold on. You'll hit Croc.

228
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:38,366
What's your point?

229
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:59,137
Watch where
you're shooting, clown.

230
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,479
I'm hit, boys!

231
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,848
Hold it.

232
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,767
Nobody move.

233
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:36,067
Yoo-hoo! Look alive, Batman.

234
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:39,946
Here comes the judge.

235
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,166
Old Hanging Judge Joker, that's me.

236
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,453
I see now there's a need
for the things you do.

237
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:33,458
But I'm still going to work toward
a city that doesn't need Batman.

238
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,043
Me too.
