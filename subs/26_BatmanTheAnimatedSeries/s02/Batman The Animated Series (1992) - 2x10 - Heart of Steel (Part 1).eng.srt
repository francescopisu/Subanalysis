1
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,102
Miss, can I help you?

2
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,491
I think it belongs
to that woman who came in early.

3
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,577
Maybe there's a reward for finding it.

4
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,629
You wouldn't think
a lock that good would just pop.

5
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,631
No I.D. on any of this stuff.

6
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,007
Weird, huh.

7
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,342
What should we do with it?

8
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,469
Eh, we'll worry about it tomorrow.
It's late.

9
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,179
- Pizza?
- Sounds good.

10
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,391
Whoa there, Mr. Wayne. Anything wrong?

11
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,311
No, just trying to get out
before they set the night alarms.

12
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,107
No problem, sir.
I'll walk you to your car.

13
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,192
Thanks.

14
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:33,235
The alarm system makes me nervous.

15
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:23,763
Did we set it off by accident?

16
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,681
No, sir. It's from upstairs.

17
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,145
What the heck is that thing?

18
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,733
Better not take any chances.

19
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,026
Right this way, sir.

20
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:39,862
Now, for your own safety
you stay put, Mr. Wayne.

21
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:42,740
Stay put?

22
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,533
I don't think so.

23
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,465
Home.

24
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,615
Intruder rectifier. Now.

25
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,303
I do wish you wouldn't be so rough
with your toys, Master Bruce.

26
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,147
Wayne Manor. Moment, please.

27
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,816
Mr. Lucius Fox, Master Bruce.

28
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,693
Shall I out him on the speaker phone?

29
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:49,069
Thank you, Alfred.

30
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,446
Lucius, what's up?

31
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,114
Bad news, my friend.

32
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:56,452
They got away with all the prototype
protein silicon wafer chips from R&D.

33
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,037
The design specs?

34
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,122
<i>Still safe in the computer,
thank heaven.</i>

35
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:02,958
The thieves won't be able
to duplicate the chips without them.

36
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,210
<i>Maybe we should discuss
tightening security</i>

37
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,545
<i>in case they come back.</i>

38
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:09,173
You're right.
10 minutes, Lucius. Thanks.

39
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,010
Protein silicon what, Master Bruce?

40
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:16,597
I's called Wetware.
The cutting edge of computer research.

41
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,141
Sounds more like a line of swimsuits.

42
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:22,561
I'm talking about AI.
Artificial intelligence.

43
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:25,773
The missing link
between computers and human thought.

44
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,275
You mean machines that think?

45
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:30,569
Yes, and with a will of their own.

46
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:33,739
They could process raw data
a million times faster than we.

47
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:35,866
It'll still be able
to make the leaps of intuition

48
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,743
that inspired our greatest minds.

49
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:41,497
Sounds as if the human race
will become quite expendable.

50
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,998
Except for butlers, of course.

51
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,666
Of course.

52
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,294
When I told the mayor
about the nature of the theft,

53
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,505
he insisted I oversee the investigation.

54
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,674
Question is, where could
the thieves hope to sell this stuff?

55
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,093
Beats me.

56
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,345
Only other group
researching AI on this coast

57
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,347
is Karl Rossum's team at Cybertron.

58
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,182
I thought Rossum was retired.

59
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:03,852
Karl went into semi-seclusion
after the loss of his daughter.

60
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,105
He taught me
everything I know about electronics.

61
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,607
But he's been
more active in business lately.

62
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,025
I'll talk to him.

63
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,360
Dad, you in here?

64
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,862
Oops, bad timing.

65
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,740
Barbara, come in. You've grown.

66
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,243
It's been, what, four years?

67
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:22,329
Home from college for a visit.
Made the dean's list.

68
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,373
And who's your little friend?

69
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,793
This is Wubby.

70
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:29,378
My best friend since 3rd grade.

71
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:33,006
Dad can't seem to pick me up at
the airport without bringing him along.

72
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,136
Yes, well, he knows
the way better than I.

73
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,764
So you go talk to Rossum
and I'll start things moving on my end.

74
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,484
Barbara forgot her bear.

75
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:37,446
Bruce Wayne. I'm so glad you called.
It's been years.

76
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,199
I heard about the theft
of those chips, my boy.

77
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,618
You need better security.

78
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,374
Just curious if anyone's
tried to sell you any Wetware.

79
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,544
Afraid not. If anyone does,
of course, you'll be the first to know.

80
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:55,547
- Cappuccino?
- Yes, thanks.

81
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,634
I was wondering
about your own AI research.

82
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,769
Uh... Thank you.

83
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,196
Nothing like a hot Cappuccino
and a foot massage.

84
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,782
Now, let me show you my pride and joy.

85
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,245
This is my greatest achievement.

86
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,497
My prototype AI.

87
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,290
This is HARDAC.

88
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,337
Who?

89
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:40,884
Holographic analytical
reciprocating digital computer.

90
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,348
HARDAC.

91
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:49,268
HARDAC. Okay.

92
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,602
And you?

93
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,939
How rude of me. Bruce,
this is Randa Duane, my assistant.

94
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:00,862
Your hand is like ice.

95
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,032
Sorry, I've been in the cold room.

96
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,702
So tell me. What does HARDAC do?

97
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:10,539
Now, Bruce, I can't tell you
all of my secrets, can I?

98
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,501
Let's just say that certain...

99
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:21,591
That certain projects
are under his control.

100
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,275
Well, since you won't tell me
what you're working on, Karl,

101
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:41,737
maybe I can charm the details
out of your lovely assistant?

102
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,822
Well, you can try.

103
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,783
Dinner? Tomorrow night at my house?

104
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,661
Love to. After 8:00 though.

105
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,288
I'm working late.

106
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,507
Good. Well, I better get going.

107
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,009
I'll walk you out.

108
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:25,280
<i>Randa, you did not bring me
the design specifics I needed.</i>

109
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,325
There wasn't time to get them
from the Wayne Enterprises' databanks.

110
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:29,993
I'll try again tomorrow night.

111
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,996
<i>Some people in high places
are becoming too curious</i>

112
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,331
<i>about this operation.</i>

113
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,249
<i>They must be dealt with.</i>

114
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,210
<i>The next duplicant is ready.</i>

115
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,673
<i>See to his placement. Tonight.</i>

116
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,967
Of course.

117
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,984
I'll get it, princess.
You keep hitting those books.

118
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,246
Yes. What is it?

119
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:18,959
What the devil?

120
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,991
Dad, you okay?

121
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,077
I'm fine.

122
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,912
Who was at the door?

123
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,002
Were you outside? Your hand is like ice.

124
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:03,170
I'm fine.

125
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,934
- Dad, are you sure you're...
- I said I'm fine.

126
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,025
As of last night, Karl Rossum

127
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,736
hadn't been approached
to receive any stolen goods.

128
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,237
But he knew what was stolen.

129
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,824
So you'll try to squeeze some info
from his assistant tonight.

130
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,702
Well, "squeeze" may not be
the best word.

131
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,875
I hope I'm not interrupting.

132
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,085
Not at all.

133
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,922
We're just installing
some new computer safeguards.

134
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,925
Well, I'll stay out of your way.

135
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,103
Shall we go?

136
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:04,314
After you.

137
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,157
Don't you like the roast, Dad?

138
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,659
It's fine.

139
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,328
That's practically
all you've said since last night.

140
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:19,538
Are you mad at me?

141
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,540
No, you're...

142
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,416
I know. I'm fine.

143
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,998
But the best one was the dishwasher
that turned into a Jacuzzi.

144
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:06,793
Yeah, Karl's a genius, all right.

145
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,837
He'd have to be to know
it was Wetware chips

146
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,380
that were stolen from my company.

147
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:12,340
Care to tell me about that, Randa?

148
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:17,220
Wayne here.

149
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:18,972
I'm on my way.

150
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:22,309
I have to go out.
Call Alfred if you need anything.

151
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,810
I'll be back soon.

152
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,321
They get the Wetware specs?

153
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,614
I don't know yet.

154
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,365
They dust the keys for prints?

155
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,200
Yeah. Nothing.

156
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,038
They got the file, all right.

157
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,624
How are these guys getting in here?

158
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,384
Don't worry. I uploaded
a decoy file here last night.

159
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,678
The real design specs file
is at my house.

160
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,640
<i>- Randa.</i>
- Yes?

161
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:04,684
<i>The information I need
was not in that file.</i>

162
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,935
<i>Search the house.</i>

163
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,147
<i>My databanks of Rossum's memories
indicate that Bruce Wayne</i>

164
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,900
<i>always kept important backups at home.</i>

165
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,276
I'll do it right now.

166
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,076
I heard your voice, Ms. Duane,
and thought Master Bruce had returned.

167
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,119
I thought you might enjoy a spot of tea.

168
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:33,505
I think it's time Ms. Duane
answered some questions.

169
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:48,937
Something wrong?

170
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,980
No answer at the house.

171
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,190
I better get back there.

172
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:53,608
See you later, Lucius.

173
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,562
HARDAC, I've definitely found something.

174
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:32,564
Bruce Wayne is Batman.

175
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:35,775
<i>Intriguing. This data
may be useful later.</i>

176
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,069
<i>There must be a central computer.</i>

177
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>It will have the data I need.</i>

178
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,449
I see it. Prepare for interface
in one minute.

179
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:52,083
<i>I will take it from here, Randa.
You come home.</i>

180
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:59,090
Alfred? Randa?

181
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:03,428
Alfred!

182
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,513
Alfred?

183
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,057
Master Bruce.

184
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,935
Alfred, what happened?
Where's Ms. Duane?

185
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,271
Forgive me, Master Bruce.

186
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:16,649
I can't imagine how would I...
I must've dozed off.

187
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,569
I assume Ms. Duane has left.

188
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,072
I assume nothing at this point.

189
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,958
Computer, scan Batcave for...

190
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:39,672
What?
