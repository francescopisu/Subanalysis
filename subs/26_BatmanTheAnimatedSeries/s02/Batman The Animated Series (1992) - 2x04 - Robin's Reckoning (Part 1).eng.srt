1
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,959
If I knew
it was gonna take this long,

2
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:26,544
I would've brought my homework.

3
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,380
You sure about this extortion ring?

4
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:32,466
- Uh-huh.
- It's been four hours.

5
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,761
- Uh-huh.
- You still think they'll show?

6
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,681
Uh-huh.

7
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,601
Lucky for me
you're such a good conversationalist.

8
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,279
There's the slime.

9
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:54,947
All right!

10
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,908
These are contract saboteurs, Robin.

11
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,703
Let's take it by the numbers,
nice and easy.

12
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,122
Yeah, time to kick some butt.

13
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:07,251
Good thing we had that little chat.

14
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,052
Okay, now I'm gonna need a charge.

15
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:19,764
- How about...
- Yahoo!

16
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,687
Oh, great.

17
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:39,492
Come on. Come on.

18
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,577
You can do it.

19
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,458
This is getting sad.

20
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,128
It's back to the gym for you.

21
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:13,961
Let them go.

22
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,172
He's all we need.

23
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,594
Now, who's behind
this little enterprise?

24
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,513
I ain't saying nothing
till I see my lawyer.

25
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,682
Suit yourself.

26
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,768
Let's go.

27
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:35,191
Wait. Wait. You gotta help me.

28
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,193
The cops wouldn't leave me.

29
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:39,111
We're not the police.

30
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,490
You want help? I want a name.

31
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,824
Who's your boss?

32
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,494
I can't. I can't say nothing.

33
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,162
He'll tear me apart.

34
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,956
Oh. Then you've got a problem.

35
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,209
Ahhh! Hey, come on.

36
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:54,710
For pity's sake!

37
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:58,547
It's Marin! Billy Marin!

38
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,174
Marin.

39
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:16,023
And where do we find Mr. Marin?

40
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,652
I don't... Look, I can't...

41
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,238
- Spill it.
- Forget it, Robin.

42
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,783
- What?
- I said forget it.

43
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,993
But this guy's ready to sing.

44
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,704
Let it go.
The police can take it from here.

45
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,540
- Go get the Batmobile.
- But...

46
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,624
Now!

47
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,379
Hey.

48
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:47,638
All right, scumbucket.

49
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:50,850
It's you, me and 30 stories.

50
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,603
You're gonna tell me
exactly what I want to know.

51
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,154
Why can't I go with you?

52
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,615
- What's the deal?
- I'm working alone tonight.

53
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,744
Come on. I don't get to do
this much since I started college.

54
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,623
If it's because I jumped
the gun back there, I'm sorry.

55
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,835
It's something I have to do alone.

56
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,088
So that's it.

57
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:24,633
No apologies, no explanation.
Just, "See you later, kid."

58
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,718
You know the rules.

59
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:29,138
- There are times when I can't explain...
- "My actions, even to you."

60
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,140
Hey, that line worked great
in sixth grade,

61
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,975
but in case you hadn't noticed...

62
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,810
We'll discuss this later.

63
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,196
Master Dick, dare I ask what's going on?

64
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,198
That's what I'd like to know.

65
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:01,754
I'll never be
like him, Alfred. Never.

66
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,842
He's a stone-cold, self-righteous...

67
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,470
Master Dick, try not to be too critical.

68
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:11,430
I'm certain whatever his reasons,

69
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:14,308
Master Bruce has your
best interests in mind.

70
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:17,019
He shuts me out, man.
Treats me like a kid.

71
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,189
I don't get it.

72
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:23,901
Everything was going great
until that Marin business came up.

73
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,448
You ever hear of a crook
named Billy Marin, Alfred?

74
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:31,742
Mmm, can't say that I have,

75
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:34,286
but I'm not one
to peruse post office walls.

76
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,705
I think Batman has.

77
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,970
Simon Dirks",

78
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:55,182
"Sid the Squid, Killa Coburn,
Punky Lesh."

79
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,976
But who is he really?

80
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,940
"Tony Zucco."

81
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:05,109
Oh! My word.

82
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:06,694
Finally.

83
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:36,515
Okay, Dick. You ready?

84
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,392
Ready, Dad.

85
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,198
That Grayson kid's a real boy wonder.

86
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:06,962
Hey.

87
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:12,885
Okay, Sitka, give it back.
Come on, you.

88
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,344
You heard me. Get out!

89
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,308
I run an honest business here.

90
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,061
I don't pay two-bit hoodlums
protection money!

91
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:24,897
Insurance, Mr. Haley.

92
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,483
You know, from accidents?

93
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,736
Can't run a business without insurance.

94
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:33,614
Get off my property
while you can still walk.

95
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,077
Hey! Hey, fine.
I've tried to be reasonable.

96
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:40,871
You don't want my services, okay.

97
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,333
But you're gonna wish
you'd listened, old man.

98
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,252
Oh, yeah,
keep my number handy.

99
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,464
You're gonna be calling Tony Zucco,
and soon.

100
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,259
Out of my way, punk.

101
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,524
Step right up.
This way to the big top extravaganza.

102
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,152
All right. Let's move it, you grubs.

103
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,655
Secure the rigging.
Show starts in one hour.

104
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:31,130
Ladies and gentlemen,
and children of all ages.

105
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,758
Welcome to the grandest show on Earth.

106
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,510
Before we begin,

107
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:41,431
let's have a hand for the benefactor
of tonight's action-packed pageant,

108
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,268
Mr. Bruce Wayne.

109
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:53,610
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

110
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:57,197
direct your attention
high above the center ring

111
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,450
for a dazzling display
of aerial artistry.

112
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,539
- Hey, that's the guy the...
- Come on, honey, we're on.

113
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:11,170
Performing death-defying stunts
without the aid of a net,

114
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:15,257
the fabulous Flying Graysons.

115
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,206
Dad!

116
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,514
It had to be that guy.

117
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,184
He threatened Mr. Haley.

118
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,354
I saw him come out of the tent.

119
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:12,356
I tried to tell my folks, but...

120
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,649
But...

121
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,234
Okay, son. Okay.

122
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,447
I want an APB
on this Zucco character now.

123
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,823
What about the boy?

124
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,908
Mr. Wayne.

125
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,662
I was in the audience,
couldn't leave after this.

126
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,580
Does he have anyone?

127
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,665
No.

128
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,208
No family.

129
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,091
Some of the circus people
want to take him in,

130
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,672
but, frankly, I'm afraid
Zucco might try to shut him up.

131
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:38,840
The boy's a material witness.

132
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,969
We'll be here tonight,
but I might have to find a safe house.

133
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,305
I may be able to help.

134
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:51,270
And remember, lad,
you'll always be a part of this family.

135
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,022
Thanks, Mr. Haley.

136
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:00,279
I know, Sitka. I'm gonna miss you, too.

137
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,181
This is it.

138
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,142
I'll get your bags.

139
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,450
I hope you find this room
to your liking.

140
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,952
It was Master Bruce's
when he was your age.

141
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,081
Look, Dick, it's not going to be easy.

142
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,751
You have to take it a day at a time.

143
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,755
But for however long it takes,
you have a home with us.

144
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,007
Thanks, Mr. Wayne.

145
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:04,384
- Bruce.
- Bruce.

146
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,805
Come, sir, I do believe Master Dick
could use some time to settle in.

147
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,333
<i>It's not right, Alfred.</i>

148
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,836
He can't take Zucco away from me.

149
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,338
I won't let him!

150
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:51,223
<i>It had to be that guy.
He threatened Mr. Haley.</i>

151
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:54,267
<i>I want an APB
on this Zucco.</i>

152
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,435
Zucco.

153
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,356
Isn't Bruce coming down to eat?

154
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm afraid not tonight, Dick.

155
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,568
I've got a late meeting.

156
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,113
Could be fruitful.

157
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,322
Mmm. Very good, sir.

158
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,576
He has a meeting every night.
Who does he see?

159
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:17,040
Um, some of the most influential people
in Gotham City.

160
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,001
Come on, seven.

161
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,170
Snake eyes.

162
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:29,845
Tough luck.
Maybe I can change the way they roll.

163
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:35,642
Hey, you're a friend
of Tony Zucco's, ain't you?

164
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:38,019
I hear he's been
feeling the heat lately.

165
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,315
Lucky five.

166
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,152
Yeah, the Z-man's been
lying low, all right.

167
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,196
They say he's got bat problems.

168
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,742
Big bat problems.

169
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:57,372
I can't help wondering
how he's keeping out of sight.

170
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,332
You do an awful lot of wondering,

171
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,043
for someone we ain't ever seen before.

172
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,628
What'd you say your name was?

173
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:05,672
Smith.

174
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:11,178
Smith. That wouldn't be
Detective Smith, would it?

175
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,804
Or maybe Sergeant?

176
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,267
Check his wallet, Al.

177
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,170
Now, about Zucco...

178
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,548
No way. I ain't no squealer.

179
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,092
You're getting nothing out of me.
You hear? Nothing.

180
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,016
Stromwell. He's with Stromwell,

181
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,477
his uncle, okay? All right?

182
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,999
Who's there?

183
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,298
Easy, Stromwell.

184
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,261
You might try knocking some time.

185
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,514
This isn't a social call.

186
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,685
I've come for your nephew, Tony Zucco.

187
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:45,021
You can't just barge in here
making demands.

188
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,275
I want him bad, Stromwell.

189
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,985
Real bad.

190
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,196
How should I know where he is?

191
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,032
I stopped looking after that loser
a long time ago.

192
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,703
If you protect him, Stromwell,

193
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:03,331
I'll be very grumpy.

194
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,043
You don't want to see me grumpy.

195
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,087
Uh, yeah. I got you.

196
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,144
Smooth, Uncle Arnie. Real smooth.

197
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:26,896
Yeah, you sure suckered
that pointy-eared freak.

198
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,191
- He won't be messing around here any...
- Jerk! Fool!

199
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,985
You and your
penny-ante extortion racket!

200
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:33,945
Look what you've brought on my house!

201
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:38,325
Hey, come on. Stop already.
We can handle the Batman.

202
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,994
No, buddy boy,
this time you've gone too far.

203
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,456
<i>You're no longer a part of this family,
you hear? You're out!</i>

204
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,253
Hey. Who's there?

205
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:54,007
It's him. He's still here.

206
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,109
Now I've got you.

207
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,195
You lousy, stinking...

208
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,042
<i>I was so close, Alfred,
I could smell his sweat.</i>

209
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:33,797
From now on, Tony Zucco
gets my undivided attention.

210
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,924
How fortunate for Zucco,

211
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,301
because there's a little boy up there

212
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,762
who's just aching
for some of that attention.

213
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,847
I'm doing this for him.

214
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,602
I'm sure revenge
can be deliciously sweet.

215
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,397
However, at the moment,
he needs a friend.

216
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,733
Isn't that what you needed, sir?

217
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,494
Hey, Dick? How you doing?

218
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,246
Fine.

219
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,331
Sorry I haven't been around.

220
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,960
I forget how big and lonely
this place can be.

221
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,420
That's okay.

222
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,587
As it turns out,

223
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,923
I may have some free time
starting tomorrow.

224
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,719
How'd you like to catch
the Gotham Knights' season opener?

225
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,929
- Box seats.
- Great.

226
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,890
I know it must be very difficult.

227
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,976
If only I could've stopped him.

228
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,603
I saw him coming out of the tent.

229
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,939
I knew he didn't belong there.

230
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,149
I know.

231
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:35,900
You keep thinking,

232
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,987
"If only I'd done something differently."

233
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,699
"If only I could've warned them."

234
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,744
But there isn't anything
you could have done.

235
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,289
There's isn't anything
either of us could have done.

236
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:52,542
Your mom and dad?

237
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,172
Does the hurt ever go away?

238
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,924
I wish I could say yes.

239
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:06,097
But it will get better in time for you.
That I promise.

240
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,267
<i>You deceived me.</i>

241
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,520
<i>You can't take this one. Zucco's mine!</i>

242
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,605
Sorry, Robin,

243
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:16,024
<i>but on this team, I call the shots.</i>

244
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:19,486
- But I've waited half my life!
<i>- Batman out.</i>

245
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,697
Oh, no. He's not going to ace me out.

246
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:25,700
Please, Master Dick,
you must do as he says.

247
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,410
Not this time, Alfred.

248
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,954
Maybe not ever again.
