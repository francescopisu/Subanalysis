1
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,015
Hey, what's with you?

2
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,577
Hi.

3
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:08,419
Come on, will you?
I ain't got all night, you know.

4
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:16,969
What the...

5
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,447
No! Stay back! Keep away from me!

6
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,750
If it's a fight you're looking for,
try starting one with me.

7
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,135
The masquerade party's over, hairy.

8
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,969
Well, Mr. John Hamner...

9
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,432
You're a very lucky fella.

10
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,445
Helen, get me...

11
00:03:58,904 --> 00:03:59,905
We need to talk.

12
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,907
I wish
you'd stop doing that.

13
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:04,869
Just tangled with a mugger
in a werewolf mask.

14
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:07,371
I tried to stop him,
and he threw a guy off a bridge.

15
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,415
Mean anything to you?

16
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,083
"A werewolf mask"?

17
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:12,877
Let's take a look.

18
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,428
Only thing that even comes close
is two Alaskan timber wolves

19
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:24,930
stolen from the city zoo last Friday.

20
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,475
The victim's name was John Hamner.

21
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,102
From his uniform,
I'd say he works for the zoo.

22
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,812
I doubt it's a coincidence.

23
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,272
I'll get Bullock on it.

24
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:38,861
Helen, get me Harvey Bullock.

25
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,280
Yeah, ASAP.

26
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,033
Hmm.

27
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:45,367
Something wrong, Batman?

28
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,412
Just had a
disturbing thought, that's all.

29
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,874
What if that guy wasn't wearing a mask?

30
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,836
Just under the wire.

31
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,965
Please, spare me the melodrama.

32
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,008
In precisely seven seconds,

33
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,803
all your fearsome growling
won't mean a blessed thing.

34
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,525
There, all better.

35
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,902
Easy. Easy.

36
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,696
It'll all be over soon,

37
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,909
- now that you've taken care of Hamner.
- No. The Batman interfered.

38
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,786
Him again?

39
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,831
Obviously, something will
have to be done about him.

40
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,334
Won't it, my friend?

41
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:25,384
<i>And here
are today's headlines.</i>

42
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,720
<i>Former Olympic champion Anthony Romulus</i>

43
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,563
<i>announced in a letter</i>
<i>in today's</i> Gotham Globe

44
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:32,349
<i>that he would double his million-dollar
pledge to a local charity</i>

45
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:35,477
<i>if Batman appears at his home
this evening to receive the check.</i>

46
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,906
Haven't seen you
around here lately, Tony.

47
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,449
Been busy, Bruce.

48
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:51,285
Trying to find a new tax shelter or two.

49
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,204
Then you're serious about that ad
in the paper, Tony?

50
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,457
Dead serious.

51
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,710
I'll give $2.5 million
to the Gotham United Fund

52
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,839
provided the Batman comes to the house
personally to pick up the check.

53
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:08,552
Why him?
Looking for someone to arm-wrestle?

54
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,555
Let's just say I've always wanted
to check out

55
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,266
Gotham's second-best athlete firsthand.

56
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,232
<i>The Alaskan
timber wolf hunts in pairs or in packs,</i>

57
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,861
<i>contrary to the way this predator
is commonly depicted</i>

58
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:27,738
<i>in wildlife adventure films.</i>

59
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,119
Thinking of acquiring a new pet,
Master Bruce?

60
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,290
No, Alfred. Just searching
for some connection

61
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,669
between Hamner, those stolen wolves,
and that hairy weirdo.

62
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,380
The hairs check out
as genuine wolf hair.

63
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:48,425
But it could mean only that shaggy
was wearing an extremely fancy mask.

64
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,804
I've come at this problem
from a dozen directions.

65
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,515
But they all lead to the same dead end.

66
00:07:55,224 --> 00:08:00,062
Well, then, might I suggest, sir,
that it's time to get a new map.

67
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,482
Or time to stop spinning
my wheels, at least.

68
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,234
I have other business tonight.

69
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,911
Hmm! You're welcome.

70
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,674
Batman.

71
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:31,802
I hear you have something
for me, Mr. Romulus.

72
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,430
I've been expecting you.

73
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,224
Please, make yourself comfortable.

74
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,604
I'll write you a check.

75
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:48,610
- Would you care for something to drink?
- No, thank you.

76
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,280
Can we just get on with it?

77
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,835
Is it getting hot in here?

78
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:06,628
"Hot"?

79
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,922
Why, no, I don't believe so.

80
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,175
It is hot.

81
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,553
And there's something wrong
with the air in here.

82
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:16,805
It's... Of course.

83
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,640
Gas.

84
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,893
Don't know

85
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,936
what you're trying to pull,

86
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,647
but you're not going to...

87
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:31,445
I'm sorry, Batman.

88
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:35,032
But you really should've taken
the doctored drink.

89
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,754
Sounds like there's quite
a nasty storm brewing, my friend.

90
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,297
I hope so, Milo.

91
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,550
The rain will make me feel cleaner
after what we just did.

92
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,470
And I hope
he awakens before moonrise.

93
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,311
I want him to see the end coming.

94
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,939
An end you expect me to deliver.

95
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,359
Milo, you're a worse animal
than anything I turn into.

96
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,946
But I'm the animal who holds
the key to your salvation.

97
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:18,951
Don't ever forget that.

98
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,332
Now, why don't I pour you
a cup of tea, Anthony?

99
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:28,127
- You'll feel better.
- In a pig's eye, Milo.

100
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,796
There's only one thing I want from you.

101
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,048
The antidote? Certainly.

102
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,509
When you've earned it.

103
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,386
As if I haven't suffered enough?

104
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,432
You know what they say, Anthony.

105
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:45,269
No pain, no gain.

106
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,980
But you know that far better than I.

107
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:52,734
<i>What with all that training you
did to compete in the Autumn Games.</i>

108
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,864
<i>But that wasn't good enough
for you, was it?</i>

109
00:10:57,364 --> 00:11:01,243
<i>No. You wanted something
that would guarantee a gold medal.</i>

110
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,786
<i>And I gave it to you.</i>

111
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,164
Steroids, Mr. Romulus?

112
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,666
No, too easily detectable.

113
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,626
But there is this.

114
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,005
A special steroid derivative
I've been working on.

115
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:15,757
Undetectable and unbeatable.

116
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:17,342
One thing you should know.

117
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:21,930
This serum contains both steroids
and timber wolf estrogen.

118
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,517
All designed to heighten one's
physical attributes to their utmost.

119
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:28,353
Unfortunately,
it still requires testing.

120
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,521
Hey.

121
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,151
Too late, Professor.

122
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,486
The power is mine now.

123
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:42,701
Then all that remains
is to discuss my fee.

124
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,751
<i>And you got your money's worth,
didn't you, my friend?</i>

125
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,151
<i>Oh, yes, your money's worth and more.</i>

126
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,404
<i>Using your newfound fame
to earn a fortune.</i>

127
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,532
<i>Public appearances.</i>

128
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,534
Commercial endorsements.

129
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,248
And that only made your terrible
selfishness all the more reprehensible.

130
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,500
Why should I give you a dime?

131
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,586
It was my own sweat
that got me this far, Milo.

132
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,716
And I intend to go
the rest of the way alone.

133
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:43,971
<i>Now, there was a decision
you've lived to regret, wasn't it?</i>

134
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,403
The effects can't be reversed.

135
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,572
- What?
- I said "reversed," Anthony.

136
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:05,158
I can't reverse the process.

137
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,952
But I can complete it.

138
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:11,081
What you're suffering from, my friend,
is an early stage of lycanthropy.

139
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,334
More commonly known as "werewolf ism."

140
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,545
For that, I have no treatment.

141
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,757
However, advanced werewolf ism
can be cured.

142
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:35,439
What did you do to me?

143
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,442
The pain! The pain!

144
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,820
And if you ever wish it
to go away, Anthony,

145
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:46,158
from this moment forward,
you will do precisely what I tell you.

146
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:51,455
I won't let you trick me again, Milo.

147
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:54,416
Now, give me that antidote!
Please, just a taste.

148
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,710
No, not a drop.

149
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,632
I want all the creature's savagery
unleashed on the Batman.

150
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,530
You Hamner?

151
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,577
John Hamner? Bullock, Gotham PD.

152
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,870
What do you want?

153
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,539
About them two wolves somebody boosted.

154
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,084
There was no sign
of forced entry here, you know.

155
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,629
So I'm figuring somebody must have
unlocked the cages,

156
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,506
and looked the other way.

157
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,216
I've been checking you out, Hamner.

158
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,928
Seems last week, your bank account
suddenly got bigger by a few grand.

159
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,262
So, what's the story?

160
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:53,100
I want the truth before I decide to
feed you to your furry friends here.

161
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,560
All right, all right. You got it.

162
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,272
The guy tells me to open the locks.
Next morning, the wolves are gone.

163
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,400
- What guy?
- I don't know.

164
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,319
I never saw him, he calls me.
Pays me off by courier.

165
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,238
For all I know, he could be you.

166
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:08,407
You got that wrong, pally.

167
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,742
I'm the guy taking you in.

168
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,752
You fool!

169
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,505
There's no telling
what the werewolf might do.

170
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,341
Hey, ask me if I care.

171
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,776
Now go. Your victim is waiting.

172
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,117
Go, Anth...

173
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,954
Anthony, what... What are you doing?

174
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,254
Anthony, please!

175
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,047
Let's talk about this.

176
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,174
We can...

177
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,594
No!

178
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:41,268
- Honey, did you hear that?
- It's only the wind, Norman.

179
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,110
Come on, we gotta call 911.

180
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,248
Do me a favor, shaggy.

181
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,422
Stay down!

182
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,341
Guess not.

183
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,569
I'm obviously no match for you
down here.

184
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,405
So let's take this to higher ground.

185
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,923
What's that?

186
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,718
Hold your fire till I give the word.

187
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,261
Your move, hairy.

188
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,362
There.

189
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,491
I said, no shooting.

190
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,327
Let him handle this. For now.

191
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,843
You know, my friend, I'm innocent.

192
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,137
They'll never convict me of a thing.

193
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,097
Don't bet on it.

194
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:35,734
No trace of wolfie.
We checked the shoreline for miles.

195
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,153
But in four weeks,
there's another full moon.

196
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:39,904
Then we'll know for sure.

197
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,411
Isn't it just to die for?

198
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,997
Wait till you see the gym. You'll plotz.

199
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:52,262
Oh, right. This place used to belong
to Anthony Romulus, didn't it?

200
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,128
- So why'd he wanna move?
- But he didn't.

201
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:57,922
They say he just left town one day.

202
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:01,301
The house is being sold
to pay off his creditors.

203
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,052
Any idea what happened to him?

204
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,264
No, nobody really knows.
Strange, ain't it?

205
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,350
Yeah. A guy who's got
just about everything.

206
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,727
And he gives it all up?
