1
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:43,769
Emergency vehicle.
Pull over and let him by.

2
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,558
What's going on?

3
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,491
Get the box.

4
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:43,788
That's it.

5
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,633
We're out of here.

6
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:07,186
Hey, man, did I call it or what?

7
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,272
Only two guards. No cops for miles.

8
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,317
It was, like, no sweat, right?

9
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,194
Huh?

10
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:22,952
Whoa!

11
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:24,745
The Batman!

12
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:04,785
Huh?

13
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,912
Hey! Hey, I can't see!

14
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,380
Chubb, you okay?

15
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,602
No, please! Let me go!

16
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,960
He's history. Gotta be.

17
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,171
Nobody could take that fall and live.

18
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:09,308
No more fingerprints, Doc, ever? Wow!

19
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,603
You think you iced the Batman?

20
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:15,105
Not on your best day, Jake.

21
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,650
I'd cover my back if I were you.

22
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,445
You mean there's actually somebody
you don't think you can push around?

23
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,664
To what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure, Rupert?

24
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:35,960
I brought you some more equipment,
the latest in medical technology.

25
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:40,214
After all, nothing's too good
for my brother, the crime doctor.

26
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:44,510
Oh, great. A laser,
for all that critical brain surgery

27
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:46,971
I'll be doing
on my distinguished patients.

28
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:52,726
Still, after all these years,
still such contempt.

29
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,314
Now why would I have contempt for
the man who made me what I am today?

30
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:58,941
How would I know?

31
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,277
I'm the fool who keeps giving you
everything you want,

32
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,029
even though you act
like an ungrateful punk!

33
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:08,868
What I want is to be a real doctor,
Rupert, with a respectable practice!

34
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,287
Is it my fault you lost your license?

35
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,664
I would've reported
that bullet to the police,

36
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:16,500
as I was supposed to.
But, no, you insisted.

37
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,212
You knew what I'd turned into before
you took that slug out of me, Matthew.

38
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,757
So for that, I get to spend
the rest of my life like this?

39
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,178
I had much bigger plans,
and you know it, you vulgar...

40
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,347
Don't you ever talk to me like that!

41
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:33,267
Me, who gave up everything
so you could...

42
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,979
So you could...

43
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,652
On the table with him. Stat!

44
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,373
It's just the flu, that's all.

45
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,335
Keep him in bed a few days,
and he'll be fine.

46
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,507
Excuse me.
I have another patient waiting.

47
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,265
Well, Bruce, what is it this time?

48
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:17,269
Bruce!

49
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,608
Just a minor concussion.

50
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,151
Probably from the fall.

51
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,364
Here. Take one of these
every four hours.

52
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,658
Though why I ever bother is beyond me.

53
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,743
You never follow my instructions.

54
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:35,079
Your father, God rest him,

55
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:38,248
he called you stubborn
from the day you were born.

56
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,922
Always used to say
you had a very hard head.

57
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,924
He didn't know the half of it.

58
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:49,760
Come back tomorrow night.
I'll take another look.

59
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,304
And stay in bed the whole day.

60
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,515
- Understand?
- Right.

61
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:57,768
The tumor's pressing against the aorta,

62
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:59,651
restricting the flow of blood
into your heart.

63
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,106
Normally, these things are benign
and easily removed.

64
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:03,899
But we can't do it here.

65
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,609
I said, no hospital!

66
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,113
I got enemies who'd pay a fortune
to make sure I don't come out.

67
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,365
Without the operation,
you're a goner anyway.

68
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,285
I told you, if you don't do it here,
it won't get done!

69
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,288
Forget it, Rupert. I'm in over my head.

70
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,459
There must be somebody
you could get to help you.

71
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,420
No. No, they'd
never work with me, not voluntarily.

72
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:26,797
Who is he, Matthew?

73
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,675
I'll get him for you.
I'll send the boys.

74
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,552
Matt, please!

75
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,887
Remember what I promised you.

76
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,639
About your license.

77
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:38,767
Okay.

78
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,437
But I'll go, too.
I have to face her myself.

79
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,691
<i>Her name is Thompkins.
Leslie Thompkins.</i>

80
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,878
I'm sorry, the clinic is closed.

81
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,630
- Leslie?
- Unless this is an emergency?

82
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:11,008
Oh, but it is.
Someone's in trouble.

83
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,926
An old friend of yours.

84
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,690
Get out, or so help me,

85
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,068
I'll knock your brains
across the street.

86
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:31,028
Sure you will.

87
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,952
Now that takes me back.

88
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,955
Remember when I took this?

89
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,293
Big AMA mixer. Graduation week
at the Waldorf. Remember?

90
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,295
And they booked Benny Goodman.

91
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,304
Matt?

92
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,348
Matt Thorne?

93
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:03,352
I'd heard things about you, Matt.
The word was you were still practicing,

94
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,481
without a license.
I heard other things, too.

95
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,775
Looks like most of them are true.

96
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,738
Now, about this friend in trouble.

97
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,323
It's me.

98
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,368
Because of what a certain patient
of mine will do to me

99
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:20,953
if I don't operate on him.

100
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,706
But I can't do it alone, and he won't
let me check him into County.

101
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,084
So you want me to assist?

102
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,377
Forget it.

103
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,257
Look, there will be
a lot of money in it for you.

104
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:36,301
I know what kind of money that is.
Get out!

105
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,846
I'm sorry you feel that way.

106
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,141
No!

107
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:44,184
Leave me alone.

108
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,235
You can't do this.

109
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:54,736
No!

110
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,453
- I thought he looked familiar.
- Who, sir?

111
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:07,541
The guy who pushed me off the bridge.
He's one of Rupert Thorne's men.

112
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:11,545
Take a look. It's from the surgical mask
he was wearing.

113
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,922
"Rose Commercial Laundry."

114
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:16,341
One of Thorne's legitimate businesses.

115
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,469
Rose, Thorne. Of course.

116
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,764
How clever, in a prosaic sort of way.

117
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,479
But what would Thorne want
with a surgical laser?

118
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:37,487
It's a chance at a decent life
again, Leslie. That's why.

119
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,072
And you believe him?

120
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,992
Of course. He's got
a lot of important friends.

121
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,703
Judges, politicians,
the medical society.

122
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,706
If Rupert says he can get me
my license back...

123
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,292
I meant, do you believe he will?

124
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,003
Of course. He's my brother.

125
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,345
Shall we call the police, sir?

126
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,473
Not just yet.

127
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:23,408
"My two best friends. Love, Matt."

128
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,787
My word, sir.
That's your father and Dr. Thompkins.

129
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,205
Mmm-hmm.

130
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:31,166
Forty years ago.
But I never saw this before.

131
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,587
Any idea who Matt is?

132
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,382
Yes, I believe
your father mentioned him.

133
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,595
One of their colleagues
in medical school.

134
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,068
Very close friends
they all were.

135
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:00,111
Called themselves
"The Three Musketeers," in fact.

136
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,615
"Matthew Thorne?" As in Rupert Thorne?

137
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:06,702
Two medical connections
to a Thorne in 24 hours.

138
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,412
I doubt that's a coincidence.

139
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,590
It went better than I could've hoped.
I owe everything to you, Leslie.

140
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,551
I don't know how I can repay you.

141
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,563
Leslie?

142
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,356
Leslie!

143
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:46,116
Good work, Doc.
Me and the boys will take it from here.

144
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,909
With the old lady, I mean.

145
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,954
Thank you, Tony, but I'd rather see
Dr. Thompkins home myself.

146
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,206
Sorry, Doc. You don't understand.

147
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,001
We can't let her talk
about this place, see?

148
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,670
Before he went under,
Mr. Thorne said to us,

149
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:02,299
"When it's over,
make sure you shut her up."

150
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:26,425
She's gotta go, Doc.

151
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,844
And Mr. Thorne said
not to let you interfere.

152
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,596
If you do, the deal's off.

153
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:36,768
Okay, okay. But we'll do it my way.
Quickly and without pain.

154
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,157
I'll give her an injection.

155
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,742
That's not what the boss ordered.

156
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,871
It'll be cleaner this way.
It'll look like she had a heart attack.

157
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,638
Of course. That's for me, isn't it?

158
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:57,098
My payment for services rendered?

159
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:59,809
You're no better than your brother.

160
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,564
I'm sorry, Leslie.
I don't have any choice.

161
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,412
No!

162
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,706
Oh, no!

163
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,338
Don't worry. It's just a sedative.

164
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:31,341
We've got to get you out of here.

165
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,511
Come on. This way.

166
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,680
What about your brother? Your license?

167
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:39,182
Forget it.
It's not worth someone's life.

168
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,354
Now you're talking like a doctor.

169
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,831
Chubb!

170
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,169
Jake!

171
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,892
This way.

172
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,323
You're not going anywhere!

173
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,799
They're headed for the roof!

174
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,179
Matt!

175
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:47,727
Come on.

176
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:49,229
I can't make it.

177
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,650
Hurry!

178
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,450
Don't! Please!

179
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:17,298
I can't hold on!

180
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,527
I thought I told you
to take the day off.

181
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,371
Visitor, Thorne.

182
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:57,964
Bruce Wayne, Dr. Thorne.
Thomas Wayne's son.

183
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,508
- Did you get my letter?
- Yes.

184
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,052
Thomas Wayne.

185
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:06,014
I told you I can help you
with your legal costs,

186
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,857
maybe even put in
a good word with the judge.

187
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,976
Yes, but what do you get out of it?

188
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,605
Well, there is something
you can do for me.

189
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,899
I knew it. I knew there'd be a catch.

190
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:19,027
Sorry, Mr. Wayne.
Matthew Thorne is no longer for sale.

191
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,282
- I'm not looking for any illegal favors.
- What, then?

192
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,077
Something you know.
Something only you can give me.

193
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,665
Tell me about my father.
