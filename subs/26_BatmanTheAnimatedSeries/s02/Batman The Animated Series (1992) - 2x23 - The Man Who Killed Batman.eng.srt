1
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,695
Oh, no.

2
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,131
Let me in, please.
I have to see Mr. Thorne.

3
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,975
A Sidney Debris to see you, sir.

4
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:26,854
Send him in.

5
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:34,904
Mr. Thorne, I'm so grateful
you're willing to see me on such short...

6
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:37,031
Nonsense, Sidney. Come in.

7
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,909
Join me for a demitasse?

8
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,994
No, thank you, sir.

9
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:44,830
Oh.

10
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,751
- Sorry about the leather.
- Mmm.

11
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:52,004
I hear you've made quite a name
for yourself on the streets, Sidney.

12
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,257
What is it they're calling you? Oh, yes.

13
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,510
"The Man Who Killed Batman."

14
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,805
Well, yes, no... That is, I didn't...

15
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,016
Oh, Mr. Thorne, I'm in big trouble.

16
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,477
Now, now, just relax, man.

17
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,771
And tell me what's on your mind.

18
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,484
Well, for a while now, I've been
trying to move my way up in the rackets.

19
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,655
A few nights ago, my pal Eddie G.
Told me about a big drug shipment

20
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,907
<i>he was picking up for some mob hotshot.</i>

21
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,910
<i>Sounded like an opportunity
and I wanted in.</i>

22
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,797
Whoa!

23
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,266
Hey, hey.

24
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,061
- You want to blow this whole deal?
- Sorry, Eddie.

25
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:52,648
Why did you bring along that loser?
He's useless.

26
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:54,692
Not as bait for Batman.

27
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,195
He'll be too busy kicking the crud
out of Sid to notice us.

28
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,782
Yo, Sid.
This is your big chance, bud.

29
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:05,953
You do this job right, you might even
score yourself a cool mob name.

30
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,580
Like what?

31
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:10,082
Uh... We'll call you

32
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,168
Sid the Squid.

33
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,587
Sid the Squid.

34
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,672
Yeah, yeah.

35
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,842
Now, get your keister up there
and holler if you see anything.

36
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,978
Like a hungry sea predator,

37
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,939
Sid the Squid stretched his tentacles

38
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,609
through the Gotham underworld.

39
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,820
Yeah, boy, I'm on my way.

40
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,655
Nothing's gonna stop me now.

41
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,627
That's weird, wonder where that...

42
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,514
Help!

43
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,687
The Batman.

44
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,982
Hey, this isn't what it looks like.

45
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:23,072
Looks like a drug run to me. Someone's
flooding the streets with that trash.

46
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:25,407
- I want his name.
- I don't know.

47
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,868
I'm just the lookout, honest.

48
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:31,872
Sid's taking on the Batman.

49
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,209
Little weasel's got guts.
No brains, but guts.

50
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,585
Split.

51
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,552
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It was an accident, really.

52
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,470
- You okay?
- Back off.

53
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,763
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,981
Don't let me fall, please!

55
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,788
Stop struggling. Let go!

56
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,803
- What?
- What was that?

57
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,857
I didn't mean it. He came right at me.
I was just trying to get away,

58
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,902
and he went over the side.
Boom, whoosh, fire!

59
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,486
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:47,531
No one could live through that.

61
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:53,162
You know what this means?
Sid the Squid just offed the Batman.

62
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,545
You should be happy, Sidney.

63
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,842
Through a one-in-a-million mishap,

64
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,387
you've realized the dream
of every criminal in Gotham.

65
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,681
Huh?

66
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,601
The utter demise of Batman.

67
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:19,021
You know, Mr. Thorne, my whole life

68
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,899
I've dreamed of being a big shot.

69
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,111
Sidney, Sidney, Sidney.

70
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:34,703
<i>And that night, for one minute,
all my dreams came true.</i>

71
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,001
To Sid the Squid,
the man who burned the bat.

72
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,839
Squid! Squid! Squid!

73
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,050
The toughest guy in Gotham!

74
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:02,064
Suddenly I'm thinking, if I take down
the guy who took down Batman,

75
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:06,026
then I'll be the toughest guy in town.

76
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,529
You got my vote, Chief.

77
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,116
Come on, Squid, give him what for.

78
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,177
Come on, let's get it going here.

79
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:15,619
Get up. Come on.

80
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,519
<i>It was nuts, I tell you.</i>

81
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:45,149
<i>Every creep and lowlife trying to get a
little piece of the guy who got Batman.</i>

82
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,821
<i>I was actually relieved
when the cops showed up.</i>

83
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,370
<i>Well, sort of.</i>

84
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:00,581
- You can't keep me here.
- I got rights.

85
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,166
Lousy bulls.

86
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:06,045
Simmer down, party boys.
You'll be out tomorrow morning.

87
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:11,008
Uh, Montoya, word is coming in
from the streets on a homicide victim.

88
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:13,719
- They have an ID?
- Yeah, it's, uh...

89
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:15,929
It's Batman.

90
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,141
What? How?

91
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,518
That explosion at the customs house.

92
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:25,606
They said it's the work
of some mastermind called the Squid.

93
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,408
Look, Renee, the commish
is taking it pretty hard.

94
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,203
- Could you, uh...
- Sure, sure.

95
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,211
How about it, losers?
You see anything tonight?

96
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,463
What's the word on this Squid guy, huh?

97
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,048
Oh...

98
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,884
What about you, skinny?
You got anything to say?

99
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,222
Just one minute, please.

100
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,226
I'm Harleen Quinzel,
legal counsel to Mr. Debris.

101
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,312
I've paid his bail, and he doesn't
have to answer any questions

102
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,314
until he's formally arraigned.

103
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,748
Don't I know you from someplace?

104
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:27,459
I think I served you a subpoena once.

105
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,505
It was a small subpoena.

106
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:55,404
Gee! Who would care enough
to bail me out of the jug?

107
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,489
My mom doesn't even speak to me.

108
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:00,075
And my parole officer's still in jail.

109
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,873
Wow, lady, you sure pile on the makeup.

110
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,293
My boss likes me
to wear a smile to work.

111
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:13,380
Hey, I've seen you. You work for...

112
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,799
The Joker.

113
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,014
Welcome, Sidney.

114
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,403
Please, allow me the honor
of shaking hands

115
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:39,364
with the man who did the impossible.

116
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,578
The man who killed Batman.

117
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:52,252
Whoops! Sorry, force of habit.

118
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,673
You know, there's just one thing
bothering me about your story, Sid.

119
00:11:56,798 --> 00:12:00,802
No body, no <i>batus delecti,</i> so to speak.

120
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,014
We need to pull a job tonight
just to make sure.

121
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:06,308
Make sure of what, boss?

122
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:11,688
Why, that old Batsy's
bought the cave, of course.

123
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:15,901
And one more thing, Murphy.
Don't ask stupid questions.

124
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:17,778
What?

125
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,655
Ah! Ooh!

126
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,247
I'll get the mop.

127
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:54,773
Righty-o! Harley, you loot the safe
while the boys and I set up.

128
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,234
Right away, Mr. J.

129
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:02,489
When the cops show, stall them
for a while. Nothing too fancy.

130
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:05,993
Just keep them busy
until Bats gets here. Got it?

131
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,619
Sure, boss.

132
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,709
- Any questions, Murph?
- No, sir.

133
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,252
Good man.

134
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,258
And if Batman hasn't really
gone to his final reward,

135
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,385
we'll see that he gets there.

136
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:37,190
Mmm. From pinching pennies
to rubbing elbows with the Joker.

137
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,693
- Not bad, Sidney.
- Please.

138
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:42,279
Connections like him I can do without.

139
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,283
<i>Naturally, it didn't take
the cops long to seal off the building.</i>

140
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,827
<i>Not that it mattered to Mr. Happy.</i>

141
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,249
Where is he?
He's never been this late before.

142
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,627
There's a certain rhythm
to these things.

143
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,880
I cause trouble, he shows up.

144
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,883
We have some laughs,
and the game starts all over again.

145
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:07,137
Only, now, thanks to you,

146
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:11,058
I have this terrible feeling
he's really not coming.

147
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,188
Whee! Look at all the pretties.

148
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:18,273
Put them back, Harley.

149
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,444
Oh, Mr. J., you're such a kidder.
You never could...

150
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,489
I said, put them back!

151
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:33,455
Sure, boss, I can do that. This is me
putting them back. No problemo.

152
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:39,252
Without Batman, crime has no punch line.

153
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,466
<i>A laughing gas bomb
kept the cops busy</i>

154
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:46,176
<i>while we slipped out the back.</i>

155
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,848
<i>Later, the Joker held a little memorial
at the Ace Chemical plant.</i>

156
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,772
You know what's great
about you, Puddin'?

157
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,025
You really put the "fun" in funeral.

158
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:14,871
Dear friends,
today is the day the clown cried.

159
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,296
And he cries
not for the passing of one man,

160
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,924
but for the death of a dream.

161
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,220
The dream that he would someday
taste the ultimate victory

162
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,347
over his hated enemy.

163
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:38,437
For it was the Batman who made me
the happy soul I am today.

164
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:43,358
How I agonized over the perfect way
to thank him for that.

165
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,487
Perhaps with a cyanide pie in the face.

166
00:15:55,412 --> 00:16:00,375
Or an exploding whoopee cushion,
playfully planted in the Batmobile.

167
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,634
But those dreams were dashed
by the weaselly little gunsel

168
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,553
sitting there in our midst.

169
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:17,434
The cowardly, insignificant ganef
who probably got lucky

170
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:21,980
when Batman slipped on the slime trail
this loser left behind him.

171
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,942
This mound of diseased hyena filth

172
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,988
who's not fit to lick the dirt
from my spats!

173
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:35,744
But I digress.
The time for sorrow has passed.

174
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:40,832
It's time to look ahead
to a future filled with smiles.

175
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,627
And I'll be smiling again

176
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,339
just as soon as we take that man there,

177
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,300
and slap him in that box there,

178
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:54,095
and roll it into that vat of acid there.

179
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,100
No, no! I never meant to do it!

180
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,063
Help!

181
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,567
This isn't funny anymore

182
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,546
Would it help if I said I'm sorry?

183
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:31,383
I'm really, really, really,
really, really sorry.

184
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,787
Well, that was fun. Who's for Chinese?

185
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,884
<i>I thought
I was a goner for sure.</i>

186
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,808
<i>Then, just as the acid started
to eat its way in...</i>

187
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,231
Huh?

188
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,610
<i>I was saved. The box must have
been sucked down a drain pipe</i>

189
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,612
<i>and smacked open on the bank.</i>

190
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,655
<i>I knew I had to get out of town.</i>

191
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,493
So I called Eddie G.
And begged him to set me up

192
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,996
with the big man behind the drug ring.

193
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:44,581
He sent me to you.

194
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:48,793
Please, Mr. Thorne.
You're rich and powerful.

195
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,921
I'll do anything you say
if you can get me out of Gotham.

196
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,385
So the famous Sid the Squid is nothing
but a pathetic victim of circumstance.

197
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,639
Just how stupid do you think I am?

198
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,349
Excuse me?

199
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,142
You think I didn't hear the rumors

200
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:07,937
of the third-rate stumblebum
who rubbed out the Batman?

201
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:12,317
And now you say you accidentally
made a fool of the Joker?

202
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,363
No one's that lucky or stupid.

203
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,324
- Yes, I am. Honest.
- Admit it.

204
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,827
You're trying to muscle in
on my drug racket.

205
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,081
You've been playing dumb
so you can get a shot at me.

206
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,832
No, really.

207
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,877
Sure, I'll get you
out of Gotham, Sidney.

208
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:32,337
In a pine box.

209
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,693
You?

210
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,133
That's for pulling a gun.

211
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,889
And that's for the drugs.

212
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:46,035
And that one's for any I missed.

213
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,621
Oh, am I glad to see you.

214
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,291
Wait a minute, how come you're alive?

215
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:54,002
I swung away
before the gas tank exploded.

216
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,504
But I thought since you believed
I was dead,

217
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,090
I'd tail you and see who
was calling the shots.

218
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:02,427
So you were the one
who saved me from the Joker?

219
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:04,137
That's right.

220
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:07,098
Well, glad to be of service. See you.

221
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,060
You're still an accomplice
to Thorne's gang.

222
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:15,732
Guess I can't win for losing, huh?

223
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:20,987
I don't know. In the right environment,
a man of your dangerous reputation

224
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,031
could still get a lot of respect.

225
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,415
- Here he comes.
- It's the Squid.

226
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:35,543
Toughest man in Gotham,
nearly offed the Bat.

227
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,339
Set Thorne up.
He made a fool out of the Joker, too.

228
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:43,551
- Don't mess with him, man.
- A big shot at last.
