1
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,863
Master Bruce.

2
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,198
What is it, Alfred?

3
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,159
Yoru Sensei. Line three.

4
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,287
<i>Konnichiwa</i>, sensei.

5
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,085
I should enjoy
our return to Nippon more

6
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,962
without this unfortunate business.

7
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,466
So would I, Alfred,
but <i>giri</i> cannot be denied.

8
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:23,012
Ah, yes, <i>giri</i>. Honor, duty, obligation.

9
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,016
<i>We'll reach the city of Kuruhara
in an hour, Mr. Wayne.</i>

10
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,279
Of course, I will help
in any way I can, sensei.

11
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,133
But what made you think of calling me?

12
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:47,161
You cannot hide a warrior's spirit
behind your playboy image, Wayne-san.

13
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:50,289
Kyodai Ken returned
from America in defeat.

14
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:51,791
He was beaten by Batman.

15
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,375
So it is said.

16
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:58,255
Perhaps I thought you might somehow
enlist the aid of this Batman.

17
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,383
- You know him, do you not?
- We've met.

18
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,824
Come.

19
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,910
A spot of tea
before retiring, Master Bruce?

20
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,954
I have some excellent green brew.

21
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,539
No, thanks, Alfred.

22
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,834
If I might be so bold, Master Bruce,

23
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,962
how did your meeting
with Yoru Sensei go?

24
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,257
It was not good news.

25
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,510
I believe I will have that tea, Alfred.

26
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,104
Once upon a time, Alfred,
500 years ago to be exact,

27
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,775
<i>there was a fighting master who learned</i>
<i>how to manipulate the</i> ki <i>lines,</i>

28
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,986
<i>the currents of life force.</i>

29
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,283
<i>He called the art</i> kiba-no-hoko <i>,</i>
<i>"The Way of the Fang.</i>"

30
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,496
<i>It was such an efficient
and terrible fighting art</i>

31
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,541
<i>that the master decided it was
too dangerous to teach.</i>

32
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:23,215
<i>A mere touch could render
a man unconscious, or cripple him.</i>

33
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,635
<i>There was even a touch that was fatal.</i>

34
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:37,271
<i>So the master hid the only copy of</i>
<i>the instruction scroll for</i> kiba-no-hoko

35
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,191
<i>in one of the thousand caves
on the slopes of Mount Kajiiki.</i>

36
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,986
<i>He told no one but his eldest son.</i>

37
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:52,328
<i>The location has been kept
a family secret for 500 years.</i>

38
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,664
And Yoru Sensei?

39
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,000
Is the great-great-great-grandson

40
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,252
of the man who created
that forbidden art.

41
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,882
And the only man who knows
the location of the scroll.

42
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,635
Yoru Sensei has no sons.

43
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:12,348
When he leaves this world,
the secret leaves with him.

44
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,808
And the kidnapped girl?

45
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,477
Yoru's star student.

46
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:19,438
Kyodai wants to trade her
for the knowledge of the fang.

47
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,607
To use against you, I expect.

48
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,028
Well, perhaps our cowled friend
can persuade him otherwise.

49
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:27,821
It's not that easy, Alfred.

50
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,408
He's after Batman as well.

51
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,910
But why?

52
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,038
He fought Bruce Wayne and Batman.

53
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,290
Fighting styles are like fingerprints.

54
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:43,170
Kyodai knows that we are the same man.

55
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:57,601
That was Kyodai Ken.

56
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,913
Did he give you
instructions for the exchange?

57
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,232
Yes. In the Uramachi district
after dark.

58
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,944
A bad part of town,
a place of thieves and the Yakuza.

59
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,363
A ninja would feel safe there.

60
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,616
If you give him a phony map,
he wouldn't know the difference.

61
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:14,910
True, but I would know.

62
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,330
You are familiar with
the code of Bushido, Wayne-san.

63
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:22,001
Ninja may lie and cheat. Samurai cannot.

64
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,502
<i>Hai</i>, sensei.

65
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:27,905
I'll see that the map is delivered.

66
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:52,781
Let her go, ninja.

67
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,533
You!

68
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,410
Release Kairi.

69
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,954
Throw me the map.

70
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:01,123
First she goes free.

71
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,532
I can only read
bits and pieces, sensei.

72
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,743
Not enough to understand the techniques.

73
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,664
It seems that age has destroyed
the secrets of <i>kiba-no-hoko.</i>

74
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,458
I wish it were so, Wayne-san.

75
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,585
There is a large part missing.

76
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,965
The location of, and directions
on performing the <i>o-nemuri</i> touch.

77
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:41,969
I think that Batman is in grave danger.

78
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,218
Another temblor, Master Bruce.

79
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,536
Shall I pack for our return
to Gotham City, sir?

80
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:10,205
I'm afraid not just yet, old friend.

81
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,209
I thought, that with the recovery
of the young lady

82
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,629
and the destruction of the scroll,
your chores here were finished.

83
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:21,842
Kyodai has the part of the scroll
that describes the <i>o-nemuri</i> touch.

84
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:25,262
I'm afraid my Japanese is
a bit rusty, Master Bruce.

85
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,347
It means "big sleep."

86
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,435
A better translation might be
"Eternal sleep."

87
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,437
Oh...

88
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,564
Oh, my.

89
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,611
I cannot tell you
where the fatal point lies, Wayne-san.

90
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,739
I never allowed myself
to read the scroll,

91
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:29,451
for fear I might someday be tempted
to use the forbidden knowledge.

92
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,870
It could be anywhere, then.

93
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,290
Yes, on a hand, an arm, a leg.

94
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:39,044
Even a simple defensive block
could mean doom.

95
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,947
Alfred?

96
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:10,617
Alfred?

97
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,330
No, rich man, but I have him.

98
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,377
<i>You will face me,
as yourself or your alter ego.</i>

99
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:22,712
<i>It is all the same to me.</i>

100
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:24,756
<i>Yoru will tell you where.</i>

101
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,060
A single touch.

102
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,021
That's all it will take
to destroy your master.

103
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,161
Will you fight Kyodai?

104
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,621
I believe the Batman
intends to face him.

105
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,292
Do you think this Batman will fight him?

106
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,544
Batman does as he will.

107
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,756
<i>But I'm fairly sure
he'll choose to meet the ninja.</i>

108
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,416
How do you like
our fire-breather, <i>gaijin?</i>

109
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,543
Impressive, is he not?

110
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,920
Very.

111
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,841
Once again,
you approach unseen, dark one.

112
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,344
You would have made a good ninja.

113
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:55,013
I would prefer to be a samurai.

114
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,642
But you are like me,
a warrior of the night.

115
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,397
So it would seem.

116
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:13,823
Let us face each other in the open,
man to man.

117
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,118
Samurai do not hide behind masks.

118
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,710
All right. Take your best shot.

119
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,897
Why do you back away,
night fighter?

120
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,692
Afraid of my touch?

121
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,497
This was a poor choice
for a battleground, Kyodai.

122
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,708
The volcano may claim us all.

123
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,837
It does not matter.
Ninja do not fear death.

124
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:27,981
Enough. It ends now.

125
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,698
You are strong.

126
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,577
But not strong enough.

127
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,209
<i>Sayonara</i>, Batman.

128
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:02,265
Leaving so soon, Kyodai?

129
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,229
The <i>o-nemuri</i> touch.

130
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,941
How could you withstand it?
It's impossible.

131
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:16,863
It's all over, Kyodai.
Your precious technique doesn't work.

132
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,328
Grab it. If you jump and I pull,
you can make it.

133
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,417
Kyodai, the rope!

134
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,320
I couldn't see through the smoke.
Was Kyodai...

135
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,741
I don't know, Alfred. I wish I did.

136
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,994
I saw him use the fatal touch
on you, Master Bruce.

137
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,787
Did he somehow miss?

138
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:50,957
No. I found his practice dummy.

139
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:55,170
There was a soft spot on it,
a place jabbed many times.

140
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,299
- I protected that spot on my own body.
- Most ingenious, sir.

141
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,722
I'm sorry about Kyodai, sensei.

142
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:09,017
We all choose our own paths, Wayne-san.

143
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:10,685
He walked a dark trail.

144
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,771
It was not your responsibility.

145
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,942
If you see Batman,
tell him I have great respect for him.

146
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,319
Why?

147
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:21,696
He's as much a ninja as Kyodai was.

148
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:25,366
Not so. Batman offered to
help his adversary.

149
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,454
And, a lesser man would have used
the knowledge of the <i>o-nemur</i> I touch

150
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:30,914
against his opponent.

151
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,751
Batman is the essence
of samurai, Wayne-san.

152
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:37,003
You would do well to remember that.

153
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,964
<i>Domo arigato</i>, sensei.
