1
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:27,169
Selina Kyle, you have pled guilty
to the charges brought against Catwoman.

2
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,546
And do you understand

3
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:32,717
you can be sentenced to
as much as 25 years in prison?

4
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,302
Yes, Your Honor.

5
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,764
Regardless of the fact
that you committed the crimes

6
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:42,602
to benefit animals and wildlife,
theft is theft.

7
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,103
Yes, Your Honor.

8
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:48,357
However, since you did help save
Gotham City from annihilation

9
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,444
and the district attorney
has recommended a plea bargain,

10
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:56,324
I have decided to sentence you
to five years probation.

11
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,702
Yeah.

12
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,081
I'm not finished!

13
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,377
But I'm warning you, Miss Kyle,

14
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:14,008
if you ever don your Catwoman costume
again to violate the law,

15
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:18,804
I'll not only revoke probation,
I'll throw the book at you.

16
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:20,681
I understand.

17
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,102
Miss Kyle, one question
from you and a picture.

18
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,314
I'll lose my job
if I don't get the question.

19
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:30,107
Miss Kyle, Miss Kyle.

20
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,636
Just one question.
Is Catwoman really finished?

21
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,154
And though she's been
released on probation,

22
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,323
<i>the question still remains.</i>

23
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:40,409
<i>Can this lady leopard
really change her spots?</i>

24
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,917
I do hope you'll be seeing Miss Selina
now that she's free to prowl again.

25
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,211
I don't think so.

26
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,047
But I thought
you'd grown quite fond of her.

27
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,965
I assumed the feeling was mutual.

28
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,635
Almost.

29
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:02,264
She's in love with Batman.

30
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,308
Oh, dear.

31
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,436
These modern relationships
can be so complicated.

32
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,441
Besides, I'm not totally convinced
she's given up her criminal life.

33
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,868
Oh, Maven,
I can't believe I'm really free.

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,788
Come here, Isis.

35
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,583
Where's my little precious?

36
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,382
Um, there's something
I have to tell you.

37
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:38,634
Maven, where's my cat?

38
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,095
I... I don't know.

39
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:44,306
A couple of days ago, I left
the window open, and she was gone.

40
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:46,809
I think she went looking for you.

41
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,770
I searched everywhere.

42
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,064
I'm so sorry, Selina.

43
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:58,033
<i>Temperatures have reached
record lows</i>

44
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,114
<i>as another snowstorm heads our way.</i>

45
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:03,659
<i>We advise our listeners
to keep children and pets inside.</i>

46
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,252
Isis?

47
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,885
Relax. I'm a friend.

48
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,413
Fleabags.

49
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,541
Dirty, lousy, stinking fleabags.

50
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,042
Get them, Paunch.

51
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,175
Come to mama, you disgusting furball.

52
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,096
Just what do you think you're doing?

53
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:48,848
Catching strays.

54
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,974
What's it to you?

55
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,810
You're obviously not the animal shelter.

56
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:54,854
So, what do you want with these cats?

57
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,898
None of your business. So kiss off.

58
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,066
Fine.

59
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,860
- But I'm taking my friends.
- Hey.

60
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,112
You asked for it, sister.

61
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:08,033
Now, tell me, what are you up to?

62
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,703
Paunch, do something!

63
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,591
That's one way to take out the trash.

64
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,093
Laugh this off, sister!

65
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,307
Nail her!

66
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,651
Paunch?

67
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,823
Hey, you can't do this to me!

68
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,745
Put a lid on it, sister.

69
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,294
You were supposed to
stay out of trouble.

70
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:03,923
Don't tell me you're my very own
private probation officer.

71
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:06,383
How often would you like me to check in?

72
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:18,437
I'm afraid our reunion
will have to wait.

73
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,276
All right, what's going on here?

74
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,112
She jumped us.

75
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,447
I wanna press charges.

76
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,199
They were stealing cats.

77
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,160
Stealing from who,
you dumb cluck?

78
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,620
They're strays.

79
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:36,681
We were just rounding them up
to find them good homes

80
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,916
when this maniac attacked us.

81
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,501
This is insane.

82
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,463
Sounds like we better settle this
downtown, Miss Kyle.

83
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:45,589
Downtown?

84
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,758
You have the right
to remain silent.

85
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:51,303
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

86
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,228
The speed at which the toxin
overtakes the animal's system

87
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:01,063
is something to behold, Mr. Daggett.

88
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:03,691
Even with a species this large.

89
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,069
There.

90
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,488
You can see the change almost instantly.

91
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,107
Careful, sir.

92
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,661
One little nip, and the toxin
will spread through you

93
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:17,424
with the same virulence.

94
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,667
Good, Milo.

95
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,919
Remember, speed is of the essence.

96
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:28,799
I expect this operation to be completed
by tomorrow night.

97
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,305
Sorry, kitten.

98
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,519
But you heard the man.

99
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:01,331
Maven, how on Earth did you
raise my bail at this hour?

100
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,381
I see.

101
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,510
Your bail money is safe.
I promise.

102
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,554
That's not important, Selina.

103
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:16,638
You are.

104
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,643
Bruce, I like you a lot.

105
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,437
But as a friend.

106
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:25,439
I understand.

107
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:29,818
Then, as a friend, may I point out
this arrest could revoke your probation?

108
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,112
I'll worry about that
after I find my cat.

109
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,990
What I wanna know is
what those creeps I met in the alley

110
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,618
are doing with a big-time attorney
from Daggett Labs.

111
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,164
I spend a night in jail, and he has them
back on the street in less than an hour.

112
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,501
Roland Daggett
is a dangerous man, Selina.

113
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,960
I'd be very careful.

114
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,587
Don't worry.

115
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:52,633
<i>You won't see Selina Kyle
anywhere near Daggett Labs.</i>

116
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,154
Our sources tell us that
Daggett's pharmaceuticals arm

117
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,323
is coming out with a hot new drug.

118
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:18,659
What kind?

119
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,661
Some sort of antitoxin.

120
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:24,164
All we really know is Daggett's
had his best people on it for months.

121
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,250
Why the sudden interest?

122
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,914
Think he's up to something?

123
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,254
That goes without saying, doesn't it?

124
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,024
Isis!

125
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:58,073
Oh, what have they done to you,
my precious?

126
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:19,094
Well, lookie what the cat dragged in.

127
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:22,306
Nasty wound you got there, pussycat.

128
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,058
You gonna lick it
and make it all better?

129
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,935
What have you done to these animals?

130
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,190
Nothing compared to what
we're gonna do to you, pussycat.

131
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,748
Let's skin that cat!

132
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:51,585
You two yobbos wouldn't have noticed,
but she's been bitten.

133
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:54,379
She can run from us, but not the toxin.

134
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,385
Isis.

135
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,001
Isis?

136
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,017
What's happening to me?

137
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,695
Isis.

138
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,630
Stay away from me.

139
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:21,049
No!

140
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,843
Catwoman, it's me.

141
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,679
Batman?

142
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,349
You're hot.

143
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:30,851
Now you notice.

144
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,020
I've got to get you to a doctor.

145
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,980
No. You can't.

146
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:36,690
Daggett will have me arrested.

147
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:38,400
I have a hideaway.

148
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:40,694
Not far. Please.

149
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:52,539
You know, you haven't told me
why you've come to my rescue, Batman.

150
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,833
Are you getting soft on criminals

151
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,293
or just on me?

152
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:59,046
I think the fever
is making you delusional.

153
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,340
Ever the escape artist, I see.

154
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,217
What's this?

155
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,511
Isis bit me.

156
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,098
It's not her fault.
They did something to her.

157
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,892
All the animals.

158
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:15,395
Must save Isis.

159
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:17,856
And we will.

160
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:25,989
Huh?

161
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,752
What's the delay, Milo?

162
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:41,088
You should have had these animals
on the street by now.

163
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:44,383
Uh, uh, right, Mr. Daggett.
We're waiting for Paunch.

164
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,094
I sent him to the warehouse
for a pack of the antitoxin

165
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,014
just in case there are any accidents
while transporting the animals.

166
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:56,061
Let's play a little game.

167
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,855
I'll try to guess Daggett's plan

168
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,024
and you'll let me know if I'm right.

169
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:13,286
Viral antitoxins for a plague
that doesn't exist yet.

170
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,873
But if the plague is introduced
via stray dogs and cats

171
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,751
it'll blanket Gotham City within weeks.

172
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,253
Days, actually.

173
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:24,881
You know how many strays
there are in Gotham, Batman?

174
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,800
Three hundred thousand.

175
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,220
Imagine if even a tenth of them
carried the virus.

176
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,722
Not only will this little bottle
make me a hero,

177
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,724
it'll make me a fortune as well.

178
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,226
Take care of him.

179
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,566
Get him!

180
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,875
Batman!

181
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:22,147
Thattaboy, Fido. Rip him to bits.

182
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:54,429
I can't imagine
he could elude that beast.

183
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,015
You'd better make sure of that,
my friend.

184
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:01,144
Because if he does get away,
I suggest you keep on driving

185
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,689
as far away from Gotham
as this truck can take you.

186
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,490
Ha! He's dog meat.

187
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,322
No!

188
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:35,757
He's not coming up.

189
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,219
Just let him show
those pointy little ears.

190
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:54,192
No one could withstand
this degree of hypothermia.

191
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:56,444
Guy's gotta be an ice cube by now.

192
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,949
Look out, you fool!

193
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,632
It's off to the pound for you.

194
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,906
Tonight on the news,
they called you a hero.

195
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:46,661
You keep this up, and they'll start
making Catwoman dolls.

196
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,043
Are you sure you'll be okay?

197
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:55,837
Go home, Maven.

198
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,172
And thanks.

199
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,341
She'll turn up. I know she will.

200
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,370
Isis.

201
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,458
Isis, you're all right.

202
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:37,712
But how?
