1
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,372
Okay, let's see what we got.

2
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:09,503
Oh, that's impossible.

3
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,047
I'm gonna be sick.

4
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,173
All of them...

5
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:14,383
With the Joker's face.

6
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:16,778
- It looks just like him.
- It can't be.

7
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:17,962
Call the police.

8
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,308
He's made his move.

9
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,517
Dining in tonight, sir?

10
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,228
The dissection tray, please, Alfred.

11
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:11,232
Any idea
what our happy friend is up to now?

12
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,695
Normal criminals usually
have logical motives.

13
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,074
But the Joker's insane schemes
make sense to him alone.

14
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,423
Look alive, wage slaves.

15
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,551
Presenting that caliph of clowns,

16
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:40,678
that mogul of mountebanks,

17
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:44,181
the one and only Joker!

18
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:51,939
Great Scott.

19
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:54,066
Actually, I'm Irish.

20
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:58,571
Good morning, Mr. Francis.

21
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:01,615
Please allow me to
introduce my associates.

22
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,908
Miss Quinn.

23
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,746
And Messrs, uh... Oh.

24
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:10,291
Their names escape me
for the moment. No matter.

25
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:14,545
We gentlemen of business
have arrangements to discuss.

26
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:17,089
Uh, arrangements?

27
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,717
For my fish, of course.

28
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:23,554
This has all been worked out
far in advance, Francis.

29
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,600
You are merely the last tiny cog
in my grand design.

30
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,436
So don't speak to me again, okay?

31
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,939
Now, what is everyone
in town talking about?

32
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,734
Uh, your fish?

33
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:38,903
I told you not to speak!

34
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:45,576
Ugh, fish. Stinker-roonie.

35
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,582
All better.

36
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:55,878
As I was saying, since every fish
in Gotham now bears my famous

37
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,755
and frankly fabulous face,

38
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,092
I should be getting a profit
from every fish product sold.

39
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,554
Let's say, a nickel per fish sandwich,

40
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:09,475
fifty cents for sardines.
Millions of dollars a day

41
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:13,479
to finance my happily
hedonistic lifestyle.

42
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:17,483
So which of your tedious copyright forms
do I fill out first?

43
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,401
You may speak now.

44
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,279
No one can copyright fish.

45
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,615
They're a natural resource.

46
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:27,243
But they share my unique face.

47
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,578
Colonel what's-his-name has chickens,

48
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,705
and they don't even have mustaches.

49
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,250
I can't help it. It's the law!

50
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,461
Oh. Trying to cheat the Joker, are you?

51
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:40,381
Well, we'll see who has the last laugh.

52
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:45,052
You have until midnight
to change your mind, Francis.

53
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,763
Or you'll be the poorest fish of all.

54
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:58,774
Buh-bye!

55
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,318
He's crazy.

56
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,448
<i>Coming up next,
Marla Benson has a special report</i>

57
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,659
<i>on the smiling fish epidemic.</i>

58
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:11,579
<i>How safe are Gotham's waters?</i>

59
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,664
Well, he's not out to poison people.

60
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,084
This diluted toxin only affects fish.

61
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:20,045
Maybe he's trying to
make us all die from disgust.

62
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,360
<i>They're finny
and funny</i>

63
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,677
<i>And, oh, so delish</i>

64
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,430
<i>They're joyful and jolly Joker Fish</i>

65
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:34,184
<i>Say, Mom, wondering what to
feed the family tonight?</i>

66
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,604
<i>What'll I feed the family tonight?</i>

67
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,566
<i>Try me famous Joker Fish.</i>

68
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,445
<i>There's Smiling Smelt, Giggling Grouper,</i>

69
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,196
<i>and Happy Haddock.</i>

70
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,741
This could cause a stampede to pork.

71
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,951
<i>Yummy, yum-yum.</i>

72
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:52,828
<i>Eat it.</i>

73
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:58,042
<i>Uh, Mr. J, I have this
little problem with fish.</i>

74
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,962
<i>Yummy, yum-yum.</i>

75
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:05,215
<i>Yes, friends, that's Joker Fish.</i>

76
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,637
<i>Tasty, tempting, and of course...</i>

77
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:13,432
<i>- Naturally low in cholesterol.
- Naturally low in cholesterol.</i>

78
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,101
<i>Coming to your local store.</i>

79
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:20,356
<i>Just as soon as that nasty
old Mr. G. Carl Francis</i>

80
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,233
<i>decides to give me
my legal cut of the profits.</i>

81
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,777
Change the channel.

82
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,656
It's on every station.

83
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,533
Get a trace on that signal. Now!

84
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,995
<i>I hope you've changed
your mind, Mr. Francis,</i>

85
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,082
<i>because I haven't changed mine.</i>

86
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,051
Relax, Mr. Francis. I've got men
posted at every window and door.

87
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:50,803
Nobody's sneaking in here tonight.

88
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,097
If I got in this easily...

89
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,017
So will the Joker.

90
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,478
Hey, hey, this is police business.

91
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,230
Haul your bat butt out of here.

92
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,564
Hold it, Detective.

93
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,484
No one knows the Joker's
methods better than Batman.

94
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,860
He stays.

95
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,197
Glory-hogging, long-underwear geek.

96
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,324
Uh, Batman,

97
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,201
why is this happening to me?

98
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:17,079
I've never done anything to this Joker.

99
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:20,791
I'm just a paper pusher.
I can't change the laws.

100
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,042
I'm harmless.

101
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:25,838
And in his sick mind,
that's the joke, Mr. Francis.

102
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,859
- Feeling all right?
- Oh, sure.

103
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:50,195
It's just that
everything's been so crazy today.

104
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,656
I haven't even had time
to rinse off that gunk

105
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,992
the Joker's girl squirted on me.

106
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,828
Get this man
to a hospital, now!

107
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:58,954
What?

108
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,672
Watch out!

109
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,048
He'll be all right
once the antivenom kicks in.

110
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:54,218
I don't get it. We all breathed the gas,
and we're not smiling.

111
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:55,761
He didn't want us.

112
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:58,472
That gas is one part
of a binary compound.

113
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,849
The Joker exposed Francis
to the other part

114
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,392
when he threatened him this morning.

115
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,477
<i>This just in.</i>

116
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,687
<i>Former Copyright Director
G. Carl Francis</i>

117
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,066
<i>will be taking an extended vacation.</i>

118
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,153
<i>Looks like he's having
more fun already.</i>

119
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,780
<i>But I'm not happy.</i>

120
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:18,700
<i>If I don't get legal
claim to my fish by 3:00 a.m.</i>

121
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,622
<i>the number two bureaucrat,
Thomas Jackson, will feel my wrath.</i>

122
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,750
<i>And now, Batman,
because I know you're watching,</i>

123
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,294
<i>here's a message from our sponsor.</i>

124
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,589
<i>They're finny and funny
And, oh, so delish</i>

125
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,971
All units, keep your eyes open
for anything.

126
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,088
I'd like to go on record
as saying

127
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,073
this Batman business
is the lamest idea and I...

128
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,449
Duly noted, Lieutenant.

129
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,327
But we're going to try it his way
to protect Mr. Jackson.

130
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,173
Nearly 3:00 a.m.

131
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,966
And not a cackle from that hyena.

132
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,676
We must've scared him off.

133
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,928
What's that?

134
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:22,890
Just my cat.

135
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:26,977
A Joker Fish!

136
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,858
It's affecting it. Look out!

137
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,718
Even drugged, the cat went
straight for its master.

138
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,771
Oh, this is
just dandy, Commish.

139
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:12,481
Your pet bat's playing dress up

140
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:15,317
while the Joker's popping off
pencil pushers right and left.

141
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,253
Well, I ain't sticking around
to see who's next.

142
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:19,029
I got my own methods.

143
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,239
Bullock!

144
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,327
Commissioner, have a look at this fish.

145
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,996
It's a Japanese tang,

146
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,582
not native to Gotham's cold waters.

147
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:32,167
So where did it come from?

148
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,221
Freeze, copper!

149
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,598
I got you covered, see?

150
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:31,810
Well, if it ain't laughing boy's
little hench-wench.

151
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,437
You're outgunned, sugar.

152
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,813
Do tell.

153
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,816
What?

154
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,904
Ooh, look at what I caught.

155
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,407
Kind of runty, though.

156
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,411
I'm gonna have to throw it back.

157
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,052
You know, Bullock,
you may be a lousy cop,

158
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,763
but you make a terrific worm.

159
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,436
You won't get away with this.

160
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,901
He's right, you know.

161
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,528
You're kidding.

162
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:31,203
If this lunchmeat
figured out where we are,

163
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,996
Batman won't be far behind.

164
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,166
And why spoil my sharkie's appetite

165
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,460
when I can feed him bigger fish?

166
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,129
Hmm?

167
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:44,674
Ugh! Again with the fish. I hate fish.

168
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:50,389
- Uh, no offense, Mr. J.
- Poor Harley.

169
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,642
This caper's been kind of
rough on you, hasn't it?

170
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:55,310
Uh-huh.

171
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,603
Cheer up.

172
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:59,439
You can be my very own little mermaid.

173
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,024
Ooh.

174
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,114
You're really sick,
you know that, boss?

175
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,740
Mmm-hmm.

176
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,660
Huh?

177
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,519
Now, this fella here

178
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,732
came with his own grin.

179
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,693
See the resemblance?

180
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,654
And check out my catch of the day.

181
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:35,952
Bullock.

182
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,457
I didn't need no bat computer to tell me

183
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,667
that weird lookin' minnow
came from an aquarium.

184
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,963
Yes, well, this is all
tremendously boring.

185
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,798
'Course, I can always amuse myself

186
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,593
watching old Harv
give my shark indigestion.

187
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,053
Yeah.

188
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,478
Wait!

189
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,397
Let him go.

190
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,774
I'm the one you're after.

191
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:09,277
Gee, and let my little guppy go hungry?

192
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,029
I don't know.

193
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:14,407
What do you think we can do about that?

194
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,666
You're right, Harley.

195
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,501
Fish are disgusting.

196
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:27,212
I think I'll start using
my toxin on cattle.

197
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,422
"Joker Burgers." Ha!

198
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,883
Talk about a Happy Meal.

199
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,350
You never could take a joke.

200
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,859
He doesn't stand a chance
against that monster!

201
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,612
- Yeah. Catch.
- Hey!

202
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,050
Hey. Hey!

203
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,328
Oh! Ah!

204
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:13,652
Oopsie.

205
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,534
Huh?

206
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,426
You okay?

207
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,430
Just give him one for me, will you?

208
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,027
Huh?

209
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:08,540
Meanwhile, back at the wrench.

210
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,668
Since my side-splitters
don't tickle you,

211
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,670
how about a skull-splitter?

212
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,135
Oh!

213
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:28,935
There's no place left to go, Joker.

214
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:42,157
See, Batsy, I think of everything.

215
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,244
Huh?

216
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,054
Oh, my poor,
poor pudding.

217
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,351
Come on, he was a demented,
abusive, psychotic maniac.

218
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,228
Yeah.

219
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,647
I'm really gonna miss him.

220
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:23,615
Do you think he's gone for good?

221
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:25,200
Believe me, Jim,

222
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:26,576
I wish it were true.

223
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,579
But deep inside, I doubt it.
