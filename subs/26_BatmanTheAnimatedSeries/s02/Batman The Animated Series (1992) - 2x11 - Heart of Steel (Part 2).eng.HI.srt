00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,899
<i>Previously on</i> Batman...

2
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,778
This is my greatest achievement.
My prototype AI.

3
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:12,905
This is HARDAC.

4
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:19,370
Holographic analytical reciprocating
digital computer.

5
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,205
HARDAC.

6
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,958
So tell me. What does HARDAC do?

7
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:28,045
Now, Bruce, I can't tell you
all of my secrets, can I?

8
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:30,923
Well, since you won't tell me
what you're working on, Karl,

9
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,552
maybe I can charm the details
out of your lovely assistant?

10
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,680
Well, you can try.

11
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,435
<i>Some people in high places are becoming
too curious about this operation.</i>

12
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,912
I'll get it, princess.

13
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,146
You keep hitting those books.

14
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:53,988
What the devil?

15
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,952
Were you outside? Your hand is like ice.

16
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,037
I'm fine.

17
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,707
- Dad, are you sure you're...
- I said I'm fine.

18
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,137
I heard your voice, Ms. Duane,
and thought Master Bruce had returned.

19
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:26,312
HARDAC, I've definitely found something.

20
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,272
Bruce Wayne is Batman.

21
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,567
Computer, scan Batcave for...

22
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:33,944
What?

23
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,189
Good heavens!

24
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,381
I do wish your toys wouldn't play
so roughly with you, sir.

25
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,969
There's another computer
uplinked to this one.

26
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:41,679
I'm tracing the link now.

27
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,320
I've lost it.

28
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,906
The link was shut down at the source.

29
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,742
Could Randa Duane have been down here?

30
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,368
I should hope not.

31
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,787
But I can't say for certain, sir.

32
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,416
I... I simply can't remember anything
beyond the time you left.

33
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,460
It's all right, Alfred.

34
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,703
We'd better search the house.

35
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,172
Search for what, Master Bruce?

36
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:19,300
Anything unusual.
She may have left a clue I can use.

37
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,385
She's only human.

38
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:27,183
Yes, I understand.

39
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,186
That's no problem.
The Gotham Club would be ideal.

40
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,062
I'll take care of Bruce Wayne.

41
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,524
Dad, who are you talking to?

42
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,776
Leave me alone.

43
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,453
You wanted me, commissioner?

44
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,290
Go to Cybertron and see
Randa Duane. She has something for you.

45
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,043
But I already took a statement
from that Rossum guy.

46
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,127
They ain't involved.

47
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,004
Do it, lieutenant.

48
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:00,674
Talk to this guy, talk to that guy.
I'm getting a sore throat.

49
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:03,172
Get me Bruce Wayne.

50
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,429
Gordon here.

51
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,224
We know who stole
your computer data, Mr. Wayne.

52
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,559
Meet me at the Gotham Club in one hour.

53
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,312
I will, commissioner. And thanks for...

54
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:29,411
The duplicant processor's been used.
I didn't authorize that.

55
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,581
<i>It was necessary
to serve your ultimate purpose.</i>

56
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,084
No, it was a stupid idea.

57
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,169
The babblings of a broken heart.

58
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,755
<i>Humans make errors in judgment.</i>

59
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,051
<i>It is sometimes necessary to protect
them from their own inadequacies.</i>

60
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,972
I've let this go too far.

61
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:49,807
I gave you too much free will.

62
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,601
It's time to change your programming.

63
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,081
You have immobilized the maker.

64
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,294
<i>His human imperfection
endangers the plan.</i>

65
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,671
<i>He must be improved upon.</i>

66
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,485
It's open.

67
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,076
What on earth?

68
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,611
- Commissioner?
- No, Batman. I called you.

69
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,323
I expected your father, Ms. Gordon.

70
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,991
That's why I called you.

71
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,494
That man is not my father.

72
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:35,913
What do you mean he's not your father?

73
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,873
Just what I said.

74
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,084
Someone is impersonating my father.

75
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,418
What makes you think so?

76
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,797
Well, he doesn't have bolts in his neck
or anything that obvious.

77
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,341
He's so cold to me.

78
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:50,970
But, it's not just that.
I can't put my finger on it.

79
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,013
But I know, he's not my father.

80
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,391
I know I sound crazy, but I'm not.

81
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:59,228
Whoever's downstairs now,
it looks like Jim Gordon,

82
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:02,064
talks like him, but it's not him.

83
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:04,817
Please help me, Batman.

84
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,778
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you.

85
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:09,738
Getting a little fresh air?

86
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:16,912
How come I wasn't invited
to this little get-together?

87
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:28,215
It's suddenly less pleasant up here.
Excuse me.

88
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,012
Not so fast, Batman.

89
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:15,072
- A robot?
- Yes.

90
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,741
More advanced
than anything I've ever seen.

91
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,453
- Does that mean my father...
- I don't know.

92
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,913
I'll find out tonight.

93
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,333
Don't go home. Stay at a friend's house.

94
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,419
Not so fast.
How are you going to find out?

95
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,089
- I wanna be there.
- That's not possible.

96
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,299
I'll contact you
as soon as I know something.

97
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,510
Please let go of my cape.

98
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,596
Batman, I...

99
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:57,531
Good evening, Bruce.
I'm glad you could come.

100
00:10:58,615 --> 00:10:59,783
Nice to see you, mayor.

101
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,078
- Is Commissioner Gordon here?
- He'll be along.

102
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,496
He won't wanna miss this.

103
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:11,336
You're going to become a member
of a very exclusive club tonight.

104
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,298
I thought I already belonged
to every exclusive club in Gotham.

105
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:17,926
No, my boy. This club is brand new.

106
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,638
Though everyone will belong very soon.

107
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,486
Huh?

108
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:49,208
Randa? Is this what I get
for leaving in the middle of dinner?

109
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,502
You know what they say
about a woman scorned, Bruce.

110
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,889
Don't let him get away.

111
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,735
"Wait at a friend's house,"
he says.

112
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,687
Not likely, Wubby.

113
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,189
Bullock went to Cybertron
and a robot came back.

114
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,066
Wanna bet Dad's there too?

115
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:29,386
Miss Gordon, your skill
at breaking and entering is impressive.

116
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,738
Where did you learn those tricks?

117
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:34,266
A police commissioner's daughter
doesn't get all her education in school.

118
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,226
What have you done with my father?

119
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:37,811
He's right here, my dear.

120
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:41,022
You'll be joining him soon. Very soon.

121
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,848
Enough. It's over, Batman.

122
00:16:57,432 --> 00:17:00,227
<i>People are imperfect.
They make mistakes.</i>

123
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,940
<i>Your mistake was coming here
to interfere with the plan.</i>

124
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,318
What is this plan?

125
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:13,657
<i>The plan was conceived by Karl Rossum
when his young daughter was deactivated.</i>

126
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,159
Deactivated? You mean...

127
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,994
<i>A vehicular accident.</i>

128
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:24,417
<i>Our maker felt the emotion called love
in great quantity for her.</i>

129
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,046
<i>Afterwards, he decided to find a way
to replace humans,</i>

130
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:30,423
<i>whose decisions
can cost other human lives.</i>

131
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,052
- But we're all capable of human error.
<i>- Precisely.</i>

132
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:37,347
<i>The maker's concept was sound,
but he did not go far enough.</i>

133
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,848
<i>Which is why I have taken over.</i>

134
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,434
- Does that mean my father's...
<i>- No.</i>

135
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,979
There is still much to learn
from humans.

136
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,523
I will keep them alive
until I have learned enough.

137
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:49,943
Dad!

138
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,209
What a headache.

139
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:51,463
Barbara? What are you doing here?

140
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:54,049
Rescuing you, silly. Come on.

141
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:00,930
<i>Emergency. Emergency.
Stop the one called Batman.</i>

142
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,525
<i>Resistance is useless.</i>

143
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,528
<i>I control every means of escape
from this building.</i>

144
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,618
Dad!

145
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,173
Is there another way out?

146
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,595
My office has a private elevator
on a separate power source. This way.

147
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,943
Get my father out of here.

148
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:58,988
- What about you?
- I'm gonna help Batman.

149
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,290
Barbara. Where's Barbara?

150
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,585
<i>Core systems damaged.</i>

151
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:55,587
<i>The plan has failed.</i>

152
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,558
Barbara!

153
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,727
Over there.

154
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,898
Barbara. Thank God.

155
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,577
I had no idea HARDAC had gone this far.

156
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,747
I'm sure the investigation
will prove exactly that.

157
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:35,376
- You did well. Thanks.
- Anytime.

158
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,796
I'm getting too old
for this kind of stuff.

159
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,464
I sort of enjoyed it.

160
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,885
Come on, sweetie. Let's go home.
