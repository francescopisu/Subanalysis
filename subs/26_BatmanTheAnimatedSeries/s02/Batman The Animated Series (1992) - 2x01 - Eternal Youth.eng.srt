1
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,463
No!

2
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,294
You can't do this.

3
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:52,713
I've seen what you've done
to the others.

4
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,425
Please let me go. I'll pay anything.

5
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,886
You've done enough damage
with your money.

6
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,097
You wicked, evil...

7
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,848
Evil, Mrs. Thomas?

8
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:04,725
I don't control a company

9
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,978
that leveled a 1,000-year-old forest
for a strip mine.

10
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,647
That's evil.

11
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,498
You and your kind owe Mother Nature
a big debt,

12
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,043
and I'm going to see that you pay it.

13
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,096
I don't care
how much money we'll lose.

14
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,223
I won't have Wayne Enterprises involved

15
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:47,143
in an operation
that destroys a rainforest.

16
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,186
Shut it down or you're gone!

17
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,689
One of my greedy directors made a deal

18
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:53,983
with a slash-and-burn outfit
in the Amazon.

19
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,152
Hmm, it's fortunate
you caught it in time.

20
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,863
I hate it when things slip by me.

21
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,699
And with me helping you
to answer your mail,

22
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:02,783
nothing will.

23
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,413
Ah, it says here
you just won $10 million.

24
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:08,497
That's nice.

25
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:13,502
Hmm, you also received a tape from
some enterprise called Eternal Youth.

26
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,587
Shall I have a look?

27
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:16,964
Be my guest.

28
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:31,103
<i>Hello, Mr. Wayne, I'm Violet.</i>

29
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:32,897
<i>And I'm Lily.</i>

30
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,441
<i>And we'd like to invite you...</i>

31
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:37,526
<i>To a free weekend at...</i>

32
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,029
<i>- The Eternal Youth Spa.
- The Eternal Youth Spa.</i>

33
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,700
Oh, my. They even speak in unison.

34
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,393
Maggie.

35
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,270
Hello, love.

36
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,901
Care to join me for a morning jog?

37
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:25,616
As much as I'd love to,
Master Bruce insists I review this tape.

38
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,287
"Eternal Youth."

39
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,164
Sounds intriguing.

40
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,710
- Hello, Bruce.
- Good morning, Maggie.

41
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:42,216
<i>Our founder, Dr. Daphne Demeter,</i>

42
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,760
<i>has created a medical program</i>

43
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,388
<i>- that actually reverses</i>
- My, my, my.

44
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:49,139
<i>The aging process.</i>

45
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,975
My gracious.

46
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,227
Everyone's got a gimmick.

47
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,523
<i>You'll enjoy a weekend
of sumptuous mineral baths,</i>

48
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:59,984
<i>specially prepared meals,</i>

49
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,486
<i>and invigorating nature hikes.</i>

50
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,155
<i>In two days, you'll look...</i>

51
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,907
<i>And feel...</i>

52
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,118
<i>- Years younger!
- Years younger!</i>

53
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,579
<i>It's the perfect weekend</i>

54
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:15,040
<i>for the harried, stressed-out executive.</i>

55
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,711
You might wanna try this, Bruce,
with your late nights and all.

56
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:20,629
My weekends are shot, Maggie.

57
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:23,066
But if you and Alfred would like
to go in my place...

58
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,091
Uh...

59
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,344
Thank you, sir,
but we couldn't possibly accept.

60
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,388
It's much too generous.

61
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,141
I thought they said it was free.

62
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:36,478
They did. Oh, Alfie,
don't be an old fogy.

63
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,856
A little fresh air would do us both
some good.

64
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:41,525
And you have been promising
to take me somewhere.

65
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,667
I'm afraid
it's quite out of the question.

66
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,907
I've been shanghaied.

67
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,366
Oh, hush.

68
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,036
Maggie!

69
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,508
<i>May I help you?</i>

70
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,636
Hello. I'm Ms. Page.

71
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,970
And this is Mr. Pennyworth.

72
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,264
<i>We'll be filling in for Mr. Wayne.</i>

73
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,643
Our target is a no-show.

74
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,269
What should we do?

75
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,104
Let them in.

76
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:22,900
Somebody's got to pay
for the sins of Wayne Enterprises.

77
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,615
Good morning.
I am your director, Dr. Demeter,

78
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,659
and I welcome you

79
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:35,871
to our wonderful program
of organic rejuvenation.

80
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,466
Would you put that thing down and relax?

81
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,052
After years of research in my lab,

82
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,138
I have developed this enzyme. Demetrite.

83
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,598
The secret of eternal youth.

84
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:57,559
Doesn't she look wonderful?

85
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:59,228
Not a day over 90.

86
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,981
Here you'll find demetrite in the food,

87
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,107
the water,

88
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,942
even the air you breathe at night.

89
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:06,986
What a relaxing thought.

90
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,073
I assure you,

91
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,244
the enzyme is thoroughly non-toxic
and completely biodegradable.

92
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:19,081
And once you see
those wrinkles melt away,

93
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:22,167
you'll want to saturate
every cell with it.

94
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,337
To eternal youth.

95
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,631
- To eternal youth.
- To eternal youth.

96
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,060
Mmm. Quite refreshing, actually.

97
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,021
You should taste these.

98
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:43,522
Delicious.

99
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,739
Now, this is the kind of
wilderness experience I could enjoy.

100
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,204
It's a real brain-buster,
my friend.

101
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,584
No ransom note, no goodbye note,
no nothing.

102
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,462
And she's not the only
vanishing industrialist.

103
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,380
Three more were reported this week.

104
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,674
I'll search her penthouse.

105
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,217
Good luck.

106
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:14,303
We put that place under a microscope.

107
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,971
And all we got was eye strain.

108
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,390
Maybe your Bat radar can...

109
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:24,104
Oh, never mind.

110
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,215
<i>Hello, Mrs. Thomas,</i>

111
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:52,716
<i>I'm Violet.</i>

112
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,134
<i>And I'm Lily.</i>

113
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:56,845
<i>And we'd like to invite you...</i>

114
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,223
<i>To a free weekend</i> at...

115
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:01,600
<i>The Eternal Youth Spa.</i>

116
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,188
Yes, Master Bruce,

117
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:09,191
I did ask about that lady
as you requested.

118
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,986
But it seems she left by herself
two weekends ago.

119
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,907
<i>Why anyone would want
to leave this place is beyond me.</i>

120
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,160
Alfred, are you okay?

121
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,037
Never better, sir.

122
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,707
Everywhere I turn,
I see another sign of nature's...

123
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:28,544
Beauty.

124
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,923
I assure you that when I return,
I'll be feeling like a new man.

125
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,646
You know, Maggie, I never realized
how dreary this place actually looks.

126
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,648
Especially after where we've been.

127
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,732
Ah, well,

128
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,818
thanks for a splendid weekend.

129
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:58,991
Oh.

130
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,788
You are feeling younger,
aren't you?

131
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,311
What the...

132
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,447
Good to see you, sir.

133
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,574
You too, Alfred.

134
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,159
What's with the jungle?

135
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:45,370
Oh, I thought this drab old cave
could use a little color.

136
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:46,788
How does it look?

137
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,333
Green.

138
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,502
Yes, so lovely.

139
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,633
I fear all this decorating has given me
a dreadful thirst.

140
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,761
What's that?

141
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:03,222
Special spa water, sir,

142
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:06,141
with a drop or two
of Dr. Demeter's formula.

143
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:08,810
Wonderful stuff, this demetrite.

144
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,446
Ah. Excuse me, sir.
I couldn't help myself...

145
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,783
Alfred!

146
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,786
Really, sir.

147
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:28,121
It was merely a case of overexertion.

148
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:32,042
My weekend must have been
more tiring than I realized.

149
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,920
Well, you get some rest.

150
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,005
I need to check on something.

151
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,458
Alfie!

152
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,294
Maggie.

153
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,462
How strange to see you.

154
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,006
I've just been thinking about...

155
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,966
Going back to the spa?

156
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,217
How did you know?

157
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,345
That's all I've been thinking about
since I got home.

158
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,307
Computer log continuing.

159
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,517
The active ingredient
in the demetrite formula

160
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,602
is a chlorophyll-based enzyme.

161
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,440
Analysis indicates that it does affect
human cellular membranes.

162
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:41,153
I am now combining equal amounts
of the enzyme

163
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:42,446
to human plasma.

164
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,534
What the...

165
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,875
Alfred!

166
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:56,918
Alfred!

167
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,256
Alfred!

168
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,800
Alfred!

169
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,011
I don't know why, Doctor,

170
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:09,890
but we felt absolutely compelled
to come back.

171
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,808
We couldn't keep ourselves away.

172
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,018
Hmm.

173
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:17,189
Already your bodies have been primed
for the true value of my treatment.

174
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,566
The ultimate rejuvenation,

175
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:23,111
the promise of life everlasting.

176
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,828
I say, what is this?

177
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,501
Run, Maggie!

178
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,400
You go after the wrong people, Batman.

179
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:47,904
Poison Ivy.

180
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,907
Only you would identify yourself
with Demeter,

181
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,409
the Greek goddess of plants.

182
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,703
Hey, a high school graduate.

183
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,085
Don't even think about it.

184
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,175
Unusual trees.

185
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,805
<i>Subtropica brasilias.</i>

186
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,892
As rare as winter roses, Batman.

187
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:25,108
I tap their sap for my growth enzyme,

188
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:30,489
which you see here
in its purified, most concentrated form.

189
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,407
The secret of eternal youth.

190
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:38,997
But you haven't seen
my most intriguing trees.

191
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:43,460
Actually, Batman,
you and I are surprisingly alike.

192
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,049
We both strive
to see evil-doers punished.

193
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:55,597
But while you have your gallery
of rogues,

194
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:58,767
I have my grove.

195
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,988
This can't be.

196
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,366
This dog of a dogwood

197
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,452
leveled enough trees
to shade a small state.

198
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,583
And weep not for this willow.

199
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,128
She slaughtered an ancient forest
to produce cardboard.

200
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:28,713
Cardboard!

201
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,510
Of course, I still owe Bruce Wayne
for his involvement

202
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,053
with that slash-and-burn outfit.

203
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,097
But for now,

204
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,808
I'm content to settle for his friends.

205
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,741
Right now,
the bark is merely exoskeletal.

206
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:59,244
It will take months
of additional spraying

207
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:02,372
before the transformations
become irreversible.

208
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,668
But, of course,
I have the patience of a redwood.

209
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:10,380
And the convictions of a fanatic.

210
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,341
Well, if you're not going
to be part of the solution,

211
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,135
you're obviously part of the problem.

212
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:16,219
Ladies.

213
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,063
This spray is triple-strength, Batman.

214
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:30,817
It will start the transformation
without any preliminaries.

215
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,410
He should be sprouting leaves by now.

216
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,582
You made your secret
too accessible, Ivy.

217
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:48,084
I coated my outfit
with an herbicidal antidote.

218
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,961
Keep spraying!

219
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,602
Huh?

220
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,973
And I thought
you believed in justice.

221
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,558
Justice, yes.

222
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,061
But not the vengeance
of an eco-terrorist.

223
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,314
You're as destructive
as those you punish.

224
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:01,825
Look what you've made me do
to my poor, defenseless tree.

225
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,378
The enzyme!

226
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,134
No!

227
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:14,105
Alfie,

228
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,399
do you realize
that this is the second place

229
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,276
we've been together in as many weeks?

230
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:21,571
This relationship is branching out.

231
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,864
Please, Maggie.

232
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:26,451
After our encounter with Joan of Bark,

233
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:29,329
the last thing I want
to be reminded of is trees.

234
00:21:29,704 --> 00:21:30,955
Hey, good news.

235
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,167
I just heard all of Poison Ivy's victims
are expected to recover.

236
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,461
Bruce, please.

237
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:38,797
The plant. Must you?

238
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,965
Oh.

239
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,176
Maybe I'd better leave this outside.

240
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:47,180
Nice man, but sometimes not too bright.
