1
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,479
That's it. Keep her steady.

2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,400
Now crank her another inch, and...

3
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,115
Ah, forget this.

4
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,909
Yeah, it can have the fruit.

5
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:28,541
Kirk. Kirk, what's the matter?

6
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,793
Nothing. Maybe.

7
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,628
I'm not sure.

8
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,422
Another nightmare?

9
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,465
You've been having
a lot of those lately.

10
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,279
Is there something you wanna tell me?

11
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,807
Then lie down. Go back to sleep.

12
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:47,685
I need some air.

13
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,190
Ugh.

14
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,151
Now what?

15
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,570
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

16
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,048
I'm telling you it was
some kind of animal, a monstrosity.

17
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,426
The wingspan had to be 15 feet.

18
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,845
With huge fangs and claws.

19
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,764
Look what it did to the fruit.

20
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,892
Uh-huh. Thanks. We'll get right on it.

21
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,458
Alfred.

22
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,127
Trouble, Master Bruce?

23
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:56,796
You could say that.

24
00:04:57,254 --> 00:05:00,007
Reports of a huge bat creature
the size of a man.

25
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,260
Remind you of anybody?

26
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,514
<i>Present company excepted,</i>

27
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:08,098
<i>indeed, sir, it does.</i>

28
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,479
I take it Dr. Langstrom has somehow
become the Man-Bat again.

29
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,939
<i>It seems that way.</i>

30
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:18,734
You don't suppose he's taking
that formula of his again, do you?

31
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,321
I don't know. But I know
where I can find the answer.

32
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,076
Huh?

33
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,136
Dad. Where is he, Dad?

34
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,764
I'm not your husband's keeper, Francine.

35
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,433
He won't even work with me
anymore, remember?

36
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,394
Can't you see I'm worried?

37
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,523
He's experimenting again
with the bat mutagen. I'm sure of it.

38
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:59,608
Well, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

39
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,194
He's been holed up in there
since before I got here.

40
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,821
Why don't you ask him yourself?

41
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,073
I'm busy enough with my own research.

42
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,928
I can't
go through it again, Kirk.

43
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,555
I won't go through it.

44
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,973
Francine.

45
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,185
Why, Kirk? Why would you
do this to me? You promised.

46
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,397
It's not what you think.

47
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,815
The devil, it isn't.

48
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:45,321
I'm sick and tired of cleaning up
after you, Langstrom.

49
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,449
- So people have spotted it?
- Yes.

50
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,952
You must have some kind of death wish
to take that stuff again, Doctor.

51
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,372
What? You think
it's happening deliberately?

52
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:59,126
If I am transforming,
then that thing's still inside me.

53
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,420
I'm not taking the formula.

54
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:04,006
Stop it, stop it!

55
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,925
I'm sick of hearing about that thing.

56
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,177
I'm sick of my life. I'm sick of you.

57
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:10,930
Francine. Francine, wait!

58
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,558
If you haven't been taking
the formula again, what's all this?

59
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,103
What do you think? I've been trying
to clean up after you.

60
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:21,065
Obviously your so-called antidote
didn't work.

61
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,901
How could it have,
if I'm still transforming?

62
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:27,321
Don't you get it yet, Batman?
You failed.

63
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,200
All right, let's prove it.
Give me your hand.

64
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,203
- What are you doing?
- A DNA sample.

65
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:37,539
I'll run some tests.
We'll see what the truth is.

66
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,630
Langstrom, look, if you're right...

67
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,132
Save it. You've done enough already.

68
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,638
I'll be in touch.

69
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,659
What?

70
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,602
Huh?

71
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,229
Look!

72
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:33,340
The end of a perfect day.

73
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,279
Indeed, Master Bruce, it does seem
that with a bit more luck,

74
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:56,446
you could have had him.

75
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,077
I think I got all of him I need.

76
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,623
Well, if she's not at
the ticket counter,

77
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,083
could you page her, please?

78
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,543
This is her husband.

79
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,545
Langstrom.

80
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,131
I have news.

81
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,259
Francine's gone. She really left me.

82
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,969
Not that I can blame her.

83
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,138
Who wants to live with a monster?

84
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,099
You're not a monster, Langstrom,
not anymore.

85
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:28,270
My tests show that the original antidote
did work after all.

86
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,856
I also got a sample
of the creature's DNA.

87
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:32,482
And after comparing them,

88
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm certain the monster is someone else,
a new bat creature.

89
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,071
We're both off the hook.

90
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,826
- But if it's not me, then...
- Let me worry about that.

91
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,536
You've got other problems.

92
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,289
Right. Maybe I can catch her
before her plane leaves.

93
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,291
You're sure you don't need any help?

94
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,461
Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

95
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,518
Put that down. Now!

96
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:12,064
Or I'll fill you
with so much tranquilizer,

97
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,482
you'll be out for a week.

98
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,818
You couldn't leave it alone,
could you, March?

99
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,946
You've recreated the mutagen.

100
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,698
Recreated it? I've refined it.

101
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:24,952
At night, on my own,
so the others wouldn't know.

102
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,497
I still believe only a creature
like a Man-Bat

103
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,333
can survive the next
evolutionary cataclysm.

104
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,459
And it will.

105
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,630
My new serum could be
even more powerful than Kirk's.

106
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:42,427
Could be? What do you mean?

107
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,597
I needed to test it,
but before I had the chance...

108
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,684
- You mean, you haven't taken it?
- Of course not.

109
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,645
The experimental batch was destroyed.
I'll have to...

110
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:52,729
Destroyed how?

111
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,856
I'd been working through the night.

112
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,234
I was just completing
the final combination.

113
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,279
<i>Francine burst in. I was startled.</i>

114
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,781
<i>You have to understand.
I was very tired.</i>

115
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:07,077
<i>I accidentally dropped the beaker.
The whole night's work, ruined.</i>

116
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,579
<i>Francine never guessed
what I'd been doing.</i>

117
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:13,458
<i>She even helped me clean up
the mess, all that glass...</i>

118
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,547
Oh! Oh, my Lord! Francine.

119
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:21,758
The mutagen,
it's in her bloodstream now.

120
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,968
Oh, no!

121
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,515
Is that what it's going to take?

122
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,852
Your daughter's life,
before you end this insanity?

123
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:06,345
How can I help you, ma'am?

124
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:09,056
I'm afraid I'm not feeling very well.

125
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,391
- Could you get me some aspirin?
- Certainly.

126
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,070
Kirk. Of all the ridiculous stunts...
I told you...

127
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,989
No, Francine, this time I talk.
You listen.

128
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,992
Whoever the creature is, it's not me.

129
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:30,786
The Batman can prove it.

130
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:33,080
But how? Who?

131
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:36,375
What's the difference anymore?
Come home.

132
00:14:43,673 --> 00:14:45,759
Honey, what's wrong?

133
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:46,843
I...

134
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:48,678
I don't know.

135
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,895
Francine!

136
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,608
Francine!

137
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,623
Francine!

138
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,132
- Cabin pressure dropping.
- Gotta take her down.

139
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,270
Pan-Con 1-4-4 to GCX Control.

140
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:21,771
<i>Cabin pressure has failed.</i>

141
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,660
<i>Requesting clearance for emergency
landing immediately, do you copy?</i>

142
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,785
Hold on!

143
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,703
Kirk.

144
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,845
I've got you, honey.

145
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,682
And this time, I'm not letting you go.

146
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:12,645
Kirk.

147
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,315
The nightmare's finally over.
