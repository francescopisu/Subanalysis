1
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,525
THE MECHANIC

2
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:43,894
Is he kidding?

3
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,400
Maybe he's new in town.

4
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,906
- Can't you go any faster?
- I'm flooring it now.

5
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,841
Hold on, guys!

6
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,838
Looks like Earl's
got his work cut out for him.

7
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,656
What happened?

8
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,535
You been letting the kid drive again?

9
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,414
Actually, we were
playing chicken with a penguin.

10
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,333
- Looks like the penguin won.
- The Penguin?

11
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,336
Or three of his men, at least.
But they flew the coop.

12
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,042
Then I guess you'll be
needing the loaners again.

13
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,476
- Well?
- The alignment,

14
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,520
the whole suspension, all shot to heck.

15
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:34,523
I'll call you
in a couple of days.

16
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,442
Better make it a week.

17
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,779
Looks like we're gonna have to order
a whole new drive train.

18
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,993
Come on, Robin.

19
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:02,593
Guess we won't be seeing sunlight
for a while, Dad?

20
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,513
Once we've got the parts
it ought to go quickly.

21
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:10,810
Better put in the order right now.
Let's see. Twelve-gauge piston pins.

22
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,564
These are terrible. Terrible!

23
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:22,738
Come on, boss, give me a break. We got
you the stamps. What more do you want?

24
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:26,325
I wanted the rare ones!

25
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,036
The reversed Audubons.

26
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,331
These aren't worth enough to pay
for the repairs to the limousine.

27
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,506
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
have Percival here peck out your eyes.

28
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,887
- Well, I'm waiting.
- Here's a reason, boss.

29
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:50,474
If we never banged up the limo,
I'd never have run into my old friend.

30
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:52,768
The one I told you about. Remember?

31
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,317
Ah, yes, the one who works for that
auto-parts distributor.

32
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,821
Mmm-hmm.
That's me. Rundle. Arnold Rundle.

33
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,868
I process custom orders.

34
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,537
- Go on, Arnie. Show him.
- Right.

35
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,040
This is an order my company
received yesterday.

36
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,213
"Titanium-steel wheel wells,
12-gauge piston pins."

37
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:26,051
Very few vehicles use such
unusual material as those.

38
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:29,013
And the point of this is what?

39
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,017
I think these parts were ordered
for the Batmobile.

40
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,602
Huh?

41
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:36,353
Ah!

42
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,275
Tell him why, Arnie.

43
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:44,361
Well, right after I got that order,

44
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,822
Falcone told me what happened
to the Batmobile

45
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,533
while it was chasing your limo
the other day.

46
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:53,829
From the description, I'd say the kind
of damage the Batmobile sustained

47
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,791
might require the kind of
replacement parts in that order.

48
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,544
Yes. Yes, I understand.

49
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,296
You do?

50
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,840
Why, yes. And it's absolutely brilliant.

51
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,009
A first-rate piece of detective work.

52
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,136
You are to be rewarded, sir.

53
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,180
Reward?

54
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,390
Would $300,000 be enough?

55
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,061
- 300,000?
- Oh, all right, 400,000,

56
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:18,771
but that's my final offer.

57
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,278
Don't spend it all in one place.

58
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:31,951
Uh... Excuse me.

59
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,329
- I don't get it, boss.
- It's all right here.

60
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:39,124
Our friend, Mr. Rundle, amassed
newspaper reports of various instances

61
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,043
when the Batmobile was damaged.

62
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:43,438
Then he checked the dates
against the other times

63
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,714
his company got orders
for these types of materials.

64
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,970
In every case, it was a match.
The same exact date.

65
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:54,139
Excuse me. Where will this take me?

66
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,808
On a sea cruise.

67
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,061
Here. Look at these bills of lading.

68
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:07,820
Excuse me!
I'm expected back at the office!

69
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,115
All the orders
come from the same repair shop

70
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,867
run by a certain Mr. Cooper.

71
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,621
Earl Cooper.

72
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,618
Earl, my good fellow.

73
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,125
I'm afraid the warranty on this vehicle
has just expired.

74
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,218
It's just like I figured, boss.

75
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,765
The on board computer routes
all the controls through a main switch.

76
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:22,019
Then we're going to pull
a switch on a switch.

77
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:26,523
Now what?

78
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,318
The flipping thing
darn near electrocuted me.

79
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:32,362
There's a security device to keep it
from being tampered with.

80
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,531
Then disconnect it.

81
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:37,201
I wouldn't even know
where to look for it.

82
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,369
Well, I know who does.

83
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,919
And he's going to help us,
aren't you, Earl?

84
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,755
In your dreams, Pinocchio.

85
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,925
And how, pray tell,
did that costumed clown

86
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,427
give you such a bad case of loyalty?

87
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:59,306
- None of your business.
- I'm making it my business.

88
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,518
Perhaps you've heard
of my umbrella weapons.

89
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:06,522
Would you like to see
what one can do to your daughter?

90
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,650
Don't listen to him, Dad.

91
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,611
Okay. Okay.

92
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,241
If you must know, I used to be
an engineer at Global Motors...

93
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:22,371
<i>till I predicted one of their new sports
cars would have brake-design problems.</i>

94
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,918
<i>But they ignored my warnings
and introduced a new model anyway.</i>

95
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:31,672
But, Cooper, the boys in Legal
say we can't be held accountable.

96
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:36,969
We're talking about people's lives here.

97
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:42,474
Well, thank you for your time.

98
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,601
Let it go, Earl.

99
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,062
Hey, you've got a bright future here.

100
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,190
Don't blow it.

101
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,985
He's gonna report it, I know it.

102
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:58,240
Then if our Mr. Cooper
is going to become a liability,

103
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:02,369
I suggest we take steps
to minimize our risk. Hmm?

104
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:09,501
<i>That same night, they sicced
some hired muscle on me.</i>

105
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,437
Huh?

106
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,364
<i>He saved my butt for sure that day.</i>

107
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,913
But long after the Global scandal
was forgotten,

108
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,916
I still had a reputation
as a whistle-blower.

109
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,834
Twenty years in the business,

110
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:53,212
and I couldn't get work
as a wrench jockey.

111
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:57,007
I was down to my last dime.
No money, no job,

112
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,051
and no prospects for one.

113
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,471
<i>And then he saved my life again.</i>

114
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,727
Huh?

115
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,107
I need a new car.

116
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,027
<i>It was a challenge of a lifetime.</i>

117
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,865
<i>It took me six months
to come up with the design specs alone.</i>

118
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,994
<i>Titanium construction,
ablative skin cowling,</i>

119
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,288
<i>tri-nitro propulsion units.</i>

120
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,293
<i>He paid for everything. Cash.</i>

121
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,673
<i>Found this site for a garage, too,
and outfitted it to my specifications</i>

122
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,008
<i>and paid me real well.</i>

123
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,927
<i>But he got his money's worth.</i>

124
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,266
Hmm. He set you up here, huh?

125
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,519
Well, now you're going to set him up.

126
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,105
Be sure to do exactly as I tell you,

127
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:56,650
or the next person who gets a jolt
out of your security device

128
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,819
will be your charming daughter.

129
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:16,169
Yes, Batman, it's ready
any time you wanna pick it up.

130
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,047
He's on his way.

131
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,842
And we will be ready for him.

132
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,595
Won't we, Earl?

133
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,898
All right, gentlemen, battle stations.

134
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,484
The Bat is about to bite...

135
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,446
The dust, that is. Put her in the limo.

136
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:50,996
Insurance, just in case
you forget your lines.

137
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,084
And do take a good long look
at your friend, the Batman.

138
00:13:56,376 --> 00:14:00,505
After all, you'll be saying adieu
to your best customer.

139
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,022
- Looks great, Earl.
- Big job, wasn't it?

140
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:18,148
You look tired.

141
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,318
Yeah. Well, it took longer
than I figured.

142
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,696
See? Haven't even had time
to clean up yet.

143
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,783
- Where's Marva?
- Oh. Down in the basement.

144
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,870
Got some cleaning to do down there,
in the basement.

145
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:37,292
By the way, I even fixed
the air-conditioning switch.

146
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,755
Uh... Right.

147
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:54,184
You did good, old man.

148
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:02,651
They just left.

149
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,751
- What's bugging you?
- He seemed upset.

150
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,546
Something's just not right.

151
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,684
- The Penguin!
- Hang on.

152
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:40,313
Here they come!

153
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,590
What are you doing?

154
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:10,218
Nothing.
We've been sabotaged.

155
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,219
Bye-bye, Bats.

156
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,806
Man, how did he get control of the car?

157
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,976
He got control of Earl.
Come on, we better bail.

158
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,101
Stand by to eject.

159
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,483
I hate to burst your balloon, Batman,

160
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,944
but now it's time for you to go.

161
00:17:57,033 --> 00:18:00,579
I got a feeling we're about to take
the hard way down.

162
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,415
- Down? The basement!
- Huh?

163
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,584
Earl. He kept saying "basement."

164
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,752
It's a racing term. When drivers crash,

165
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,839
they say they've gone down
in the basement. He was warning us.

166
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,638
The air-conditioning switch.
He said he'd fixed it.

167
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:32,485
Ha!

168
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:43,038
Pity. It was a magnificent vehicle.

169
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,882
All right, Earl!

170
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,926
Right. Blew him sky-high, huh?

171
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,013
Bat's all, folks.

172
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,570
Let me down!

173
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,697
What are you doing? Let me down!

174
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,205
Wait! Hey, boss, behind us!

175
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:28,458
What? It's not possible.
Get us out of here!

176
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,425
Get him off us! Lose him!

177
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,006
Come on.

178
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,760
Let her go, Penguin.

179
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,371
Uh-uh.

180
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,297
I'm gonna miss this place.

181
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,049
Only till you see the new one
I'm setting up for you.

182
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,844
But this time I had my backers

183
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,555
set up dummy corporations
to order the parts through.

184
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:07,223
So no one can trace you again.

185
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,685
Yeah? Wait till you see
the new Batmobile.

186
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,439
It's gonna have tritium thrusters,
dual accelerators,

187
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,108
fuel-injected turbo boosters.

188
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,383
"One bat for you"?
