1
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,468
Don't tell me, I only work here.

2
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,483
Hello, handsome.
It's criminal to keep you like this.

3
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,069
If I had my way, you'd be running free

4
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:55,156
and the humans who did this
would be put in here.

5
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,464
Easy, lady.
Just relax and go sleepy-bye.

6
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,884
I won't let you hurt

7
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,094
the tiger.

8
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,931
I wasn't sent here
after the tiger, lady.

9
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,484
Okay, Romeo, take it somewhere else.
The zoo's closed.

10
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:35,571
What in the name of...

11
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,083
Nice tiger. Nice tiger.

12
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:07,019
<i>- Alfred, have you heard from Selina?</i>
- Why, no, Master Bruce.

13
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:11,273
I thought you and she were having dinner
to discuss an animal rights charity.

14
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,859
She should've been here by now.

15
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,029
I'm so sorry, <i>Monsieur</i> Wayne,
I meant to tell you earlier.

16
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,949
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Kyle
called to say she'd be delayed.

17
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,451
She was visiting a friend at the zoo.

18
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,663
I may be home late, Alfred.

19
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,253
If you hadn't have gotten here,
I would have been sushi.

20
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:34,255
- That tiger was ready to...
- Yes, sir.

21
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:36,882
- Now, about the woman.
- Yeah.

22
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,844
Man, her taste in boyfriends
lacks severely.

23
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,263
- The guy looked like an ape.
- Where is she?

24
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,102
Sir, this is police business.
Where is she?

25
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,188
Kong carried her off.
I mean, we're talking primal here.

26
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,382
Hey, anybody here?

27
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,068
Ah, I see you've met Tygrus.

28
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:42,364
He seems to like you, Miss Kyle.

29
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,493
Go. It's time for your exercises.

30
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,749
This is called kidnapping.
The last I heard, it was highly illegal.

31
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,125
Who are you?

32
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,378
My name is Emile Dorian.

33
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,089
But that doesn't
begin to tell you who I am.

34
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,425
Tygrus is my creation, Miss Kyle.

35
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:08,015
You've met my first attempt
at altering human genetic structure,

36
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:09,433
Garth the ape-man.

37
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:14,021
A simple biform. Crude, but serviceable.

38
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:17,066
But Tygrus,
he is the pinnacle of my art.

39
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:20,069
I designed him from scratch,
so to speak.

40
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,031
I have given him the strength
and speed of a cat and more.

41
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:27,117
I love cats.

42
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,454
Their independence,
their power, their beauty.

43
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:40,506
That is why I've chosen you
for my next experiment, Selina Kyle.

44
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,092
Or perhaps I should I say Catwoman?

45
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,010
Mister, you're crazy!

46
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,681
Sticks and stones, Miss Kyle.
Sticks and stones.

47
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,517
You've already been inoculated
with the initial dosage.

48
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,061
This shot will further the treatment.

49
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,318
My analysis shows that it's similar

50
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,154
to the compound that turned you
into the Man-Bat.

51
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:14,456
You're right. It's called T-99,
the brainchild of Dr. Emile Dorian.

52
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,963
What is it?

53
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:24,091
One of the good doctor's
early experiments.

54
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,512
Shhh. It's okay.

55
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,473
So Dorian uses cats for his research?

56
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,850
In a way.

57
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,978
He likes cats better than people.
Won't experiment on them.

58
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,898
When I worked with him,
he used primates, monkeys.

59
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,567
He changed their genotypes
with feline DNA.

60
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,653
- Where can I find him?
- He owns an island off the coast.

61
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:48,991
He retired there after people started
protesting his genetic engineering work.

62
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,338
The doc don't take kindly
to uninvited guests.

63
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:49,259
Garth, bring him downstairs.

64
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,519
That's one way to do it.

65
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,562
That will be all, Garth.

66
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,023
Doc, are you sure it'll be all...

67
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,443
Yes, yes. Leave us. Now.

68
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,615
Servants nowadays. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

69
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,575
Where's Selina Kyle?

70
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,828
Temper, temper, Batman.

71
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:20,040
You shall see your Catwoman
as you've never seen her before.

72
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,215
Selina.

73
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,889
What have you done to her?

74
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,519
I've made her
what she always wanted to be.

75
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:44,481
I've given her power and grace
beyond her wildest dreams.

76
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,775
You've made her a monster!

77
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,153
I believe she would disagree.

78
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:52,156
You can't even
begin to imagine how it is for her.

79
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,991
A whole new state of being,

80
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:58,370
heightened senses,
increased speed, agility, strength.

81
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,346
- Selina, do you know me?
- Batman?

82
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,434
You'll only confuse her, Batman.

83
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,521
She's no longer the woman you knew.
No longer even human.

84
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,816
In fact, she needs only
one more injection to complete...

85
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,235
Reverse the transformation or I'll...

86
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:39,953
Good lad, Tygrus.

87
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:52,299
Another example
of your genetic tinkering, Dorian?

88
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:54,301
Well, nothing so crude, Batman.

89
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:57,387
Tygrus is the ultimate life form.
Superior to any human.

90
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,696
Doesn't he remind you of Blake's poem?

91
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,575
<i>Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
In the forests of the night.</i>

92
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:30,838
Tygrus, no!

93
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:35,008
Enough, Tygrus.

94
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,347
Go back to the enclosure.

95
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,101
Who... What am I?

96
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,354
Selina, come with me.

97
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:49,731
I'll find some way to help you.

98
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,567
Take him outside.

99
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,118
Garth!

100
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,625
Look out!

101
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,383
Interesting.

102
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:19,511
Perhaps your bestial side
is not as dominant as I thought.

103
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,305
Remove her.

104
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,069
It's all right. It's for her own good.

105
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,656
Let her go, Dorian, or by heaven I'll...

106
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,201
Her fate is in your hands, Batman.

107
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,330
I want to test
Tygrus' reflexes and feral instincts.

108
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:48,999
And who better
to pit him against than you?

109
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,924
I'll give you a generous head start
before releasing Tygrus.

110
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,927
If you defeat him,
I shall relinquish this.

111
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,138
The antigen to reverse
Catwoman's mutation.

112
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,599
How do I know you'll keep your word?

113
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,976
You don't.

114
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:11,188
The clock is ticking, Batman.

115
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,273
Good luck. You'll need it.

116
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,406
He's all yours, Tygrus.

117
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,994
He is prey to you, my boy.

118
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,914
<i>Of no more concern
than a rabbit is to a wolf.</i>

119
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:33,043
And when he's gone,
nothing will stand in your way.

120
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:14,960
Don't be difficult.
It's for your own good.

121
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,673
Think how wonderful it will be
once this inoculation takes effect.

122
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:22,134
You'll be so much more than human.

123
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,762
Wait!

124
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,017
No need to do it that way.

125
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,394
I... I won't fight you.

126
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,148
You've made the right decision, my dear.

127
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,443
Don't trust her, Doc.

128
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,448
She's getting away!

129
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,619
Never mind. We'll find her.
This is an island after all.

130
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,152
No.

131
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:25,739
So, you can talk.

132
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,574
My father taught me.

133
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,202
Your father was a test tube.

134
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:33,288
He told me to destroy you, and I will.

135
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,708
And when you're gone,
Selina will love me.

136
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,752
I wouldn't count on it.

137
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,756
That cable should hold you for a while.

138
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,498
Batman.

139
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,545
- You're hurt.
- It's nothing.

140
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,172
How did you get away from Dorian?

141
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:49,132
He didn't try to stop me.

142
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,176
He knows there's no way off this...

143
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,719
What is it?

144
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,605
Stop, Tygrus! Don't hurt him.

145
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:04,856
Why?

146
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,025
Batman's done nothing to you.

147
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:10,195
He's my enemy and my father's enemy.

148
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,822
When I prove I'm best, you'll be mine.

149
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,700
No, I can't be won like that.

150
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,663
- But my father said...
- He's wrong!

151
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:23,750
Search your feelings, Tygrus.
You know he's wrong.

152
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,225
I'm very disappointed in you, Tygrus.

153
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,186
I am ashamed of you.

154
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:48,316
- Father, please.
- Twenty years of work in jeopardy.

155
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,444
You should have killed Batman.
Torn him limb from limb.

156
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:56,157
Why? He Is not food,
and he is not my enemy.

157
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,242
He's right.

158
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,369
I'm not his enemy.

159
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:01,037
All I want is the antigen.

160
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,415
And you.

161
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,844
Tygrus, stop him.
He'll take me away from you.

162
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,096
This is out of your hands, Tygrus.

163
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,183
He's broken the law,
committed crimes against nature.

164
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:29,274
It doesn't matter.
He's my father. He gave me life.

165
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,817
Batman.

166
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,614
This is your fault. You've ruined him!

167
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,242
No!

168
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,582
Let go!
I won't have this insolence, Tygrus.

169
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:48,835
I made you and I can unmake you.

170
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,719
Stop!

171
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,804
Tygrus!

172
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:16,029
No!

173
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:26,456
I only wanted you to be strong,
to show no weakness, no pity.

174
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,335
As you wish, Father!

175
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,133
Tygrus!

176
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,244
Tygrus didn't deserve this.

177
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:08,832
No need for tears yet, Selina.

178
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:31,271
Father needs help.
You will help him, won't you?

179
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:32,647
Yes.

180
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,817
Batwing, standard evac, code three.

181
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:41,656
Batman, the antidote!
I'll be stuck like this forever.

182
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:45,827
Would that be so bad?

183
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,163
You could stay here with me.

184
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:53,251
Oh, Tygrus, I can't live like this.
I have to be human again.

185
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:58,673
Goodbye, Selina.

186
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,105
Wait.

187
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,692
Won't you come with us?
There's nothing for you here.

188
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,862
There's nothing for me anywhere.

189
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:35,710
<i>Tyger Tyger burning bright,
In the forests of the night:</i>

190
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:44,135
<i>What immortal hand or eye,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?</i>
