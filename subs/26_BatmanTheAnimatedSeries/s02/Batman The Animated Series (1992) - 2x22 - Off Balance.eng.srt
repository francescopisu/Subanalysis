1
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,501
An hour I've been waiting.

2
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,705
I don't know what Nico
wanted to meet here for anyway.

3
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,046
He didn't, Twitch.

4
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,966
I did.

5
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,595
You! You tricked me.

6
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:37,221
What do you want?

7
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:40,933
Information on the Society of Shadows.

8
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,394
Word is they've started operating here.

9
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,605
Tell me all about them.

10
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,024
There ain't that much to tell.

11
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,027
I mean, I only worked for them, okay?
Not with them.

12
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,738
It'll have to do. Now talk.

13
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:55,281
Okay, okay.

14
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:58,004
They're supposed to have their
claws in every dirty deal in Gotham.

15
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:07,460
In fact, word on the street is they got
something major going down tonight.

16
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:10,504
Gonna boost some kind of
new ultrasound gizmo, or something.

17
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,091
- Who runs the show?
- Strange dude.

18
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:16,636
Strangest thing about these guys,
come to think of it.

19
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:21,098
Goes by the code name "Vertigo."
They say he's...

20
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,526
Please, he made me talk. I didn't wanna.

21
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:35,738
No one betrays the Society.

22
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:45,081
No, no, please.
I didn't do it!

23
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,216
Such be the fate of all traitors.

24
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,470
You'll pay for that.

25
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,464
May the Shadows live forever.

26
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:27,224
Batman?

27
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:29,310
Over here, Jim.

28
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:36,609
I heard Twitch got away,
thanks to a couple of Shadow agents.

29
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,486
And when I tried to nail them,

30
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,030
they used some sort of gas
to erase their own minds.

31
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,116
Yeah, that fits with what little
we know about them.

32
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,119
But something Twitch said makes me think

33
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,664
they're going after Wayne Tech's
new sonic drill tonight

34
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,791
when it comes into Gotham.

35
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,835
Tell Bullock he should add more guards
just to be safe.

36
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:57,087
Is there anything you don't know about?

37
00:04:57,421 --> 00:05:00,049
I only assigned that detail
a couple of hours ago.

38
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:04,512
One of these days,
I'm gonna nail his feet to the ground.

39
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,783
You don't want us to touch the drill.
Right, Mr. Fox?

40
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,701
Not unless you have to.

41
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,372
And be careful, it's the only working
prototype from our lab in Chicago.

42
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,333
And I don't wanna be the guy
who has to tell Mr. Wayne it broke

43
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,656
before we got it to headquarters
for the final shakedown.

44
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:39,421
But I thought you said
it could be dangerous.

45
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,591
Well, it's intended for use
in building excavations,

46
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,844
oil rigs and the like, but...

47
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,515
Relax, kid. That gizmo ain't gonna hurt
nobody as long as Harvey Bullock's...

48
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,934
What the...

49
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:29,096
- Who are you?
- What do you want?

50
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:33,475
The first thing I want is for you
to stop asking stupid questions.

51
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:39,189
The second is a powerful weapon,
and I think your drill will do nicely.

52
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,496
And I think you'll do 10 to 20
in Stonegate, minimum.

53
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:56,665
The Batman.

54
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,169
I suppose this had to happen
sooner or later.

55
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,738
You.

56
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:47,800
Come. We're due back
by the tolling of the hour.

57
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,286
But are you certain

58
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,914
the lady in black
was working with this Vertigo chap?

59
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:23,585
Had to be, Alfred. He'd never have been
able to escape if she hadn't shown up.

60
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,064
And she was the only one who wasn't
affected by his weapon.

61
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,882
- Weapon, sir?
- That eyepiece of his.

62
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,719
I think it gives off
some kind of radiation.

63
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,139
It must distort visual perception
and sense of balance somehow,

64
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:38,684
creating the illusion that
everything around you is topsy-turvy.

65
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,311
- My word.
- Not that it matters.

66
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,356
Nothing about that can give me any clues
to his whereabouts.

67
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,110
He mentioned returning to his base
before the "tolling of the hour,"

68
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:52,031
which suggests a clock tower,
or church bell. Then fled west.

69
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,908
Yet there's no such structure that could
conceal a hideout,

70
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,869
not within 50 miles to the west.

71
00:08:56,952 --> 00:09:00,164
Might I suggest, Master Bruce,
that you take a break?

72
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,751
If you keep pushing yourself like this,
you soon won't know

73
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,962
- your right hand from your left.
- Alfred, you're brilliant!

74
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,589
Yes, so I've heard.

75
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:10,674
With my head turned around like that,

76
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,718
I couldn't tell one direction
from the other.

77
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:15,596
They didn't escape to the west,
they went east.

78
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:24,438
There, Alfred. That has to be the place.

79
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,651
Four against one. Nasty odds.

80
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:05,581
- I can take care of myself, thank you.
- So I see.

81
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,459
- Still, the gesture is appreciated.
- Don't mention it.

82
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,671
- Just whose side are you on?
- That would be telling.

83
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,381
And it would make no difference.

84
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,388
As of now, this battle is ended.

85
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:09,228
- Filthy creature.
- I've been called worse.

86
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,982
What happened to... My mask!

87
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,111
- What have you done with it?
- Easier to clean your wounds this way.

88
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,822
Then you know. You know that I'm...

89
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,451
Hush. Who knows what other ears
may be listening?

90
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,832
Just who are you?
What are you doing here?

91
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,252
My name is Talia.

92
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,296
And I, too, have business
with the Society of Shadows.

93
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,258
- What kind of business?
- Personal business.

94
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,094
Such as I imagine yours must be.

95
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,806
Point taken. It's a simple enough lock.

96
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,392
I can get it open it with... My belt!

97
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,102
How unfortunate.

98
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,898
I appreciate the sympathy, but what
we need right now is a lock pick.

99
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,149
I know.

100
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,785
We make a good team, don't you think?

101
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:13,583
Now, come. Quickly.

102
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:17,879
There's no telling what evil
Vertigo may do with your sonic device.

103
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:21,049
Sounds like you two have a history.

104
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,887
Yes. The man once worked for my father.

105
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,975
Until Father at last came to recognize
the blackness in his soul.

106
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:39,651
When he learned of Vertigo's intentions,
my father sent me as his emissary

107
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,571
to keep the device
out of Vertigo's hands.

108
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,949
How kind of him.
Why should your father even care?

109
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,453
Because he is concerned
for all humankind.

110
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:56,752
- This way. It leads to the lab.
- Lab? What lab?

111
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:15,562
Unlocked. How convenient.

112
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,523
You do, of course,
realize that this is a trap.

113
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,818
Naturally, but what other choice
do we have?

114
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,289
Welcome, friends.

115
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:39,086
You're quite right,
I have been expecting you.

116
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:12,285
Your little dizzifying trick
won't stop us, Vertigo.

117
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:14,287
Maybe, maybe not.

118
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,833
You see, you'll have to get
across this room alive.

119
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:22,254
And that may prove difficult,
considering this entire laboratory

120
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,589
has been rigged to destroy you.

121
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:31,221
Oh. And in case you think that once I go
my disorienting effect will go with me,

122
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,889
think again.

123
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,977
I've planted duplicate vertigo devices
throughout the room

124
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,313
to maintain the effect
once I've departed.

125
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,568
Goodbye and good luck. You'll need it.

126
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,953
- You okay?
- My contact lenses.

127
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:58,248
I lost them when we fell.
They counter the distortion effect.

128
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:00,250
Without them, I'm as helpless as you.

129
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,669
I don't do "helpless."

130
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:08,508
Come on, take my hand.
I can get us through this.

131
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:12,262
- How?
- I trusted you, now it's your turn.

132
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:32,616
Jump!

133
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,247
How did you know?

134
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,338
Down!

135
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:53,053
Stop!

136
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,235
Clear.

137
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,404
How did you do that?

138
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,741
Simple. I just kept my eyes closed.

139
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:16,993
You what?

140
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,704
The only way to neutralize
the vertigo effect

141
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,541
was to rely on my other senses
to see us through.

142
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,545
All right, I am impressed. Now where to?

143
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,516
Up.

144
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,133
- Going somewhere, Vertigo?
- No.

145
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,303
- It's impossible!
- Nothing is impossible.

146
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,600
Then I will finish you both myself.

147
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,544
I can't take much more of this.

148
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,047
Only one thing to do.

149
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,382
No!

150
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,417
Without Vertigo to lead them,

151
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,940
his agents have all fled?

152
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:56,194
Yes. The Society of Shadows
is no longer what it was.

153
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,453
Well, I've gotta get this back
to Gotham City.

154
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,458
Wait. I can't let you leave like this,

155
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,460
not with the drill.

156
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,966
I thought I finally knew
which side you were on.

157
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,051
I should have known better,

158
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,054
considering that you knew
where everything was in the monastery.

159
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,514
How could you have,

160
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:26,641
unless you were one of them?

161
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,941
I am truly sorry, Batman.
It could have been...

162
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,735
Sweet.

163
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,160
This is not over.

164
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,875
Vertigo has been dealt with, Father.

165
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,794
Small wonder you seem so pleased.

166
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,298
- Then your mission?
<i>- A complete success.</i>

167
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,092
<i>I secured this just as you asked.</i>

168
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,428
Then choose a target
and test it, daughter.

169
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:07,098
<i>We must be certain it has survived
its ordeal intact.</i>

170
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,870
<i>The Batman, he sabotaged it somehow!</i>

171
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,039
So, even in defeat,

172
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:35,543
the detective manages to achieve
