1
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,594
Hello, Gotham, I'm home!

2
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,887
- Hello, Ronnie!
- Ronnie!

3
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:40,016
Veronica, darling,
you look smashing.

4
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,602
How did you like the rain forest?

5
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:46,230
The food was appalling,
the accommodations were nonexistent

6
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,150
and the bugs were the size
of my trust fund.

7
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,990
But seriously,
it's important we all do our part

8
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,242
to preserve those precious resources.

9
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,494
Hear, hear.

10
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,790
Look at them,
celebrating without a care in the world.

11
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,084
I think it's great
that Veronica's finally

12
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,128
doing something worthwhile
with her money.

13
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,880
I'm sorry, Bruce.

14
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:13,025
The securities business has been
kind of rough lately.

15
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,383
Lot of late hours, you know.

16
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,095
Seems all I do is worry about how to get
my company through one more day.

17
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,766
Worries, Hayden?
I have the cure for that.

18
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,479
I'm a little old for dolls,
don't you think?

19
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,272
Not these dolls.

20
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,233
They're Worry Men from Central America.

21
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,527
Legends say you tell them your problems,

22
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,571
then put them under
your pillow at night.

23
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,990
They'll do your worrying for you
while you sleep.

24
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,911
And when you wake up,
poof, your problems are gone.

25
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:43,454
Oh, come on, Ronnie.

26
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,666
You're the last one I'd think would
fall for some ancient tribal hoodoo.

27
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:48,626
Don't be so smug, Brucie.

28
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,254
When I was in the jungle,
I saw some things you'd never believe.

29
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,274
And I tell you, I haven't had
a bad night's sleep since my trip.

30
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,318
Well, sounds great to me.

31
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,699
In fact, the little darlings work
their magic for me all day long.

32
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,953
See, aren't they precious?

33
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,851
- I just couldn't get along without them.
- Thanks for everything, Ron.

34
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,711
But I've got a few more rounds to make.

35
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:37,550
If ever someone led a worry-free life,
it's you, Bruce Wayne.

36
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,435
I've got one for everybody.

37
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:50,271
Party crasher.

38
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,578
Nasty toy.

39
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,675
Ready to call it a night?

40
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,720
Oh, my heavens!

41
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,291
Tell me, Alfred.

42
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,878
What's an ancient Mayan witch doctor
doing on a Gotham skyscraper?

43
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,589
This isn't one
of those Riddler questions, is it?

44
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,174
No, but it's just as confusing.

45
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:28,178
There's someone new in town using
Mayan tribal gimmicks in his crimes.

46
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:32,141
- Blowguns, stone weapons.
- Voodoo dolls?

47
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,019
That's some party favor
from Veronica's party.

48
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:37,422
They're supposed to take away
your worries while you sleep.

49
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,814
Imagine that.

50
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,526
What some overworked souls
won't do to get a good night's rest.

51
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:44,612
Hmm.

52
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,406
Still, every little bit helps.

53
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,170
I tell you, child, I handle
all sorts of things for Mr. Wayne,

54
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,839
but this one really takes the cake.

55
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,137
- Oh, Morning, Dana.
- Oh, I gotta go. Bye-bye.

56
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,566
Sometimes I forget how beautiful
Gotham can be.

57
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,736
You're in fine spirits, I must say.

58
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,784
A good night's sleep
and I'm ready to take on the world.

59
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,261
You got everything all right?

60
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,829
Yes, I followed your message
to the letter.

61
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,707
- But I can't help wondering what...
- Thank you.

62
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:19,581
I know it's your company, Mr. Wayne,
but $20 million, man.

63
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,210
- That's a lot of money.
- Yes, it is. What's your point?

64
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:26,547
Well, I'd sure feel uncomfortable
walking around with all that cash

65
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,465
in a tiny little briefcase.

66
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:32,428
Dana, I'm sorry. I'm not following this.
What cash? What briefcase?

67
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,473
The $20 million you told me
to put in a briefcase for you.

68
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,642
You're not making any sense.

69
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,478
The $20 million I told you
to put in a briefcase?

70
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,481
You called me from your car,
gave me your account number,

71
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,485
told me to transfer $20 million
in cash and...

72
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,786
Hey!

73
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,166
$20 million of my money in that case?

74
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:05,461
I hope you're not going to take it
out of my salary.

75
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:15,597
<i>Tens of millions of dollars are missing</i>

76
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:16,865
<i>since this morning, Mr. Sloane.</i>

77
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,515
<i>If it wasn't you, then who?</i>

78
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:22,936
<i>But I don't know, I tell you.
I don't know. Why would I do it? Why?</i>

79
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,148
<i>That was the scene today
as broker Hayden Sloane was arrested</i>

80
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,608
<i>on charges of embezzlement.</i>

81
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:31,487
<i>Sloane joins the growing list of wealthy
Gothamites who, for reasons unknown,</i>

82
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,450
<i>have pilfered their own companies
for a combined total of $100 million.</i>

83
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,828
Unbelievable.

84
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:42,956
And you have no clue
how this could have happened?

85
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,336
I do now. Each of us was a guest
at Veronica Vreeland's party.

86
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:50,798
If there are answers, she's got them.

87
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,314
Miss Vreeland.

88
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,732
Huh?

89
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,196
Batman?

90
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,324
Let me help you with your bag.

91
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,618
No, you stay back.

92
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,246
This is mine, you hear? Mine.

93
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,002
I know it's yours.
What were you planning to do with it?

94
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,089
I have to throw it overboard because...

95
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,465
Because...

96
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,552
Excuse me, I don't feel very well.

97
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,316
Care to explain these?

98
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,029
My jewels! How did they get here?

99
00:10:56,113 --> 00:11:00,450
- Don't you remember?
- No, everything's a blank. I...

100
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,428
Leave him alone, you swine!

101
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:21,430
Please?

102
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,700
My therapist is never
going to believe this.

103
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:44,703
And I thought you were supposed
to take away my worries.

104
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:47,831
Hmm.

105
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:52,169
Well, say goodbye,
you troublesome little trinkets.

106
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,716
Wait. These dolls.
Where did you get them?

107
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,679
From a craftsman at a small village.
A funny little man in a giant straw hat.

108
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,515
An Englishman?

109
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,476
Why, yes.

110
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,729
And he suggested giving the dolls
to your society friends.

111
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:13,440
What, are you psychic, too?

112
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,276
Just picking up on the pattern.

113
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:34,628
Sir, you have no idea how terrible
I feel to have played a part in this.

114
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:38,131
Neither you nor Veronica could have
known that hidden within each doll

115
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:42,010
was a tiny microchip designed
to stimulate a sleeper's brainwaves

116
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,471
and make them susceptible
to hypnotic suggestion.

117
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:49,685
Creating a radio receiver of sorts
out of an entranced human mind?

118
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,978
Exactly.

119
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:01,613
And who knows
how to warp the human mind better

120
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:05,075
than Jervis Tetch, the Mad Hatter?

121
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:10,956
<i>"'O frabjous day, callooh,</i>
<i>callay,</i> ' <i>he chortled in his joy.</i>"

122
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,125
It's sheer brilliance.

123
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,960
A wonderland of treasures

124
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:18,839
all willingly donated
by Gotham's simpering elite.

125
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:20,215
Ah.

126
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,511
And now come the famous Vreeland jewels
to dance at my heels.

127
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,808
What? How dare you return empty-handed?

128
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:32,728
Forgive us, sir.
But Batman showed up, and...

129
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:33,937
Batman?

130
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,815
You insufferable fools.

131
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,278
You can't even handle one man
dressed up like a flying mouse?

132
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:46,408
Oh, and what's this? What's this?

133
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:49,411
You've graciously left
part of your cloak behind

134
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:52,539
as Batman's invitation
to waltz right into our midst.

135
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,003
And that's just what he'll do, won't he?

136
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,131
Of course he will.

137
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:05,385
And far be it for me to disappoint him
when he arrives.

138
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,997
<i>As you predicted, sir,
the computer has identified</i>

139
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:38,502
<i>this scrap of artificial fur as a type
used in theatrical productions,</i>

140
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:41,296
<i>which would make
its most probable source of origin...</i>

141
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,799
The Great Eastern Costume Company.

142
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,425
It's been closed for years,

143
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:48,470
making it a perfect hideout
for the Mad Hatter.

144
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,419
<i>I knew you were coming,
so I thought</i>

145
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,547
<i>I'd have some of the old chaps 'round
to make you feel at home.</i>

146
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:39,062
<i>How is Batman like a donut shop?</i>

147
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,691
<i>They're both filled with holes.</i>

148
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:27,569
<i>Whoops.</i>

149
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:29,988
<i>Should have warned you, old boy.</i>

150
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:32,282
<i>That lot's real.</i>

151
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:07,359
Delightful. Oh, quite a bonus to add
to my already-substantial collection.

152
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,111
You disappoint me, Tetch.

153
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,906
For all your brilliance,
you've become just another thief.

154
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,243
You make it sound so common.

155
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,161
Well, actually, Batman,

156
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:22,499
you'll be happy to know you're
witnessing my retirement from crime.

157
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,794
See, after my recent release
from Arkham,

158
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:29,464
I vowed to leave Gotham
and my wicked ways behind me.

159
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:35,178
Perhaps buy a little island somewhere
and open a sunbonnet shop.

160
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:40,100
But islands, even little ones,
cost money.

161
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,978
Lots of money.

162
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,939
And then I heard of Ms. Vreeland's

163
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:48,692
well-publicized trek
into the rain forest.

164
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:55,448
Yes, I realized at once she'd be the
perfect unwitting partner in my scheme.

165
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,536
<i>Investing what limited funds I had,</i>

166
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,497
<i>I managed to follow dear Ronnie
into the forest</i>

167
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,959
<i>where, at a small native village,
she made the acquaintance</i>

168
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:09,004
<i>of my specially-created Worry Men.</i>

169
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:16,052
Though, I can't take complete credit.

170
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,972
I provided
the microcircuitry, of course,

171
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:22,142
but my good friend here
supplied the dolls.

172
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,477
Can you believe it?

173
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,439
He was just an honest native craftsman

174
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:30,817
until I changed his mind
about helping me.

175
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,238
Those others are riffraff culled out of
various Gotham street gangs.

176
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,949
Gutter trash of no great importance.

177
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,785
So, as this is my farewell to crime,

178
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,371
I think I'll take a souvenir
to mark the occasion.

179
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:53,715
No matter. I have a better way
to remove that nasty old cowl.

180
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:04,017
Stop! You don't know what you're doing.

181
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,329
Oh, that noise!

182
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:28,541
What's going on?

183
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,503
How did I get here?

184
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,548
Oh, you're a clever one.

185
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,678
But I will not be denied.
As the great Lewis Carroll said,

186
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:42,389
"One, two, one, two,"

187
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,975
"and through and through,
the vorpal blade went snicker-snack."

188
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,521
"He left it dead, and with its head,
he went galumphing back."

189
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,028
No!

190
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,739
Stop! I command you.

191
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:02,575
So, we're gutter trash, are we?

192
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,122
Who's calling the shots now?

193
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,917
- Stop!
- Yes. Stop.

194
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,257
Leave him to the police.

195
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:23,680
Thank you. Thank you, you generous,
forgiving, noble fool.

196
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:25,390
Stand back, all of you.

197
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:30,270
I'm getting out. But not before
I sew up one last loose end.

198
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:31,938
What?

199
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:15,398
Tomorrow this all goes
back to the company.

200
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,068
Minus the cost of a plane ticket home
for our kidnapped doll maker.

201
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,946
I must say, after all the Hatter
put him through,

202
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,449
that fellow showed remarkable restraint.

203
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:25,909
When everything was said and done,

204
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,203
all the shaman really wanted
was to go home.

205
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:32,040
<i>In fact, I hear he even sent the Hatter
a farewell gift.</i>

206
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,252
<i>Something to ensure
that Jervis Tetch</i>

207
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,589
<i>only dreams of a good,
honest life from now on.</i>
