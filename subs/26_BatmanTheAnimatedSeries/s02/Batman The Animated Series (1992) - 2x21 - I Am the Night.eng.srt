1
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,595
Master Bruce?

2
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,806
Are you all right, sir?

3
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:42,018
- I'm tired, Alfred.
- I shouldn't wonder.

4
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:46,480
You've taken no meals today.
I can't recall when you last slept.

5
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:49,525
A weary body can be dealt with

6
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,945
but a weary spirit,
that's something else.

7
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,664
Sometimes, old friend, I wonder
if I'm really doing any good out there.

8
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:07,501
How can you doubt it?
The lives you've saved,

9
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,920
the criminals you've brought to justice.

10
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,716
I've put out a few fires, yes,
won a few battles.

11
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:17,928
But the war goes on, Alfred. On and on.

12
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,851
You have it, Alfred?

13
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:25,186
Of course, sir.

14
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:57,218
It's a done deal. You're looking
at the new vice president of...

15
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:01,430
Excuse me, folks. Spare some change?
Trying to get bus fare home.

16
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:04,058
Uh, sure.

17
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,774
Works every time.

18
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,501
I say we take them now,
before the deal happens.

19
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,129
We got enough on them.
What are we waiting for?

20
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,173
Batman. He got us the dirt
on the Jazzman.

21
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,426
Said he'd be here
when the hammer went down.

22
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,773
Batman.

23
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,703
You seem quieter than usual tonight.

24
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:09,957
Every year I come here, I wonder
if it should be the last time,

25
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,501
if I should put the past behind me,

26
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,712
try to lead a normal life.

27
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:19,633
Santayana says that those who forget
the past are condemned to repeat it.

28
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,845
He also said a fanatic is someone
who redoubles his efforts

29
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,722
while losing sight of his goal.

30
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,373
Wizard, you never call. You never write.

31
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,419
You never pay us our piece of kale
for letting you work that corner.

32
00:04:56,086 --> 00:05:00,174
Willie. Monk. Yeah,
I was just looking for you guys.

33
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:08,224
Let's skip the pleasantries.
What do you say? 50 bucks, now.

34
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,436
It's that, or I cut out your liver
and fry it in a pan.

35
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,231
I haven't exactly got it right now.

36
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:19,026
Then what you do got
is a whole world of trouble.

37
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,662
Willie?

38
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,205
Willie?

39
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,336
You're mine. Later.

40
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,433
Hey, Bats, don't worry about me.

41
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,811
I don't need help from some jerk
in long underwear.

42
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,241
Think there's room in the
Mitchell Street Mission for one more?

43
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:08,576
Of course.

44
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,254
Commissioner, it's gotta be now.

45
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,593
Hit it.

46
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,935
This is the police. You men
in the warehouse, you're under arrest.

47
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:56,707
Aren't you going home?
It's almost 3:00 a.m.

48
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,877
Promises to keep, Leslie.

49
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,587
I have promises to keep.

50
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,817
This was a setup.
The Jazzman was ready for us.

51
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:31,367
I've been waiting a long time
to play "Taps" for Gordon.

52
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,640
What the hell?

53
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:09,363
What's the deal? We couldn't
get close enough to use tear gas.

54
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,089
Looks like the fat lady
just sung, Jimmy.

55
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,634
Hey, where's the commish?
He should see this.

56
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,553
Commissioner?

57
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:17,973
Oh, my God!

58
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,632
BP, 90/60.
Respiration shallow.

59
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:35,657
Normal saline.

60
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,785
Type and cross match. Five units now.

61
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,411
Warm up O.R. 1.

62
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:59,389
<i>Last night, police broke the smuggling
ring of Jimmy "The Jazzman" Peake.</i>

63
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:02,351
<i>But the victory in the drug war
came at a high cost.</i>

64
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,313
<i>Police Commissioner James Gordon
was badly wounded in the line of duty.</i>

65
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,110
<i>Ballistics investigation has matched
the bullet with the Jazzman's gun.</i>

66
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,070
<i>Any comments, Jazzman?</i>

67
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,532
<i>Let's just say it was time
to pay the piper.</i>

68
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,411
<i>Sources say that
the Jazzman has long nursed</i>

69
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,497
<i>a grudge against Commissioner Gordon.</i>

70
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,834
<i>The commissioner remains in
intensive care at Gotham City Hospital.</i>

71
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,238
I don't know if you can hear me, Jim.
I'm sorry.

72
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,866
If I hadn't stopped in Crime Alley...

73
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,576
Batman.

74
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,829
- How is he?
- Not good.

75
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,539
It's my fault.

76
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:09,168
I should've gotten there first,
checked it out before.

77
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,045
Don't blame yourself.
You caught the man who shot him.

78
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,589
If I'd been there...

79
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,887
You should've been there, pointy ears.

80
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,218
Then maybe Peake might've shot
the right guy.

81
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:21,068
I thought you were supposed to know
what's shaking on the streets.

82
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:23,307
How come you didn't tell us
this was a setup?

83
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,893
- I didn't know.
- Yeah?

84
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,478
In my book that makes you
just as responsible

85
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,397
for him being here as the Jazzman.

86
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,649
Harvey, please. It wasn't his fault.

87
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:41,533
Hey, where you going?
This ain't over yet, outlaw!

88
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,286
You hear me? You're going down for this!

89
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,915
I ain't talking law!
I'm talking you and me!

90
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:42,302
James Peake, you are hereby remanded

91
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,013
to the custody
of the state pending trial.

92
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,808
As there is no room currently
in the Gotham City jail,

93
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:52,062
you will be taken to Stonegate
Penitentiary to await a trial date.

94
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,074
It ain't going to trial.

95
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:06,827
They got enough on me to play
the funeral march.

96
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:10,622
Not a problem, bro.
Talk to Southside Eddy.

97
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,466
He'll get you on the street
and out of Gotham

98
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:14,543
before the ink on your fingers dries.

99
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,629
Not out of Gotham. Not yet.

100
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,800
First, I'll make sure Gordon's
got a one-way ticket to harp land.

101
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,094
Not now, Jimmy. You gotta lay low.

102
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,308
Gordon busted me six years ago.
Would've been the best score of my life.

103
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:32,060
I owe him big time.

104
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,451
I'm so glad you could come,
Master Dick. It's been three days.

105
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,661
I've never seen him like this before.

106
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,176
Bruce?

107
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:14,311
Bruce! Stay down here much longer,

108
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:16,646
you'll be growing mushrooms
in your armpits.

109
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,067
- I should have been there.
- You can't be everywhere.

110
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:24,196
- I let him down.
- You're being too hard on yourself.

111
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,657
He's a friend. More than a friend.

112
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,912
Jim Gordon's the same age
my father would've been if he hadn't...

113
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:34,623
Now he's hanging by a thread.

114
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:38,043
If I'd gotten there five minutes sooner.

115
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:42,047
You're only human.
You do all one man can do.

116
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,049
More than any man's expected to do.

117
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,223
Laundry coming through, boss.

118
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,559
I chose this life.

119
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,188
I use the night. I became the night.

120
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,607
Sooner or later, I'll go down.

121
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:05,404
It might be the Joker or Two-Face
or just some punk who gets lucky.

122
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,490
My decision. No regrets.

123
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,576
But I can't let anyone else
pay for my mistakes.

124
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,373
Jim Gordon's a cop, Bruce.
He knows the risks.

125
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,835
How long before I let
someone else I care about down?

126
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,672
Leslie. Alfred. You.

127
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,307
Now.

128
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:54,202
When all is said and done,
how much good have I accomplished?

129
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,829
They sell T-shirts of me.

130
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,958
I've become a cliché. More good
for the tourist trade than the streets.

131
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,127
This city would fall apart without you.

132
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,796
Maybe. Maybe not.

133
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:09,176
When you look too long into the abyss,
the abyss looks back through you.

134
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,013
Maybe it's time for Batman to return
to the night that spawned him

135
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:14,598
before anyone else gets hurt.

136
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,832
Jimmy Peake's a madman, Dick.

137
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:44,628
He'll try to finish what he started.
I feel so helpless.

138
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,547
I can't just sit here.
I've gotta do something to...

139
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,091
I know how you feel.
More than you might think.

140
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,468
But your place is here.

141
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,804
There's only one person
who can find the Jazzman now.

142
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,099
- You're talking about Batman.
- I hope so.

143
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,326
You've gotta pull yourself
out of this, Bruce.

144
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,321
The Jazzman broke out of Stonegate.

145
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,615
He's gone to ground somewhere in Gotham.

146
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,286
You know he'll find a way
to get to Gordon.

147
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,790
Okay. Then I'm going after him.

148
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,894
You taught me everything I know
about crime-fighting, Bruce.

149
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,588
But the most important lesson
was to never give up.

150
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:44,521
No, Dick.

151
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,065
This is my hunt.

152
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,896
<i>Attention, all cars.</i>

153
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,673
<i>Suspect sighted near corner
of Adams and O'Neil.</i>

154
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,175
This is Bullock. I'm on him.

155
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,053
<i>Roger, Detective. Use caution.</i>

156
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:44,581
I've gotta get some coffee, Dad.

157
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:45,915
I'll be right back.

158
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:05,310
Time to face the music, Gordon.

159
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,189
No!

160
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,792
Freeze, Jimmy!

161
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:16,297
- Barbara?
- Dad! You're all right.

162
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:19,300
The bust... Went down okay?

163
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:22,011
Yes. Get some rest now.

164
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,180
Gotta keep fighting. Never stop.

165
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,349
What I try to live by.

166
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,312
Maybe if I'd been younger,
could've been like you.

167
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,566
Always wanted to be a hero.

168
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,986
You are a hero, Jim.

169
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,172
Up to your old tricks, I see.

170
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,799
How about returning that suitcase
to its owner.

Hey, man, I am the owner.

172
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,764
You know, I was kind of hoping
I'd run into you.

173
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:08,308
I'd been in those places
like where you left me before.

174
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:12,854
Heard the rap, wasn't impressed.
But this time it made sense.

175
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,149
Maybe I was ready to hear it.
So I'm heading back home.

176
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:18,443
I guess I kind of owe it to you, Batman.

177
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,780
You probably saved my life.
I bet you hear this all the time.

178
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,115
Look, I'm gonna miss my bus.
I'll see you around.

179
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,035
And thanks.
