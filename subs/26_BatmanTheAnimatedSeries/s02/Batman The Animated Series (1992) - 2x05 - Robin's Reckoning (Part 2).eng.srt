1
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,483
<i>Previously on</i> Batman...

2
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,570
Everything was going great
until that Marin business came up.

3
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:14,907
You ever hear of
a crook named Billy Marin, Alfred?

4
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,462
- Hey, that's the guy the...
- Come on, honey, we're on.

5
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,433
Dad!

6
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,688
Does he have anyone?

7
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,940
No. No family.

8
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,610
I may be able to help.

9
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,905
<i>You can't take this one.
Zucco's mine.</i>

10
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:58,367
- Sorry, Robin.
- But I've waited half my life.

11
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,622
<i>- Batman out.</i>
- Oh, no, he's not gonna ace me out.

12
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,041
- Master Dick, you...
- Not this time, Alfred.

13
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,793
Maybe not ever again.

14
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:40,201
I told you to sit this one out, Robin.

15
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,377
You're a real piece of work, Batman.

16
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,588
Okay, I'll find Zucco on my own,

17
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,882
just like I did before.

18
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,136
Ha-ha!

19
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,396
<i>En garde.</i>

20
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:16,278
Try using more control.
You're wasting a lot of energy.

21
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,823
Oh, yeah?

22
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,957
See?

23
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,543
It's finesse, not strength.

24
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
Finesse, huh?

25
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,341
Hey. Okay, now you're gonna get it.

26
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,678
Whoa!

27
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,388
Too slow, huh?

28
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,391
Forgive the interruption, sir.

29
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:47,685
But Lieutenant Gordon
is here to see you.

30
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,645
He asked to meet with you in private.

31
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,565
Uh, why don't you hit the showers, Dick?

32
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:53,977
It's almost time for dinner.

33
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,152
Uh, yeah, sure.

34
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,437
I dropped by to let you know

35
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,338
you might not
have to keep the boy much longer.

36
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,961
Oh?

37
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:17,298
We just started putting these up
and already we got a few bites.

38
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,425
Zucco's been spotted
on the Lower East Side.

39
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:21,969
Off the record,
we hear he's trying to skip town.

40
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:24,472
- How soon?
- Could be tonight.

41
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,557
This Batman's got Zucco real spooked.

42
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:29,143
Zucco's friends too.
Nobody will touch the guy.

43
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,146
And if Zucco gets away?

44
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:33,898
We could lose him for good.

45
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,224
You sure you want to get off here?

46
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,475
Yeah.

47
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:12,394
Hey, ever pick up this guy?

48
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:16,816
Can't say as I have.

49
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:19,568
Who is he, your old man or something?

50
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,529
Yeah, something.

51
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,163
Who you looking at, boy?

52
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,373
No one.

53
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:16,709
Huh?

54
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,981
Who do you think taught you
how to grift, Chi-Chi?

55
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,746
You don't go skimming money from me.

56
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,248
But I ain't,
Lennie, honest.

57
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,209
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.

58
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,003
No! Wait!

59
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:10,220
Lennie, look,
I can explain.

60
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,431
We're beyond explanations.

61
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,682
Leave her alone.

62
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,605
This kid belong to you?

63
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,024
Let go of me.

64
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,859
I said leave her alone!

65
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,533
You little creep.
When I get my hands on you...

66
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,410
Get away, kid. Jump!

67
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,271
- Come on!
- Hey. Hey, let me out!

68
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,734
There's roaches in here. Roaches!

69
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:12,032
So when's
the last time you ate, kid? Christmas?

70
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,539
Sorry, but I'm kind of in a rush.

71
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:21,291
Hey, you can't expect to find
this uncle of yours at this hour.

72
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,545
This is the only place around
that's still open. Right, Berty?

73
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:26,005
Mmm-hmm.

74
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,215
Hey. I know that deadbeat.

75
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:31,719
- You do?
- Yeah. He's been here.

76
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:34,346
Always barking orders, never tipping.

77
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,349
I've seen him come
from that building across the basin.

78
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,020
That place has been
condemned for years, right?

79
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,023
Yeah, and may it
fall on his head, the louse.

80
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,043
Let go of me!

81
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,128
The circus boy.

82
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,172
My little material witness.

83
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,757
What are you doing here?

84
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,510
- Ow! Why, you...
- Hey!

85
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,054
I was just about to
leave town because of you.

86
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,390
Looks like I'm gonna have
a change in travel plans.

87
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:06,647
Only place you're going
is up the river, you scum.

88
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,822
You creep! I hate you! I hate you!

89
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,449
Get away!

90
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,006
Help!

91
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,978
So much for the Bat and the brat.

92
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:57,114
Help! Help!

93
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,043
Hang on.

94
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:23,348
He's gone. He got away.

95
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:28,312
No! You had him.
You let him go! You let him.

96
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,231
Why? Why'd you do it? Why?

97
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,408
Where are we going?

98
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,202
Home.

99
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,751
Man, oh, man.
Is this where you live?

100
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,794
This is where I work.

101
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:57,549
You're the first...
Correction, second person to see it.

102
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:00,093
Why'd you bring me here?

103
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,766
Because I wanna know
just how badly you want Tony Zucco.

104
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,101
What do you mean?

105
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,020
Who are you?

106
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:20,280
I take it Master Dick's visit
will now be indefinite?

107
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,372
You're out there somewhere, Zucco.

108
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:30,123
But you can't hide from me.

109
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,418
I've been taught by the best.

110
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,397
<i>And just
a few hours ago,</i>

111
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:38,674
<i>Batman apprehended
a suspected extortionist,</i>

112
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,551
<i>Ferris Dolan of 210 Trumbell Avenue.</i>

113
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,303
<i>Mr. Dolan and other men</i>

114
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,223
<i>were reportedly sabotaging
a midtown construction site</i>

115
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,016
<i>at the time of his capture.</i>

116
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,992
Come on, Dolan.

117
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,910
You gotta have his address somewhere.

118
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:36,315
Yeah, who is it?

119
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,443
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

120
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,654
<i>Who's there? Ugh.</i>

121
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,906
Gotcha.

122
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,617
I don't like it.

123
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,187
You sure Batman didn't follow you?

124
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,122
No. And Dolan's no squealer.

125
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,707
You got nothing to worry about.

126
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,337
Don't tell me
what I've got to worry about.

127
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,464
I'm not back in town five minutes,

128
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,924
five minutes, and he's on my tail.

129
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,968
You don't know the Bat. He don't let up.

130
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,180
He's a dark angel of death, man,
and he wants me.

131
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,226
Uh, why you, boss?

132
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,270
How should I know?

133
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,231
What's that?

134
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,067
What's what?

135
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,943
Shh. Listen.

136
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:27,074
It sounds like rats.

137
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,410
Yeah, rats.

138
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,891
Boss, calm down, okay?

139
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:56,353
You're starting to worry us.

140
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,821
Mama.

141
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,660
Aw, what's the matter, Bats?

142
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,078
You twist your knee?

143
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:16,331
Looks like you could use
a little protection about now.

144
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:21,294
And protection is my racket.

145
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:28,009
Nine years, creep.

146
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,846
Nine years of looking over my shoulder.

147
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:32,180
No more.

148
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,641
I'm sending you straight to a bat box.

149
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,020
No!

150
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:58,373
What are you deadbeats
standing around here for?

151
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,208
Get out there!

152
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:01,960
Now!

153
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,514
- Where'd he go?
- Not far.

154
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,099
You saw how he was limping.

155
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
Spread out.

156
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,794
Mick! Mick, he's over here!

157
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,259
Get him. Get him!

158
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,208
Round and round we go, hey, Bats?

159
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,757
Ride's over!

160
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,302
No, boss! Don't! Wait!
You can't! You'll hit us!

161
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,763
Sorry, boys.

162
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:03,433
You pays your money,
and you takes your chances.

163
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,538
I don't believe this.

164
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,165
You're through, Zucco.

165
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,250
Forever.

166
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,087
Is that so, birdy boy?

167
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:33,630
Huh?

168
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,343
I've waited a long time.

169
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,815
Keep away from me.

170
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:04,160
No. Don't. Please.

171
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:05,912
Robin!

172
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,873
Enough.

173
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:11,418
You can't let your emotions
get the best of you.

174
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:15,046
Stuff your advice, Batman.

175
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,798
You and your stone-cold heart.

176
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:19,342
You don't know how I feel.
How could you?

177
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:23,888
Batman, I...

178
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:25,765
I didn't mean to...

179
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,891
I'm sorry.

180
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:06,765
You were right, you know,
not bringing me along.

181
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,850
You knew I'd take it too personally.

182
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,019
It wasn't that, Robin.

183
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:13,229
It wasn't that at all.

184
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:18,026
Zucco's taken so much,

185
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,153
caused you so much pain.

186
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,781
I couldn't stand
the thought that he might...

187
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,658
Take you too.

188
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:32,957
Come on, partner.

189
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,918
It's been a long night.
