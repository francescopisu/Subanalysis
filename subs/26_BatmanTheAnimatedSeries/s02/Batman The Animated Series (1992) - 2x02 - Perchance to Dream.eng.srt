1
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,782
Huh? What the...

2
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,165
Good morning, Master Bruce.

3
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,750
Rise and shine, sir.

4
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,169
I'm lucky to be awake at all.

5
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,672
I fell into that trap like an amateur.

6
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,423
Trap, sir?

7
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:56,926
How'd I get back here?

8
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,678
Robin?

9
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,221
Robin, sir?

10
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:03,933
A young lady?
I thought you and Miss Selina were...

11
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,228
Pardon me, sir, none of my business.

12
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:10,106
If this is a joke, Alfred,
it's not funny.

13
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:13,275
If it's a joke, sir,
I assure you it's on me.

14
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,444
I've just prepared breakfast.

15
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,406
Perhaps morning coffee
will clear the cobwebs.

16
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:36,841
What?

17
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,759
A problem, sir?

18
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,177
It's not here.

19
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:42,096
What's not here, sir?

20
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,181
You know what I'm talking about.

21
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,767
The entrance to the Batcave.
Why is it sealed up?

22
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,477
Batcave?

23
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,396
I'm sorry, I don't...

24
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:53,315
That's right, Alfred, the Batcave.

25
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,317
It's a big hole in the ground

26
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,446
with a big car in it
that's all black, remember?

27
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:00,990
<i>Son? You sound upset.</i>

28
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,283
Is something the matter?

29
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:08,205
No. No, it's impossible.

30
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:09,457
No.

31
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,542
It can't be you.

32
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,210
It can't be.

33
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,389
You okay, son?

34
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm... I'm all right.

35
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,311
Just partied too hard last night,
that's all.

36
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,105
You will be able to get
to the office today, won't you?

37
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:35,316
There's that stockholder's meeting,
you know.

38
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,484
Sure.

39
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,195
I'm fine, really.

40
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,156
Well, good. Glad you'll be there.

41
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,617
Your mother and I have an appointment
too this morning.

42
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,037
On the golf course.

43
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,632
This should be just the thing
for your meeting, Master Bruce.

44
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,803
Alfred,

45
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,721
will you do me a favor?

46
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,723
It's an odd favor.

47
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,683
Would you tell me

48
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:11,477
about my life?

49
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:13,395
Just humor me, please.

50
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,773
Very well, Master Bruce.

51
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,318
Since your father retired,

52
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,403
you've been head of Wayne Enterprises,

53
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,366
though Lucius Fox
really runs the business.

54
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,535
Not that you aren't capable, of course.

55
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:31,163
That's all right, Alfred. Go on, please.

56
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:35,876
And, um, unless plans have changed
since last night,

57
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,170
you're to marry Miss Selina Kyle.

58
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,131
You proposed to her last week.

59
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:43,217
No, it's wrong.

60
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,844
It's all wrong.

61
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,222
Well, sir, it's a leisurely existence,
I admit.

62
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,224
But there are worse lives.

63
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:14,665
Selina?

64
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:17,835
Your mother called, darling,
said you could use some cheering up.

65
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,671
And, uh, who better for the job

66
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,506
than the woman
you're marrying next week?

67
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:26,760
Bruce,

68
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,888
you really are upset. What's wrong?

69
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,514
I feel as if

70
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm someone else.

71
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,269
It's crazy, but I know I'm...

72
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:36,478
Batman!

73
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,458
Hey, watch where you're going!

74
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,376
Bruce. Bruce, wait.

75
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,748
Huh?

76
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,126
Whoa!

77
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,461
Hey! Help!

78
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,988
Isn't he fantastic?

79
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,365
Actually, yeah.

80
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,085
Who... Who is he?

81
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,670
They call him Batman.

82
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,673
No, I mean, who is he?

83
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:29,550
No one knows.

84
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:32,302
He just appeared in Gotham
a few weeks ago.

85
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,346
Bruce, you okay?

86
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:38,308
Selina, does the name Catwoman
ring a bell?

87
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,810
Catwoman?

88
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,814
Bruce, you're beginning to worry me.
What's this all about?

89
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,150
I'm losing my mind, that's what.

90
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,239
I couldn't go to a psychiatrist.

91
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:54,742
You're the only doctor I trust, Leslie.

92
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,287
It's like
I'm living someone else's life.

93
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,415
I don't know anything about me anymore.

94
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,044
Help me, Leslie, please.

95
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,254
Even though
I'm not a psychiatrist, Bruce,

96
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:08,839
your problem seems clear.

97
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:10,924
You've led the sort of life

98
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,801
where everything has been handed to you,

99
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,344
even Wayne Enterprises.

100
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,347
You don't feel
you've accomplished anything.

101
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,433
It's all been laid out for you.

102
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,937
So your unconscious created a life
more satisfying to you.

103
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,941
You've identified with someone
whose every deed has great value.

104
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:29,443
Batman.

105
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,695
It's called disassociation, Bruce.

106
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,239
Once you find pride
in your own existence,

107
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,575
then these delusions will vanish.

108
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:39,953
Then all these years of training
and discipline...

109
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:42,915
What happened to my parents...

110
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,416
A delusion.

111
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,335
Then...

112
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,296
The nightmare is over.

113
00:09:58,263 --> 00:09:59,306
Dad.

114
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:04,978
Dad, will you and Mom join Selina and me
at the opera tonight?

115
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,273
You certainly seem
like your old self again, Bruce.

116
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:11,235
I've never felt better in my life, sir.

117
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,570
I'll check with your mother.

118
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,368
Have you found that entrance
to the Batcave yet, Alfred?

119
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,412
Uh, I'm afraid not, sir.

120
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,208
Good. Because if you had,
then we'd both be nuts.

121
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,878
It's nice to see you
in good humor again, Master Bruce.

122
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,049
Why shouldn't I be?
My life is a dream, Alfred.

123
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,343
The best dream anyone ever had.

124
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:39,763
I'll just prepare your suit
for the opera tonight.

125
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,517
You do that, Alfred.

126
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:58,073
What?

127
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,911
Huh?

128
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,227
Nothing makes sense!

129
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:30,981
Bruce!

130
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,278
No.

131
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,863
You're a lie.

132
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,324
It's all a lie!

133
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:57,132
<i>Once again, the mysterious figure
known as Batman has come...</i>

134
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,550
Batman!

135
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,386
Always Batman!

136
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:05,849
Stop it, son.

137
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,309
Calm down.

138
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,937
He's behind all this. I know it.

139
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,980
And I'm gonna find out why.

140
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,816
You're not well, son.

141
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:17,319
Bruce.

142
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,883
I need a flare gun and some flares.

143
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,052
Uh, sure, no problem.

144
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,775
Excuse me, sir.
This is a no-parking zone.

145
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,443
May we see your license?

146
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,446
Certainly, officer.

147
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:07,327
Mr. Wayne, your parents
are very concerned about you.

148
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,495
Please come with us.

149
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,247
Very well.

150
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,999
But not right now.

151
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,503
Hey! Stop!

152
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,433
Blast it.

153
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,059
Go around. We'll cut him off.

154
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,069
Up there.

155
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:43,196
Stop!

156
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,285
Guy moves like Batman.

157
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:27,908
Stop right there, Mr. Wayne.

158
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:34,956
Not again.

159
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,799
Here I am!

160
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:30,262
I've been waiting for you!

161
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:32,848
You did this to me!

162
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,648
You're not well, Mr. Wayne.

163
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,568
You need professional help.

164
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:29,779
Liar! You know what's going on.

165
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:31,072
This is a dream.

166
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,408
And you're the one responsible.

167
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,659
A dream?

168
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,411
Why do you think that?

169
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,497
I suspected it from the start.

170
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:41,541
I knew I was right
when I tried to read the newspaper.

171
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,710
The print didn't make sense.

172
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:45,295
Yes?

173
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,924
That's because reading is a function
of the right side of the brain

174
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:51,343
while dreams come from the left side.

175
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,179
It's impossible to read something
in a dream.

176
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,097
Granting that's true,

177
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,807
how is it my fault?

178
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,392
I can't explain it.

179
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:01,436
But you're the key to this.

180
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,063
I knew you'd be here.

181
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,482
This tower is part of my nightly patrol.

182
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:08,151
Now tell me what's going on.

183
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,281
<i>We know you're up there, Mr. Wayne.</i>

184
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,367
<i>We don't want to hurt you.</i>

185
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,452
<i>We just want to talk.</i>

186
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,535
The Mad Hatter?

187
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,663
Congratulations are in order,

188
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,915
I suppose. And you're right.

189
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,333
This is a dream,

190
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,294
a very special dream.

191
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,754
Then you know everything about me.

192
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,840
I do.

193
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:14,134
But I'm only part of your dream.

194
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:19,055
The mind-control apparatus
reveals nothing to the real world.

195
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:22,767
Its purpose is
to create an ideal world for you.

196
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,812
Then you're not the real Mad Hatter.

197
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,230
No.

198
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,649
Just a figment of your imagination.

199
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,777
But that doesn't mean I'm not real

200
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,863
in this dream world.

201
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,116
Make it stop. Bring me back.

202
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,204
I'm crushed.

203
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,041
You don't like the fantasy world
I've created for you?

204
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:47,459
It's not real.

205
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:54,132
Ah. Are you the dreamer
or merely part of someone's dream?

206
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,135
That was just the question

207
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,471
Tweedledee put to Alice
in <i>Through the Looking...</i>

208
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:01,890
This isn't some silly storybook!

209
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,225
Ah, but it is.

210
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,227
It's a beautiful story.

211
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,813
You have love, wealth, a family.

212
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,857
All you ever wanted.

213
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:13,943
Your own private Wonderland.

214
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,738
No!

215
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,490
I won't live a lie.

216
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,076
No matter how attractive you make it.

217
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,079
It's a moot point, my friend.

218
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,539
There's no way out of this.

219
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,709
Tell me how to wake up, or I'll...

220
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,587
Ha! You can't hurt a dream,
my good fellow.

221
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,881
And you can't wake up.

222
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,133
Stop fighting it.

223
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:42,430
You see?

224
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,849
In a moment, the police will be here.

225
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,478
Do you want to spend the rest
of your dream life in Arkham?

226
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:52,607
Open up, Mr. Wayne.

227
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,286
You're wrong.

228
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,663
There is a way out.

229
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,748
Now, wait just a minute.

230
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,084
You don't want to do anything foolish.

231
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,380
This isn't an ordinary dream.

232
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,549
What if you're wrong?

233
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:21,177
Then I'll see you in your nightmares.

234
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:27,767
Mr. Wayne, no!

235
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,742
No! You can't!

236
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,879
It's impossible!

237
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:59,507
No one's will is strong enough
to escape my dream machine!

238
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,468
Why?

239
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,179
Why did you do it?

240
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,723
You, of all people,

241
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:09,642
have the gall to ask me that?

242
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,812
You ruined my life!

243
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,692
I was willing to give you
whatever life you wanted

244
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:20,904
just to keep you out of mine.

245
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,332
Something for the lab boys to play with.

246
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:33,750
Any idea what it is?

247
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,251
Yes.

248
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,755
The stuff that dreams are made of.
