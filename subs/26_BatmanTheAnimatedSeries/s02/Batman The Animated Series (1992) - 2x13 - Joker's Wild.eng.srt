1
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,300
<i>Be sure the bulbs are spaced far enough
apart for proper root growth,</i>

2
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,386
<i>and remember to give the seedlings
plenty of sunlight.</i>

3
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,234
<i>Add just enough water. Then...</i>

4
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,070
Hey, I was watching that.

5
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,406
And now you're watching this.

6
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,578
<i>Next, a dog drinks milk
out of his owner's mouth.</i>

7
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:02,913
Change it back.

8
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,042
Oh, no, no, no. Don't want to.

9
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:08,169
Guard!

10
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:10,338
What's the problem?

11
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:16,010
Don't look now, Sonny Jim, but
the plant lady's gone wackers again.

12
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,013
He started it. I was just sitting here.

13
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:22,975
That's right. You're always blaming me.

14
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,144
And the children wonder why we fight.

15
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,271
Crazy.

16
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,940
I know you are, but what am I?

17
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:35,780
Okay, okay, you'll watch this quietly,
or you'll go back to your cells.

18
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:36,864
<i>Jawohl!</i>

19
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:38,616
I don't care.

20
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,872
You hold my hand, and I'll slug you.

21
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,208
Guard!

22
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,251
Just kidding. Just kidding.

23
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,545
Yeesh, Pammy, lighten up.

24
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:56,384
<i>This is Summer Gleeson live at
Gotham Palisades Boardwalk,</i>

25
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,843
<i>where it's opening day</i>

26
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,263
<i>at billionaire Cameron Kaiser's
latest showplace resort.</i>

27
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:06,102
<i>Total price tag for this
fun-seeker's mecca, nearly $300 million.</i>

28
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,271
<i>It's true, Summer.</i>

29
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,149
<i>I set out to create the most opulent
gambling resort in the world.</i>

30
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,151
After all, what's a few million
here and there

31
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,195
as long as my guests are happy?

32
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,907
<i>Gotham's elite have turned out
in style for the opening.</i>

33
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,284
<i>Bruce Wayne,
perhaps you can give us a hint</i>

34
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,663
<i>about the top secret theme
of Mr. Kaiser's new casino.</i>

35
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,541
<i>Looks like we'll find out
together, Summer.</i>

36
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:33,379
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the wait is over.</i>

37
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:35,631
<i>I officially welcome you, one and all...</i>

38
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,053
<i>To Jokers Wild.</i>

39
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,346
Say what?

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,820
<i>Oh, just disgusting.</i>

41
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,281
<i>Psst! Summer, we're on the air.</i>

42
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,702
<i>Oh, uh... There you have it.
Let's get a reaction from the guests.</i>

43
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:07,496
<i>- Uh, Mr. Wayne.
- No comment.</i>

44
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,423
<i>Mr. Kaiser, why build a casino
seemingly in honor</i>

45
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:20,384
<i>of one of history's
most notorious outlaws?</i>

46
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,344
<i>Summer, please.</i>

47
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,015
<i>My joker is a classic symbol,
long associated with cards and games.</i>

48
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:29,602
<i>I can't help it if there's a passing
resemblance to some criminal fruitcake.</i>

49
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:37,568
How dare that smug, preening fool
try to cash in on my image!

50
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,904
Now who should lighten up?

51
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,323
Don't get cute with me, Red.

52
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,534
He's ripping me off. I'll protest.

53
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,870
Yeah, I'll sue.

54
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:49,997
Then I'll rip his lungs out.

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,332
And I will, too.

56
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:53,709
Take it easy.

57
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,087
I feel dizzy.

58
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,424
Sick... Everything's spinning.

59
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,427
Oh! Need a doctor.

60
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,721
Oh, Joker?

61
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,474
Thanks for the smile.

62
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,160
Hang on. I'll get Dr. Bartholomew.

63
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,622
Yes. Hurry. Please.

64
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,045
Sucker.

65
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,600
What a maroon. Ha!

66
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,228
I know you are, but what am I?

67
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,440
The Joker!

68
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,782
Exit stage left, laughing all the way.

69
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,661
- Hey!
- Excuse me.

70
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,008
- There he is!
- Get him!

71
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:28,387
Step right up and play
everyone's favorite game,

72
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,472
"What's the Joker got in the pail?"

73
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,309
Maybe a deadly poison?

74
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,604
Or maybe just something
to make the floor nice and slippery.

75
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:39,565
- Hey!
- Look out!

76
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:46,030
I always did know how to make an exit.

77
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:50,576
Ta-da!

78
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,513
Don't try this at home, kids.

79
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:21,857
Peekaboo.

80
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,444
Sorry, no riders.

81
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:38,040
Now to treat Mr. Cameron Kaiser
to a real blowout opening.

82
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,054
I didn't mind driving down here

83
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:54,139
at a moment's notice
with your equipment.

84
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,977
And I was happy to dream up
a plausible alibi for your date.

85
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,356
But staying in this horrid place
pushes even my tolerance.

86
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:04,024
Mine too.

87
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,401
But I'm convinced

88
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,696
it wasn't Kaiser's original goal
to make a Joker-themed casino.

89
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:14,201
- See?
- But why the deception?

90
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,954
That's what I intend to find out.

91
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,359
"Camelot." Hmm.

92
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,707
Looks like Kaiser
broke the bank on this place.

93
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,964
What an interesting hobby
you've got, Cameron.

94
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,843
Hey, you.

95
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:37,159
Where are you? Come out and fight.

96
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,895
Jumpin' Jiminy Christmas.

97
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,945
It's an homage to me.

98
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,614
I'm kind of sorry I have to blow it up.

99
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,410
Go on and open table six.
We got players waiting.

100
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
Hmm.

101
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,793
Then again, all work and no play...

102
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,423
Good evening, folks.

103
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,387
The game is blackjack.

104
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,639
Joker's rules, of course.

105
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,606
Ooh! Blackjack already.

106
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,692
Lucky me.

107
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,235
- Hey.
- What?

108
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,444
Hold on.

109
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,155
Don't be sore losers.

110
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,073
<i>We're here to have fun.</i>

111
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,413
Mr. Kaiser, that dealer's
doing something screwy.

112
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,956
I'm calling security.

113
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,416
No. Wait.

114
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:12,379
<i>Ooh! Mercy me. Another blackjack.</i>

115
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:15,048
<i>One might think I had
an ace up my sleeve.</i>

116
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,051
Let him deal.

117
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,262
Yes, sir. You're the boss.

118
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,402
- Try your luck, friend?
- Why not?

119
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,363
Say, don't I know you?

120
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,241
Sure. Bruce Wayne.

121
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:42,784
Huh.

122
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,163
So this is how your family
made all those billions.

123
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,751
The secret's out. And you are?

124
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:54,755
Oh, just a nameless clown,
shuffling my life away.

125
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:59,301
Too bad it has to be in such
gruesome surroundings.

126
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,556
Don't care for the decor?

127
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,310
Not hardly. All those horrible faces
grinning at me.

128
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,271
That would do things
to my mind after a while.

129
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:13,982
Who says you have one?

130
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,779
Yeah, I'd be ready
for the laughing academy

131
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:22,074
if I had to stare
at that ugly clown all day.

132
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,827
- Why I ought to...
- Hit me.

133
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,877
Twenty.

134
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:38,507
Oh, lucky me. Twenty-one.

135
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,011
How nice. A little something
for the Wayne Charity Fund.

136
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,098
Good night.

137
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,608
He's here.

138
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,278
Place your bets, folks.

139
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:02,906
- You.
- Huh?

140
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,033
- Batman.
- It's Batman.

141
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,159
I don't believe it.

142
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,829
- It is Batman!
- What's he doing here?

143
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,998
Whoops! Time to cash out.

144
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,043
- Hey!
- Hey.

145
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,421
Stop that guy.

146
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:57,586
Here's where I get off.

147
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,130
Whoo!

148
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,812
Not bad for a starter,

149
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,607
but the real fireworks
are still to come.

150
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:28,241
Whoops! Coming through. Hot stuff.
One side, please.

151
00:14:43,673 --> 00:14:46,927
I wouldn't take odds on this place
lasting the night.

152
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,314
<i>Helipad.</i>

153
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,317
I want my personal 'copter
ready for takeoff in 20 minutes.

154
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,443
<i>Yes, sir, Mr. Kaiser.</i>

155
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,705
Going somewhere?

156
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,584
First you trash my penthouse,
then my casino.

157
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,908
You gonna wreck something else?

158
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,506
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you wanted this place destroyed.

159
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:30,387
After spending 300 million to build it?
That's not good business, my friend.

160
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,472
I've seen the unpaid bills.

161
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,933
Building this casino has bankrupted you.

162
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,853
That's why you turned it
into a target for the Joker.

163
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:41,106
Once he destroys it,
you'll collect the insurance money.

164
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,692
You hit the jackpot, Batman.

165
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,778
But I've got too much at stake
to be stopped now.

166
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:55,745
Ah! You again.

167
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:00,667
- What do we do with him, boss?
- Send him down to his friend.

168
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,969
Huh?

169
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,809
Kind of slow on the reflexes, eh, Batsy?

170
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:21,605
That car crash must have taken
more out of you than I thought.

171
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:37,579
Wakey, wakey.

172
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,344
Thought you'd like to be conscious
for your own demise.

173
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:55,263
I really put some effort into this one.

174
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,351
Once I spin the wheel,

175
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:00,977
you, the casino

176
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:05,815
and that strutting fool Kaiser
will all be blown sky-high.

177
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,984
Not bad, eh?

178
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:12,322
You won't get Kaiser.
He's been playing you for a patsy.

179
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,074
Eh?

180
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,576
He's counting on you
to blow this place up

181
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,994
so he can collect the insurance.

182
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,330
By the time you get clear,

183
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:22,582
Kaiser will be miles away,
laughing at you.

184
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,377
I hate it when you make sense.

185
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,218
I'll settle my score
with Kaiser, man to clown.

186
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,762
But that still doesn't
let you off the hook.

187
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,320
How about that, Bats?
Looks like your number's up.

188
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:35,530
- Get me out of here now!
- Yes, sir.

189
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,290
What happened?

190
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,003
Some clown jumped me
and grabbed my 'copter.

191
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:51,421
Mr. Kaiser's up there.

192
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:59,638
What are you circling for, you fool?

193
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,351
It was a scheme worthy of me, Kaiser.

194
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:09,064
The way you got me riled up
and turned me loose on this place.

195
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,902
You... You were supposed to
destroy the casino.

196
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,822
Yeah, but then I realized
it'd be more fun to get rid of you

197
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,407
and run the show myself.

198
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,409
But you can't!

199
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,748
Oh, please, Mr. Kaiser,
you of all people should've realized

200
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,667
there'd be a joker in the deck.

201
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,050
Why can't he ever stay dead?

202
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,244
Gotcha!

203
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,666
Yes.

204
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,889
That's it. Chew him up and spit him out.

205
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,908
Stop! You'll kill us all!

206
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:29,370
<i>And so it ended for both ex-billionaire
Cameron Kaiser and the Joker.</i>

207
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:32,207
Ah! Enough of this rubbish.

208
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,291
Hey!

209
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:35,001
We were watching that.

210
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,965
<i>And was returned to Arkham.</i>

211
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,719
Ah, you bunch of no-good,
whacked-out losers.

212
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,970
You make me sick.
