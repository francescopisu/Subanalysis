1
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,559
Huh?

2
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,187
What the...

3
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:19,972
Excellent.

4
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:30,107
Hey, you. Stop!

5
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,769
What?

6
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,109
When you are ready.

7
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,163
Again.

8
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,256
Sorry,
some of us aren't perfect.

9
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,258
Master Bruce, I'm afraid

10
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:40,177
there's been another robbery
of a Wayne Enterprises company.

11
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,847
That's the sixth one
in less than two weeks.

12
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,557
Seventh.

13
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,683
Where, Alfred?

14
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,245
I didn't see him.

15
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,603
I was doing the closing report.

16
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,690
The next thing I knew,
I woke up with a headache.

17
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,441
Guard said he was dressed in black.

18
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:54,942
Same guy all right.

19
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,232
Good morning, Commissioner.

20
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,612
I wish.

21
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,656
He left something behind this time,
Mr. Wayne.

22
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,450
Deadly little thing.

23
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,868
Mean anything to you?

24
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,872
Don't touch it.
You'll break the evidence chain.

25
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,566
The match is over.

26
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,109
Kyodai is the victor.

27
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,904
Don't be depressed, Wayne-san.

28
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:44,033
You're not bad for a rich man's
pampered son.

29
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:54,126
There's always someone better,
Kyodai Ken.

30
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,212
Now apologize for your remark.

31
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:17,900
Mr. Wayne. Mr. Wayne!

32
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:20,361
Do you have any idea

33
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:23,614
why someone has been robbing
and sabotaging your businesses?

34
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,324
Two buildings burned down,

35
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:26,408
another blown up.

36
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,369
This one's computer system's wrecked.

37
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,102
Miss Gleeson, how do you know that?

38
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,665
A good reporter
has sources, Commissioner.

39
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:34,375
Any comment, Mr. Wayne?

40
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,460
If you'll excuse me.

41
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:43,175
Hmph.
You can't ignore the press, Mr. Wayne.

42
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,223
Hey, Bruce, wait up.

43
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,335
Listen, it will only take a minute

44
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,435
to get into my costume.

45
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,020
Not this time, Dick.

46
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,363
What's with him?

47
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,781
Bat got his tongue?

48
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,241
You know Master Bruce.

49
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,243
He's not one
to discuss his feelings.

50
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,661
Isn't that the truth.

51
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:12,580
Something's eating him, Alfred.

52
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:14,248
I don't know what.

53
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,958
Yet.

54
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,152
You practice as a man obsessed.

55
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm not good enough, Yoru Sensei.
I lost!

56
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,211
Everyone loses now and again.

57
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,339
I have to be the best there is,

58
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,715
no matter what it takes!

59
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:08,886
Defeat can be more instructive
than victory.

60
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,969
So, the famous Batman.

61
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,054
I am honored.

62
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,682
However, my business is not with you.

63
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,976
Leave and you may live.

64
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,145
Stay and...

65
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,042
Listen, dipstick.

66
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,460
Batman's my pal.

67
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,045
He can be a major jerk,

68
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,212
but you gotta love him.

69
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,215
And nobody tries to fillet him
when I'm around.

70
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,595
Another time then.

71
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,209
How does he do that?

72
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,340
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

73
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,801
Come on.
There's nothing more to do here.

74
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,596
"Thanks for saving my bacon, Robin."

75
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,848
"Hey, no problemo, Batman."

76
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:07,397
I thought samurai live
by a code of honor.

77
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,192
That gas gun wasn't exactly
according to Hoyle.

78
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,610
He's not samurai.

79
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,613
He's ninja. They're spies and assassins.

80
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:16,548
Their only code is to get the job done.

81
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,492
I know him.

82
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:19,743
Say what?

83
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,498
He and Bruce Wayne were students
together in Japan,

84
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:26,083
a long time ago.

85
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,001
His name is Kyodai Ken.

86
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:29,920
He was good.

87
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,088
Yeah? How good?

88
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,339
Good.

89
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:34,508
I see.

90
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,427
I'm sure there is more to these crimes

91
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,388
against Bruce Wayne than meets the eye.

92
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,849
What do we know
about the Bruce, after all?

93
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,600
One of the richest men on the planet,

94
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,978
but he comes off
like the ultimate Boy Scout.

95
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,147
I think I'll just pop over

96
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,566
to the Wayne charities reception tonight

97
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,776
and see if I can't get some answers.

98
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:55,070
Be careful, Summer.

99
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,947
Wayne's got mondo clout in Gotham.

100
00:10:57,364 --> 00:10:58,365
Hey, Harry,

101
00:10:58,615 --> 00:10:59,741
I'm a big girl.

102
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:07,416
Alfred, do you know anything
about Bruce's training in Japan?

103
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,209
Of course, dear boy.

104
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,628
I was there. Lovely country.

105
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,297
I especially like the tea.

106
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,924
You ever hear of somebody
named Kyodai Ken?

107
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,342
Oh, indeed.

108
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,012
He was the only student
at the martial art school

109
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,472
who could consistently defeat
Master Bruce.

110
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,349
A bad egg, that one.

111
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:27,352
I think Bruce is worried
he can't take this ninja.

112
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,104
He won't admit it, of course.

113
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,773
He never admits fears, Master Dick.

114
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,442
Haven't you learned that by now?

115
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:39,698
Ah, Master Bruce.

116
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:40,782
I...

117
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,868
I'll be at the museum.

118
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,661
I should be back by midnight.

119
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:48,207
Do you think he heard us?

120
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:49,541
Who can tell?

121
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,711
Good thing
I decided to practice tonight.

122
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,631
Yoru Sensei would hate
to lose that blade.

123
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,466
It's 500 years old.

124
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,718
True, and worth a fortune.

125
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:44,096
I don't need it
to take care of you, Wayne.

126
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:56,608
Stop!

127
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,488
You have dishonored the dojo, Kyodai.

128
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,116
You no longer have any place here.

129
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:05,367
Go!

130
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,287
You will pay for this, rich man's son.

131
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,455
I'll take all that you hold dear,

132
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,582
and then I will destroy you!

133
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,419
Why have you been following me
all evening?

134
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,742
How did you... Look.

135
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,577
I know you don't like me much.

136
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,162
But I have a job to do.

137
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,788
It's late, Miss Gleeson.

138
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,467
I did some research, Mr. Wayne.

139
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,427
I know you spent some time in Japan.

140
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:08,055
Do you think
this ninja person is connected to that?

141
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:10,974
Have a nice trip, Mr. Wayne.

142
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:44,591
You really think
this is a good idea, Master Dick?

143
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,635
Bruce is hours overdue, Alfred.

144
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:47,761
It's not like him.

145
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:49,346
There's a tracker in his car.

146
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:53,016
I'll feel better once I check it out.

147
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,690
Godspeed, lad.

148
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,247
Huh?

149
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:18,458
Ah, the rich man awakens.

150
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,293
Remember me?

151
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,672
I remember you, Kyodai.

152
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:26,133
Well, you should recall the man
you ruined.

153
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,803
I was forced to become a thief
after I was cast out of the dojo.

154
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,513
As I remember it,

155
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:34,599
being a thief was what got you
thrown out in the first place.

156
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:38,520
Of course, you never had to worry
about money, Wayne.

157
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:41,064
A society parasite feeding off others.

158
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,358
Flabby, soft, weak.

159
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,361
It is too easy to defeat you.

160
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,158
Where am I?

161
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,537
I've stolen your bank codes
at each theft.

162
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,372
Soon I will have them all.

163
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:01,042
Then I'll transfer your money
to my own accounts.

164
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,335
I don't get it.

165
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,255
You mean you're nothing
but a common thief?

166
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,675
Not a common thief, woman.

167
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,052
A great thief. The best.

168
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,014
And now the game is about to end.

169
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,617
Ah, way to go, Dick.

170
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,744
Master crime fighter.

171
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,625
It appears we have an unexpected guest.

172
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,376
I'll be back.

173
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,892
Isn't it past
your bedtime, boy?

174
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:01,102
Let's just see who's going sleepy-by

175
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,729
in the next couple of minutes, huh?

176
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,857
This isn't the movies, boy.

177
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,742
Enough of this.
I have business I must attend to.

178
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,392
Ah!

179
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,947
Oh, really?

180
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,593
You have gone soft, Wayne.

181
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:59,095
Even a white belt could avoid
that throw.

182
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,810
Tired, Mr. Wayne?

183
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,896
I haven't even broken a sweat yet.

184
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:09,522
Get up!

185
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,319
Hang in there, Bruce.

186
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:21,993
Stop it! Can't you see
he's no match for you?

187
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,787
He never was.

188
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,676
I have had enough exercise
for one night.

189
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,969
Now it ends, Wayne.

190
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,105
Hey!

191
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,079
Yes!

192
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,210
Gotten a second wind, have you?

193
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,756
Good. This will make your defeat
all the more satisfying.

194
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,591
Shut up and fight.

195
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,774
You were right about one thing, Kyodai.

196
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,359
Now it ends.

197
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,227
So, what did you tell Summer?

198
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,813
That Batman arrived
and took care of the ninja.

199
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,981
That's true enough.

200
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:18,485
The police couldn't find any trace
of Kyodai Ken.

201
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,861
You think he escaped?

202
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:22,030
Ninjas are very resourceful.

203
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:23,698
Do you think he might return?

204
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:24,949
It doesn't matter.

205
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,326
I defeated him once.

206
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:28,495
If necessary, I can do it again.

207
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,039
He had you worried for a while though,
didn't he?

208
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:34,250
Thanks for your help.

209
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,859
It would have been harder to defeat him
with Summer watching.

210
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,589
Maybe even impossible.
