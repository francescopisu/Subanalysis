1
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:31,382
"Where tracks and golf balls roll
and wind."

2
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:37,597
"Round colored banners of all kind."

3
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,102
"Here, new instructions you will find."

4
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,105
<i>You've come
to the right place, Mr. McWhirter.</i>

5
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,608
<i>You won't be able to find me.</i>

6
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,360
Just follow the sound of my voice.

7
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,907
Who the devil are you?

8
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:02,788
Well, for a diplomatic courier,
you're not very diplomatic, are you?

9
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,958
If you're my contact,
what's the countersign?

10
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,711
Patience, patience.

11
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,023
<i>All your questions will be answered,
dear boy,</i>

12
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,258
<i>if you'll simply follow
the running lights.</i>

13
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,772
Okay, I'm here. Now what?

14
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:40,326
<i>Now then, about that
collection of bearer bonds</i>

15
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,161
<i>you're supposed to transport,</i>

16
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,497
if you'll just tell me
where I can find them,

17
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:47,541
<i>you might get out of here alive.</i>

18
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,471
All right! All right, I'll tell you!

19
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,474
<i>Good call. Now, hurry up.</i>

20
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:07,770
I hate it when people talk
with their mouth full.

21
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,906
All we know is this, last night,
the International Relief Consortium

22
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,826
was supposed to receive a delivery
from one of their couriers.

23
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,079
This guy. Name's McWhirter.

24
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:28,541
He's lucky to be alive.

25
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:31,460
He was supposed to pick up
and deliver a donation.

26
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,089
A diplomatic pouch containing
$750,000 in bearer bonds

27
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,258
earmarked for humanitarian aid...

28
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,678
To starving refugees in Eastern Europe.
Yeah, I know.

29
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,597
Only McWhirter never showed up.

30
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:46,517
Somebody else got to the bonds
before he did.

31
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,977
And now they're missing.

32
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:52,022
The same somebody who lured him into
that quicksand trap you mentioned?

33
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:55,568
You know who that sounds like,
don't you? Wormwood.

34
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:56,861
The Interrogator.

35
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,113
The guy who specializes in
using deathtraps

36
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,532
to pry information out of his victims?

37
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,910
Terrific. Look up "slippery"
in the dictionary,

38
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,787
and you get Josiah Wormwood.

39
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,498
Well, I guess if anyone can
pin something on him

40
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,500
and make it stick, you can.

41
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:15,796
Maybe. Right now, though,
we're not even sure he's in town.

42
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,592
But I think I know which one
of Wormwood's associates

43
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,844
might be able to give me
that information.

44
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,559
Oh, yeah, I remember this clown.

45
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,935
Nothing but a two-bit con man.

46
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,521
But a continental type, a real smoothie,

47
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,732
<i>the kind who'll do anything
for a free meal.</i>

48
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,193
<i>Calls himself "The Baron."</i>

49
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,241
Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest speaker this evening

50
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,869
Baron Waclaw Jozek.

51
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,385
Madam President, honored guests,

52
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,888
this is a rare pleasure for me.

53
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,975
Unaccustomed as I am to being
sought after...

54
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,567
No, no, no!

55
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:25,032
No, no, no!

56
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,957
How dare you manhandle me.

57
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,835
I want information from you.

58
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,880
By the way,
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

59
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,936
That's all you have on
your friend Wormwood?

60
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,272
I've told you all I know.

61
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,527
What more do you want?
Let me down.

62
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,196
Just one more thing, Baron.

63
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,366
I suggest that for your health

64
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:13,706
you take a vacation,
somewhere far away from Gotham City.

65
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,183
Come in.

66
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,615
This had better
be important, Waclaw.

67
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,493
It is, to me.

68
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:04,632
I want the Batman's cape and cowl.

69
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,092
And I want you to get them for me.

70
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:11,764
Hmm. Humble the legendary Batman?

71
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,808
I must admit,
it is an intriguing challenge.

72
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,436
But I'm afraid I can't contain
my curiosity.

73
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:21,023
I must know, what do you want them for?

74
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,070
I will be glad to tell you that,
dear Wormwood,

75
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,240
if you'll tell me how you got
those bearer bonds

76
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,285
away from
the International Relief Consortium.

77
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,664
I don't know what you're talking about.

78
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,709
Have it your way.

79
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:43,003
In that case, I will say

80
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:47,466
only that you will be very well paid
to do as I request

81
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,261
without further questions.

82
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,520
All right, I'll get you
the Batman's cape and cowl.

83
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,397
That won't be difficult.

84
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:05,484
He is only human, after all.

85
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,217
Got a new toy, I see.

86
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,928
I figure it might come in handy.

87
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,973
It might get you in trouble
with the mayor.

88
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,725
Let me worry about the mayor.

89
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,852
Here, have a look at this.

90
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,445
"Where iron horses go to rot
and children toot their horns a lot..."

91
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:52,948
"A damsel's pleas shall come to naught."

92
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,700
Do you know what it means?

93
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,375
Don't you?

94
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,172
Looking for someone, Batman?

95
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,800
<i>Sorry, you won't find me in there.</i>

96
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,469
<i>However, you will find</i>

97
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:56,929
<i>a trap!</i>

98
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,943
<i>Now then, you have approximately
one minute to save that young woman.</i>

99
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:24,748
But I'll remove her from jeopardy

100
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,877
if you simply surrender
your cape and cowl.

101
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:32,422
<i>You can push it through the little
opening at the base of the engine door.</i>

102
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,008
<i>Thirty seconds left, Batman.</i>

103
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,723
Fifteen seconds.

104
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:46,145
<i>Help! Please, help!</i>

105
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,490
<i>One second left.</i>

106
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,454
A hologram?

107
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,500
<i>Do you have the items?</i>

108
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,234
Uh, no.

109
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,278
Uh, the first apparatus...

110
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,239
<i>The trap at the old railway exhibit?</i>

111
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,658
<i>Yes. He beat it.</i>

112
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:44,161
So there will have to be others?

113
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,833
Only one. And this time,
I shall put the man himself in jeopardy.

114
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,587
I have a facility at
De Larues Wax Museum

115
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,548
that will serve our purposes nicely.

116
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,593
Just see that you succeed.

117
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:04,431
Oh, I will. And once you have what
you want, you must tell me why...

118
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:06,058
Well!

119
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,148
"Where Washington and young Babe Ruth"

120
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,776
"stand side by side
with John Wilkes Booth"

121
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:19,279
"Batman will find a plan uncouth."

122
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,907
Well, what do you think this one means?

123
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,744
Those famous figures standing
around together?

124
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,080
De Larues Wax Museum, what else?

125
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,374
Oh. Of course.

126
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,732
<i>Over here, Batman.</i>

127
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:00,404
<i>That's it. Come right in.</i>

128
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:12,374
Now, if I might call your attention

129
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:15,585
to the panel sliding open
along the ceiling.

130
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:19,840
<i>It's uncovering
a 20,000-watt halogen bulb.</i>

131
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,511
<i>I don't actually know how hot
20,000 watts make a room,</i>

132
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,514
<i>but I do know that it melts wax.</i>

133
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,070
And eventually, it will melt you.

134
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:10,140
Of course, you can save yourself simply
by giving me your cape and cowl.

135
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,311
<i>After all, it looks like your weapons
are covered with wax.</i>

136
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,146
No hurry. I'll wait.

137
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,151
<i>Oh, very inventive.
Do you suppose it will work?</i>

138
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:48,553
<i>Congratulations. But don't breathe
too deeply, Batman.</i>

139
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,390
<i>It seems that when you shattered
the lamp,</i>

140
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:56,770
<i>you triggered the release of a toxic
nerve gas from a tank in the ceiling.</i>

141
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,690
Now, your cape and cowl, please.

142
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,197
All right. All right. Turn off the gas.

143
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:09,866
You win.

144
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:28,093
<i>Ah. Nothing like
a breath of fresh air, eh, Batman?</i>

145
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:35,100
<i>And now, your cape and cowl, please.</i>

146
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,899
Satisfied?

147
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,527
Actually, no.

148
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:50,198
I wonder if you would put those down
neatly over here, by the light.

149
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,372
<i>A second mask?</i>

150
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:02,752
<i>Not as confident as we'd seem then,
are we?</i>

151
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:07,757
<i>Hmm. Well, keep your silly identity.
These are all I require.</i>

152
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,569
Stop stalling, Jozek.

153
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,573
I've got the goods.

154
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,867
Have you got my certified check?

155
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,411
I have indeed.

156
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,582
Ah, but first,
let us drink to our success.

157
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,668
On one condition.

158
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:49,049
Will you tell me why you wanted
Batman's cape and cowl, finally?

159
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:54,930
Ah, but you know my condition.
You must tell me your secret.

160
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,849
Then I will tell you mine.

161
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,355
What did you do
with those bonds?

162
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,445
And who commissioned their theft?

163
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,493
If you really want to know,

164
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,956
an agent of the Quirian Emirates
will get the bonds

165
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:25,085
from a locker
at Pan-Europa Airways tomorrow

166
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:28,505
when I meet him there to give him
this key.

167
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:35,845
Now, what will you do
with the cape and cowl?

168
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,230
I am going to wear them.

169
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,903
You're not Jozek?

170
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:59,202
You were playing. Playing me for a fool.

171
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,497
From the day you first walked in here.

172
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:11,673
It was you I was dealing with all along!

173
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,091
Give me the key.

174
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,581
<i>If you really want to know,</i>

175
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,120
<i>an agent of the Quirian Emirates...</i>

176
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,165
The bugs in the room picked up
the whole story on tape.

177
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:52,667
<i>At Pan-Europa Airways tomorrow.</i>

178
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:57,005
- Thank you, Commissioner.
- Thank you.

179
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:03,386
And thank Jozek for the use of the hall,
if he ever returns from Europe.

180
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:10,643
When we collared the Quirian agent
at the airport, he sang like a bird.

181
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,772
And he fingered you as the guy
who was gonna sell him the bonds.

182
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,691
Oh, I almost forgot.

183
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,943
This came for you.

184
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:28,411
"Confinement will speed your reform.
But long, cold nights will be the norm.

185
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,790
"So here's a thing to keep you warm"?

186
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,667
Well.
