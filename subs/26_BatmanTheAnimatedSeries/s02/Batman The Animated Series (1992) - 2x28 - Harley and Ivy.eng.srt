1
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,882
You jerks!

2
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:49,525
Ah! The wind in my hair
and the Batman at my heels.

3
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:53,321
It's the kind of night that
makes you glad to be alive.

4
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,531
Right, Harley girl?

5
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,409
Sure thing, Mr. J.

6
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,502
Quick! Turn here!

7
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,798
- But, boss, that's...
- I said, turn!

8
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:14,383
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:33,527
Why didn't you tell me
someone put a hill there?

10
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,906
- I tried, but...
- Never mind. Just hand me the gun.

11
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:41,494
Come on! Come on!

12
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,914
Here.

13
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,291
Hey, Batsy!

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,794
This is where I leave you flat.

15
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,843
You nincompoop!

16
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,305
You didn't say which gun.

17
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,125
Let's go. Let's go!

18
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,841
If he wants the car that bad,
he can have it.

19
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,854
Next time, clown.

20
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,779
No, we didn't get the diamond.

21
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:02,783
The "Dork Knight" showed up
before we even got to the museum.

22
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,202
I had a great shot at him, too,

23
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:10,833
except my dear little Harley Quinn
handed me the wrong gun!

24
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,921
But, pudding, it was kind of funny
watching you shoot at him

25
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,673
with the "bang" flag.

26
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,680
Funny?

27
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:29,268
You presume to tell me what
I should think is funny?

28
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,937
In fact, when have you ever

29
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,523
contributed a worthwhile idea
to this gang?

30
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:37,943
Well,
I did get us away from Batman.

31
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,029
Huzzah!

32
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,364
The kid gets lucky,
and she wants a medal!

33
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,827
Maybe I should just let
you run the gang.

34
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,080
Maybe you're a better crook
than the rest of us put together.

35
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:51,832
Maybe

36
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,667
not.

37
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,565
Fine! I'll show you! You'll be sorry!

38
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,026
I'll pull a big heist,
and I'll be laughing at you.

39
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:21,445
Ha! Ha! You hear? Laughing!

40
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,705
I miss him already.

41
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,491
Piece of cake.

42
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:15,875
Mr. J will just plotz when I give him...

43
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,254
No. I'm keeping it for myself.

44
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:22,756
Maybe.

45
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:37,313
The heck with it!

46
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,087
Nice work, butterfingers.

47
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,090
Why didn't you just turn on
the Bat signal while you were at it?

48
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,676
I wasn't trying to get caught.

49
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,595
Could've fooled me.

50
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:13,307
Hey! Aren't you that plant lady,
Poison Oakie?

51
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,601
Ivy. Poison Ivy.

52
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,144
Sorry.

53
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,730
Harley Quinn. Pleased to meet you.

54
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,741
This is not a good time
to get acquainted.

55
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,368
Freeze!

56
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,670
Any ideas?

57
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,674
What you got in the bottles?

58
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,593
Plant toxins
from the museum lab.

59
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:52,638
Good enough.

60
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,519
Heads up!

61
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,113
Stop in the name of the law!

62
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:11,156
Not tonight, baby.

63
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:15,911
Get in the car!

64
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,287
What car?

65
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,792
That car.

66
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:31,510
- Yes!
- Yes!

67
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,930
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

68
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,070
I hate shots!

69
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:52,072
I hate shots!

70
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:55,534
Now, now. You're
not immune to poison like I am

71
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:59,913
and you won't last 10 minutes
here in Toxic Acres without my antidote.

72
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:10,007
You'd think after living with
Mr. J, I'd be used to a little pain.

73
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:12,968
Why do you put up with that clown?

74
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:16,638
Don't get me wrong. My pudding's
a little rough sometimes,

75
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:18,849
but he loves me, really.

76
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,351
Sure he does.

77
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,146
You're just one big forgiving doormat,
aren't you?

78
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,690
I am not a doormat.

79
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,442
Am I?

80
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,737
If you had a middle name,
it would be "Welcome."

81
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:38,243
But cheer up, kid. You just need some
lessons in good old female self-esteem.

82
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:42,998
In other words, let's play with the boys
on our terms.

83
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,048
And now, gentlemen,
if there is no new business,

84
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,674
I propose we adjourn to...

85
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,802
A moment, please, Mr. Chairman.

86
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,730
- Who is that?
- A woman, here?

87
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,891
Outrageous!

88
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,977
See here, young lady,
is this some kind of joke?

89
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:06,021
The joke, my dear chairman,

90
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,359
is this obsolete, sexist mockery
you call a men's club.

91
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,569
Now, I ask you,

92
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,198
what kind of adventurers refuse
to admit women?

93
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,535
- What does she know?
- That is ridiculous.

94
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,870
Get her out of here.
How dare she?

95
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,670
Still, if it's excitement
you boys crave...

96
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:33,799
What is this?

97
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,884
- Let go!
- Stop!

98
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:44,768
That should keep you big strong men
busy while we weak little girls

99
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,854
loot your trophy room.

100
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,815
Gee, Red. You got style!

101
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,983
This is true.

102
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,037
What did you make? What did you make?

103
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,499
Steamed chard and beet juice. Hmm! Yum!

104
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,502
Gee, green.

105
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,546
My favorite color.

106
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:11,897
No offense, Red,
but I'm not very hungry.

107
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,318
Somehow I don't feel
like my old perky self.

108
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,570
Something's missing.

109
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:24,034
Will you stop? I can't believe you're
still mooning over that psychotic creep.

110
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:28,038
Well, maybe I'd feel better
if I knew he missed me, too.

111
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,631
Harley!

112
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:41,760
This place is going
to blinking blue blazes.

113
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,263
Anybody seen my socks?

114
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,556
Harley!

115
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,602
They snapped at me!

116
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,312
What's going on, Roc?

117
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:56,858
The place is a mess, no one's fed
the hyenas, and I can't find my socks!

118
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,402
Where's Harley?

119
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,280
You canned her,
boss, remember?

120
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,074
So? She's always come back before.

121
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,951
Gee,

122
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,287
I guess you ain't seen the papers then.

123
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,415
Papers? What are you babbling about?

124
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:44,364
I remember when I would go driving
like this with Mr. J.

125
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:47,117
"Mr. J, Mr. J."

126
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,870
Change the record, Harl.

127
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:52,873
You want to be some wacko's victim
the rest of your life?

128
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:01,882
Well, hello.

129
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,509
I think I'm in love.

130
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:06,636
Ahooga! Ahooga!

131
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,599
Excuse me, boys.

132
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:15,312
Didn't your mommies tell you that's not
the nice way to get a lady's attention?

133
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:19,608
Oh! And what are you gonna do? Spank us?

134
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:23,278
That's right, pigs.
And here's the paddle.

135
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,872
There may be hope for you yet.

136
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:00,982
Choosing a weekend date, sir?

137
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,611
This is one sister act
that's hard to follow, Alfred.

138
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,365
Only clue I have is this soil analysis
from their tire tracks.

139
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,077
Hmm.

140
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:16,123
Contains the same compounds
you'd find in a toxic waste dump.

141
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,918
Then may I suggest an accessory
this evening?

142
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,139
<i>What?</i>

143
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,307
Mr. J?

144
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,726
Harley?

145
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,647
Hi, pudding. You still angry with me?

146
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,027
Honey, baby, pumpkin pie.

147
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:48,155
You know I can't hold a grudge.

148
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,657
- Where are you?
- With a friend.

149
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,785
Look, I can't talk, but I wanted
to let you know I'm okay.

150
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,706
Oops. Gotta go.
I'll talk to you soon.

151
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,626
Sooner than you think.

152
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,088
- What's up?
- Wrong number.

153
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,010
Evening, ladies.

154
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,845
Playtime's over.

155
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,764
Land o' Goshen, Harleen.

156
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,433
Look who's come a-courting.

157
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,643
Looks like he's got us.

158
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,020
Looks like!

159
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,571
Poor Batman. All trussed up.

160
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,240
And no place to go.

161
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,911
- Yes!
- Yes!

162
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,835
Here we have
the typical male aggressor,

163
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,381
fittingly imprisoned within the bonds
of female domestic slavery.

164
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,515
And, frankly, folks,
he's never looked better.

165
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,266
Admit it, darling,

166
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,062
you didn't think two women
were capable of bringing you down.

167
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,274
Man or woman,
a sick mind is capable of anything.

168
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,778
A very enlightened statement, Batman.

169
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,405
We'll carve it on your headstone.

170
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,492
Aloha, sucker.

171
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,749
Hey, did you leave the lights on?

172
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,510
My, haven't you been
the busy little bees.

173
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,804
Pudding?

174
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,558
You were out, so we just made
ourselves at home.

175
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:41,226
Hope you don't mind.

176
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,478
You found me!

177
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:45,313
So much for self-esteem.

178
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,612
I hope you realize
we're on a toxic waste dump.

179
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:56,616
I'd say you've got 10 minutes
to clear out before the fumes do you in.

180
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,245
She's right, boss.

181
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:01,955
I'm feeling kind of...

182
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:03,498
Sick.

183
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,125
Hold it in, Rocco.

184
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:10,880
I'm only staying long enough
to collect what's mine.

185
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,592
Hey!

186
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,073
Ooh! Look at the goodies.

187
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:39,367
That's ours, you louse!

188
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,622
Pammy, I wouldn't
leave you empty-handed.

189
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:46,541
Since you like flowers so much...

190
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,002
Oh, Pudding, no!

191
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,631
You can have mine!

192
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,052
Oh!

193
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:58,219
Red!

194
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:05,060
It doesn't work on me.

195
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,742
Get them!

196
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:51,898
Oh, Batsy!

197
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,388
Stop shooting, you lunatic.

198
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,036
We're sitting on a powder keg.

199
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,771
Oops. Dopey me.

200
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,147
No man can take us prisoner.

201
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,449
All right, ladies.

202
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,867
Raise them.

203
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,251
That's it.

204
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:39,005
Next time I start a gang, no women.

205
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,715
Do you hear me?

206
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,383
No women!

207
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,303
I think we can still work it out.

208
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,721
Don't you?
