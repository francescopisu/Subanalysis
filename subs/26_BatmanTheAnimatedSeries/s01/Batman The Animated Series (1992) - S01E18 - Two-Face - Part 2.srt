1
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,941
Get away from me!

2
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:08,776
Thorne is mine!

3
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:10,611
<i>Previously on</i> Batman...

4
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,282
Look out, Harvey!

5
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,743
Harvey!

6
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,746
Now, you understand,
there's going to be some scarring.

7
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,674
Harvey...

8
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:03,956
This is it.
Rupert Thorne's bookie joint.

9
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,172
Good heads, we leave him alone.

10
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:14,967
Bad heads, we hit him hard.

11
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,362
Everybody, down!

12
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,741
I said, down!

13
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,045
Don't bother to adjust the picture.

14
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:54,465
For the next five minutes,
I'm in control.

15
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:55,925
Get the money.

16
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,310
Hey, look at this.

17
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,646
Must be
a couple of hundred silver dollars.

18
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,147
Bring it.

19
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,530
I'll take that.

20
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:19,865
Jewelry wasn't part of the plan.

21
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,576
- We gotta flip for it.
- What?

22
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,378
Good side, leave it.

23
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:33,838
But, Two-Face...

24
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,342
I said leave it!

25
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,646
Before I go, I want you all to give
Rupert Thorne a message for me.

26
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,697
How much did he take me for this time?

27
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,366
$200,000.

28
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,118
I thought we got rid of this guy.

29
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,287
Are you kidding? We created him.

30
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,457
Six months of this is long enough!

31
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,208
Spread the word.

32
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,253
I'm putting out a contract. $1 million.

33
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,881
No. Make it $2 million.

34
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:23,137
A million dollars a face
to the man who brings me Two-Face.

35
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,939
Harvey.

36
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,163
Stay back!

37
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,170
Harvey, please, let me help you.

38
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:00,007
You... You saw what was happening.

39
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,802
You knew something
was terribly wrong with me.

40
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,595
I thought you were my friend.

41
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,765
You should've been able to help me,
but you didn't.

42
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,101
Now, look at me!

43
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,770
But I tried, Harvey.

44
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:13,979
I...

45
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,733
Harvey!

46
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:21,862
Why couldn't you save me?

47
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,040
Why couldn't you save us, son?

48
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,857
So what are you
dreaming tonight, Harvey?

49
00:05:58,607 --> 00:05:59,984
Peaceful dreams?

50
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,652
Or nightmares?

51
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,904
Maybe both at once.

52
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,535
Sleep well, my friend.

53
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:13,163
Wherever you are,
whatever you've become,

54
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,624
I will save you.

55
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,501
I swear.

56
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,394
- Grace Lamont?
- Yes?

57
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,771
I'm Detective Leopold.

58
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,024
It's about your fiancé.

59
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,238
So, unless we can get to Harvey
before Thorne does,

60
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,823
he won't stand much of a chance.

61
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,034
I wish I could help,
but I haven't seen him

62
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:52,036
since that horrible day in the hospital.

63
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,663
I don't know where he is.

64
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,625
It is possible
that Harvey might try to see you.

65
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,336
If he does, you activate this beeper,

66
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,006
and we'll be able to trace the signal
to wherever you are.

67
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,098
It's all in your hands.

68
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,188
All we have to do now is wait.

69
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,565
What makes you so sure
Two-Face will come back here?

70
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,027
He'll come back. They always come back.

71
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,297
$64,800,

72
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,842
$64,900, $65,000.

73
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:55,933
You don't touch anything
until I tell you to, punk.

74
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,855
You always were
a couple of greedy little beggars,

75
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,776
even when I prosecuted you as DA.

76
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,498
What are you looking at?

77
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,837
Gee, Two-Face, if you miss her,
why don't you go see her?

78
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,339
Sure, we could even bring her here,
if you want.

79
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,358
Forget it.
We have more important things to do.

80
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,156
I've decided it's time to finish Thorne

81
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,699
once and for all.

82
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:55,367
You're gonna knock him off?

83
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,536
Let's just say, I'm gonna do to him

84
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:00,414
exactly what he did to me.

85
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:09,590
So you think you've discerned
a pattern to his crimes?

86
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:12,051
Just look at the places
he's robbed, Alfred.

87
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:17,181
Club 22, Gemini Jewelers,
the Two's Company Cafe.

88
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,516
Two's? My word!

89
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,352
Has anyone informed
the Second National Bank?

90
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,604
That won't be a target.

91
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,689
Every place Two-Face has robbed

92
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,942
is also a front
for Rupert Thorne's criminal activities.

93
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,738
Unfortunately, he's used up
all of Thorne's places.

94
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,366
Perhaps, he'll rob them twice.

95
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,327
A sort of double-or-nothing.

96
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,830
No. I think Two-Face
is through humiliating Thorne.

97
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,749
Now he wants him out of the way.

98
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,501
And I think I know how.

99
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,973
Keep your guard up, sir.
Harvey is no longer the fellow we knew.

100
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,643
I still feel that
somewhere inside that monster

101
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,311
is my old friend.

102
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,564
That may make him even more dangerous.

103
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,686
Hey, this looks like something.

104
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,605
"Rupert Thorne. Confidential."

105
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:53,610
For years, I tried to subpoena this.

106
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:58,198
"Money laundering, payoffs, blackmail."
It's all here.

107
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,327
I'll destroy Thorne with his file

108
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,163
just like he destroyed me with mine!

109
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,456
Come on, let's get out of here.

110
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,059
You're coming with me, Harvey.

111
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,898
I want to help you.

112
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,651
Help me? You don't know
anything about me.

113
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,820
I know that you have friends, Harvey.

114
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,822
Friends who love and care about you.

115
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,950
Harvey's friends are no friends of mine.

116
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,369
What about Grace?

117
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,621
Grace?

118
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,749
What do you know about Grace?

119
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:52,502
She still loves you, Harvey.
She keeps your picture.

120
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,796
Every day, she waits and prays.

121
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,506
She wants you back, Harv.

122
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,508
Hey, what's taking you guys...

123
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,927
Holy...

124
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,102
Come on, let's get out of here!

125
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:13,941
No, Harvey. Wait.

126
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,738
Let go of me!

127
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,087
Hey, there. You okay, Batman?

128
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,965
Looks like you took
a nasty fall there, fellow.

129
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,718
Harvey! Where's Harvey?

130
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,595
Ain't nobody here but us, son.

131
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,060
- You all right?
- Yeah.

132
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,853
I'm fine.

133
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:08,161
Wait till the police
get a load of this stuff.

134
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,414
It's even got his Swiss bank accounts.

135
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,763
Stop the car!

136
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,735
- Hello?
<i>- Grace?</i>

137
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,944
Harvey?

138
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,989
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I...

139
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,199
I wanna see you.

140
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,369
Yes! Yes, of course, darling. Where?

141
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,996
<i>Look out your window.</i>

142
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,168
<i>They'll bring you to me.</i>

143
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,927
Harvey, you know
that no matter what, I love you.

144
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,388
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

145
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,059
He did what?

146
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,902
If he gives those files
to the police, I'm ruined!

147
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:24,029
We've got to stop him now!

148
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:37,042
Grab your hat, Rupie,
and your checkbook.

149
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,586
Tonight may be our lucky night.

150
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,818
This way, ma'am.

151
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,408
In there.

152
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,008
Hello, Grace.

153
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,636
Harvey.

154
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,309
My name is Two-Face now.

155
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,727
No, Harvey.

156
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,438
This is my world now.

157
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,608
A dichotomy of order and chaos...

158
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,277
Just like me.

159
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,988
Harvey, what's happened to your mind?

160
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:51,032
Your feelings?
You used to listen to your feelings.

161
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,411
This is what I listen to now.

162
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,963
Chance, Grace.

163
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:06,673
Chance is everything.

164
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:10,969
Whether you're born or not,
whether you live or die,

165
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,929
whether you're good or bad,

166
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:16,183
it's all arbitrary.

167
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,934
That's nonsense, Harvey.

168
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,854
Was it chance
that made you District Attorney?

169
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:23,023
Was it chance
that made you fall in love with me?

170
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,734
Take control of your life, Harvey.

171
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:27,277
You don't need a coin.

172
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:29,404
And you don't need this.

173
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,868
You don't ever need to hide from me.

174
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,134
- I love you.
- Grace.

175
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:53,970
What is it?

176
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,400
At last we meet,

177
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:13,698
face to face... To face.

178
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,116
You!

179
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,669
You did very well,
leading us to your boyfriend.

180
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,213
Grace?

181
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:32,092
Now, now, she thought
she was alerting the police.

182
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:34,427
She wanted to save you.

183
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,638
I'm so sorry, Harvey.

184
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:43,019
So much for control, huh, Grace?

185
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,844
It ain't here, boss.

186
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,471
That file is here, all right.
Now, where is it?

187
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,558
Not a chance, you slime!

188
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,482
Such a pretty face, Harvey.

189
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,152
- Let her go!
- Give me the file.

190
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,675
- Get rid of them.
- But you said...

191
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,511
Your boyfriend first.

192
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:11,232
Batman!

193
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,903
This is the last time
you interfere with me.

194
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,884
No! Two-Face, don't!

195
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,886
- You can't let him.
- Harvey!

196
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,390
- What are you doing?
- Taking control of my life.

197
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:26,975
Let the law handle it.

198
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,518
The law?

199
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:31,980
Here's the only law!
The law of averages,

200
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,898
the great equalizer.

201
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,665
No! What have you done?

202
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,709
My coin, where is it?

203
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,003
I can't decide without...

204
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:58,131
Oh, no! It's got to be here!
It's got to!

205
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,842
I have to have it!

206
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:13,605
It's all right now, Harvey. I'm here.

207
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,329
Poor Harvey. So filled with anger.

208
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:30,705
Do you think there's any hope?

209
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,542
Where there's love,
there's hope, Commissioner.

210
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,090
Well, a little luck wouldn't hurt.

211
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:47,514
For you, Harvey.
