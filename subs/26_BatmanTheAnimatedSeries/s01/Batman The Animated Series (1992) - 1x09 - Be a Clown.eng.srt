1
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:23,583
Ever since my election,
I've promised the people

2
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,752
I'd build them a safe,
affordable place to live.

3
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:28,754
Gotham Towers is that place.

4
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,259
Your safety has always been
my prime concern.

5
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,929
And under my leadership,
no city will be safer

6
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,058
or more free of crime
than Gotham City...

7
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:46,105
- Look out!
- Run!

8
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,900
Batman!

9
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,452
Garbage collection is normally Monday,

10
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:44,580
but in your case,
I'm making an exception.

11
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,669
Batman, wait!

12
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,133
Regarding safety in the city, sir,
you were saying?

13
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,927
Well, I...

14
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,472
Well, what just happened
was an isolated incident.

15
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,892
There are just a few rotten apples

16
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:08,229
<i>giving an otherwise peaceful community
a bad name.</i>

17
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:12,274
<i>Do you include Batman
in those rotten apples, Mayor?</i>

18
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,484
<i>Absolutely.</i>

19
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:17,571
<i>He and criminals like the Joker
are cut from the same cloth.</i>

20
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,658
What? Compare me to Batman?

21
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:23,536
I got more style, more brains.

22
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,913
I'm certainly a better dresser.

23
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:30,418
<i>Furthermore, I intend to run every one
of these costumed freaks out of town,</i>

24
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,715
<i>and make all of Gotham City
as safe as my own mansion.</i>

25
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:37,633
Oh, really?

26
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,472
Well, we'll just see
how safe your mansion is,

27
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,725
you babbling bonehead.

28
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:52,773
Get a move on, Franklin.
It's almost time for the party.

29
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,233
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:59,113
Some very important people will be here,
and I don't want anything to go wrong.

31
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,282
By the way, have you seen my son?

32
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,535
Ladies and gentlemen,

33
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:07,955
I will now perform
my famous disappearing-wand trick.

34
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,540
Abracadabra.

35
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,676
Jordan, stop fooling
with those stupid magic tricks.

36
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,720
Your party is starting.

37
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,306
They're not stupid, and it's your party.

38
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,768
Nonsense. I've invited some children.

39
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:33,856
Yeah, your friends' kids.
I don't even know any of them.

40
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:36,066
I'm not going to argue with you,
young man.

41
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,652
I'll expect you downstairs
in five minutes.

42
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:43,032
Hello. Glad you could come.

43
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,869
Senator Finch. What a pleasant surprise.

44
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,040
Did you get a good shot of me
with the Senator?

45
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,833
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.

46
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,712
Smile, Jordan.
You'd think you're having a bad time.

47
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,590
- No kidding.
- Well, cheer up.

48
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,802
I've got a surprise coming,
which should be here by now.

49
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,764
Councilman Frye. And this must be Timmy?

50
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,724
Happy birthday. Where's the food?

51
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,310
Did someone say "food?"

52
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:16,315
I'm the guy with the goodies.

53
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,207
Mayor Hill, I presume.

54
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,752
Jekko. Jekko the Magnificent.

55
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,462
Pleased to... Ow!

56
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,425
Always gives the party a charge.

57
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,346
It's showtime!

58
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,932
All right.

59
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:54,311
Thank you! Thank you!

60
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:56,438
Where'd you learn that, Jekko?

61
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,649
From the great Prosciutto.

62
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,986
Now there was a ham.

63
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,866
How can I get to be
a great magician like you?

64
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,743
Well, there are three steps.

65
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:13,080
Step one, run away.

66
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,459
Step two,
find a magician with a great act.

67
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,336
And step three,

68
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,671
steal it.

69
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,050
That... That, that's okay.
I think I got it.

70
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,721
Bruce! Bruce Wayne!
How good of you to come.

71
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,765
Jordan will be so happy to see you.

72
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,643
I know the sooner I give him this,
the happier I'll be.

73
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,232
Could you show us more, please, Jekko?

74
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,818
Sure, birthday boy.

75
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,613
I'm saving the best for last.

76
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,948
Jordan, I've got more guests
for you to meet.

77
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,452
But, Dad,
Jekko was just going to show us a trick.

78
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:55,205
- Sorry, but Mr. Wayne is waiting and...
- I don't care about Mr. Wayne!

79
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,792
Hush. You'll do what I say. Now come on.

80
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,419
It's always what you want.

81
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:02,212
You! You! You!

82
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,561
Kids.

83
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,146
Turn that off!

84
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:26,153
Oh! Too bad for birthday boy.
This last trick is pure dynamite.

85
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,156
- Ta-da!
- What is it?

86
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,951
It's a birthday candle, Einstein.

87
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,662
Except this one blows you out.

88
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,167
Now scoot, you kids. Show's over.

89
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,544
Go find some goodies.

90
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,881
This trick's for the grown-ups.

91
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:02,648
It's time for Jordo to make his wish.

92
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:04,441
And mine, too.

93
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,072
Oh, my! A sparkler candle.

94
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:12,908
Keep watching and I'll, uh...

95
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:15,995
Get the birthday brat.

96
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,997
I don't know
where Jordan could have gone.

97
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,040
He was dying to see you.

98
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,835
- You know kids.
- Not really.

99
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:27,506
So long, Mayor. Got to go.
But I left them with a bang.

100
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:33,345
- That laugh...
- Good riddance, Jerko.

101
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,056
As I was saying... Hey.

102
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,621
- Watch out!
- Hey, pal!

103
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,001
Excuse me. Excuse me!
I'm sorry. Pardon me.

104
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:07,755
Coming through. Out of my way, please.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

105
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,465
Pardon me. Oops!

106
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,177
Aw.

107
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,147
I want answers!

108
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,734
Nobody makes a fool of me,
especially in my own home.

109
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,986
At least no one was hurt.

110
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,156
Mr. Mayor,
this is the real Jekko the Clown.

111
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,950
We found him tied up down the road.

112
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,413
Some maniac jumped me,
stole my wagon and my costume.

113
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,832
Mayor, where's Jordan?

114
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:09,274
TNT with your cake, sir?

115
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,485
Oh, I crack myself up!

116
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,407
Wow!

117
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:26,792
<i>Denying reports of a bomb blast
at his son's birthday party,</i>

118
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:31,505
<i>Mayor Hill insists the explosion
was caused by faulty electrical wiring.</i>

119
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,300
Yeah, right!

120
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,268
<i>The Mayor declined, however, to confirm
that his son, Jordan, is missing.</i>

121
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:45,727
Missing?

122
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:48,147
It's me, Jekko. I ran away.

123
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,649
You did what?

124
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,153
I, I want to be a magician, like you.

125
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:01,201
Well, kid, you got
step one right. Come on in.

126
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,204
I've been thinking about a protege.

127
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,958
It sure could be the Joker.

128
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,254
If only I'd been paying more attention,
he wouldn't have run away.

129
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,508
Take it easy, Mayor.
I'm sure the police will find Jordan.

130
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,093
I tell you, Wayne,

131
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:21,388
things are going to be different,
if only he'd come back.

132
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,933
<i>Where'd you learn that, Jekko?</i>

133
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,060
<i>From the great Prosciutto.</i>

134
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:31,690
<i>Now there was a ham.</i>

135
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:40,157
- But isn't swallowing a sword dangerous?
- Watch.

136
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,162
Hey! How did you do it?

137
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:49,666
Easy, kid.

138
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,376
It's a trick sword.

139
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,463
Now, you try it.

140
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,424
Uh-uh. You could get cut.

141
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:02,554
Hey! If it wasn't risky,
I wouldn't enjoy it.

142
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,061
What's that?

143
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,604
- Security, my boy.

144
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,316
You can't be too careful
in this part of town.

145
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,079
Well, if it ain't
the Caped Coconut.

146
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,040
My dad says Batman's no good.

147
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,876
Well, then I guess your dad's
not a total idiot.

148
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:36,838
What do you say
we play a little joke on Batman?

149
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:40,092
You can be my assistant.

150
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,345
Come on. This'll be a killer!

151
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,233
Come one, come all.

152
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:57,901
It's...

153
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:00,946
"Jekko the Jokester."

154
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,199
Ja... Jekko the Jokester.

155
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:05,784
Jordan!

156
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,466
This isn't a game, Jordan.
Where's Jekko?

157
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,104
Take a card, Batso.

158
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:36,773
Take all the cards!

159
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,279
Now it's my deal.

160
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,288
Not so fast!

161
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,541
A good magician always keeps an ace
up his sleeve.

162
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,210
This one always floors them!

163
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:05,927
Oh, my gosh.

164
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,849
We bagged a big one this time!

165
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,899
- He isn't hurt, is he?
- Hurt? Heavens!

166
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,278
You wound me to the quick.
The enemy merely slumbers.

167
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,490
No doubt dreaming of more foul deeds

168
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:29,409
to render upon the fair citizens
of Gotham.

169
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,080
But his fate is not for us to decide.

170
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,101
You're going to love this.

171
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,241
Wake up, Batman. You're on.

172
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:29,261
For your viewing pleasure,

173
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:33,181
we present the infamous water tank trap.

174
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,934
The great Houdini survived such a test.

175
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:40,021
Dare we demand less of the Batman?

176
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:50,407
- I don't like this, Jekko.
- Quiet, kid. It's a free ticket.

177
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,043
He did it! He got free.

178
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,255
They don't make straitjackets
like they used to.

179
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:06,423
I should know.

180
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,728
He can't get out. What's the trick?

181
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:22,606
That's just it. There is no trick!

182
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,066
No! He'll drown!

183
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:31,740
That's why they call it the finale!

184
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,619
Now sit down and enjoy the show.

185
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,044
Hey!

186
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,462
Come back!

187
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,689
Naughty, naughty.

188
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,901
You're making me miss the show.

189
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:28,255
All right, Joker.
Get ready for a little bat magic.

190
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,864
Oh, Jordo!

191
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,456
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

192
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:13,925
What?

193
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,356
Gotcha!

194
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,899
No!

195
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,278
Come here, you little...

196
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:37,282
On second thought...

197
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:43,079
I love a roller coaster.

198
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:46,625
Too bad you missed the train.

199
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,550
Fasten your seat belt,
it's going to be a bumpy ride.

200
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,807
You win the prize, Batman.

201
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,392
Catch the Kewpie!

202
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:11,066
Whee!

203
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:12,942
Butterfingers!

204
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,528
Kewpie-dewpie number two-ee!

205
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:27,499
You just don't like to play with dolls,
do you?

206
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,096
That must have been his stop.

207
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:45,308
On the contrary, Joker.
This is where you get off.

208
00:19:57,195 --> 00:20:00,073
Smell the roses, Batman.

209
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,672
He always knew how to make an exit.

210
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:22,429
- Oh, my gosh!
- Jordan!

211
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,685
Reach for me. You have to trust me.

212
00:20:35,316 --> 00:20:36,401
Now!

213
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:46,995
Whoa!

214
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,092
Can we go home now?

215
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,268
Dad! Daddy!

216
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:12,228
Jordan? Jordan.

217
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,649
Oh, you're back.

218
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,864
My boy is back.

219
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:28,578
- I'm so sorry for running away.
- Please forgive me for the party.

220
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,455
We can talk later.

221
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,999
Right now, I want to give you

222
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:36,628
the biggest birthday hug you ever got.
