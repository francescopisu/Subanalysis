You're out of here. You're history.
You're fired. <i>Comprende?</i>

You can't afford
to do without me, Mockridge.

15
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:48,376
I can if you're gonna
sue me for royalties.

16
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,587
I created
the <i>Riddle of the Minotaur</i> game.

17
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,256
This company is making millions
from my genius.

18
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:58,135
Competitron Software's success
didn't come from the product, Nygma.

19
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,137
Competitron has a corporate attitude.

20
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,307
Its strength is in the boardroom,
the deal, the contract.

21
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,686
Specifically the work-for-hire contract
you signed.

22
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:13,901
You are a fool, Mockridge,
to think you can get away with this.

23
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:18,072
Your amoral greed is no match
for an intellect like mine.

24
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,741
Oh, yeah? Then tell me something, Eddie.

25
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,953
If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?

26
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,083
So I've made sure that Competitron

27
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,836
owns all rights to

well heck, we just built a <i>Minotaur</i>

And if we'd had to pay royalties
on all that to the creator...

31
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,513
You can stop pitching, Mockridge.

32
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:45,516
I want this deal
so I can move Competitron to Gotham.

BRUCE: "Why do multi-million dollar
deals break down in the wasteland?"

41
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,154
It has to have a double meaning.

42
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:43,407
Master Dick,
that must be quite a computer game

the traps or the puns.

174
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,593
I guess this isn't
a good time to tell you.

175
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,595
Nobody's ever made it
to the center of the maze.

176
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:15,497
I'll find Mockridge if I have to tear
this place apart, Nygma.

177
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,290
RIDDLER: <i>I doubt it.</i>

178
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,751
<i>I made sure the perils are quite lethal.</i>

179
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,838
<i>You have eight minutes, gentlemen.</i>

180
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:26,383
<i>Then Mockridge becomes
the only good corporate shark.</i>

181
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:27,801
<i>A dead one.</i>

182
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:33,140
ROBIN: Great.

183
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,350
You don't happen to know Arabic, do you?

184
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,520
No, but I can translate it.

185

(BATMAN READING)

186
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,193
Oh, terrific.

187
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:47,070
Let's just pick one and move!

188
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:50,907
(GASPS)

189
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,369
We're going the wrong way!
'Cause here comes the Hand of Fate!

190
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,673
BATMAN: Of course! We went to the left,

191
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:09,718
but in the Arab world,
you always eat with your right hand.

192
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,348
We've gotta use one of these keys.

193
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,225
Yes, but which one?

194
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,395
And why are they labeled A, C and D?

195
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,730
Don't look at me.

196
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,398
BATMAN: Let's try D.

197
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,113
Look out!

198
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,034
Try another one.

199
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:35,118
Okay.

200
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,745
A this time.

201
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,330
ROBIN: No, wait!

202
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,875
Turn that key
and there'll be three blades.

203
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,503
- But how do you...
- It's the C key. Trust me.

204
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,639
It's a musical puzzle.

205
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:57,474
They key of D has two sharps.

206
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,100
The key of A has three.

207
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,853
But the key of C has no sharps.

208
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,231
(GASPS)

209
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,288
ROBIN: The shortest distance
between two points on a globe.

210
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,873
That one I remember.

RIDDLER: <i>One minute, Batman.</i>

212
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,379
Stay here.

213
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,214
- But that's the wrong door.
- I know.

214
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,550
- But the Hand!
- That's what I want.

(GRUNTS)

216
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,822
Batman! Batman, where are you?

217
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:57,701
<i>Forget it, kid.
I handed him his walking papers.</i>

218
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,454
Get on.

219
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,876
Just one question. How?

220
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,045
I linked it to my palmtop computer.

221
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,674
RIDDLER:
<i>That is grand-scale cheating, Batman.</i>

222
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,719
<i>You're not allowed
to tamper with the Hand of Fate.</i>

223
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:18,179
I don't believe in fate.

224
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,141
<i>You probably don't believe
in minotaurs either.</i>

225
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,143
<i>But you'll still have to answer
the riddle.</i>

226
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:28,231
MINOTAUR: <i>I have billions of eyes,
yet I live in darkness.</i>

227
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,067
<i>I have millions of ears,</i>

228
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,320
<i>yet only four lobes.</i>

229
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:38,408
<i>I have no muscle,
yet I rule two hemispheres.</i>

230
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,744
<i>What am I?</i>

231
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,580
That's simple. The human brain.

232
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:45,915
(POWERING DOWN)

233
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,752
It has billions of optic
and auditory nerves

234
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,754
four lobes and two hemispheres.

235
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:54,341
And it's the only thing
Edward Nygma respects.

236
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,218
<i>A lucky guess, that's all.</i>

237
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,512
<i>But it won't save you, Batman.</i>

238

<i>Destroy them!</i>

(GASPS)

240
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,329
I solved your riddle, Nygma.

241
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,747
Now here's one for you.

242
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,334
How do you take out a minotaur
with a single blow?

243
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:31,336
Like this!

244
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,774
You're through, Nygma.

245
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,735
<i>Sorry, boys, but you'll never find me.</i>

246
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,029
<i>I'm not even in the amusement park.</i>

247
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:02,951
<i>And by the time you get out of the maze,
I'll be out of the city.</i>

DICK:
I guess the mayor's happy about this.

249
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:18,133
Bringing in $5.5 million a year
in new jobs will do that.

250
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:22,178
But that creep Mockridge got to pocket
a cool 10 mil from the buyout.

251
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,055
What a burn.

252
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,559
Maybe. But we've been searching
for The Riddler for months,
