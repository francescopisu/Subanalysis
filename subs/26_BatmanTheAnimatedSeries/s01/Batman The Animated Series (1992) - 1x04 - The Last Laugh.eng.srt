1
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,450
Ew! P.U.!

2
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,828
Of all the disgusting...

3
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,963
Hey!

4
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,508
Look out, you crazy...

5
00:02:58,427 --> 00:02:59,428
Ouch!

6
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,350
Rough night of crime-fighting, sir?

7
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,851
Very.

8
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:08,562
Well, you'll be happy to know
I've drawn you a bath.

9
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,147
Whenever you're ready.

10
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:14,777
What's the deal, Alfred?

11
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,364
I said I "drew" you a bath, sir.

12
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,908
April Fool's.

13
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:24,745
Very funny, Alfred.
I guess I'll just take a shower.

14
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,832
Not a funny bone in his entire body.

15
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:32,878
Alfred, hit the radio, would you?

16
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,547
Right away, sir.

17
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,717
<i>Traffic is at a standstill
on the Gotham expressway</i>

18
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,886
<i>where a trailer full of eggs
has overturned. This just in.</i>

19
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:43,305
<i>The Gotham police are investigating</i>

20
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,350
<i>a series of near-fatal accidents
along the riverfront.</i>

21
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,061
<i>Initial reports indicate
that hundreds of Gothamites</i>

22
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,398
<i>have inexplicably begun acting
like total laughing fools.</i>

23
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,984
<i>More details as they become available.</i>

24
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,446
Sounds like a rather
dirty April Fools' prank.

25
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,407
Sounds like the Joker.

26
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,046
<i>At this hour,
Gotham City is in the grip of insanity.</i>

27
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,281
<i>Everywhere, people
are turning into lunatics.</i>

28
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:44,992
<i>The latest reports say that the wave
of foolish hysteria</i>

29
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,077
<i>is moving down 7th Avenue towards...</i>

30
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:49,997
<i>Towards the financial district.</i>

31
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,630
That's my cue.

32
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,856
Uh-huh. Hmm...

33
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,402
Perfect.

34
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,870
Now, everybody,
remember where we parked.

35
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:38,087
When the going gets tough,
the tough go shopping.

36
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,101
Who says crime doesn't pay?

37
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:58,250
Now, this is what I call
a sidewalk sale.

38
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,054
<i>Airborne gas emanating</i>

39
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:11,388
<i>from riverfront district.</i>

40
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:16,685
<i>Analysis, lengthy exposure to the gas
will result in permanent insanity.</i>

41
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:24,109
Alfred, I left
the hex key upstairs in the den.

42
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,402
Would you bring it down?

43
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,074
<i>Oh, go fetch it yourself.</i>

44
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,494
Very funny, Alfred,
but I've no time to play.

45
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,039
Alfred? Alfred!

46
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,097
Just a little spring cleaning, sir.

47
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,729
The gas!

48
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,364
Oh!

49
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,004
I believe I've contracted
a giant case of the giggles.

50
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,319
<i>Lengthy exposure to the gas</i>

51
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,470
<i>will result in permanent insanity.</i>

52
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,908
Okay, let's shoot it.
This place is giving me the creeps.

53
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,452
I'm here in downtown Gotham

54
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,455
where corporate CEOs
have gone stark raving mad.

55
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:03,250
It would appear that the collapse
of the stock market is now imminent.

56
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,418
<i>The question is,</i>

57
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:08,464
<i>Will April Fools' Day mark the end
of Gotham City as we know it?</i>

58
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:13,761
The only things gaining now
are the laughing stocks.

59
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:35,657
Huh? Ah!

60
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:05,979
Look who's come to trash the place.

61
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,440
A fitting setting for you, Joker.

62
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,027
Ooh, I just love to get down and dirty.

63
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:14,613
Okay, boys,

64
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,532
it's playtime!

65
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,493
It's about time.

66
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,537
What are we waiting for?

67
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:43,225
Batman, you're a real party pooper.

68
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,854
Why don't you take your mask off
and have a few laughs?

69
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,774
Cut the clowning, Joker.

70
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,285
Get him.

71
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:15,966
Tsk-tsk. You shouldn't have made
Captain Clown mad.

72
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:23,098
Time to take out the garbage!

73
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:36,111
I just love these new Ziploc seals.

74
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:41,241
We wouldn't want our little
caged rodent to suffocate,

75
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,870
so we'll just punch some air holes.

76
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:54,796
Okay, Captain, give it the old heave-ho.

77
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:15,984
Oops! Looks like our air holes
are water holes too.

78
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,986
What a shame!

79
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:46,807
I never knew Batman could sink so low.

80
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:51,436
Well, Captain, this could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

81
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:17,189
You want to play dirty, Joker?

82
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:28,825
Get ready, boys. Here it comes.

83
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:37,709
This will give those April fools
a lot more smiles per gallon.

84
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,520
What are you fools... Batman!

85
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,585
Hey, Batman!

86
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:07,299
Looks like Captain Clown
is really getting attached to you.

87
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,638
You killed Captain Clown.

88
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,974
You killed Captain Clown!

89
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,144
Just for that, Batman...

90
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,699
Hey, Batman,

91
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,912
you stink so bad
I can smell you from here!

92
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,540
P.U.!

93
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,960
Pyew, pyew, pyew!

94
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:18,990
Yee-haw!

95
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,470
Justice is served hot, Batman!

96
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:45,809
You're going to melt
just like a grilled cheese sandwich.

97
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,795
Justice will be served, Joker.

98
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,755
Service with a smile?

99
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,885
Clean up your act, Joker.

100
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,305
Oh, that's a joke, right?

101
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,100
Batman finally told a joke.

102
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:52,876
Batman! You wouldn't let me fry,
would you?

103
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,255
Batman!

104
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,107
I've taken eight showers
and I still feel soiled.

105
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:18,860
Ugh! I've never seen so much garbage.

106
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,822
What's wrong, Alfred?
Aren't you feeling better?

107
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,783
"What's wrong," sir?

108
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:29,829
I destroy a priceless Ming vase,
and you ask me what's wrong?

109
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,082
Don't worry about it.

110
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,044
I'll just take it out of your salary
for the next couple of years.

111
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,758
Very well, sir.

112
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,804
Alfred.

113
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,474
April Fool's.
