1
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,219
<i>The mob war in Gotham continues tonight.</i>

2
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,889
<i>Rival crime families led by
Rupert Thorne and Arnold Stromwell</i>

3
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,809
<i>continue to battle
for control of the city's underworld.</i>

4
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:44,812
- That's a nice picture of you, boss.
- Pipe down!

5
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:49,025
<i>According to Police Commissioner Gordon,
mob violence is intensifying.</i>

6
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:52,194
<i>What we have here is a battle
between an older crime boss</i>

7
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,073
<i>and his younger rival
for control of the rackets in Gotham.</i>

8
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,035
<i>And in this case,
it looks like youth has the edge.</i>

9
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:01,996
<i>I'd say Stromwell
is about to be retired.</i>

10
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,664
We'll see about that!

11
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:06,584
<i>But the struggle
may now be taking a tragic twist</i>

12
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:10,671
<i>with the reported disappearance
of Arnold Stromwell's only son, Joseph.</i>

13
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,552
Calm down, boss.
Remember your blood pressure.

14
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,596
I want my son back.

15
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,473
I know, Arnie. I know.

16
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,433
This war has to stop.

17
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:25,019
I want a meeting with Thorne,
and I want it tonight!

18
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:27,355
I'll set it up, Mr. Stromwell.

19
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,911
It's Thorne. He's got my son. I know it!

20
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:43,162
I know it!

21
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,391
Come on, buddy, you're out of here.

22
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,436
Huh?

23
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,651
Let's go.

24
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,658
Stromwell wants the meeting tonight.

25
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,452
We'll put out a sign that says
"private party."

26
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,247
Yeah. A going-away party.

27
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,375
When Arnie gets here,
we're all going to act nice-nice,

28
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,002
make him feel we want a truce.

29
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,256
All everybody has to do
is follow my instructions.

30
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,216
And you get the first cue, Pete.

31
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,345
<i>It's got to go like clockwork.
After Pete leaves, the lights go out.</i>

32
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,681
<i>We have to the count of five
to get clear,</i>

33
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:46,684
<i>and it'll be all over
for Arnold Stromwell.</i>

34
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,748
I'll teach Thorne to muscle in on me.
This is my town.

35
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,624
I made it what it is.

36
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,863
You got to swear
you won't squeal on me, Mike.

37
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:44,617
Gee, Arnie, you keep stealing junk,
you're gonna get caught.

38
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,869
Nah. Someday I'm gonna own this town.

39
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:03,886
Arnie? What are you doing?
Get off the tracks!

40
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:05,971
Arnie!

41
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,139
Arnie!

42
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,965
- Excuse me, Father.
- What can I help you with?

43
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,049
You!

44
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,845
It's coming down tonight, Father.
He's going to need you.

45
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,139
Arnold?

46
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:34,643
That's one soul
I wish I could give up on.

47
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,063
I don't believe
you'd give up on anyone, Father.

48
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,982
Please be there.

49
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,884
Hi, Arnie.
I'm glad we could get together.

50
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,098
We'll see, Thorne. It's time to talk.

51
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,143
I think we should talk alone.
Man to man.

52
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,687
Let the boys get some air.

53
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,701
We made the news today.

54
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:37,456
I saw. It's making things difficult.
You're making things difficult.

55
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:41,126
Come on, Arnie. This town's big enough
for the two of us.

56
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,504
- Where's my son?
- What?

57
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,632
My son! Where is he?
What have you done to him?

58
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,054
I don't know anything about it.

59
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,723
You lowlife.

60
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,520
You'd do anything to take over my city.

61
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,106
I didn't touch your kid.
I swear it, Arnie.

62
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,607
You know I don't mess with family.

63
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,656
Hey, come on.

64
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:13,200
We're getting off
on the wrong foot here.

65
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,619
It's a shame about your kid.

66
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,454
Maybe I can help.

67
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,707
- How?
- Well, I've got connections you don't.

68
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:32,302
Good.

69
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,180
Now, we can't talk on an empty stomach.

70
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:38,517
Pete, I want to see an antipasto
out here that'll knock our socks off.

71
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,024
No!

72
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:09,590
The boss!

73
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,636
- You can't go in there.
- It was a setup!

74
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,680
We can't do nothing now.

75
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,350
We've got to regroup.
Come on, before the cops get here.

76
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,359
Consider yourself replaced, Arnie.

77
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,196
It's party time.

78
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,304
Oh. What...

79
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,850
No! Where am I?

80
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,524
I'm alive.

81
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,984
You! What are you doing?

82
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,903
Saving your hide.

83
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,410
Whoa. Heavy barbecue action, man.

84
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,042
Wow! He's really out there.

85
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,713
Let me go, you caped freak!

86
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:48,772
The media's going to nail us
on this one.

87
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,692
What are you looking at?

88
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,611
Your hair. It looked better on TV.

89
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,991
Definitely arson, Commissioner Gordon.
A bomb.

90
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,785
Darn shame. They make the best cannolis.

91
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,332
- Anybody in there?
- There's no evidence anyone was inside.

92
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,545
There was somebody in there!
Batman saved his butt! I seen them, man.

93
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:15,132
He was just leaping on the rooftops,
carrying somebody on his shoulders.

94
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,258
I seen it!

95
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:20,345
Like a dark angel snatching the guy
from the fires of Hades, man.

96
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,521
Your news puts a crimp
in our celebration, Simon.

97
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,481
Sorry, Mr. Thorne.

98
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,818
But why would Batman
want to save a guy like Stromwell?

99
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,197
To get him to spill his guts
about the organization.

100
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,201
Get everyone on the street!
Check the train yards.

101
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,495
Find Stromwell and the Batman
and get rid of them!

102
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,179
All right. Why the heroics?

103
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:04,389
You've got something I want.

104
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:06,767
Oh, yeah? What's that?

105
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,144
Information. About the gangs.

106
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,899
Well, I appreciate
your saving my life and all,

107
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:17,022
but you're gonna have to come up with
a better reason for me to turn stoolie.

108
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,448
I'll try and deliver.

109
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:27,704
Whoa.

110
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:36,838
You're gonna pay for this!

111
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:41,134
Hey, I know this place.
I started out here.

112
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,594
Selling drugs.

113
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,471
Prove it.

114
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:48,058
- And now you manufacture them.
- Prove that, too.

115
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,769
Nobody twists anybody's arm
to take them, you know.

116
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,896
And for the record, I make candy.

117
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,775
Hey, what are you doing?

118
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,617
"Sunrise Foundation."
Means nothing to me.

119
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,629
What is this place?

120
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,631
A drug rehab center.

121
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,301
No. I ain't going in.

122
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:24,928
Your 10-cent tour of the city's over.

123
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:29,766
So what could it hurt?
One little look, right?

124
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:35,981
Joey!

125
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:38,734
Yes, and he's lucky. He'll pull through.

126
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,028
Connie! Why didn't you call me?

127
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:42,946
I didn't know until today.

128
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,574
I'd never have known
if it weren't for Batman.

129
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,539
Don't get any closer.
The nurse said not to disturb him.

130
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:55,500
I'll find the guy who got him hooked.

131
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,002
Just look in the mirror.

132
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,671
It was your drugs
and your people who sell them.

133
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,424
I left you to get away
from what you were doing.

134
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:04,259
Our son wasn't so lucky.

135
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,726
Help stop it, Stromwell.

136
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:16,855
All your power and money has bought you
is an empire of misery.

137
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:21,443
- What do you want me to do?
- Close down the organization.

138
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:24,738
Talk to the D.A.
Turn in all the records.

139
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,865
It has to stop, Stromwell.

140
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,993
It has to stop now!

141
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,594
Here are the records. Look them over.

142
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,524
These are dummy books.

143
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,901
Yeah. And you're the dummy.

144
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:13,245
They're both up there, all right.
Let's smoke 'em out!

145
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:16,206
You think I'd go down that easy? Ha!

146
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:19,709
I got scores to settle.
I'm big bad news.

147
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,255
- Always have been, always will be.
- What about Joey?

148
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:26,550
I'm getting him out of that freak ward,
so I know he'll get better.

149
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,969
You're fooling yourself
again, Stromwell.

150
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:33,640
You're the fool, Batman.
Now, if you just stay nice and quiet...

151
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,770
Tear gas!

152
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,585
Look out!

153
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,840
Stash, Freddy, get up there.

154
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,845
Stay here. Don't move.

155
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,034
Stash? That you?

156
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:37,787
Where's Batman?

157
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,432
Huh?

158
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,019
You blew it, you jerks!

159
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,616
Over there! It's Stromwell!

160
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,926
He ain't here.

161
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:35,011
He's got to be here somewhere.

162
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,810
Arnie, it's time to come home.

163
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,605
No! Get away from me.

164
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,316
You can't run anymore, Arnie!

165
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,338
Go ahead, take some.

166
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,090
No! You stole that candy, Arnie.

167
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,010
- I don't want it.
- Oh, what a mama's boy!

168
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:59,262
No! Not again!

169
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,057
Someday, I'm gonna own this town.

170
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:14,903
Get off!

171
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,154
Get off!

172
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:19,908
Arnie? What are you doing?
Get off the tracks!

173
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,372
Arnie! Arnie!

174
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:35,382
Jump, Arnie. Jump!

175
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,207
Michael? Michael!

176
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,378
Michael! Michael!

177
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,589
- I'm here, Arnie.
- What are you doing here, Michael?

178
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,968
- I came to help you, Arnie.
- I don't need your help.

179
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,429
Is that a fact?

180
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:27,016
An empire crumbling.
A marriage shattered. A son lost.

181
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,185
Sure, you're doing fine.

182
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:43,491
Stay away, Michael.

183
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,869
Last time you helped me,
it cost you your leg.

184
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,663
Oh, I get by. Knock on wood.

185
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,542
You knew I was no good, Mike.
Why did you save me?

186
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,836
Arnie, what else could I do?

187
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,756
But now, you've got a chance
to save yourself.

188
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,341
Come on, Arnie. Do the right thing.

189
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:03,136
For yourself, for your son.

190
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,972
For me, your little brother.

191
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,186
Michael.

192
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:17,484
Your family reunion
touches me, Stromwell.

193
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:19,319
Now say goodbye.

194
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,927
Commissioner Gordon,
I have a statement to give you.
