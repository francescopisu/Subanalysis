00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,585
Has the new patient quieted down?

3
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:29,130
Yes, Doctor. His hallucinations
seem to have stopped.

4
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,173
Such a pity, really.

5
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:36,554
To think, after all he's accomplished,
that he should end up here, like this.

6
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,349
Yes, he does seem calmer.

00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:43,019

Calm yourself.
Everything is under control.

Haven't you listened to
anything I've told you?

13
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,456
He needs more time.

14
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,291
See that he's not disturbed.

we don't have any more time!

No. I must have been staring

BATMAN: Someone stole a huge
water-purification system last month.

58
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,580
This device is a miniature test model

59
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:35,334
which means someone was trying
to contaminate the spa's water.

60

Good heavens. With what?

61
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,174
The gas residue was completely oxidized.

74
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,218
- Why?
- Because it may have affected me too.

75
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:30,014
Your blood titers are elevated.

76
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,182
You've been exposed to it also.

77
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:35,686
Percentage is smaller,
so it's taking longer to affect you.

78
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,439
But I will begin to hallucinate as well?

this supposed gas again.

be implemented
without attracting attention?

117
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:05,169
I think this plot

It was no accident, his turning up
at the health spa, you know.

Of course.

And now that he's been
exposed to the gas,

146

there's no stopping
the chemical reaction.

SCARECROW: Excellent.

180
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:35,814
The opportunities to study
the nature of fear will be unparalleled.

181
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:40,444
It's time for the greatest controlled
experiment in mass madness

No!

You've got to help me.

200
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,184
It's too late for that, Bruce.

201
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:01,686
You've lived in darkness too long.

202
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:06,942
Yes. Do come along, Master Bruce.
It's time to go home.

He's been exposed to the gas, remember?

224
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:54,049
