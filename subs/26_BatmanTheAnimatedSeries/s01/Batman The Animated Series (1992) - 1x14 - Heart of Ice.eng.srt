1
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,455
This is how
I'll always remember you.

2
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:23,207
Surrounded by winter,

3
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,834
forever young,

4
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,586
forever beautiful.

5
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:28,963
Rest well, my love.

6
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,215
The monster who took you
from me

7
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,427
will soon learn
that revenge is a dish

8
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,680
best served cold.

9
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,433
<i>In the midst of the hottest August
on record,</i>

10
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,394
<i>a rash of bizarre cold-related crimes</i>

11
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,229
<i>have chilled Gotham to the bone.</i>

12
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,566
<i>Once again,
the target is a GothCorp facility</i>

13
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,234
<i>attacked by an assailant</i>

14
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,069
<i>wielding what witnesses called</i>

15
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:53,654
<i>a "freezing gun."</i>

16
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,866
<i>The attacker's motives
remain unclear.</i>

17
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,326
<i>We spoke earlier</i>

18
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:00,870
<i>with GothCorp CEO
Ferris Boyle,</i>

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,496
<i>who offered these comments.</i>

20
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:05,708
<i>I don't know
what this person has against GothCorp</i>

21
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,918
<i>But we've always looked upon ourselves</i>

22
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,545
<i>as the people company.</i>

23
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,547
<i>If this man has a problem,</i>

24
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,215
<i>we're willing to listen.</i>

25
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:18,054
<i>A heartfelt plea from the chairman
of GothCorp,</i>

26
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:19,555
<i>the people company.</i>

27
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:21,515
<i>This is Summer Gleeson</i>

28
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,017
<i>for</i> Gotham Insider.

29
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,409
<i>Hey, get out of here!</i>

30
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,534
Taking up video games,
are we, sir?

31
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,872
I've accessed police files
on the GothCorp raids.

32
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,874
These are the stolen objects.

33
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,751
They don't look like much alone,

34
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,544
but in this configuration...

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,801
My word.

36
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,470
They combine
into a massive weapon

37
00:02:59,553 --> 00:03:01,055
able to generate intense cold.

38
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:03,432
There's still one component missing,

39
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,434
and only one GothCorp plant makes it.

40
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,696
<i>Halt.
Stay where you are.</i>

41
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:19,894
Look out!

42
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,638
We got company.

43
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,057
Keep your mind
on your business.

44
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,892
I'll handle this.

45
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,439
Load those canisters.

46
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,107
Hurry.

47
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,129
Are you done?

48
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,635
All set.

49
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,471
The Batman!

50
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:08,182
Put me down!

51
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,313
Freeze.

52
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,483
That's "Mr. Freeze" to you.

53
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,496
This is a personal vendetta.

54
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:33,082
It doesn't concern you.

55
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,000
It's my concern now.

56
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,671
Since you ally yourself
with my enemies,

57
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,548
you leave me no choice.

58
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:49,056
Ahhh!

59
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:50,766
Johnny!

60
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:07,491
Take it easy, man.
I got you.

61
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:08,868
Leave him.

62
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:14,707
He should have been more careful.

63
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,876
Now he's paid the price

64
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,003
for his incompetence.

65
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,921
But he's one of us.

66
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:24,675
Then perhaps
you'd like to share his fate.

67
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:35,102
Don't leave me.
Please!

68
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,071
Please!
Come back!

69
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,914
Help! Please!

70
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,249
Cold...

71
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,543
So cold.

72
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,613
I must say,
you're showing

73
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:30,574
a surprising amount
of compassion for that man

74
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,202
considering he would surely
have left you

75
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:34,536
to die in his place.

76
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,677
With all the compartments
on your belt,

77
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,447
you'd think
there'd be one for tissues.

78
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,391
Thanks.

79
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,737
He's pulling through.

80
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,572
The hot chemical bath
did the trick.

81
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:14,910
You could use a hot bath yourself.

82
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,455
I can't worry about a cold now.

83
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,582
After Batman drops
our unconscious guest

84
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,793
at police headquarters...

85
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,370
<i>Bruce Wayne has got a meeting</i>

86
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,380
<i>with Mr. Ferris Boyle.</i>

87
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:28,215
Bruce Wayne.

88
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,050
It's been forever.
How have you been?

89
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,386
Still the terror
of the Gotham night scene?

90
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:36,432
I get around.

91
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,851
Speaking of terror,

92
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,895
what's this about
someone causing trouble for GothCorp?

93
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,272
You got me.

94
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,399
Some fruitcake has it out
for my company.

95
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,859
I don't know why.

96
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:48,797
Maybe it's an investor
who lost money.

97
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,697
Or an angry ex-employee.

98
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,272
There's only one man
who'd hate

99
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,658
GothCorp that much,

100
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,993
if he were alive.

101
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:58,620
- Who?
- One of our scientists.

102
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,205
An obsessed wacko.

103
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,957
He was caught
using company equipment

104
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,250
for personal reasons.

105
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,085
I had to send my security men in.

106
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,046
There was a fight,
an explosion.

107
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:08,672
We lost him.

108
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,466
What was he doing?

109
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,342
Wasting company money.

110
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:13,761
My money!

111
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,179
Look, Bruce.

112
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,848
That "people company" line is great PR.

113
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,058
But when the wage-slaves

114
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:20,704
start acting like they own the place,

115
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,894
it's time to pull the plug.

116
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,581
Know what I mean?

117
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,231
<i>Sir,
the humanitarian committee is here.</i>

118
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,275
I'll be right out.

119
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,847
We're hosting a ceremony tonight

120
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,529
for Gotham's Humanitarian Industrialist
of the Year.

121
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,406
Guess who's winning?

122
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,408
I feel ill.

123
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,951
Hmm?

124
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,371
Excuse me, Ferris. My cold.

125
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,750
Congratulations on your award.

126
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,752
I'm sure it's well-deserved.

127
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,384
<i>And I want to say
that these</i>

128
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,804
<i>unwarranted attacks against GothCorp</i>

129
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:58,013
<i>have in no way changed</i>

130
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:00,099
<i>our personal commitment
to the community.</i>

131
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:01,934
<i>Inspirational words</i>

132
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,895
<i>from Gotham's
Humanitarian Industrialist of the Year.</i>

133
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:08,482
Humanity.

134
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:10,484
Compassion.

135
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:12,402
Charity.

136
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,822
Where were those pretty words

137
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,698
when she needed to hear them?

138
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:25,332
Faster.

139
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:27,835
The cannon must be completed tonight.

140
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,088
I have my own warm wishes

141
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,340
to bestow on Mr. Boyle.

142
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,022
When Ferris
mentioned that explosion,

143
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:42,072
I remembered this headline
from last year

144
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,560
Does it say
what caused the accident?

145
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,771
No.

146
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,900
And I suspect
that's the reason for the cover-up.

147
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,777
I won't know for sure until I check
GothCorp's classified files.

148
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,239
If you're going
to go sneaking around

149
00:10:57,364 --> 00:10:59,199
a crowded office building,
you'll need this.

150
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,952
Knockout gas?

151
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,203
Chicken soup.

152
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,663
The only way to fight a cold.

153
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,261
Mr. Boyle sent me to fill in.

154
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,638
Enjoy yourself at the party,
with his compliments.

155
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:23,473
Hey, great.

156
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:27,686
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Take off.

157
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:29,414
<i>My name is Dr. Victor Fries.</i>

158
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,334
<i>I am recording
what I pray</i>

159
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,711
<i>will be mankind's first step
toward immortality.</i>

160
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:38,590
<i>Behind me
you see the CC-100...</i>

161
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,718
<i>A cryogenic
freezing chamber of my own design.</i>

162
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,638
<i>I created it for the express purpose
of freezing subjects</i>

163
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:46,765
<i>stricken with inoperable ailments.</i>

164
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,183
<i>Subjects like</i>

165
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,102
<i>my own beloved wife, Nora.</i>

166
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,844
<i>Once a remedy
has been found...</i>

167
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,982
<i>Open this door!
Open it now!</i>

168
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:00,729
<i>Get away from that equipment!</i>

169
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,281
<i>Shut this stuff down.</i>

170
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:05,075
<i>Stop! This is my experiment!</i>

171
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,035
<i>Your unauthorized experiment.</i>

172
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,621
<i>I ordered
funding suspended weeks ago.</i>

173
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:12,499
<i>I'm already three million in debt,
thanks to you.</i>

174
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,334
<i>You can't stop it now.</i>

175
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,919
<i>My wife is in there.</i>

176
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,504
<i>So bring her out.</i>

177
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:20,007
<i>You can't interrupt the process now.</i>

178
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:21,466
<i>Open it.</i>

179
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:23,093
<i>It's her only chance.</i>

180
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,637
<i>This is my equipment!
Mine!</i>

181
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,264
<i>I have every legal right</i>

182
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,683
<i>to use it
or not use it as I see fit.</i>

183
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,060
<i>I say this project ends now!</i>

184
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:35,647
<i>No!</i>

185
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,941
<i>Stay away from her, murderer.</i>

186
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,234
<i>Victor...</i>

187
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:40,986
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

188
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:42,821
<i>I lost my temper.</i>

189
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,406
<i>It doesn't have to come to this.</i>

190
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,907
<i>We can talk.</i>

191
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:52,039
<i>Get out! Get out!</i>

192
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:55,709
<i>Nora!</i>

193
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,669
<i>Nora!</i>

194
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:00,922
My God.

195
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,008
Yes...

196
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,093
It would move me to tears

197
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,221
if I still had tears to shed.

198
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,532
The snow is beautiful,
don't you think?

199
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,494
Clean, uncompromising...

200
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,704
And cold.

201
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,500
Like the swift hand
of vengeance.

202
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,419
I saw what happened to your wife.

203
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,213
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,508
I'm beyond emotions.

205
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,427
They've been frozen dead in me.

206
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:49,596
That suit you wear...

207
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:51,056
A result of the coolant?

208
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:52,808
Very good.

209
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:55,310
A detective to the last.

210
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,729
I can no longer survive

211
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,524
out of a sub-zero environment.

212
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,360
Tonight, I mean to pay back

213
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,612
the man who ruined my life.

214
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,531
Our lives.

215
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,616
Even if you have to kill

216
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,326
everyone in the building to do it?

217
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:15,330
Think of it, Batman.

218
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:18,583
To never again
walk on a summer's day

219
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,961
with a hot wind in your face

220
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,130
and a warm hand to hold.

221
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,006
Oh, yes.

222
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,884
I'd kill for that.

223
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,849
Let's go.

224
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:25,692
Huh?

225
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,617
Keys?

226
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,331
Seal the building.

227
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,504
Higher. Higher.

228
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:30,549
Let the evil that walks inside

229
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,969
be cleansed
by pure, unforgiving ice.

230
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,849
And so it gives me great pleasure

231
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,435
to present this well-deserved award to...

232
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,780
Double the power.

233
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:57,576
Huh?

234
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,476
I will finish this.

235
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:56,426
The cold eyes of vengeance

236
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,470
are upon you, Boyle.

237
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:00,263
Who...

238
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,681
Who are you?

239
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,433
Come, now.

240
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:05,393
Surely you remember

241
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,853
your old colleague

242
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,521
Victor Fries.

243
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,067
No!

244
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,031
Stop. Please.

245
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,408
I beg you.

246
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,827
You beg?

247
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,913
In my nightmares,

248
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,956
I see my Nora behind the glass,

249
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,211
begging to me
with frozen eyes.

250
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,338
How I've longed to see

251
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,548
that look frozen on you.

252
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,817
The advanced circuitry
that powers my suit

253
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,069
also triples my strength.

254
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,414
Sooner or later,
all who stand in my way

255
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:11,042
must feel the icy touch of death.

256
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,773
Ugh. What was that stuff?

257
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,984
The only way to fight a cold.

258
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,362
It can't end this way.

259
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,239
Vengeance...

260
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,992
No.

261
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,243
Justice.

262
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:47,871
A year ago,
Ferris Boyle interrupted an experiment,

263
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,582
and in the process
destroyed two lives.

264
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,417
Here's the evidence.

265
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,592
Good night, humanitarian.

266
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,565
I failed you.

267
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:19,486
I wish there were another way
for me to say it.

268
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,155
But I cannot.

269
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,200
I can only beg your forgiveness

270
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,244
and pray you hear me somehow...

271
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:30,246
Someplace...

272
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:33,792
Someplace where a warm hand

273
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,126
waits for mine.
