1
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,514
You know me, Bruce.

2
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:45,683
Staid banker, old conservative stock.

3
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:48,102
I'm the last person to act impulsively.

4
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:50,604
But I'm telling you,
this fellow is a revelation.

5
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,398
You should read this.

6
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,651
Dad, you're not gonna proselytize Bruce.

7
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,653
Now you hush, Lisa.

8
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:00,281
We're raising a generation of cynics.

9
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,784
"Nostromos." Yes, I've read
about him in the <i>Star Enquirer.</i>

10
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:07,204
Uh, Alfred likes to pick up a copy
now and then.

11
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,457
That man saved my life.

12
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,376
He warned me not to go
on the gambling cruise.

13
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,087
Two days out to sea, the ship sank.

14
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,589
A coincidence.

15
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,924
What about the cave-in
at the Zanza mines?

16
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:21,427
Or the fires at the Karobi oil field?

17
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,637
His predictions saved me a fortune.

18
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,473
Make a heck of a stockbroker.

19
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,435
Tomorrow I'm hosting a party
in Nostromos' honor.

20
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,896
I want you to be there
to see for yourself.

21
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,272
Sounds great.

22
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:35,608
But I'll have to check
my horoscope to be sure.

23
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:45,677
You don't believe in this guy
at all, do you?

24
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:49,288
Call me crazy, but sometimes
I think his predictions come true

25
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,831
because he makes them happen.

26
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,170
Only thing I do know is these days,
my father won't make a move without him.

27
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,173
Daddy's even part
of a secret brotherhood.

28
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,091
Secret brotherhood?

29
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,594
He won't even tell
his own family what it's about,

30
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:07,973
thanks to Mr. All-Wise,
All-Wonderful Nostromos.

31
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,692
Peace to all.

32
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,486
Brothers and sisters,

33
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,113
the negative plane is aligned
with the positive,

34
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,533
bringing forth astral harmony.

35
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,659
What?

36
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,079
The vibrations are right for prophecy.

37
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,122
Oh. Okay.

38
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,251
That which you seek and cannot find,

39
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,377
is the seeker.

40
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:40,214
You are merely the eye
trying to view itself.

41
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,716
This is awfully deep.

42
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,721
We are but radios
for the cosmic transmitter.

43
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,849
Tune your receivers.

44
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,851
Hear the inner voice.

45
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,021
What is going on?

46
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:58,566
Brother Ethan, the inner voice speaks.

47
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,401
Someone here is in grave danger.

48
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,580
The messenger of death is searching,

49
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,082
crying out for...

50
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,668
You!

51
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,609
But, how did the glass break, sir?

52
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,696
Psychic vibrations, Alfred.

53
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:49,033
Though I'd bet on
a high-frequency sonic device.

54
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,954
But I have some tricks of my own.

55
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:57,458
I lifted Nostromos' fingerprints
at the party.

56
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,836
There he is. Alias Carl Fowler.

57
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,047
Professional actor.

58
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,632
Arrested for petty larceny.

59
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,385
Otherwise, no criminal record.

60
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,224
That's his partner.

61
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:16,644
Lucas. Special-effects man.

62
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,312
Arrested for fraud.

63
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,647
Never convicted.

64
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,232
So, they were both in show business.

65
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,442
Still are.

66
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,487
I just wish I knew
where this act was going.

67
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,048
Hi, Mr. Wayne.

68
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,634
I hear your personal elevator
is working great now.

69
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,719
The repair guy was just out.

70
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,305
Really? I didn't know
there was anything wrong.

71
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,722
No one could have predicted
Batman would spot me.

72
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,766
Not even the great Nostromos.

73
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,770
Besides, how do you know Wayne survived?

74
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,855
The news said he got off the elevator

75
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,691
right before it fell,
you pathetic amateur.

76
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,028
Well, you didn't predict
he would die, exactly.

77
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,949
Fool! Can't you see how his death
would have affected the Brotherhood?

78
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:19,243
How vulnerable they would have felt?

79
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,246
We could have finally hit them
for all they're worth!

80
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:27,126
Peace to all.

81
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,296
Nostromos, I must see you at once.
It's about Bruce Wayne.

82
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,048
Bruce Wayne?

83
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,801
Mmm-hmm. A miracle has happened.

84
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,636
Bruce has seen the light.

85
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,475
It wasn't until that moment,
when I came so close to death,

86
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,979
that I realized you really did have
a divine connection.

87
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,523
To think I ridiculed you.

88
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,942
Can you ever forgive me?

89
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,153
Of course.

90
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,156
I rejoice in your soaring consciousness.

91
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,783
Nostromos, I was thinking,

92
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,120
a man of Bruce's standing,
his influence,

93
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:05,831
should he not be considered
for the Brotherhood?

94
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,084
Yes. It's preordained.

95
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:13,172
Welcome, Brother Bruce.

96
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,299
No, not Bruce!

97
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:17,384
Lisa, you

98
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,386
don't understand.

99
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,763
Oh, I understand, all right.

100
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,265
You're like all the rest,

101
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:26,768
suckered in by
this money-grubbing, bogus creep.

102
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,145
Lisa!

103
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,565
You know what my inner voice
tells me, Nostromos?

104
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,901
You've ripped off your last victim.

105
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,865
I'm so sorry. I...

106
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:41,116
Do not apologize.

107
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:42,618
She will believe.

108
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,494
They will all believe,

109
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,413
after the Great Fall.

110
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:51,752
You may have joined us
just in time, Bruce.

111
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,671
For months Nostromos
has been warning the Brotherhood

112
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:56,673
of an economic collapse in the West.

113
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,342
"The Great Fall"?

114
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,843
Exactly.

115
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,720
But, at Nostromos' direction,

116
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:04,806
we've set up a superfund
to protect ourselves.

117
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,810
After the fall, we can use it
not only to rebuild fortunes,

118
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,146
but society as well.

119
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,690
And I take it that Nostromos
controls this money.

120
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,361
Oh, no, he can't touch it
without my written approval.

121
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,781
Nostromos insisted
everything be aboveboard.

122
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,366
Of course.

123
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:34,419
And though,
tonight we bask in the radiance

124
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,922
of Brother Bruce's conversion,

125
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,299
it grieves me to burden your spirits

126
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:40,968
with solemn news as well.

127
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:44,638
The Great Fall is at hand.

128
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,266
The Great Fall.

129
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:12,374
<i>The omens rise and converge
with every passing moment.</i>

130
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:14,042
<i>Yes, my brethren,</i>

131
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,044
<i>the inner voice speaks.</i>

132
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,339
I now see a dawn of destruction.

133
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,051
Riots!

134
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:24,177
Pillaging!

135
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,429
Carnage!

136
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,056
A society out of control!

137
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,601
Oh, the torment!

138
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,395
The suffering!

139
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,157
<i>The vision becomes clear.</i>

140
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,078
Brothers, beware!

141
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:51,955
Argh!

142
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,089
I am fine.

143
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,845
Brethren, you must transfer all you can
to the Brotherhood's fund by tomorrow.

144
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,222
The stars are
in their proper confluence.

145
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,266
Signs and portents abound.

146
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,895
As prophets of old foretold
cataclysmic changes,

147
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,190
so now, I predict
a massive social upheaval!

148
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,108
This is the end of the old order.

149
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,110
Anarchy and chaos will abound.

150
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,946
The Great Fall has begun.

151
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,040
You gave them $10 million, sir?

152
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:38,418
And to think,
I was fretting over the electric bill.

153
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,546
I had to keep up appearances, Alfred.

154
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,341
There must be over $300 million
in that fund.

155
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,009
My word!

156
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,680
Well, at least Nostromos can't touch it
without Mr. Clark's authorization.

157
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,057
For now.

158
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,018
But I don't need to be psychic
to predict that Ethan Clark

159
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,646
is about to undergo a spiritual crisis.

160
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,214
Well, Lucas,

161
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,632
our benevolent brothers

162
00:15:25,715 --> 00:15:28,468
transferred another
63 million this morning.

163
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,722
I predict, you and I
are about to become as rich as pigs.

164
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:36,202
Nostromos!

165
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,269
Huh?

166
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:43,442
Out. Out!

167
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,902
Nostromos.

168
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:48,363
I got your message.

169
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:51,032
I'd have been here sooner,
but I've been trying to locate Lisa.

170
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,659
She didn't come home last night.

171
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,745
The inner voice assures me she is fine.

172
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,164
Do you know where she is?

173
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,792
Do not worry.
I see you joining her soon.

174
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:04,504
Right now,
we have urgent business to discuss.

175
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,298
The voice has warned

176
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,675
that the Brotherhood's fund
is in jeopardy.

177
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,218
What do you mean?

178
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:13,180
We must convert it
into gold bullion at once.

179
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,765
I've prepared the papers
for your signature.

180
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:21,438
But, Nostromos, I can't possibly sign
until I've notified the brothers.

181
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,939
There's no time!

182
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,025
But, they must be informed.

183
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,776
It's our obligation.

184
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,446
Perhaps the stars can persuade you.

185
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,199
I see a bad moon rising.

186
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:35,535
Lisa!

187
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:40,832
Sign!

188
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,922
Nostromos, what is this?
I don't understand.

189
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,258
Sign! Or she pays.

190
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,843
Why would you do this?

191
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,638
I believed in you. You saved me.

192
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,931
Please, Nostro...

193
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,101
I have one last prediction for you,
Ethan.

194
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:02,229
The end will be swift.

195
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:05,607
Brother Lucas has set
enough explosives in this place

196
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:07,859
to create a supernova.

197
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,529
I suggest you make your peace quickly.

198
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,744
Ooh!

199
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,498
The control room!

200
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,214
Up there.

201
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,522
You go that way.

202
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,125
Your turn to see the light.

203
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,501
Batman?

204
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:49,270
You're about to fall
out of orbit, Batman.

205
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:27,327
I can't believe
I was so gullible.

206
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,705
But that's what I get
for putting my faith in greed.

207
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,335
You weren't the only one, Daddy.

208
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,420
Guilty as charged.

209
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,047
As the Bard once said,

210
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,259
"The fault lies not in the stars,
but in ourselves."
