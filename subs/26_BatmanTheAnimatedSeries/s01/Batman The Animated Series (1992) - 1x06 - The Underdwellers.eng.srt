1
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,342
Whoever jumps first is chicken.

2
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,240
I knew you'd chicken out.

3
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,910
Huh?

4
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:23,392
You play chicken long enough, you fry.

5
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,221
My purse!

6
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,972
Help! A thief!

7
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:10,773
I'm telling you, it was a leprechaun.

8
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:15,569
Really, ma'am? You expect me
to believe you saw a little green man?

9
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,155
Oh!

10
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:21,742
Hey!

11
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:38,092
Whoa!

12
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,273
Leprechauns and batmen...

13
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,275
What's Gotham coming to?

14
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,321
Leprechauns?

15
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:06,662
Leprechauns, Alfred.

16
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,666
Pardon?

17
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:16,589
- Not in the mood for Brahms, are we?
- You think I'm crazy, don't you?

18
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,799
In what sense, Master Bruce?

19
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,678
Seriously, you don't believe
I saw a leprechaun.

20
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,139
Did he have a pot of gold?

21
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:28,184
Sir, I believe you saw something.

22
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,394
Maybe I need a rest.

23
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,564
I do believe a break
from Wayne Enterprises

24
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,691
and crime fighting would do wonders.

25
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,277
Perhaps a vacation. A little golf?

26
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,528
Sounds boring.

27
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,905
In the Bahamas?

28
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,698
Hot and boring.

29
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:46,285
No, Alfred, I think
this is a job for Batman.

30
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,915
You have a fine flair
for dramatics, sir.

31
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,751
Why, thank you, Alfred.

32
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,106
The theater district?

33
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,175
Yes, I think it's time for an encore.

34
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:41,108
Hurry up!
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

35
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:46,447
Are you ready for your lessons?
Yes? I think so. I think so.

36
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,493
Well, so am I. Your teacher.
Your leader. Your king.

37
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,704
Ready, I am. Yes.

38
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:04,924
Lesson number one is...
No talking!

39
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,136
Children are to be seen
and not heard.

40
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:13,057
We are the Underdwellers.
We are the silent ones.

41
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,894
We follow the invisible creed.
But, but, but...

42
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:21,815
Someone was talking.
You. You, you, you were heard.

43
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,818
And we all know the punishment
for talking.

44
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,987
Don't we, boys and girls?

45
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,746
I think he needs to see the light.

46
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,832
Yes, I do.

47
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:44,004
A few hours in the light
will make Jack a bright boy.

48
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,594
And now, lesson two.
All of you up to the streets!

49
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:55,140
Bring back pretties,
lots and lots of pretties for your king.

50
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,351
Now!

51
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,429
I thought so.

52
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,007
Dead bolt.

53
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,141
Just a second, son.
I'm not going to hurt you.

54
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,186
Wait.

55
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,300
Open.

56
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,554
Good evening, Alfred.

57
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,930
Sir.

58
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,100
Might this wee one
be a leprechaun?

59
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:29,688
This, Alfred, is our guest.
I'd like you to take care of him.

60
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,192
Me? But I know nothing of children.

61
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:34,776
You'll do fine.

62
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,862
Feed him, clean him and put him to bed.

63
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,530
Well, perhaps.

64
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,657
Not in that order.

65
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:50,375
Rise and shine,
master leprechaun.

66
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,169
Time to be up and about.

67
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,182
First a bath, don't you think?

68
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:08,894
Do you have a name?

69
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,358
I hope you don't expect me
to guess it. Fred?

70
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:18,528
Pete? Leon?

71
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,657
How about a little help? Can you talk?

72
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,245
Gotcha.

73
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:29,122
You'll feel much better
when you're clean.

74
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,506
And smell better too, I trust.

75
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,610
Frog, the rolls, if you please.

76
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,530
You're not Frog.

77
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:04,616
Where is he?

78
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,620
He's not here! Not here!

79
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:13,125
And after all I've done for you
ungrateful little monsters...

80
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,919
I took you in when
nobody else would have you.

81
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,880
It is I who care for you.

82
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,675
I who provide for you,

83
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:26,179
and only I who knows
what's good for you!

84
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,057
Would you rather I sent you
back into the light?

85
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:32,978
Back to those who
hurt you and sent you away?

86
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,900
There will be nothing to eat
until Frog is found!

87
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,280
Now, out with you.
Out with you!

88
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,125
Now, now. Let's start with
some basic table manners.

89
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,211
Knife, fork, spoon.

90
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,009
Oh, dear, I could've sworn I...

91
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,095
No matter. As they say, "Dig in."

92
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,394
I wash, you dry.

93
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:19,649
Now then, doesn't it feel good
to be doing honest work?

94
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,695
What? Wait!

95
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,615
Charming.

96
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:47,177
<i>Now, see here, we're supposed
to be working.</i>

97
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,931
I wonder if I was that much trouble.

98
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,449
Oh, dear. That is extremely dangerous.

99
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,993
You must put it down
before you hurt someone.

100
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,832
Children and guns do not mix, ever.

101
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,752
It wasn't loaded,
but it could have been.

102
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,963
I need your help.

103
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,496
Evidence.

104
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:03,920
Where is he?

105
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:53,053
I don't know what kind of barbarian
did this to you, but it's over.

106
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:56,223
And from now on you'll be treated
like human beings.

107
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,267
I think we'll have something
to say about that.

108
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,354
Yes, we will.

109
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,568
Welcome our guests.

110
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:46,147
Crush him! Destroy that
costumed freak.

111
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,587
I'll show you who's the ruler
of this kingdom.

112
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,963
Put him down.

113
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,676
- Now!
- It's feeding time for my pretties.

114
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,088
Great.

115
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,010
And I thought you were endangered.

116
00:18:57,218 --> 00:19:00,347
Bravo. Bravo.

117
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,893
You've caused me great distress,
you evil bat.

118
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,770
Yes. Yes. Yes, you have.

119
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:12,317
You've hurt my pretty pets, and
you've frightened my beloved children.

120
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:16,154
- Beloved children?
- Yes.

121
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,825
I feed them, I clothe them,
I discipline them,

122
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,244
and I teach them a trade.

123
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,000
And now I will teach you something.

124
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:38,259
Grab my hand!

125
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:40,970
Never!

126
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:50,522
A gruesome fate for a gruesome man.

127
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:54,317
I rather enjoyed it.

128
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:58,488
I told you, they're my pretties.

129
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,367
Have a nice swim.

130
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,006
Later.

131
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,950
What? You!

132
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,473
Why? Why? Why?

133
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,517
I don't pass sentence.
That's for the courts.

134
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,478
But this time...

135
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:17,066
This time I am sorely tempted
to do the job myself.

136
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:32,582
The light.

137
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,918
The light.
