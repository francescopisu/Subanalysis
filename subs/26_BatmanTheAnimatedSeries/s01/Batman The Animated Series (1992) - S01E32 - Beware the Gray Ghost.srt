No,

182
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,567
it can't be him!

(ALARM BEEPING)

186
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:29,167
Well, if it isn't
the Dark Knight himself.

187
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,878
You're finished, Mad Bomber.

188
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,006
I don't think so.

(BUZZING)

190
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,481
Time to put your toys away, little man.

191
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,816
TED: I can't.

192
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,317
You see, I need the money,

193
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,027
to buy more toys.

194
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,821
I love toys.

195
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,239
They can play songs.

196
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,074
They can dance.

197
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,660
They can even eat money.

198
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,829
Oh, boy, can they eat money.

199
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:07,914
All my money.

200
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,124
And then,

201
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,876
I remembered an episode
of <i>The Gray Ghost.</i>

202
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,087
And I knew what else a toy could do.

203
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:15,839
It can carry a bomb.

204
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,633
It can hold a city for ransom.

205
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:20,844
Oh, the power of the toy.

206
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:23,054
It can earn millions.

207
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,349
Millions for the little,
old toy collector, me.

208
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,560
(LAUGHING)

209
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,882
No!

210
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:03,178
My toys! My toys, my beautiful toys!

REPORTER: <i>Gothamites have
turned out in record numbers</i>

to celebrate the video release

213
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,149
of the long-lost <i>Gray Ghost</i>

214

And on hand, for the festivities

215
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,405
the Gray Ghost himself, Simon Trent.

217
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:30,705
There you go, Bruce.

218
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,707
Thanks, Mr. Trent.

219
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,754
You know, as a kid,
I used to watch you with my father.

220
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:39,839
The Gray Ghost was my hero.

221
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:41,674
Really?

222
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,843
And he still is.
