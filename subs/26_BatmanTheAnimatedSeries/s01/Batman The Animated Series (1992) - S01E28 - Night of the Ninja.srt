NINJA: Ah, the rich man awakens.

186
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,293
Remember me?

187
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,672
I remember you, Kyodai.

188
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:26,133
Well, you should recall the man
you ruined.

189
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,803
I was forced to become a thief
after I was cast out of the dojo.

190
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,513
As I remember it,

191
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:34,599
being a thief was what got you
thrown out in the first place.

192
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:38,520
Of course, you never had to worry
about money, Wayne.

193
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:41,064
A society parasite feeding off others.

194
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,358
Flabby, soft, weak.

195
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,361
It is too easy to defeat you.

196
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,823
(GROANING)

197
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,158
Where am I?

198
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:53,452
(GASPS)

199
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,537
I've stolen your bank codes
at each theft.

200
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,372
Soon I will have them all.

201
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:01,042
Then I'll transfer your money
to my own accounts.

202
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,335
I don't get it.

203
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,255
You mean you're nothing
but a common thief?

204
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,675
(LAUGHING) Not a common thief, woman.

205
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,052
A great thief. The best.

206
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,014
And now the game is about to end.

207
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,771

Ah, way to go, Dick.

210
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,744
Master crime fighter. (SCOFFS)

211
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:38,747
(ALARM CONTINUES)

212
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,625
It appears we have an unexpected guest.

213
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,376
I'll be back.

214
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,892
NINJA: Isn't it past
your bedtime, boy?

215
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:01,102
Let's just see who's going sleepy-by

216
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,729
in the next couple of minutes, huh?

217
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,857
NINJA: This isn't the movies, boy.

218
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,526

220
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,742
Enough of this.
I have business I must attend to.

Ah!

227
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,593
You have gone soft, Wayne.

228
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:59,095
Even a white belt could avoid
that throw.

229
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,307

00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,810
Tired, Mr. Wayne?

232
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,896
I haven't even broken a sweat yet.

233
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:09,522
Get up!

234
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,319
(SOFTLY) Hang in there, Bruce.

(BRUCE GROANING)

236
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:21,993
Stop it! Can't you see
he's no match for you?

237
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,787
He never was.

238
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,913

241
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,676
(SIGHS) I have had enough exercise
for one night.

242
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,969
Now it ends, Wayne.

243
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,020

246

Yes!

247

Gotten a second wind, have you?

248
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,756
Good. This will make your defeat
all the more satisfying.

249
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,591
Shut up and fight.

250
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,302
(NINJA EXCLAIMING)

251
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,774
You were right about one thing, Kyodai.

252
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,359
Now it ends.

253
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,227
So, what did you tell Summer?

254
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,813
That Batman arrived
and took care of the ninja.

255
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,981
That's true enough.

256
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:18,485
The police couldn't find any trace
of Kyodai Ken.

257
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,861
You think he escaped?

258
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:22,030
Ninjas are very resourceful.

259
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:23,698
Do you think he might return?

260
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:24,949
It doesn't matter.

261
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,326
I defeated him once.

262
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:28,495
If necessary, I can do it again.

263
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,039
He had you worried for a while though,
didn't he?

264
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:34,250
Thanks for your help.

265
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,859
It would have been harder to defeat him
with Summer watching.

266
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,589
Maybe even impossible.
