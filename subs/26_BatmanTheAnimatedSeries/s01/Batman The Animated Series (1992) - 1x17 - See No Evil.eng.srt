1
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:45,855
Kimberly?

2
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,274
Kimmy.

3
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:53,654
Kimmy.

4
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,408
Mojo, you came back.

5
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,910
Sure. I said I would, didn't I?

6
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,495
Uh-huh.

7
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,331
Look what I got for you.

8
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,792
Oh. It's beautiful.

9
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,419
Thank you, thank you.

10
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,838
You're welcome, sweetie.

11
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,717
Now, don't worry. I know that
what you've really been hoping for

12
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,177
is a pearl necklace.

13
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:19,013
Well, I haven't found
just the right one yet,

14
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,475
but Mojo promises
he'll bring you one next time he visits.

15
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:23,893
Oh.

16
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,061
Kimmy, what's wrong?

17
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,731
Next time better be soon
or you might not find us.

18
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,816
Mommy says we're moving.

19
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,152
Moving?

20
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:37,239
She says things will be
better for us someplace else.

21
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,911
Kimberly, who are you talking to?

22
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:44,455
Nobody, Mommy, just Mojo.

23
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,708
Oh, I'm sorry I missed him.
I would've said, "Hi."

24
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,752
He really was here, Mommy.

25
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,421
I know, honey. I know.

26
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,548
Now go to sleep, okay?

27
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,893
Hey! Who locked the bathroom?

28
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,298
A most handsome selection, Mr. Wayne.

29
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,429
I'll take it.

30
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:24,972
What in the devil?

31
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,773
Holy smoke, look!

32
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:46,118
Police! Police! Over this way!

33
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,373
Help, security! I've been robbed.

34
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,375
- Look at that!
- What the heck?

35
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,594
Nobody moves till we figure out
what's going on here.

36
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,888
Hey! My piece. It's been stolen.

37
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,348
Mine, too.

38
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,311
Argh! Ahhh!

39
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,771
Oh!

40
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,111
Footsteps?

41
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,371
Who are you?

42
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:31,831
I know you're in here.

43
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,122
Cute. Real cute.

44
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,511
You were better off
blowing smoke, Batman.

45
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:32,224
See, I guess I'm what you'd call
a burnout case.

46
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:45,821
Too bad about these
high ceilings, huh, Batman?

47
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:49,575
I mean, all this lousy echoing
kind of makes it hard

48
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:51,577
to get a fix on me, doesn't it?

49
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,246
Especially, since you wouldn't see me...

50
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,417
if I were standing right next to you.

51
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,839
Argh!

52
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,098
See you around, Batman.

53
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,309
Too bad you can't say the same.

54
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,893
A better life somewhere else, huh?

55
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,981
Where your dear old dad can't find you,
that's what she really means.

56
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,109
Well, don't you worry.

57
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:08,320
She's never going to
take you away from me.

58
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,449
I won't let her. You hear me?

59
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,785
I won't let her.

60
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,473
Bye, sweetie. Have a nice day.

61
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,965
I'll be back in an hour.

62
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,180
Hey, babe.

63
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,307
Long time.

64
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,184
Not long enough.

65
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:26,982
Did they tell you about the parole?

66
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,986
I'm living in Gotham now.

67
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:35,074
I don't care what you do, as long as
you don't do it within 100 feet of me.

68
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,451
The restraining order?
You don't need that anymore, Helen.

69
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,703
When I was still a bum,
it made sense, but...

70
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:41,288
What do you mean, "was"?

71
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,916
Come on, babe. Look at me!

72
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,599
How many all-night gas stations
did you have to knock over for that?

73
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,643
Keep it.

74
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,735
Everything is different now,
can't you see that?

75
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,738
I can give Kimmy
everything she'll ever need.

76
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,156
You stay away from her.

77
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,742
Come on, babe.
If you could just let her see me...

78
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,702
Keep your hands off me.

79
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,787
I told her all about you.

80
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,914
She knows you're
not supposed to go near her.

81
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:26,667
Helen, please.
Cut me some slack, here, will you?

82
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,418
I'll give you anything you want.

83
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,670
Want?

84
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,673
All I want is for you to disappear.

85
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,007
Okay.

86
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,551
Okay.

87
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,761
But just remember the old saying,

88
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,014
"Be careful what you wish for."

89
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,438
I understand
your concern, Mr. Wayne.

90
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,525
But I don't think you need to worry
that Wayne Tech is responsible

91
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,443
for this invisible man.

92
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,487
After all, no equipment is missing.

93
00:10:57,614 --> 00:11:00,868
But, I seem to remember,
last year, hearing something

94
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,953
about an invisibility project.

95
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,539
You mean that inventor Carrows.

96
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,624
Yeah, I remember him.

97
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,894
The one who wanted us
to go into business with him,

98
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,086
developing that plastic.

99
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:15,132
Uh-huh. The "cloak of invisibility"
he called it, right?

100
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,009
So, what happened?

101
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,887
Well, we were interested
in hearing more, Bruce.

102
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,599
But, Carrows withdrew his proposal
before we could close a deal.

103
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:28,437
Lucius, see if you can locate him.
I'd like to talk to him.

104
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,148
Don't bother.
He passed away a couple of months ago.

105
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,401
But I've heard that his old assistant,
Sam Giddell,

106
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:36,486
was trying to carry on his research.

107
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,775
Okay, you, come out of there.

108
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,902
I don't know
what you think you're doing.

109
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:03,907
Argh!

110
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,711
You.

111
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,212
I didn't know.

112
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,463
Are you Giddell?

113
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,132
What do you want?

114
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,217
Where were you the day before yesterday?

115
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,428
Here. All day. And I can prove it.

116
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,138
The building security saw me.

117
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,264
You can check.

118
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,397
Working kind of late, aren't you?

119
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,275
I wanted to prep
the last of the stuff for disposal.

120
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:45,032
This is that invisibility plastic
your boss created?

121
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,867
Mmm-hmm.

122
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:50,454
- How does it work?
- Here, let me show you.

123
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,706
It's really quite remarkable.

124
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,424
See those filaments
embedded in the plastic?

125
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,344
Mmm-hmm.

126
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,304
Run an electrical current through them,

127
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:10,182
and the stuff bends light
instead of absorbing it,

128
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:11,266
so you can't see it.

129
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:14,186
But in the process,
the plastic becomes toxic.

130
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,188
I know. I read the report.

131
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:19,441
I've spent the last two months
trying to correct the problem,

132
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:20,525
but it's hopeless.

133
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,134
So, you were just going to dump it?

134
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:24,237
Yes, it's too dangerous.

135
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,990
Funny thing is,
some of it seems to be missing.

136
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,285
- Who else would know about this stuff?
- Only the other assistant.

137
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,871
Actually, he was
more like an errand boy.

138
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,498
An ex-con.

139
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,626
Name is Ventrix. Lloyd Ventrix.

140
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,759
Mrs. Ventrix?

141
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:47,386
I'm looking for your husband.

142
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,887
It's urgent.

143
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:51,807
Oh, Mojo, it's exactly what I wanted.

144
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,308
I'm glad.

145
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:56,686
Now, come on.

146
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,814
I want to show you
something real special.

147
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,110
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

148
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,947
And prolonged exposure to the plastic

149
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,449
can damage the mind,
as well as the body.

150
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:11,785
You say he can make himself invisible?

151
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,954
Mojo!

152
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,081
- Who?
- Kimberly!

153
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,217
Kimberly.

154
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:29,678
Kimberly.

155
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:31,596
Kimberly!

156
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,265
Kimmy!

157
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,120
I thought Mojo was just
her imaginary friend.

158
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,371
I never thought...

159
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,581
What's that?

160
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,083
A tranquilizer dart.

161
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,085
How long ago did you see your daughter?

162
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,546
Five minutes ago.
I put her to bed and...

163
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,089
Batman?

164
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,768
Here we are.

165
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:24,232
- You want me to get in your car?
- Now, Kimmy...

166
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:26,860
But it'll look
like the car's going by itself.

167
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,570
Won't we get in trouble?

168
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,822
No, Kimberly, we won't.

169
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,407
I don't know.

170
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,493
I'll tell you what,

171
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:37,287
maybe if I let you see me,
you'll feel better.

172
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,458
Hi, Kimberly.

173
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,376
You're a man?

174
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,962
I gotta go, Mojo.

175
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,839
I'm not supposed to be with strangers.

176
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,758
Mommy told me.

177
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,427
But I'm not a stranger, Kimberly.

178
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:53,887
I'm your daddy.

179
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,014
My daddy? Get away!

180
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,099
Mommy says you're not allowed
to come near me.

181
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,768
She says you're a bad man.

182
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,645
She says that's why they locked you up.

183
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,979
Never mind that!

184
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:05,524
You're coming with me,
whether you want to or not.

185
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,400
Not in this lifetime, pal.

186
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,953
Mommy, Mommy!

187
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,944
Mommy, Mommy!

188
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,028
Kimberly?

189
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,819
I didn't know he could fly, too.

190
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,809
Give it up, Ventrix.

191
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,437
The suit is toxic. It'll destroy you!

192
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:09,773
Don't hand me that.
I'm not feeling any pain.

193
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,941
At least, not like you're gonna feel.

194
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:05,995
Argh!

195
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,096
Ventrix, the suit,

196
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,431
it's poison!

197
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,057
So, what if it is?

198
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,726
I don't care.

199
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:31,855
As long as I have it,

200
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:35,400
I can take my daughter back,
whenever I want!

201
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,154
Her mother won't be able to stop me,

202
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,822
and neither will you!

203
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,502
No!

204
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,463
Peekaboo.

205
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:58,131
Ow!

206
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:04,763
Oh!

207
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:12,353
Get ready for your biggest
disappearing act, Ventrix.

208
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,398
The one where no one sees you
for 10 to 20.

209
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,475
Me and Mommy are moving.

210
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,465
And even if Daddy gets out
of jail this time,

211
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,782
he'll never find us.

212
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,493
Kimberly? Who are you talking to now?

213
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,161
Just Batman, Mommy.

214
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,122
Oh. Him, again?

215
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,500
But he really was here, Mommy.

216
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,210
I know, honey.

217
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,336
I know.
