1
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,827
Bruce? Bruce Wayne?

2
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,912
Over here, Lucius.

3
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,127
Bruce, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Couldn't this wait?

4
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:11,005
I could've given you this stuff
in the office.

5
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:14,550
Not out here.

6
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,096
Come on.

7
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,942
My phones are bugged.
The office, the house, everywhere.

8
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,196
He knows we're on to him.

9
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,822
Daggett?

10
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,536
Who else? You were the one who said
he was trying to take over the company.

11
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,414
Yes. Insider trading.

12
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,710
But once you give these papers
to the DA, he'll be under indictment

13
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:51,629
before he can change his socks.

14
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,674
If I turn in the evidence. But I won't.

15
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:59,303
You see, Lucius, the reason I want
those papers is to destroy them.

16
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:03,891
And now, that you've brought them,
we won't be needing you anymore.

17
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,478
Bruce, what's going on here?

18
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:13,359
Let's just say
I'm accepting your resignation, Mr. Fox.

19
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,885
<i>Two-Baker-six. Two-Baker-six.</i>

20
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,138
<i>204 at Gotham Island Tramway,</i>

21
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,932
<i>south-side terminal. Respond, code 2.</i>

22
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,144
Let's finish this.

23
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,353
Fast.

24
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,272
Before we have the law on our necks.

25
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,232
Too late, dirtbag.

26
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,358
Huh?

27
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,443
Who said that?

28
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,320
The Batman! Not him!

29
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,286
Where is he?

30
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,671
Wayne. Bruce Wayne.

31
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,048
He set me up.

32
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:43,592
Cover me!

33
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:54,103
Stay where you are! Don't move!

34
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,428
Ready on the set.

35
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,348
I'll go get Matt.

36
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,195
Come on, come on. Where are you?

37
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,408
Matt, uh, you okay in there?

38
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,872
Matt?

39
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,957
Close the door!

40
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,293
It's Teddy, Matt.

41
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,879
Close the door!

42
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:03,839
Help me look.

43
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,633
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

44
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,470
The face cream?
You used up your last jar yesterday.

45
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:10,804
No!

46
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,349
I gotta have more! Now, see.

47
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:17,061
It wore off.
Look! I can't fix it anymore!

48
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,896
Relax, Matt.

49
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,898
Don't tell me to relax, you idiot!

50
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,067
I can't go out there like this!

51
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,152
Here.

52
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,613
Give it to me!

53
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,370
Huh? That's all?

54
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,873
I was lucky I could
hang on to that much.

55
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,045
You were holding out on me?

56
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:46,298
I had to, Matt. If I didn't,
you wouldn't have any now.

57
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,726
You can't go on like this, Matt.
You hurt all the time now.

58
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,728
You're just my stand-in.

59
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:02,147
Nobody promoted you to nursemaid.

60
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,900
That stuff
makes your face like putty, Matt.

61
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,110
It can't be good for you.

62
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,362
It probably ain't good for me.

63
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:10,823
But unless I only wanna do
horror pictures,

64
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,158
it ain't bad for me either.

65
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,786
Gone!

66
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,121
Empty!

67
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,498
Only 24 hours,

68
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:22,668
then it starts all over again.

69
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,380
Mr. Hagen, we're waiting!

70
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:27,756
Keep your shirt on!

71
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,802
That's what ain't good for you.

72
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:34,930
Having to keep going back
to Daggett for more of that stuff,

73
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,599
and do whatever lousy thing
he wants to get it.

74
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,103
You're right, Teddy. I can't.

75
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:45,899
I'll have to find a way
to get lots of this stuff on my own.

76
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,953
You're sure, Bell?

77
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,542
You're sure that the man you hired
knows nothing about our operation?

78
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:09,673
Bell! I asked you a question.

79
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:13,302
Bell! Bell!

80
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,476
Germs, take off his headphones.

81
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,563
Pay attention.
Mr. Daggett is talking to you.

82
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:31,236
Now, then.

83
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,988
Relax, Mr. Daggett.

84
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,283
The guy was just a hired gun.
He don't even know our names.

85
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,119
Thank heaven for small favors.

86
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,583
But Hagen has disappointed me
once too often lately.

87
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,294
He botched this assignment completely.

88
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:51,965
To wit, once Fox is able to talk,
he might very well incriminate us,

89
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,636
if the police can't figure out
what we're up to from those papers

90
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,138
Hagen was supposed to retrieve.

91
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,141
Frankly,

92
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:05,312
I think our Mr. Hagen
has outlived his usefulness.

93
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,816
I want him dealt with.

94
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:12,236
But, Mr. Daggett,
the man's a master of disguise.

95
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:16,406
He was even before he had his accident,
and you gave him this stuff.

96
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,410
Yeah. It's not easy finding somebody
who can change the way he looks.

97
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:25,082
You needn't bother searching for him.

98
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,336
This is the only place in the world
where he can get what he needs.

99
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,880
And when his supply runs out,

100
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,466
he'll come to us.

101
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,380
Hold it right there.

102
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,258
Turn around, real slow.

103
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,011
Step into the light
where we can see you.

104
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,431
I'm looking for Mr. Daggett.

105
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,807
I don't believe we've met.

106
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,060
My name is Wayne. Bruce Wayne.

107
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,360
Wayne, huh? Yeah, right. Sure.

108
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,573
Can the garbage, Hagen. We ain't stupid.

109
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,667
- No!
- You're Hagen, all right.

110
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,045
Broke in for more of that stuff,
didn't you?

111
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,798
Yeah, once they're hooked,
they stay hooked.

112
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,719
Come on, Hagen,
we're going for a little ride.

113
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,722
Forget it! I know what that means!

114
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,277
Wait! I got an idea.

115
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,737
Hold him.

116
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,122
Pretty boy wanted more of this stuff?

117
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,166
Then let's give it to him.

118
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,168
No! Not that way!

119
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,711
Please!

120
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,131
Let's give him
all he'll ever need.

121
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,216
No!

122
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:42,344
No! Don't!

123
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,692
Sweet dreams, slimeball.

124
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,919
I know my fist has landed
on that jaw once before.

125
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:35,772
Bell. Raymond Bell.

126
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:38,650
Of course! Now I remember him.

127
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:45,407
Carries a pocket radio,
tuned to police band at all times.

128
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,120
Master Bruce,
what am I to do about the police?

129
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:51,955
They shall be back, you know.

130
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,333
I can't keep telling them you're out.

131
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,544
Police? What police?

132
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,171
What are you talking about?

133
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,799
I suggest you consult
the morning paper, sir.

134
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,929
"Bruce Wayne
sought for questioning"

135
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,223
"in attempt on executive's life"?

136
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,351
But that's impossible!

137
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,399
<i>Two-Baker-10,
code 7 in progress, 500 North Main.</i>

138
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:24,363
<i>Twenty-two, code 4
at 1900 Roth Avenue, apartment B, "boy."</i>

139
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:28,575
<i>All units, a warrant has been issued
for the arrest of Bell Raymond.</i>

140
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,787
<i>White male,
approximately 5 feet 10 inches.</i>

141
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,996
<i>Age, mid-30s.</i>

142
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,263
<i>All available units
divert to suspect's last known address,</i>

143
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,184
<i>3720 Burnley Boulevard.
Suspect is believed...</i>

144
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:58,105
Armed and dangerous.
Proceed with extreme caution. Over.

145
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,816
Yeah, go ahead.

146
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,901
Stake out my place.

147
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:05,237
It'll be a long wait, jerks.

148
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:22,212
That's it, Bell. Keep it up.
You're reacting true to form so far.

149
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,777
The Batman?

150
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,292
Made it! I am out of here!

151
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,503
Huh?

152
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,125
No!

153
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:46,796
Oh, no!

154
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:25,710
No!

155
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,799
No! For the love of mercy, Batman,
don't let me fall!

156
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:38,640
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

157
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,392
Listen up, scumwad.

158
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,602
<i>Because I'm only gonna ask you once.</i>

159
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,282
<i>Who was Lucius Fox meeting at the tram?</i>

160
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,993
Wayne! Bruce Wayne!

161
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:00,745
You lying sleaze!

162
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,165
<i>You wanna rethink that answer?</i>

163
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,211
No! No!

164
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:11,423
Okay, okay, it wasn't Wayne!

165
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:14,259
Then who was it?

166
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,937
Last chance.
Who was impersonating Wayne?

167
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,445
Who, Bell? Who?

168
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,283
Fainted. He fainted.

169
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:50,211
<i>This is GCPD airborne unit
six-Able-12 to Batwing.</i>

170
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,130
<i>Descend in the name of the law</i>

171
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:55,300
<i>and remand your prisoner
to police custody.</i>

172
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,145
This should wake you up, Mr. Bell.

173
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,741
This is the police!
You are under arrest!

174
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:38,968
No.

175
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,261
Please,

176
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,514
leave me alone.

177
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,433
Lucius, it's okay. It's me, Bruce.

178
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,102
I have to speak to you.

179
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,521
Only you can give me
the answers I need now.

182
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:55,610
You know I'd never do anything
to hurt you.

183
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,373
Ah, there's his car. Stop here.

184
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,261

185
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,179
Matt, are you in there?

186
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,856

updates on this late-breaking story.

What in heaven's name
did they do to you?
