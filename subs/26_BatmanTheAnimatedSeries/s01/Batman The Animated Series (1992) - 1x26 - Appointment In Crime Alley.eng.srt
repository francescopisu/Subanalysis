1
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,481
You do good work, Mr...

2
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,233
What did you say your name was?

3
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:51,110
Nitro, Mr. Daggett,

4
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:53,154
on account of explosives
are my business.

5
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:58,659
I assume Crocker explained
the terms of your employment, Mr. Nitro?

6
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:02,038
Sure. There's an old gas line
running under the whole block.

7
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,290
I make it look like
the pipeline ruptured,

8
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,626
so the job can't be traced to you.

9
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,713
It's to be done while I give my speech
to the Gotham Better Business Council.

10
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,716
9:00 exactly.

11
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,511
Trust me, when the hands
on that watch hit nine,

12
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,221
boom.

13
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,519
<i>As expected, the city zoning board
today rejected a request</i>

14
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,982
<i>by the Daggett Development Corporation
to raze a block of landmark brownstones</i>

15
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:31,817
<i>along Gotham's Park Row.</i>

16
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:32,985
<i>Thirty years ago,</i>

17
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,072
<i>Park Row was Gotham City's
most glamorous address.</i>

18
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>But, in recent years,
the area has suffered a decline.</i>

19
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,537
<i>And today, it is a slum better known
as the infamous "Crime Alley."</i>

20
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:44,705
<i>But, to its inhabitants,</i>

21
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,375
<i>many of whom
spoke at the zoning board today,</i>

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,835
<i>Crime Alley is the only home they have,</i>

23
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,587
<i>and they fear its loss.</i>

24
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:55,966
<i>Others, like Roland Daggett, director
of the Daggett Development Corporation,</i>

25
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,386
<i>see the situation differently.</i>

26
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,348
<i>It's tragic.</i>

27
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,267
<i>Park Row may be an historical landmark,</i>

28
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,062
<i>but it's also a breeding ground
for crime.</i>

29
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,440
<i>Of course, as much as we disagree
with the zoning board's decision,</i>

30
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,275
<i>our hands are tied.</i>

31
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:20,241
Roland Daggett
is up to something, Alfred.

32
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,494
That almost goes without saying,
doesn't it, sir?

33
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,622
I don't know what it is yet, but I will.

34
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:29,583
You don't want to be late
for your 8:00 appointment, sir.

35
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,585
Have I ever been late?

36
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,504
No, sir.

37
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:35,089
Not once in all these years.

38
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,228
Help! Help!

39
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,988
Help! Somebody help my mommy!

40
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,241
Those men in our apartment,

41
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,326
they'll hurt her.

42
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,328
I climbed out the window.

43
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,662
Where?

44
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,589
Lady, you and your kid
were told to clear out.

45
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,051
You didn't listen.

46
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,303
Maybe you'd like to be carried out.

47
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,516
No! Please!

48
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,093
Yah!

49
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,638
Mommy! Mommy!

50
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,102
Thank you.

51
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,604
What did they mean,
you were warned to clear out?

52
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,190
Couple of days ago, these three show up,

53
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:00,234
say they're working
for some corporation.

54
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,653
They tell everyone on our block
they got to leave.

55
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,446
But, where are we gonna go?

56
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,790
He's never been late before.

57
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,792
I'd better look for him.

58
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,753
Where you off to, Miss Thompkins?

59
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,131
Just looking for a friend, Maggie.

60
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:23,716
You be careful.

61
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,344
Maggie, I've lived in Park Row
for 30 years.

62
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:28,554
It's my home.

63
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,472
I'm not afraid here.

64
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:04,298
What are you doing here?

65
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,550
This building is condemned.

66
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,305
I saw you on the news.

67
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:12,932
You work for Daggett.

68
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,854
Oh, my gracious!

69
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,013
I'm looking for Dr. Thompkins.

70
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:56,100
She said
somebody was supposed to meet her.

71
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,601
You?

72
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,603
Where is she?

73
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,522
Leslie went looking for you.

74
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,023
I told her to be careful.

75
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:06,110
Bad things happen to people
in Crime Alley.

76
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,653
I know.

77
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:37,993
Urban redevelopment, lady.

78
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,435
That's what this is all about.

79
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,645
Uh, tell me if the rope's too tight.

80
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,571
All set. We just gotta do
that old hotel down the street.

81
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:53,032
And then when 9:00 rolls around...

82
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,701
Boom! Instant slum clearance.

83
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,661
Next stop, mini-mall.

84
00:08:57,786 --> 00:09:00,039
You can't destroy that hotel.

85
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,331
This block may be abandoned,

86
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,500
but that building
has people living in it.

87
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,170
Hey, we told them to leave.

88
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,131
They stand in the way of redevelopment,
they get bulldozed.

89
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,258
Nothing personal. Just business.

90
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,219
You're insane.
You won't get away with...

91
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,696
Alfred, did Leslie call?

92
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:33,947
No, sir.

93
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:37,034
- Is anything wrong?
<i>- We missed each other.</i>

94
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,870
I'm on my way to her apartment.

95
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,540
Something's come up, Alfred.
I'll be in touch.

96
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,727
Now, you're gonna listen to me!

97
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:08,148
I want justice, Gotham City!

98
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,444
Who's the hostage?

99
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:14,488
Some clerk from Daggett Development.

100
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,032
Wrong place at the wrong time
with an eviction notice.

101
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,076
Ten seconds, we make our move.

102
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,746
If you go,
the hostage might be hurt.

103
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,665
- I'll do it.
- You'll do it?

104
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,834
Who do you think you are?

105
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:28,585
Oh.

106
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,213
You took my job, Gotham City!

107
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:32,798
You took my home!

108
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,300
Somebody's gotta pay for that!

109
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,219
I pick you.

110
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,265
Put the gun down!

111
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:42,391
Who said that?

112
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,227
Batman!

113
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,398
Whoa.

114
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,030
So, you're working for Daggett, too?

115
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,037
I won't ask twice.

116
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,025
Thanks for the help.
Good thing you showed up.

117
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,919
Leslie?

118
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,557
Poor Doc Thompkins. She's in trouble.

119
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:50,852
What trouble?

120
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,937
Uh, nothing.

121
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,606
I didn't see them grab her.
I didn't see nothing.

122
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,733
What do you mean? Who grabbed her?

123
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,694
I don't know! Let go of me! Let go!

124
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,158
Where did you get this blasting cap?

125
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,995
And where's Dr. Thompkins?

126
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,497
Two guys, they grabbed her.

127
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,581
She dropped it.

128
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,375
I thought I could sell it.
Get a few bucks.

129
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,876
Where are they?

130
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:16,753
Corner of Finger and Broom.

131
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,505
That's all I know, honest!

132
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,446
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce our speaker,

133
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,781
a bold force for progress,

134
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:47,826
a man of vision
with the will to execute his dreams,

135
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,870
Roland Daggett.

136
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,749
- He's hurt!
- He's passed out!

137
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,647
- Help!
- Help!

138
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,947
Perfect. Just perfect.

139
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:21,503
- Look out!
- Runaway trolley!

140
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:23,428
Get out of the way!
The trolley's coming!

141
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,110
Don't leave us!

142
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:32,925
Oh, my goodness. Thank God.

143
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,509
Thank goodness. I was so afraid.

144
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,411
Let us out of here!

145
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,165
I've never been so scared
in all my life.

146
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,074
Hello, Crocker.

147
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,785
- Long time no see.
- Batman?

148
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,807
What are you doing here?

149
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:21,706
Meeting a friend.

150
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:23,667
What are you doing here, Crocker?

151
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,752
No. None of your business.

152
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,271
Somebody is trying
to run the people

153
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,895
in this neighborhood out of their homes.

154
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,800
Your boss, Daggett,
wouldn't know anything about this,

155
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:32,884
would he?

156
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:35,220
No. No, of course not.

157
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,640
How about you, Nitro?

158
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,395
You told your parole board
you gave up the arson-for-hire game.

159
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,731
I did. I'm clean.

160
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,233
Really?

161
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:51,987
Then what's this?

162
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:57,075
You crazy? This stuff is dangerous.

163
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,451
Talk to me, Nitro.

164
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,204
After Daggett lost his appeal
to the zoning board,

165
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,833
Crocker hired you to level
this whole neighborhood, didn't he?

166
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,793
That's it. That's right. You got it.

167
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:08,503
Don't tell Daggett I talked.

168
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,964
Where's Leslie Thompkins?

169
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:12,841
The old lady? In there.

170
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,802
Listen, we gotta get out of here.
It's almost 9:00.

171
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,578
Don't worry about me.

172
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,039
They're blowing up the old SRO Hotel.

173
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,374
You've got to get the people out.

174
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,127
Gentlemen,

175
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,921
Gotham City is at a crossroads.

176
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,050
As businessmen,
the choice we face is clear.

177
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,886
It's time we decide where we stand.

178
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:01,181
Are we for progress or against it?

179
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:04,517
For the future or for the past?

180
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,020
For the weak or for the strong?

181
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,246
In short,

182
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:29,376
we cannot allow
the underclass to hinder us

183
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,461
from building a better tomorrow.

184
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,746
Mr. Daggett. Mr. Daggett.
Any comments on this tragedy?

185
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:09,499
Does this affect your plans
for redevelopment, Mr. Daggett?

186
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,128
It's a sad fact,

187
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:17,215
but you have to expect
violence in Crime Alley.

188
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:20,468
These people don't value
human life like we do.

189
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,556
Nobody values human life
like you do, Daggett.

190
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,727
I diffused the bomb at the hotel.

191
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:32,939
All your punks managed to destroy
were a few condemned buildings.

192
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,024
Once they confess,

193
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,985
you're finished.

194
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,570
I'm shocked.

195
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,158
Shocked to learn that arson
was the cause of this tragedy.

196
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:46,995
Thank heaven the criminals responsible
have been caught.

197
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,956
- But, Mr. Daggett, you told us to...
- Officers,

198
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,333
I believe your duty is clear.

199
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:58,840
Excuse me.

200
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:09,934
Let it go.

201
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,021
Daggett won't escape the law forever.

202
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,064
There's nothing you can do now.

203
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,984
And besides,
you have an appointment to keep.

204
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:26,117
This used to be a beautiful street.

205
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,495
Good people lived here once.

206
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,790
Good people still live in Crime Alley.
