1
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,975
<i>Has escaped today.</i>

2
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,711
<i>He is armed and considered
extremely dangerous. If seen...</i>

3
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:31,090
Oh, swell. Some nut makes trouble,
and for that, they preempt the ballgame.

4
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:33,217
Perfect ending to an awful day.

5
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:35,428
Boss turns me down for a raise,

6
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,054
our kid needs braces,

7
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,473
and Bonnie's making meatloaf for dinner.

8
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,437
At what point exactly
did I become life's punching bag?

9
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:49,483
Huh?

10
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:52,028
What's their hurry?

11
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,957
Sheesh.

12
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,084
Go on, push me aside, big shot.

13
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,463
No reason anyone should move over
and make way for Charlie Collins.

14
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,673
Hey!

15
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,471
Oh, that's it. No signal, no nothing.

16
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,097
Just treat me like I don't exist.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,850
Sorry, comrade. Not this time.

18
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,446
Hey, buddy.

19
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,406
Yeah, I'm talking to you, clown.

20
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:39,325
You think you own the whole road?

21
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,993
Why, for two cents, I'd...

22
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,953
Huh?

23
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:56,801
That was The Joker.

24
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,469
I cussed out The Joker.

25
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,528
Oh.

26
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:17,947
Oh.

27
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:35,798
Where'd all the cops go?

28
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,403
Go, go, go.

29
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,905
Come on, come on.

30
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:23,971
There's your two cents.

31
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,932
Now, what are you going to do to me?

32
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,393
Listen, I'm sorry, really.

33
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:30,811
I had a bad day.

34
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:32,164
Boss turned down my raise and...

35
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,482
Now, look, my rude friend.

36
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:38,527
We can't have people cursing
at each other on the freeway.

37
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,197
It's simply not polite.

38
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,907
Ahh!

39
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,329
I'm just going to have to teach you
some manners.

40
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:51,957
Please don't.

41
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,125
I have a family.

42
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,503
A wife, a little boy. Please.

43
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,837
I'll do anything to make it up.

44
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,922
Anything.

45
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,842
"Anything," says you?

46
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,094
Uh-huh.

47
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,930
Okey-dokey.

48
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,644
Wallet.

49
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:18,275
Sure. I don't have much cash.

50
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,612
Oh, please. Don't insult me.

51
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:28,202
"Charles Michael Collins." That's you.

52
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:29,495
Lousy picture, though.

53
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:30,621
Lousy.

54
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:33,874
"Address, height, weight."
Blah, blah, blah.

55
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,210
Righty-o, Chuckers.

56
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,419
Here's the deal.

57
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,088
I'll let you off,

58
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:43,133
if you promise to do
a little favor for me.

59
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,303
Okay. What?

60
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,138
I don't know!

61
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,266
I haven't thought of it yet.

62
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:56,146
You just toddle on back to your mundane,
meaningless little life,

63
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,941
and when I need you, I'll call.

64
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,025
Fair?

65
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,777
Good. Great!

66
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:02,987
I'll be in touch.

67
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,836
It's a waste
of time, money and manpower.

68
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,046
If I had the authority to block it,
I would.

69
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,840
Come on, Commissioner.

70
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:25,634
It's free eats,
and you get your picture in the paper.

71
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,886
It's a good deal.

72
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:36,270
"Testimonial in honor
of Police Commissioner, James Gordon."

73
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,565
"Tuesday night,
the Gotham Peregrinators Club."

74
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,567
Blasted waste of time.

75
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,152
Most of the force
would disagree with you.

76
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:47,072
If anyone should be
getting a testimonial, it's you.

77
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:48,741
I'm just the night shift.

78
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,577
You deal with this mess 24 hours a day.

79
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,471
That's what those people want to honor.

80
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,831
Okay, okay. What the heck.

81
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,833
It's a fancy club, good food.

82
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
Could be fun.

83
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,837
You don't know where
I can rent a tux, do you?

84
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,841
I hate it when he does that.

85
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,309
I arranged another early parole,

86
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:18,687
as soon as I heard
about Gordon's testimonial.

87
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,980
Phoo!

88
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,942
It is to laugh, huh, Mr. J?

89
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,489
I ask you, Harley,

90
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:33,661
who's given more hours of amusement
to the Gotham Police Force than me?

91
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,579
No one, Mr. J.

92
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,498
I deserve...

93
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:42,586
Nay. Demand the right
to honor our dear commissioner as well.

94
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,171
Hear, hear.

95
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,898
Huh?

96
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,987
Oh!

97
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,908
Gonna call in a specialist, boss?

98
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,368
No, no.

99
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,328
Just an old friend,

100
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:19,039
who's dying to do me a favor.

101
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,765
Good one, Kenny.

102
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:38,434
Go out for a long bomb.

103
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:43,605
I got it.

104
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,860
Hello?

105
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:50,070
<i>Hello, Charlie.</i>

106
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,114
Wrong number, pal.

107
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:53,532
My name is Don.

108
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:54,825
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

109
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,746
<i>This is the right number,
Charles Michael Collins.</i>

110
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,957
I don't know why
you changed your name to Don Wallace

111
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,169
and moved your family
to 12 Marigold Lane,

112
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,296
Springdale, Ohio.

113
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,884
One might think you were trying
to skip out on our little deal.

114
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,552
Leave the sideburns.

115
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,221
How did you find me?

116
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,308
Oh, I never lost you, Chaz.

117
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,935
You've become my hobby.

118
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,233
Now, listen up, Charlie Brown.

119
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,861
<i>You're booked on the next flight
to Gotham.</i>

120
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:33,947
Tell the family you have to visit
a sick friend.

121
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:37,826
Oh, and let's keep this
to ourselves, okay?

122
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,247
<i>Bad things happen to people who gossip.</i>

123
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,500
<i>Capisce, Carlo?</i>

124
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,169
Yeah.

125
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,004
<i>Good. See you.</i>

126
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:05,354
<i>Gotham Air flight 32,
now arriving from Springdale.</i>

127
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:08,941
<i>This is crazy.</i>

128
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,484
<i>I can't believe I'm doing this.</i>

129
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,617
<i>If only I had some way to,</i>

130
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,869
<i>I don't know, call him.</i>

131
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,181
Hi!

132
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,810
The car is this way, Charlie.

133
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,234
Jumping Jiminy Christmas!

134
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,403
Charlie Collins!

135
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:56,238
It's been forever.

136
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,115
How are you, man?

137
00:10:58,198 --> 00:10:59,575
You look great.

138
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,118
Lost a little weight.

139
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,996
Lost a little hair, too.

140
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,081
Oh, Charlie.

141
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,167
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

142
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:13,213
So, ready to do me that little favor?

143
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,633
Please, don't make me hurt anyone.

144
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,094
Not to worry, Chuckers.

145
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,763
As soon as you've done my favor...

146
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,057
<i>I'll send you right back home.</i>

147
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,601
<i>I promise.</i>

148
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,856
Okay, Chaz.

149
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:34,902
When Harley knocks on the door
three times, you open it.

150
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,487
- And?
- That's it.

151
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,823
Wait. That's the favor?

152
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,284
You called me here just to open a door?

153
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,287
Well, look at the size
of that cake, man!

154
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,998
She can't open the door
and push it in all at once!

155
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,583
Think!

156
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,128
He is nuts.

157
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,350
Not bad.

158
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,730
Congratulations, Jim.

159
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:13,607
I'm sorry I won't be
able to stay for dinner.

160
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:16,735
Hmm. The life of a busy socialite.

161
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,445
Any way I could sneak out with you?

162
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,580
<i>A room filled with cops,
and no way to warn them.</i>

163
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,964
<i>If there were just some way
to call Batman.</i>

164
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,771
Oh... No way.

165
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:54,439
It'd never work.

166
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,024
Not in a million...

167
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,109
Well, maybe.

168
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,953
Not staying for dinner, sir?

169
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,830
Not with The Joker on the loose.

170
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,500
Sir, I believe you may be needed inside.

171
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,751
Huh?

172
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,801
I'm honored that
Gotham's finest turned out to rub elbows

173
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:25,220
with this tired old beat cop.

174
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,726
You eating that roll, Montoya?

175
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,477
I'm really, very touched.

176
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,693
And I'll conclude by saying...

177
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:41,361
Don't stop now, Jimmy.

178
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,280
The party's just starting!

179
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,913
Baby doll. Entertainment.

180
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,002
Hey, sugar.

181
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:58,879
You want to read me my rights?

182
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,007
You have the right to remain silent.

183
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:05,927
Jerk.

184
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,479
Oh.

185
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,622
Here's to Gotham's Commissioner G.

186
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:37,542
You lock up the weirdos,
the crooks and the geeks.

187
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,879
You're a hero to all the boys in blue.

188
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,923
But this time, baby,

189
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,841
the joke's on you.

190
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:09,282
Yes!

191
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,328
Another stunning Joker entrance
leaves the crowd speechless.

192
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,914
Let's hear it for him, folks.

193
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,464
Gee! Tough audience.

194
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,094
Commissioner!

195
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,514
I'm here to present you
with a small token of affection,

196
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:36,935
from me and all the guys
doing 25 to life.

197
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,611
Wear it in good health,

198
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,989
all remaining 59 seconds of it.

199
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,992
Toodles.

200
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,373
Wait. You promised to send me home.

201
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:00,917
I never said alive.

202
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,962
You dirty, evil...

203
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,426
Sayonara, sucker.

204
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,159
Batman!

205
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,870
The commissioner's medal, it's a bomb!

206
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:51,968
Guess I'll need a new hobby,
now that old Charlie is... Pfft!

207
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,470
Macramé's nice.

208
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:58,725
That came from outside!

209
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,810
Rocko! Henshaw!

210
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,562
I smell a bat!

211
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,356
Quick! To the van!

212
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,442
Uh, Mr. J.

213
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,156
Okay. We'll tough it out here.

214
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,577
He called you his hobby?

215
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,703
Yeah.

216
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,289
For two years,
he watched me like a bug in a jar.

217
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:23,750
Watched and laughed,
and threatened my family.

218
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,002
I had no choice, Batman, really.

219
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,261
The gas is wearing off.

220
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,595
Stay with the cops.

221
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,302
I know. You're thinking,

222
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,469
"What a shame."

223
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,431
"A pure, innocent little thing like her"

224
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:22,392
"led astray by bad companions."

225
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:27,397
Right. Tell me another.

226
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,156
Oi! Beauty school is starting to look
pretty good about now.

227
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,430
Ingenious, the way they reconstructed
this temple.

228
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,307
Completely accurate,

229
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,226
right down to the poison-tipped darts.

230
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,029
The drop-away floor
is a nice touch, too. Hah!

231
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,210
Catch!

232
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,394
Hold it!

233
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:51,106
Oh, come on!

234
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:52,774
I said, hold it!

235
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,241
You miserable little nobody!

236
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:05,537
If I get caught,
your wife and son are history!

237
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:08,373
You're not getting caught,
not this time.

238
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:10,583
I found this blown out of the van.

239
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,544
This is how it ends, Joker.

240
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,878
No big schemes,

241
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:16,214
no grand fight to the finish
with the Dark Knight.

242
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,717
Tomorrow, all the papers will say,

243
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,970
"Is that the great Joker was found
blown to bits in an alley,"

244
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,347
"alongside a miserable little nobody?"

245
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:27,434
Kind of funny. Ironic, really.

246
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,311
See, I can destroy a man's dreams, too.

247
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,481
And that's really the only dream
you've got, isn't it?

248
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,484
Look, Charlie. You've had a busy day.

249
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,069
All this running around,

250
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,406
all this excitement with...
Batman!

251
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:44,159
Stop. You're crazy.

252
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,327
I had a good teacher.

253
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,580
Say good night, Gracie.

254
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,331
No!

255
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,752
Batman! Batman!

256
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,380
How long have you been there?

257
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,340
Long enough.

258
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,009
Put it down, Charlie.

259
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:03,136
You know he'll just escape again.

260
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:05,472
This is the only way
my family stays safe.

261
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,557
All right. You win. Take it easy.

262
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,186
Here's everything on his blasted family.
Names, addresses, it's all there.

263
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,025
You're no fun anymore, Charlie.

264
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,485
Hey, Joker.

265
00:21:24,991 --> 00:21:26,075
Huh?

266
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,292
Gotcha.

267
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:40,673
Oh. Very funny. A million laughs.

268
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,675
Go home, Mr. Collins.

269
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:46,095
Home. I never thought
that could sound so good.

270
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,181
Wonder what Bonnie's making for dinner.

271
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:50,243
Right now, anything would taste great.

272
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,976
Even meatloaf.
