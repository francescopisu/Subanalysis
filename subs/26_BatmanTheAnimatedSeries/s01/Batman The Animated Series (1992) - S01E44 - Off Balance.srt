(HELICOPTER HOVERING)

177
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,516
Up.

178
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,133
- BATMAN: Going somewhere, Vertigo?
- No.

179
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,303
- It's impossible!
- BATMAN: Nothing is impossible.

180
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,600
Then I will finish you both myself.

I can't take much more of this.

184
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,047
Only one thing to do.

185
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,382
No!

his agents have all fled?

191
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:56,194
Yes. The Society of Shadows
is no longer what it was.

192
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,453
Well, I've gotta get this back
to Gotham City.

193
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,458
Wait. I can't let you leave like this,

194
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,460
not with the drill.

195
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,966
I thought I finally knew
which side you were on.

196
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,051
I should have known better,

197
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,054
considering that you knew
where everything was in the monastery.

198
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,514
How could you have,

199
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:26,641
unless you were one of them?

200
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,941
I am truly sorry, Batman.
It could have been...

201
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,735
Sweet.

Vertigo has been dealt with, Father.

MAN: Small wonder you seem so pleased.

205
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,298

<i>- A complete success.</i>

206

207
