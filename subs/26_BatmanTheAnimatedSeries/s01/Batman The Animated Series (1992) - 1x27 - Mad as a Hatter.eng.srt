1
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,546
Oh, dear.

2
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,381
Such table manners.

3
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,305
Perhaps I can make you act
a bit more civilized.

4
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:56,032
Bravo!

5
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,076
They all laughed when I said I'd find
a way to tap into another

6
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,453
creature's mind.

7
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,414
Why, with this band and these
electrodes,

8
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,499
I can control anything.

9
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,171
Psst, Jervis.

10
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,884
Oh, Alice.
What a nice surprise.

11
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,679
Yeah, yeah. Look busy.

12
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,515
Dr. Cates, Mr. Wayne.

13
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,854
Right this way.

14
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:36,572
Bruce, you remember Jervis Tetch.

15
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,409
- Hello.
- Of course.

16
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,830
I read your proposal on using microchips
to enhance the brain's potential.

17
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,207
Sounds intriguing.

18
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,544
Actually, the prototype
isn't quite ready yet.

19
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,924
Tetch, I think we owe our founder
and employer, Mr. Wayne,

20
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,968
a little more than lame excuses.

21
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,305
- Sorry.
- That's all right, Dr. Cates.

22
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,557
Mr. Tetch is a valued member
of our research team.

23
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,685
I'm sure we can spare him more time.

24
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,603
As you say, Bruce.

25
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,564
Thank you.

26
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,243
You got off easy this time, Tetch,

27
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:25,538
but heads could roll
if you slip up again.

28
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:39,218
She's always like that
when the big boss drops by.

29
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,221
Cheer up. Mr. Wayne knows
what you mean to the company.

30
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,389
Oh.

31
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:48,102
Sometimes, Alice, I think you're
the only one who understands me.

32
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,647
That's just
what my boyfriend says.

33
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:59,572
I guess I'm lucky to have two
such amazing men in my life.

34
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,449
See you after lunch.

35
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,085
Of course, intellectually,
I know it's all wrong.

36
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,546
She's got a boyfriend, after all.

37
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,008
Better to withdraw like a gentleman.
Forget her.

38
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,260
Turn my heart to other pursuits.

39
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,558
Never!

40
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,730
Look. I've already developed
a circuitry card

41
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,316
powerful enough
to control a human brain.

42
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:40,654
It would be so easy to make her forget
her boorish beau and love me.

43
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,906
Ah.

44
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,534
But that would reduce her
to a soulless shell.

45
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,579
Oh, no, not my Alice.

46
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:49,705
Oh.

47
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,291
It's hopeless.

48
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,878
- DR.
- Oh, Alice, I'm sorry.

49
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,347
Curiouser and curiouser.

50
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:12,478
I just wanted to talk about
where our relationship was going

51
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,730
and Billy got so defensive.

52
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,318
Mmm. Classic male fear of commitment.

53
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,364
The next thing I knew,
we were shouting, screaming.

54
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,034
Saying we never wanted
to see each other again.

55
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,041
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!

56
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:35,835
She's mine for the asking.

57
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:40,673
I'll sweep her off her feet, treat her
to a wonderful night on the town and...

58
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,884
Nothing.

59
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,304
What could a beautiful girl like her
ever see in someone like me?

60
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,932
How could I impress her?

61
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:52,726
Hmm.

62
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,522
How, indeed.

63
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,156
Jervis?

64
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,580
Good evening, Miss Pleasance.

65
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:15,958
I'm here to help you forget
your recent heartbreak.

66
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,169
Gotham can be a wonderland, Alice.

67
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,172
Tonight, let me be your guide.

68
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,050
I'll get my coat.

69
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,808
Did you see that?

70
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,896
- Gotta be the Bat-Creep.
- Hey, easy money headed our way.

71
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,906
This is really a surprise, Jervis.
You're so...

72
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,574
Quiet at work.

73
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,327
Ah, still waters run deep, my dear.

74
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,664
It's been my philosophy that people
should take what they want from life.

75
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,708
Hey, ours too.

76
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,920
Okay, Mr. Hat, let's have the money.

77
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:03,839
On your way, curs,
lest I'm forced to teach you a lesson.

78
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,132
Jervis, no.

79
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:07,635
It's your funeral, nut boy.

80
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,187
Please, Mr. Hat, go easy on us.

81
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,814
We're sorry. Honest.

82
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:27,112
Why don't you do something useful,
like, oh, go jump in the river.

83
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,906
Okay.

84
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,452
- Are you all right?
- I'm sorry you had to see that.

85
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,496
But they had to be taught a lesson.

86
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,421
<i>Dare we hope Gotham treats you
to an early evening, sir?</i>

87
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,218
I should be so lucky. The police
emergency band just switched on.

88
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,974
<i>Then I'll prepare your usual breakfast,
toast, coffee, bandages.</i>

89
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,934
Good night, Alfred.

90
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,703
<i>All units. All units.</i>

91
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:02,106
<i>Two possible suicides reported scaling
the Gotham Bridge suspension tower.</i>

92
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,817
<i>- All units, please respond.</i>
- Guess I'm elected.

93
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,673
Engage.

94
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,682
Lousy night for a swim.

95
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,934
Mr. Hat told us to jump in the river.

96
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:44,023
Right. Look, you guys stay calm and...

97
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,233
Gotta do what Mr. Hat says.

98
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,699
Stop!

99
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:55,576
No!

100
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,772
Hey, man, keep away from me.

101
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,732
We never touched the creep.

102
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,986
Okay, maybe we hit him up
for money, but we never...

103
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,655
Hey, what are we doing here?

104
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:45,209
Monsieur Tetch, I have created
a gastronomical delight for you.

105
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,586
All on the house, of course.

106
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,129
Thank you, Antoine.

107
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:50,798
Pardon, Monsieur Tetch.

108
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:54,551
Would you be so kind as to favor us
with a photo for our celebrity wall?

109
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,762
Enchanté, my dear.

110
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,393
I had no idea you were
such a man about town.

111
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,107
Ah, this is a side I share only
with those closest to me.

112
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:25,040
Don't forget to lock up
when you're done, Mr. Tetch.

113
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,375
Right-o.

114
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:37,678
You know, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>
was always my favorite story.

115
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:41,223
Do you remember
"The Mock Turtle's Song"?

116
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:44,059
<i>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you</i>

117
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:46,395
Won't you join the dance?

118
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:07,833
When you showed me that strange card,
I recalled an image from my childhood.

119
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,419
It seems those near-suicides

120
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:13,505
had a run-in
with a self-styled Mad Hatter.

121
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:16,466
I saw that picture earlier today

122
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,471
in the office of a scientist
who creates circuitry similar to this.

123
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:32,566
Thank you for a wonderful time.
You're a terrific friend.

124
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,694
Until tomorrow, dear Alice.

125
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:42,367
Tomorrow and every day afterward.

126
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,293
What a sweet, funny man.

127
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,466
- Alice?
- Billy?

128
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,929
Baby, I'm sorry. Can we talk?

129
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,285
<i>Will you, won't you, will you...</i>

130
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:17,486
Ah, good morning. Hello!
Good to see you. Lovely day, what?

131
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,208
Oh, Jervis, thanks so much
for cheering me up last night.

132
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,169
Listen, I have the most incredible news.

133
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,213
Billy was there
after you dropped me off.

134
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:38,548
He apologized. I forgave him.

135
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:41,051
And then, he gave me this.

136
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,136
Can you believe it?

137
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,265
I'm getting married.

138
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,520
Jervis, your hand.

139
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,982
Oh, it's nothing. Forget it.

140
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,277
- And congratulations.
- Jervis?

141
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,528
Jervis?

142
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,954
I can still fix this. I can still win!

143
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:10,831
- DR.
- Tetch!

144
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,083
I don't know what you did,

145
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,961
but Bruce Wayne
is demanding to see you now!

146
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,298
I promise you, Tetch, it's your head

147
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,925
if you've gotten
my department in any trouble.

148
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,761
Oh, do be quiet, Dr. Cates!

149
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:35,939
Excuse me, Alice.
Have you seen Marcia or Jervis Tetch?

150
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,483
They left together
about half an hour ago.

151
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,985
Together?

152
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,990
Hello? Hi, sweetie.

153
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,285
- My fiancé.
- Congratulations.

154
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,125
Billy, what's wrong?
You sound so... What?

155
00:13:56,084 --> 00:14:00,464
But why? Billy? Billy.

156
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:07,054
Excuse me, Mr. Wayne.
I think I'm gonna need a minute alone.

157
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,021
Sorry, Billy, me lad,
but all's fair in love and war.

158
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,585
Alice, darling.

159
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,340
I had to come back when I heard
that cad abandoned you again.

160
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,968
How did you know? I didn't tell anyone.

161
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,720
Oh, pish tosh.

162
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,974
What matters now is we have each other,
now and forever.

163
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,559
Oh...

164
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,853
This is getting too weird.

165
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,357
What have you done with
Marcia Cates and this girl's fiancé?

166
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:02,943
No, I don't like this game.

167
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,361
Let's play another.

168
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:18,834
I anticipated there'd be trouble sooner
or later, so I enlisted some help.

169
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:24,089
I'm sure you recognize my friends,
the Walrus and the Carpenter.

170
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,108
Why are you doing this?

171
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,819
For us, my dearest.

172
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:49,823
Oh, believe me.
I didn't want it this way.

173
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,101
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.

174
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:03,063
How I wonder what you're at.

175
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:18,370
Now, this is a game more to my liking.

176
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,666
Are you, the famous Batman,
so intent upon destroying my happiness

177
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:27,045
that you'll harm these poor,
mind-warped innocents to get me?

178
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,381
Let's find out.

179
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,472
Off with his head.

180
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,860
Oh, one thing I forgot to mention.

181
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:54,281
My control over my pawns
increases their strength.

182
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,616
Guess you found that out, huh?

183
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,625
Oh!

184
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,379
Off with his head!

185
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:35,905
Batman.

186
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:39,868
There's the knave. Off with his head!

187
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,120
They're programmed to attack me.

188
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,706
- But they won't fight you.
- I gotcha.

189
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:50,879
My aching skull.

190
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:53,673
Come, my dear. It's time we were away.

191
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,747
You're mighty
in Gotham, Batman,

192
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,459
but in Wonderland,
the Mad Hatter reigns supreme.

193
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:09,916
I'll cut that cowl off your neck
before you'll take her.

194
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,794
I've waited my whole
lonely life for her!

195
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,672
Then all you've waited for is a puppet.

196
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,384
A soulless little doll.

197
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:23,888
It didn't have to be this way.
You made me do this to her!

198
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,251
Grrr!

199
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,615
- Alice?
- Oh, Billy!

200
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:38,797
Would not, could not...

201
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,716
Would not, could not.

202
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,303
Oh, could not join the dance.
