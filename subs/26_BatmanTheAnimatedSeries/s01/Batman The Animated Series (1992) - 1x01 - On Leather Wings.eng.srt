1
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,254
<i>This is Gotham Air One
reporting in.</i>

2
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,047
Things are actually quiet, for once.

3
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,969
- You see that?
- What?

4
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,139
I had a blip.
It just ghosted across my screen.

5
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,391
- I don't see anything.
- It was there.

6
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,615
Whatever it is,
it must be right below us.

7
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:45,855
- There it is.
- There what is?

8
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,524
It looked like bat wings.

9
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,192
Bat wings?

10
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,237
Okay, take us up through those clouds,
just in case.

11
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,663
Sorry, kid.

12
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,248
There's nothing up here.

13
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,875
I swear, I saw it.

14
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,252
Something was flying
around up here.

15
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:34,293
Testing, one, two, three.

16
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,155
Testing, one, two, three.

17
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,115
You, too, can fulfill the dream

18
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:39,825
of being a high-paid radio personality

19
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:41,786
in your spare time, just like me.

20
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,496
Just call...

21
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,416
Just call
the Gotham Institute of Broadcast Arts.

22
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,395
Yeah, that's better.
Call the Gotham...

23
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,820
Get away!

24
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,804
I didn't authorize
this statement, Detective.

25
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,227
Come on, Commissioner.

26
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,354
Somebody asked me
a couple of questions.

27
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,690
I just gave them
a couple of answers.

28
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,984
You gave them without my approval.

29
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,131
If you'd kept quiet, he wouldn't know
we're moving against him.

30
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,447
I'll find him.

31
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,574
I just need
a little extra help, Your Honor.

32
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,075
What kind of help?

33
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,362
I want my own tactical squad

34
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:07,663
for the sole purpose
of throwing a net over this Batman.

35
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:10,624
- Commissioner?
- I've already denied the request.

36
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,586
Nobody's taking a vigilante force
onto my streets.

37
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,672
Your Honor, any nutcase
that dresses up like a bat,

38
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:18,507
sooner or later is gonna snap.

39
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,718
Listen, it's just not Batman's M.O.

40
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:23,778
Oh, yeah? Tell that to the guy
he just tossed through the window.

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,270
I think we could
spare a few men, Commissioner.

42
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,351
Detective Bullock does have a reputation
for getting results.

43
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,520
I'm authorizing the strike force.

44
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,105
Anything else, Detective?

45
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,192
Just make sure the D.A.'s office
can give me an airtight case, sir.

46
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,027
If you catch him, Harvey,

47
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,570
I'll put him in jail for you.

48
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,414
"Gotham police
declare war on Batman"?

49
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,868
I gather you've been reading

50
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,084
<i>How to Make Friends
and Influence People.</i>

51
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,129
Somebody's setting me up.

52
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,380
My heavens.

53
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,965
You mean, it wasn't you

54
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,801
tossing guards
out of windows last night?

55
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,136
I only toss butlers, Alfred.

56
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:06,555
Look here.
There were two very quiet burglaries

57
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,651
at other pharmaceutical
companies this week.

58
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:10,100
Nobody hurt like last night,

59
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:12,937
but chemicals stolen just the same.

60
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,772
And you suspect a pattern?

61
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,649
Only one way to find out.

62
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,360
I'll cancel
Master Bruce's rendezvous with

63
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,195
Bambi, was it, sir?

64
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,988
Yes, Alfred, do that.

65
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,173
Come here, you.

66
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:29,179
- He's back.
- I'll call the police.

67
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,014
<i>Calling Detective Bullock.</i>

68
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,122
<i>Calling Detective Bullock.</i>

69
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:56,832
Yeah?

70
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,126
<i>The Batman's been sighted
breaking into Phoenix labs.</i>

71
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,628
<i>Thought you'd be interested.</i>

72
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,339
I want my squad there,
backed by choppers

73
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,342
and as many officers
as you can get now.

74
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,473
You're mine.

75
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,001
<i>Call the Gotham...</i>

76
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,354
All right, you jokers,
pipe down!

77
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,314
He's in there.

78
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,191
I want him
by any means necessary.

79
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,541
Commissioner, you're just in time

80
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,626
to see us hang this bat upside down.

81
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,213
You sure he's in there?

82
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,091
The chopper pilots just spotted him
on the fourth floor.

83
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,233
Well, he can't be in two places at once.

84
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,430
Another pharmaceutical factory
was just robbed across town.

85
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,974
- You've got the wrong suspect.
- What?

86
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,110
There!

87
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,760
Gas attack.

88
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,494
Put on your masks.

89
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,004
Hey, there he is.

90
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:54,593
Well, somebody's in there, Commissioner.

91
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,637
Call them off, Bullock, or I will.

92
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:11,193
The Bat's got to be in there, sir.
What do you think?

93
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,117
- Tear gas?
- We'll smoke him out.

94
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,577
Okay, men, ready with your masks.

95
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,454
<i>The Gotham Zoo tour tram

96
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,791
<i>Adventures in Chiroptery,</i>

97
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,043
<i>at the Bat Exhibit,

98
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:19,595
Hello?

99
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,054
Anybody here?

100
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,183
Dr. March?

101
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,477
Who is it?

102
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,480
Bruce Wayne.
I have an appointment.

103
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:31,982
I called about a bat problem.

104
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,401
What do you think we are?
Pest control?

105
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:36,945
- I just need...
- Yes. Come in.

106
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,031
Why, thank you, Doctor.

107
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,909
You donate a few million,
and you think you own the place.

108
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,078
I understand
I'm to analyze something for you.

109
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,041
Yeah, Doc.
I keep hearing squeaks in my chimney

110
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:51,099
and I found these in my empty fireplace.

111
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:52,753
They look like hairs.

112
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,464
I thought maybe you could tell me
if I have a bat problem.

113
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:58,342
And what if they are bats, Mr. Wayne?
What then?

114
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:00,427
Destroy them like insects?

115
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:03,305
We won't survive
the next evolutionary cataclysm,

116
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:04,806
but bats will.

117
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:07,434
They're survivors, Mr. Wayne,
not pests.

118
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,144
You should understand that.

119
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:10,479
Dad?

120
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,982
I hope Mr. Wayne understands
you mean no disrespect.

121
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,568
Of course not, Miss...

122
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,112
Mrs.
Actually, Doctor.

123
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:20,614
I'm Francine Langstrom.

124
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:22,829
I think you spoke with my husband
on the phone.

125
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,078
Oh, Mr. Wayne,
I'm sorry I'm late.

126
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:27,621
I'm Kirk Langstrom.

127
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,248
Did you bring the sample?

128
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:31,458
I gave it to Dr. Mar...

129
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,210
Where'd he go?

130
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,003
Probably to get started on the analysis.

131
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,881
If it's a bat problem,
we'll know by tonight.

132
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:41,176
Dad was lecturing Mr. Wayne
on the virtues of chiroptera.

133
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:43,095
Chiropt-a-what?

134
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,596
Chiroptera. Bats.

135
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:47,766
And I hope he didn't get carried away?

136
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,811
He's a little protective of all this.

137
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,064
I think he likes bats
better than people.

138
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:55,816
I can't imagine.

139
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:57,150
I brought you this, too.

140
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,486
It's a recording I made
of the noise in my chimney.

141
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,705
That doesn't sound like any bat
I've ever heard, Mr. Wayne.

142
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,627
The animal-behavior people
have a sound library.

143
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,129
Maybe they can identify it.

144
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:18,922
We'll let you know.

145
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,674
I'd appreciate it.

146
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,436
I didn't realize you'd taken up
listening to rock 'n' roll, sir.

147
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,646
You know, I actually did check this

148
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,315
against any musical sounds.

149
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:38,692
Computer still can't come close
to pinpointing it.

150
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:44,364
Wayne Manor.
One moment, please.

151
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:46,325
A call for Master Bruce

152
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,993
from a Dr. March.

153
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,371
Hey, what's up, Doc?

154
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,914
<i>You have bats, Mr. Wayne.</i>

155
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,291
<i>Common brown bats.</i>

156
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,876
They shouldn't pose a problem.

157
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:57,804
As the weather gets colder,
they'll move on.

158
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,504
<i>What about the sound on the tape?</i>

159
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,131
It's actually two sounds.

160
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,716
Starlings and brown bats.

161
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,093
Probably fighting over
a nest in your chimney.

162
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:06,636
Appreciate the help, Doc.

163
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:09,389
I'll return the favor
next time you're raising funds.

164
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:10,682
Bye-bye.

165
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:12,476
This computer checked that fiber

166
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,853
against every animal species
known to man.

167
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,657
I went to them because I thought
they might know something we didn't.

168
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,109
That hair wasn't a brown bat's.

169
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:24,071
And those melodic sounds?

170
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,324
Computer, check against combined sounds.

171
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:29,326
Starlings and brown bats.

172
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,372
<i>Negative.</i>

173
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,374
<i>Sounds not originated
by either species.</i>

174
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,085
I would say, sir,

175
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,879
that we have ourselves an incongruity.

176
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,464
Incongruity, Alfred?

177
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,132
He's lying.

178
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,134
And I'm gonna find out why.

179
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:23,463
Can't fight it.
It's got me.

180
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,871
Who's back there?

181
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:59,541
You!
I'm looking for Dr. March.

182
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,543
He's not here, Batman.

183
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:05,213
Where is he?

184
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,757
Giving a lecture
on human extinction

185
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,176
and bat evolution.

186
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,261
He's really quite brilliant.

187
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,513
He's misguided and a thief.

188
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,348
He's just a theorist.

189
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,267
He was afraid
to put it to the test.

190
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,019
But I wasn't.

191
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,229
I knew we'd discovered a formula

192
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,106
to create a totally new species.

193
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,941
Neither man nor bat.

194
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,860
And once I started taking it,

195
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,111
I couldn't stop.

196
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:29,863
I desperately wanted to.

197
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,240
But it took over.

198
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,118
Francine and March
tried to protect me,

199
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,953
but it was too late.

200
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,540
The beast knew what chemicals
were needed to bring itself about.

201
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,501
It was out of my control.

202
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,962
And it only needs one more component

203
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,089
to complete the process.

204
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,509
It's in me,

205
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,010
Batman.

206
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,730
Kirk!

207
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,395
I'm getting something strange.

208
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:27,230
Oh, not again!

209
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,566
I'm serious.
It's right below us.

210
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,111
Whoa!

211
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,322
Gotham Command, we need choppers.

212
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:37,115
We've sighted the Batman.

213
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,427
- Let's go!
- I can't do it, sir.

214
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,122
What do you mean you can't do it?

215
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:02,015
I just got word not to let you up
without the Commissioner.

216
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,601
- Who told you that?
- The Commissioner.

217
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,478
Get out, Detective!

218
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,481
The Mayor may not let me fire you,

219
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,941
but I am not taking the heat
for your fiascoes.

220
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,903
This is my case, Commissioner!
You heard the Mayor!

221
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,155
Then why don't you go
take it up with him?

222
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,573
I've got a job to do.

223
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:20,909
If you want to tag along,
fine!

224
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:24,913
Take her up, Lieutenant.

225
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:27,916
Hey, wait for me!

226
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:17,340
- There he is.
- There they are.

227
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,009
What is that thing?

228
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,720
That thing is what we're after.

229
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,638
Holy...

230
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,215
Two for dinner, sir?

231
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:02,385
I got a list of all the items
stolen from the chemical labs.

232
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:06,014
Who would have thought
they'd be used to create a monster?

233
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,560
Maybe I can undo the fate
Langstrom has brought upon himself.

234
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,733
Does it appear feasible, sir?

235
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:18,735
I think so.

236
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,334
Is he all right?

237
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,547
- Will he change again?
- No.

238
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:41,508
The formula's out of his system.

239
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:43,384
It's over...

240
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:44,886
for now.
