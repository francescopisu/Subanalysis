1
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,981
<i>Previously on</i> Batman...

2
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:07,024
That's what ain't good for you.

3
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:10,194
Having to keep going back
to Daggett for more of that stuff.

4
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,280
You're right, Teddy. I can't.

5
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,367
I'll have to find a way
to get lots of this stuff on my own.

6
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:20,246
I think our Mr. Hagen
has outlived his usefulness.

7
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,416
<i>I want him dealt with.</i>

8
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:27,461
- No.
- Sweet dreams, slimeball.

9
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,508
"Bruce Wayne
sought for questioning"

10
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,011
"in attempt on executive's life"?

11
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,996
Mr. Wayne,
what was it like to be in jail?

12
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,416
How do you respond to the
charges that you assaulted Lucius Fox?

13
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:07,835
No comment. My client has no comment.

14
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,272
- Let us through, please.
- Mr. Wayne, over here.

15
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,110
Mr. Wayne, Mr. Wayne,
over here.

16
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,302
Over here.

17
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,846
Mr. Wayne, could you talk to us?

18
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:26,604
Imagine, Lucius Fox thinking
I would harm him.

19
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,024
And he's been with you,
what, ten years now, sir?

20
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:33,694
Then whoever impersonated you
did an uncanny job.

21
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,696
"Whoever" is right.

22
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,448
Bell said he didn't know.

23
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,033
He had to be lying.

24
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,202
But I know where to get the truth.

25
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,714
Move it, Lupus.

26
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,384
I want all this stuff
out of here by sunrise.

27
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:59,220
Ah, Matt, come on,
you don't have to do this.

28
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,889
You made a comeback before.
You can do it again.

29
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,308
Comeback?

30
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:06,560
Comeback? From this?

31
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,939
Face it, Teddy, Matt Hagen is history.

32
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,482
This time, for good.

33
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,067
He's never coming back again.

34
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:18,197
My contact on the force
says Bell hasn't cracked, so far.

35
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,076
Good. Well, I'm afraid we still have
quite a mess to clean up.

36
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:26,080
Sooner or later, I will take control
of Wayne Enterprises.

37
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,922
Their marketing operation
will instantly give me

38
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:38,926
a distribution network that would
take me years to build on my own.

39
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:44,014
Till then, my takeover plan
will have to be revised.

40
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,520
Now that our actor friend,
Hagen, is no longer available to us.

41
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:55,234
Okay, Mr. Daggett, who do you want
me to take out now?

42
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:59,196
I want everything wrapped up
by the time I tape that show tonight.

43
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:02,032
We're going to settle the Fox matter
once and for all.

44
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,288
But, Mr. Daggett, he's in a hospital.
All those sick people...

45
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:15,045
Okay, Mr. Daggett.

46
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,174
But, Matt,

47
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,384
you thought it was all over
for you once before,

48
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,011
and you were wrong then.

49
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,971
You know, when you had your accident.

50
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,723
Of course I thought it was over.

51
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,225
I figured I was lucky to be alive.

52
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,731
<i>Just like I thought I was when Daggett
came to visit me at his clinic of his,</i>

53
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,692
<i>asking me to be his first test subject.</i>

54
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,319
<i>How could I say no?</i>

55
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,530
<i>He told me his Renuyu formula
could do in minutes</i>

56
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:44,408
<i>what plastic surgery would take years
to accomplish.</i>

57
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,751
It wasn't so bad,

58
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,921
except for all those jobs
you had to do for him in return.

59
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,341
But, hey, it worked.

60
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,927
I mean, you had your biggest hits
after the accident.

61
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,725
Yeah. Some of the best parts I ever had.

62
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:16,315
Matt! You're changing.

63
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,359
And you didn't use your hands this time.

64
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,277
You didn't even try.

65
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,490
You did it automatically,
like a reflex or something.

66
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,991
Unbelievable.

67
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,868
You know what this means, don't you?

68
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,162
It doesn't have to be over.

69
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,539
You can go on.

70
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,123
We can go on.

71
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,300
Wow!

72
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:46,720
You can even form clothes
out of your skin.

73
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,556
But, how?

74
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:52,017
The formula must've soaked
every cell in my body.

75
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:00,484
It's... It's some kind of miracle.

76
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,657
- What... What are you doing?
- No.

77
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,743
No. You broke my concentration!

78
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,204
It won't work, don't you see?
It's too hard.

79
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,582
It's like tensing a muscle.

80
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,333
I can't keep it up for long.

81
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,628
My career, my life...

82
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,713
It is gone!

83
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,131
And I can never get it back!

84
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,928
I'm not an actor anymore.

85
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:30,472
I'm not even a man.

86
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:36,645
Pull in here.

87
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,398
The hospital?

88
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,985
Sooner or later, Daggett will
send someone to finish off Fox.

89
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,446
Once I know who it is, I can

90
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,156
take his place.

91
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,909
And if Daggett thinks I'm his henchman,

92
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,994
I can walk right up to him and,

93
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,162
"Bam!"

94
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,918
Goodbye, Mr. Daggett.

95
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,925
Hey!

96
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:11,907
Let me out of here. Please.

97
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,286
All these viruses and bacteria,
I could be infected.

98
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,997
I know.

99
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,335
Now, the man who impersonated
Bruce Wayne,

100
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,629
I want his name.

101
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,382
I, uh, I don't know who, uh...

102
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:34,096
Hmm. Crimson fever.

103
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,806
Lousy way to go.

104
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,891
No cure, you know.

105
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,019
The name. Now!

106
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,271
Okay, okay, it was Hagen.

107
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,898
Matt Hagen, the movie actor.

108
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,902
It's the truth. I swear!

109
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,654
Then, how did he fool Fox?

110
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:54,408
He's good, but no actor,
no makeup, is that good.

111
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,326
I... I don't know.

112
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:00,664
You're crazy!

113
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:02,207
Last chance.

114
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,794
- Talk!
- All right. He had something.

115
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,464
Something nobody else had. He could...

116
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,174
Nice going, Batman.

117
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:13,093
But I'll take it from here.

118
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,354
- This is my collar.
- Just a moment.

119
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:38,243
What in the name of...

120
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:39,578
Shut up.

121
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,021
Relax, Germs.

122
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,774
You won't have to hang around here
too long.

123
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,127
What in the name of heaven...

124
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:31,547
Back off!

125
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,177
Huh?

126
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,193
All that shape-changing
takes a lot out of you, doesn't it?

127
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:20,072
<i>Tomorrow on</i> Gotham Insider,

128
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:23,075
<i>my guest will be pharmaceutical king,
Roland Daggett,</i>

129
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,454
<i>whose new product can perform
miracles even plastic surgery can't.</i>

130
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,334
Not even the Batman can stop me, Teddy.

131
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,379
And that means,
Daggett won't have a prayer.

132
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,505
Matt, please.

133
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,759
You don't want to do anything crazy.
Why don't you try to get some shuteye?

134
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,680
Don't you dare patronize me!

135
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,890
I told you, I don't need rest.

136
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,308
I don't need food!

137
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,852
And I don't need you!

138
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:57,859
Ah!

139
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,960
I've acquired the Matt Hagen
films you requested, sir.

140
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,337
Good, because now I'm sure that

141
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,631
that thing I fought
at the hospital is Hagen.

142
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:21,925
His condition is apparently
the tragic result

143
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,304
of an experiment conducted
by Roland Daggett.

144
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,182
Hagen apparently transforms,
unconsciously sometimes,

145
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:31,310
like a reflex action.

146
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,913
<i>A face-lift in a jar?</i>

147
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:55,143
<i>I love that idea. That's interesting.</i>

148
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,211
If you'll watch the monitors,
you'll see that with Renuyu,

149
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:00,213
you can smooth away wrinkles,

150
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,424
reshape imperfections.

151
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:07,220
Literally, remake your face
however you choose.

152
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,764
- Oh, that's great!
- Yeah.

153
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,981
<i>Amazing stuff, Rolly.</i>

154
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:20,650
<i>I see we have some questions
in our audience.</i>

155
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,738
I'd like to ask Mr. Daggett
about the rumors I've heard.

156
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,699
I hear he's selling Renuyu
through direct marketing

157
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:31,995
because stores won't carry it
due to its harmful side effects.

158
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,830
Well, that's, uh...

159
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,416
Absolutely untrue.

160
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:40,504
What about the addictive properties
of Renuyu, Mr. Daggett?

161
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,547
How, once you're hooked on it,

162
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:46,426
you can't stop using it
without horrible pain?

163
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,053
No. I mean...

164
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:49,763
That's just not so.

165
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,521
Why don't you show them
what an overdose can do, Daggett.

166
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,191
Why don't you tell them about me?

167
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:31,972
Huh?

168
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:37,310
Huh?

169
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,440
You again.

170
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,775
Hagen, listen to me.

171
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,360
There is no Hagen.

172
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,197
It's only me now, Clayface.

173
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:30,715
See? I figured out
how to manage this thing pretty good.

174
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:39,701
What are you doing? Stop it!

175
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,620
Look at them, Hagen.

176
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,830
Look at what you used to be.

177
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:47,000
No. No.

178
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,460
Turn them off.

179
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,462
You can play those roles again, Hagen.

180
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,131
Let me help you find a cure.

181
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:55,508
No! Hagen's gone.

182
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,302
Make him stop haunting me!

183
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,609
Stop it. Stop it. Turn them off.

184
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,777
I can't control it.

185
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,904
I can't be all of them. Not all at once.

186
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,083
Stop!

187
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,437
Mother of mercy.

188
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,648
It looks just like Bruce Wayne.

189
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,047
You know what I'd have given
for a death scene like this?

190
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,049
Too bad I won't get to...

191
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,301
Read the notices.

192
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,604
<i>I'm just glad to know</i>

193
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,690
<i>it wasn't really Bruce Wayne
who attacked me.</i>

194
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,358
<i>Thank you, Mr. Fox.</i>

195
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,277
<i>All charges against Wayne have,</i>

196
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,695
<i>of course, been dropped.</i>

197
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,531
<i>And Roland Daggett remains in custody.</i>

198
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,829
Mmm.

199
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,539
My word, sir.

200
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:52,625
I should think after all this,
it would be time to rest.

201
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,752
Look.

202
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:57,213
A piece of clay left behind
when they took Hagen's body away.

203
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,840
Watch.

204
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,308
Electricity has no effect on it?

205
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,434
Exactly.

206
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,728
<i>I wouldn't be surprised</i>

207
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:14,981
<i>if the body they took
to the morgue was only a shell.</i>

208
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,612
<i>Don't forget, first and foremost,
Hagen was an actor.</i>

209
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,198
<i>He said it himself, Alfred,</i>

210
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:24,783
<i>he called it a scene.</i>

211
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,702
<i>Maybe the greatest scene of his career.</i>

212
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,871
See you around, Matt.

213
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,795
<i>A death scene so real,
it fooled us all.</i>
