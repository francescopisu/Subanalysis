1
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:41,767
- How we doing for time?
- Bullock's meeting us at 2300 hours.

2
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,270
We'll be there
with time to spare. Relax.

3
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,697
Sorry. I've never worked a sting before.

4
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,741
It ought to be a hot one.

5
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:04,707
Hot is right. What happened?

6
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,089
Where's Bullock?

7
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,052
I don't know, but we're in deep trouble.

8
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,762
We've got to find Bullock.

9
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:28,522
- Detective Bullock. Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

10
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:32,234
Do you realize what this means?
Why didn't you wait for us?

11
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:47,875
- Let's go.
- Wait. More inside.

12
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,794
Wilkes, go after those two.

13
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:51,671
I'll check out the warehouse.

14
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,517
Batman!

15
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:12,692
When I'm done with you clowns,
you won't qualify as security guards!

16
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:15,569
The department works months
to nail that drug lord.

17
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,406
We lay out $2 million in cash
for the sting.

18
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,534
And in five stinking minutes,
you idiots blow it!

19
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,079
- Hey, I didn't blow anything.
- Well, one of you did!

20
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,459
Or maybe what we've got here
is three cops on the take.

21
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,255
- That's uncalled for.
- What? You can't be serious.

22
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:37,258
Where does he get off?
Hey, I'll tell you who's to blame.

23
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,384
Batman!

24
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,347
- You saw the Batman, too?
- Come on, Harvey, Batman's fault?

25
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,766
Then whose fault is it, Officer?

26
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,936
I don't know, but I'm sure
it wasn't Batman. He was...

27
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,898
Either you start coming up with
some answers or hand over your badges.

28
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,651
I'm telling you, Lieutenant,
Batman blew the bust.

29
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,487
Montoya and Wilkes were late,
so I had to go in alone.

30
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,323
We weren't late!

31
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,161
You had your chance.
All right, Bullock, let's have it.

32
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:08,122
Like I said, I had to go in alone.

33
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,794
<i>I was waiting for Wilkes and Montoya
when I saw that blasted Batman</i>

34
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,045
<i>enter the warehouse.</i>

35
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,339
<i>I couldn't wait for backup any longer.</i>

36
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,342
<i>I was afraid he'd screw up the bust,
so I followed him.</i>

37
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,294
Got it.

38
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,718
The boss was right.
Must be a couple of mil in here.

39
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,770
<i>I was closing in
when this loud noise tipped them.</i>

40
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,274
<i>Must have been Batman.</i>

41
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,818
What was that?

42
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,669
Freeze, maggots!
You're all under arrest!

43
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:40,339
- Jeez!
- Over there. Get him!

44
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,326
Fry, copper!

45
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,648
<i>In spite of the fire,
I had everything under control</i>

46
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,484
<i>and then Batman showed up
and bungled everything.</i>

47
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,459
<i>Lucky I was there to save his butt.</i>

48
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:48,092
It took my last bit of strength
to get us out.

49
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,887
- So you went in because of Batman.
- I told you. They were late.

50
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:55,891
Were you trying to beat them out
of the collar or beat them to the cash?

51
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,645
- Ease up, Lieutenant.
- No. You back off, Commissioner!

52
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,607
Gordon, this is my investigation,
so pipe down or get out!

53
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,985
He knows they were
supposed to go in as a team.

54
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,363
Bullock, I demand to know
the real reason you didn't wait

55
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:10,614
for the rest of your team.

56
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:13,075
- Bullock!
- Give me a break.

57
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:15,257
Why don't you ask them
why they were late?

58
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:17,287
But we weren't late, Detective.

59
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,165
All right, let's hear from the rookie.

60
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,585
Maybe he knows who's to blame
for this screw-up.

61
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,135
Well, like Officer Montoya said,
we weren't late.

62
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,846
When we arrived,
Detective Bullock was down.

63
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,473
Then the two suspects
came out of the building.

64
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,893
<i>I pursued them while Officer Montoya
went into the warehouse.</i>

65
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:43,647
<i>When I looked into the alley...</i>

66
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,109
<i>The suspects completely vanished.</i>

67
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:10,299
<i>I thought I'd bought it.</i>

68
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:15,137
<i>Then he came flying out of nowhere.</i>

69
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:18,057
<i>I'd heard of him,
but I'd never seen him before.</i>

70
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,477
<i>It was incredible,
the Batman threw out his hand</i>

71
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,979
<i>and sparks flew from his fingertips.</i>

72
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,509
<i>Then he pointed his fingers...</i>

73
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,205
<i>And some kind of ray
shot out at the van.</i>

74
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,416
<i>It blew the door open.</i>

75
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,502
<i>One of the suspects staggered out.</i>

76
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,921
<i>The other must've escaped
through the loading dock.</i>

77
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,884
<i>The guy tried to bolt
and the Batman just pointed at him.</i>

78
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,761
<i>Wham! He dropped!</i>

79
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:59,848
<i>It was unbelievable!
Batman's on the guy in a flash.</i>

80
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,101
<i>Then the Batman says something to him.</i>

81
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,480
What did he say?

82
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,151
I couldn't hear.
But the guy looked plenty scared

83
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:15,280
- and blurted out "Doc" something.
- Doc who?

84
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:18,909
I don't know. He just said "Doc."

85
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,789
We're interrogating the suspect now,
but it doesn't look like he'll crack.

86
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:26,458
Well, I think the rookie's
holding something back.

87
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,128
Take it easy!
He told you everything he knows!

88
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,549
How touching. I hope you're as good
at defending yourself

89
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,677
since the detective here
is calling you a liar.

90
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,888
Wait a minute.
Nobody's calling anyone a liar.

91
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,933
There's obviously a
communication problem here.

92
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:48,313
- But my officers are not liars.
- Well, someone in here is lying.

93
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,899
Why don't you reserve judgment
until you've heard

94
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,818
what Officer Montoya has to say.

95
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:55,154
All right, let's have your version.

96
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,949
Like I said before,
we got there on time.

97
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,659
Bullock was down.

98
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,496
<i>He said there were still
suspects inside, so I entered.</i>

99
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,299
We'll take it down
to Hathcock.

100
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,801
<i>And then I heard the name "Hathcock.</i>"

101
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,430
Freeze! Police!

102
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,367
Get her.

103
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,204
My pleasure.

104
00:11:57,132 --> 00:11:59,426
<i>I guess Batman must have
gotten a second wind</i>

105
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,970
<i>after Detective Bullock dragged him out.</i>

106
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,557
<i>Because he was in rare form.</i>

107
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:10,812
Behind you!

108
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:25,285
<i>I was just about to cuff them when
the whole place started to come down.</i>

109
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,747
<i>Before I knew what happened,
Batman pushed me out of the way.</i>

110
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,630
<i>He was buried alive.</i>

111
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,849
- There was nothing I could do.
- Poor Batman.

112
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:51,353
But don't feel too bad.
One of you is going to burn, too.

113
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:54,898
What we've got here is three cops
with two stories.

114
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,610
- I'm telling you, they were late!
- Commissioner, it's just not true.

115
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,112
Bullock went in early.

116
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:03,407
So you're accusing the detective
of trying to hog the collar?

117
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,867
He may have had good reason
for going in.

118
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,536
But we were not late.

119
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:09,579
So it's my word against theirs.

120
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,957
Now what, Commissioner?

121
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,210
You're all suspended
until I make my decision.

122
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,629
- Suspended?
- Hey, you can't...

123
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,006
But no, I...

124
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,758
I'll take your badges and your weapons.

125
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,108
You too, Officer.

126
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,886
Doc. Doc.

127
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,889
Dr. Hathcock. Dock!

128
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,857
Dock. Gotham Harbor! The dock!

129
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,400
I'd better tell...

130
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,069
No.

131
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,513
Hathcock. Yes!

132
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,933
Now it all comes together.

133
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,686
I wonder what the boss is gonna do
with pointy-ears up there.

134
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,063
Well, he's already been charbroiled.

135
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,065
How about we skewer him?

136
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,777
No. The boss figures
he's worth more in one piece.

137
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:47,446
Where is your boss?

138
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,906
Is he gonna keep me
hanging around all day?

139
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,870
Keep your cape on. He's right up there.

140
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,957
That's all I wanted to know.

141
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,526
- I thought you were...
- Not while there's unfinished business.

142
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:01,019
Come on.

143
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,446
Argh! Give me another clip.

144
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,662
Oh, boy!

145
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,541
Are you all right?

146
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,963
- Dandy.
- Then don't go away.

147
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,590
Count on it.

148
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,093
What?

149
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,717
I have to hand it to you, Montoya.

150
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,511
You and the Batman
really turned this thing around.

151
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,056
Yeah. What a collar.
You didn't just bust them,

152
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,975
you put the whole gang
out of commission.

153
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:11,394
What collar? She's suspended!

154
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:13,897
This farce has gone far enough, Hackle.

155
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:16,733
We've nailed the suspects
and recovered our money.

156
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:18,568
The investigation is closed.

157
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:21,654
Officer Montoya earned this collar.

158
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:26,993
The collar belongs to all three of us.
It was a team effort.

159
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,455
Gee, thanks, partner.

160
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,875
What was that, Bullock?

161
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,253
I said...

162
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:40,131
Thanks a lot, Montoya.
