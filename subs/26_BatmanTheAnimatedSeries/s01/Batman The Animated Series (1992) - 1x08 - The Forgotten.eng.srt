1
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:39,307
Your help means a lot to us, Bruce.

2
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,892
And what you do
means a lot to this city.

3
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,686
I wish we could do more.

4
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,316
Lately, things haven't been going well.

5
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,776
Thanks. What do you mean?

6
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,739
I can't prove it, but I'm positive,
people are disappearing.

7
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:58,492
Transients, regulars,
old faces I miss seeing.

8
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:02,163
Then a month ago, a volunteer,
Dan Riley, disappeared.

9
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:04,332
I'm telling you, something's very wrong.

10
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,542
- You've talked to the police?
- Of course.

11
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,669
But the police have their hands full.

12
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,464
And homeless people disappearing
is not big news.

13
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,234
Hey, buddy, you looking for a job?

14
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,404
Maybe. What kind of job?

15
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:02,116
Oh, you'll like it.
It's long-term employment.

16
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,007
Hey, Riley.

17
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,439
Oh, boy.

18
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,610
- Hey, stranger.
- You okay?

19
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,739
I think so. Where am I?

20
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:27,785
Well, opinions differ, but we all agree.
It ain't Miami.

21
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,747
Don't mind him.
Every chain gang has a comedian.

22
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm Dan Riley, and he's Salvo Smith.

23
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,669
So, what's your name, pal?

24
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,297
I don't know.

25
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,774
What is this?

26
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:02,653
If it's moving, it's a rat.
If not, it's a cooked rat.

27
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,115
Why aren't these lowlifes working?

28
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,783
They have to eat, sir.

29
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,997
I have to eat. They have to work.

30
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,792
From now on, they'll bring me
twice the gold ore.

31
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:19,044
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,963
We recruited some new men.

33
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,634
You bums better start busting butt

34
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,138
or you'll all end up like him.

35
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:36,437
No! Please!

36
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,815
I ain't done nothing! No! Please!

37
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,736
Please!

38
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:45,404
Please!

39
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:49,241
Please!

40
00:06:57,124 --> 00:07:02,046
Now get to work, or you'll all roast.

41
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,643
Rise and shine.

42
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,811
It's a beautiful...

43
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,897
That's odd.

44
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:23,776
Only vampires loathe daylight
more than Batman.

45
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,736
I wonder what's keeping him.

46
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,263
- How you holding up?
- Okay, I guess.

47
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,641
Remember anything yet?

48
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:58,769
I'm beginning to wonder if I ever will.

49
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,480
Hey, you can't give up hope.

50
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:03,649
Down here it's all we've got
to hang on to.

51
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:07,403
I guess you're right.
So, what brought you guys here?

52
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,491
I was one of Gotham City's unemployed.
Now I got a job. Lucky me.

53
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,828
I was a steamfitter
at the Gotham Navy Yard.

54
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,456
Two nights a week, I did volunteer work
at the Dock Street Rescue Mission.

55
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,835
One night I was getting into my car,
and three guys jumped me.

56
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,837
I wound up here.

57
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,881
My family must be
going out of their minds.

58
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,260
Rescue Mission.

59
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,181
Cave-in!

60
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,534
Ah, are you okay?

61
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,830
Where's Salvo?

62
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,124
I'm over here, taking five.

63
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,461
Hang on, man. We'll get you out.

64
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,630
Take your time.
It's the first break I've had all day.

65
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,759
Does this sort of thing happen often?

66
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:13,385
Too often.

67
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:20,601
No, I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Wayne was called out of town.

68
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,937
If you call back on Friday...

69
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,037
The Studebaker's gone.

70
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,331
I'd better activate the tracking device.

71
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,670
The Bowery.

72
00:10:57,614 --> 00:11:01,076
Dock Street Rescue Mission.

73
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:10,377
I've never seen such lazy scum.

74
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:21,388
Now that was real funny.

75
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,932
Throw him in the box!

76
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,478
You can't. It'll kill him.

77
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:33,734
That's the idea. Now do it!

78
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:43,660
I got him! Come on!

79
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:12,189
We'll see how they like the oven.

80
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:58,026
Hey, you really cleaned their clocks.

81
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,570
You did pretty good yourself.

82
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:03,824
Well, maybe you used to be
some kind of fighter.

83
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,784
I don't know.

84
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,662
I just don't know.

85
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,716
My son, he's gonna be six on April 7th.

86
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,803
Or seven on April 6.

87
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:27,597
Oh, what's it matter?
I'll never see him again.

88
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:29,641
Hang on, Riley.

89
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:31,435
We'll make it.

90
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:35,439
Remember what you told me?
You can't lose hope.

91
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:38,108
I can't take it anymore!

92
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,360
I lost my family! My family!

93
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,781
My family! My family! My family!
My family!

94
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:16,855
Riley, you've got to pull it together.
We're getting out of here.

95
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,441
Yeah, right.

96
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:21,276
You're the one who's losing it.

97
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,587
Stop him!

98
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:45,550
Stop him,
or you'll all rot in the mines!

99
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,639
There he is.

100
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,432
We got him now.

101
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,393
He's gone into Box Canyon.

102
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,311
There's no way out.

103
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,771
Look! Up there!

104
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,706
Whoa!

105
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,129
Oh! Whoa!

106
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,932
This must be the place. Bring us down.

107
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:17,184
<i>Negative.</i>

108
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,187
But Master Bruce is down here.
We have to land.

109
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,647
<i>Impossible. Area too confined.</i>

110
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,609
Land, you bucket of bolts.

111
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,319
<i>Your funeral.</i>

112
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,029
Oh, dear.

113
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,660
Get us down!

114
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,331
<i>Caution. Rocks.</i>

115
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,925
Son of a gun.

116
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:04,648
<i>Watch your step.</i>

117
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:11,821
I... I... I claim this land for Spain.

118
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,665
Master Bruce.

119
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,298
Hurry up with that gravy!

120
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:37,430
If those fools let that prisoner escape,
I'll eat them alive.

121
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,268
A bat! A giant bat!

122
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,811
Horrible!

123
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,730
What are you babbling about?

124
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,148
What bat?

125
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,942
Right here.

126
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,735
There it is!

127
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,613
Batman!

128
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:08,628
Shoot him!

129
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,635
After him, you fools!

130
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,308
<i>After him!</i>

131
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:26,229
$1,000 to the man who bags that bat.

132
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,199
There he is!

133
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,870
Split up and fan out.

134
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,885
Huh?

135
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,807
Huh?

136
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:09,356
Kill the lights!

137
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,360
We'll find out if this bat
can see in the dark.

138
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,959
Look out!

139
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:35,965
I think he went this way.

140
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,635
Pete, where are...

141
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,096
Help!

142
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,432
Help!

143
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:48,353
Hodges, Kurt, Howard! Are you okay?

144
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,188
Not exactly.

145
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,734
Stop him!

146
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:21,594
No! Leave me alone!

147
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,145
We've got to get out of here.

148
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:33,064
Stop. We'll be killed.

149
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,984
Stop, and we will be.

150
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,722
Don't let me drown!

151
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,936
When you taste the prison food,
you'll wish I had.

152
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:14,105
It's no palace,

153
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,029
but you're welcome to stay at our place
until you get back on your feet.

154
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:20,612
Thanks, Riley. Maybe this time,
we can find some work that pays.

155
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,658
You know, pal, it'll be tight,
but you're welcome too.

156
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,035
Thanks, but I...

157
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:28,912
<i>Are we ready, Master Bruce?</i>

158
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,916
Master Bruce?

159
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:35,877
Bruce Wayne. WayneTech Enterprises.

160
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,547
If you'd like a job,
I can probably help.

161
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,634
Hit me, Riley.

162
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,885
Hit you? Why?

163
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:46,888
Maybe I'll lose my memory
and wake up a millionaire too.
