1
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:16,552
A piece of cake.
Just like the boss said.

2
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,804
Yeah, all it took was five minutes.

3
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,182
And that will get you
five years.

4
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,060
With good behavior.

5
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:15,361
Bird seed?

6
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,994
Hey, Roberta,
it's got a walkie-talkie wrist band.

7
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:27,665
A pen light, binoculars,
even this cool badge.

8
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,292
Yo, Sherwood, what you got there?

9
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,378
It's a junior detective kit.

10
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,171
And the name's Sherman.

11
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:37,341
A fake, just like you, wormwood.

12
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,385
Whoa. Check this out.

13
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,469
A hawk.

14
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,180
Come on, Frank. Those are mine.

15
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,242
Come on. Give it back.

16
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,269
Can't you find any of your
own species to play with?

17
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:52,064
Ah, don't pitch a fit.
We're just kidding around.

18
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,818
Hey, that's no hawk.

19
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:59,029
Judging by its wingspread
and the shape of its head,

20
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,116
it's obviously a giant
South American vulture.

21
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:05,077
A vulture, in Gotham City?

22
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,246
Sure thing, Sherlock.

23
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,914
Come on, Roberta.

24
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,959
Sherman, where are we going?

25
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,671
A vulture in Gotham City
is a mystery worth checking out.

26
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:31,020
Come on, Roberta. It went in there.

27
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,197
Sherman, the sign says it's condemned.
You shouldn't go in.

28
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:44,825
Men.

29
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,044
I don't like it.

30
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,630
Cop a squat and dummy up, Jay.

31
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,133
If the boss said to meet him back here,
we meet him here.

32
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,969
What's that?

33
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,895
It's just birdseed, birdbrain.

34
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:21,403
Come on, let's get out of here.

35
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,914
The Penguin.

36
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,464
Aw, Scrap, my faithful pet.

37
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,092
Ready for a ripe repast?

38
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,600
That bald buzzard gives me the willies.

39
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,394
If it weren't for Scrap,

40
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:57,106
you two would be feathering
your nest at Stonegate Penitentiary.

41
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,775
Now, where is it?

42
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:10,744
Oh, how much more doth beauty
beauteous seem by this sweet egg,

43
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:13,247
which we have scrambled for?

44
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,500
They stole the Vonalster Fabergé Egg.

45
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,043
The what?

46
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,296
Don't you read the papers?

47
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,298
Do the comics count?

48
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,012
That thing's worth a fortune.

49
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,430
We gotta tell someone.

50
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:48,949
Batman!

51
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,410
Get that capon crusader.

52
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,207
Batman.

53
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,282
Get out. Now!

54
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:32,451
Yes, sir.

55
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,467
You should have taken your own advice.

56
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,667
Batman's in trouble. Come on.

57
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,086
I don't know about this.

58
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:33,387
It's those delinquents.
Stop them!

59
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:45,816
- Quick, inside.
- Sherman, do something.

60
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,560
We gotta get out of here.

61
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,103
What am I doing?

62
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:25,147
I'm not old enough to drive.

63
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,361
I can't reach the pedals.

64
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,988
I can.

65
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,743
Push that long one.

66
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,808
Hit it again.

67
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,566
Okay, Roberta, floor it.

68
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,182
Be-fowled by a couple of fledglings.

69
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,424
Keep it going, Roberta.

70
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,689
I think I'm starting
to get the hang of this.

71
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,989
Come on, Batman.
This will help.

72
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,291
It's okay.

73
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,130
My name is Sherman.
And I'm a detective, too.

74
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,299
We're lying low in my basement.

75
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,709
We got the egg down here, too.

76
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,972
See, this is my crime lab.

77
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,849
It's not exactly the Batcave.

78
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,517
Capsule.

79
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,187
"Cap" what?

80
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,898
No, you're not captured, Batman.

81
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,817
You're safe here.
It's just Mom and me.

82
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,360
And she's at work.

83
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,948
Oh, yeah. And Roberta's here.
She's cool.

84
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,742
No.

85
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,203
Visor.

86
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,498
Wonder what that meant.

87
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,085
Don't look at me.
I've had enough mystery for one day.

88
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,546
- I'm calling the police.
- No way.

89
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,425
A detective always has to protect
the identity of his client,

90
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,719
especially when it's this client.

91
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,070
Those meddling brats
couldn't have gotten too far.

92
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,280
But, boss, what about the Batman?

93
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,618
Batman's a worm, less than nothing,
a worthless peasant.

94
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,790
And besides, the gas will keep him null
and void for a good week.

95
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,343
Sherman, what are you doing down there?

96
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,886
Nothing, Mom.

97
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,098
You're not trying to make
gunpowder again, are you?

98
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,350
No, Mom, honest.

99
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,686
We saved Batman's life, Mrs. Grant,

100
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,063
and now we're hiding him
from some bad criminals.

101
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:56,233
That's good, just don't make a mess.

102
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,027
Nice going, Miss Bigmouth.

103
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,613
Sorry, Sherman.
I guess I panicked.

104
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,831
I'm going to the store, Sherman.

105
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:12,374
Stay out of trouble.

106
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:13,917
Sure thing, Mom.

107
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,010
Afternoon, Mrs. Grant.

108
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,137
Lovely day, isn't it?

109
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,892
He's up! He shoots! It looks good!

110
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:36,898
Oh, no!

111
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,446
Man, oh, man! Scope out these wheels.

112
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,656
You guys
better leave that alone.

113
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:47,909
Oh, Golly, we sure are scared,
aren't we, Nicholas?

114
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:52,956
Oh, yes, Francis, we certainly are.
Step aside, Shirley.

115
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,586
Cool. Whose car is this?

116
00:13:57,794 --> 00:14:00,005
It's my mom's... My uncle's.

117
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,552
All right, look, it's the Batmobile.

118
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,429
Yeah, right.

119
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,099
Hey, I don't think he's kidding.

120
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:12,684
What's this?

121
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:17,022
Some kind of capsules.

122
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:18,565
Capsule?

123
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,778
Capsule on the visor.
That's what he meant.

124
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,114
Give me that!
It's a matter of life or death.

125
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:54,684
No!

126
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,319
Whoa!

127
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,783
Come on, Batman, wake up.

128
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,291
It's him!

129
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,586
Totally awesome.

130
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,214
I wonder who he really is.

131
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,049
No! Get back.

132
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:29,636
This isn't a game, you jerks.

133
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:33,640
If the vulture's here that means
the Penguin will be right on his tail.

134
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,058
The Penguin?

135
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,186
Oh, no! What's that?

136
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,480
Oh, great! It's him.

137
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,494
That's it. I'm calling 911.

138
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,834
It's dead.

139
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,175
So much for phone calls, huh, boss?

140
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,596
Then it's them or us.

141
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,556
Be careful with that egg, Roberta.

142
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,267
I bet we can find
something here to help us.

143
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,233
I don't think anyone's home.

144
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,277
Yeah, the place is locked up tight.

145
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:32,240
Stone walls do not a prison make
nor locked doors a barricade.

146
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,000
Gentlemen,
and I use the term loosely,

147
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:43,960
after you.

148
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:56,264
Okay, get ready for operation Fowl Play.

149
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,313
How bourgeois.

150
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,775
Tearing this place apart
could only improve it.

151
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,071
Let the egg hunt begin.

152
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,758
Hey, Raven, are you okay?

153
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:39,057
These commoners
have such cheap furniture.

154
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,649
Come on, Batman, snap out of it.

155
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:50,569
If that didn't wake him,
I don't know what will.

156
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,366
Charge! Now, Roberta!

157
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,123
Nice shot.

158
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,543
Be careful, Roberta,
you don't wanna get too close.

159
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,420
We did it.

160
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,508
Children defending their nest.
How noble. How endearing.

161
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,469
How ineffective.

162
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,388
Grab the little pests.

163
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:38,199
He's not awake yet?

164
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,785
Frank thought he saw his eye blink.

165
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,840
Valiant effort, but I win.

166
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,010
Now, back away, you irksome imps.

167
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,224
Ah.

168
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,101
A treat with my egg.

169
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:09,481
Sliced ham.

170
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,068
No.

171
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,403
Farewell, Bat-vermin.

172
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:20,867
Batman!

173
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:25,080
Back off, Penguin.

174
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,628
Gentlemen, your timing is impeccable.

175
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:34,005
Take no prisoners!

176
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:58,196
I'll clip your wings, you flying rodent.

177
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,481
Still a little dazed, are we?

178
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,120
We're safe!

179
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,040
- My house!
- Sherman!

180
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,168
Maybe you're safe.

181
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:56,546
Young man, you've got some
serious explaining to do.

182
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,342
Uh, Mom, I'd like you to meet Batman.

183
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,094
Batman, this is my mom.

184
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:04,804
Ma'am.

185
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,264
Uh, hello.

186
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,477
Say, Batman, you wouldn't be single,
would you?

187
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,907
Now, where was I?

188
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:26,743
Someone keeps swiping
Mr. Vanducci's newspaper?

189
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,203
Right, Frank.

190
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:29,891
You and Nick set up for surveillance.

191
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,833
Roberta and I will be over at
Mrs. Fineman's. Her dog is missing.

192
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,877
You're the boss.

193
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,337
Sherman.
