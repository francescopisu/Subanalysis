1
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,259
Now, Isis, my sweet.

2
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,254
Perfect, my love.

3
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,464
Let's go home.

4
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,681
So, our new cat burglar is a woman.

5
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:14,860
Hmm. Probably my imagination.

6
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:16,237
Probably not.

7
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,997
Magnificent.

8
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:31,127
I suggest you save the flattery
for the judge.

9
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,402
So long, Dark Knight.

10
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:58,195
Drop in anytime.

11
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:06,787
You're too kind.

12
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,451
Hey!

13
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,413
I'll have to try and trim those claws.

14
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,640
No!

15
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,649
Left you behind, did she?

16
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,018
Thanks for the memento.

17
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,110
<i>Next, we'll be auctioning off a date</i>

18
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:03,320
<i>with Gotham's most eligible bachelor,</i>

19
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,614
<i>Mr. Bruce Wayne!</i>

20
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,367
<i>Uh, if Mr. Wayne would be
good enough to step up.</i>

21
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,870
<i>Now, now, don't be shy.</i>

22
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,496
<i>Ah, there he is.</i>

23
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,545
- Oh, Bruce!
- I'm so happy to see you.

24
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:20,796
Where've you been?

25
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,923
- You look handsome.
- You look wonderful.

26
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,925
Ooh! Have I missed you.

27
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,094
I've been pinching my pennies for you.

28
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:30,222
Uh... Excuse me, ladies.

29
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,850
<i>Remember, we've got
lots of animals to save,</i>

30
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,729
<i>so we're going to start the bidding
at $500.</i>

31
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,023
- Five hundred.
- Six hundred.

32
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,066
We have six. Do I hear seven?

33
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,401
- Seven hundred.
- Eight.

34
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:43,694
One thousand.

35
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,487
Well, well.

36
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,448
That's 1,000.

37
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:49,700
Going once, going twice...

38
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:51,535
$10,000.

39
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,922
<i>Uh, do I hear any more bids?</i>

40
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:06,842
<i>Then sold, for $10,000, to...</i>

41
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,470
<i>Ms. Selina Kyle.</i>

42
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,888
Oh, wow.

43
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,641
I've never seen her before.

44
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,352
Rumor has it she's a wildlife nut.

45
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,522
She's supposed to be sponsoring
a mountain lion preserve outside Gotham.

46
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,904
It's a pleasure.

47
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,197
Thank you.

48
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,326
Uh, Mr. Wayne, my secretary, Maven.

49
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,827
How do you do?

50
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,830
Uh... Please. "Bruce."

51
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,582
I'm very flattered.

52
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,628
Please understand,
it's purely for the animals, Mr. Wayne.

53
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,754
You're off the hook.

54
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,339
But you're not.

55
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,674
I beg your pardon?

56
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:51,095
You bought a date,

57
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:54,264
and I'm honor-bound,
and delighted to deliver.

58
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,725
I warn you,
I'm not a man who gives up easily.

59
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,811
All right. Lunch, then.

60
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,403
I wonder what's going on

61
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,029
Oh! Where'd he go?

62
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:31,862
Watch yourselves, men.
These guys are crazy.

63
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,660
- Thanks, friend.
- What's going down?

64
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,871
This morning, I get a warning
from the Feds.

65
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,748
Red Claw is in Gotham.

66
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:43,832
Now, this.

67
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,709
- Any leads?
- Nothing.

68
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:49,004
Red Claw is the most ruthless
terrorist leader in the world.

69
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,099
And we don't even have
a picture of the guy.

70
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,925
I'll see what I can do from my end.

71
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,597
Good. There's no telling
what they're up to.

72
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:01,350
Nothing is safe
with these savages in town.

73
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,323
Aren't you even a little excited
about your date?

74
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:20,077
I mean, Bruce Wayne
is tall, dark and disgustingly rich.

75
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,246
I'd rather it were Batman.

76
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,165
You should have seen him, Maven.

77
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,251
He had the eyes of a lion.

78
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,508
Yes?

79
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:36,191
<i>A Mr. Bruce Wayne is on his way up.</i>

80
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,427
Here we go.

81
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,683
Come on, Selina,
at least he's a good connection.

82
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,434
You might be able to use him.

83
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,190
- Hello?
- Yes, I know.

84
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,984
I suppose you're right.

85
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,029
Still, I wish it were Batman
standing behind this door.

86
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,620
Bruce, how wonderful to see you.

87
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:04,788
Please, come in.

88
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,542
You're even more stunning
than I remember.

89
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,460
I'll just put these in some water.

90
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:12,045
Selina, it's your lawyer.

91
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,922
He says the deal is off.

92
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,007
What?

93
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,676
Give me that.

94
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,011
Martin, what happened?

95
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:23,307
That's ridiculous.
You tell him I want to meet with him!

96
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,436
No, today! He can't sell to Multigon!
We had an agreement!

97
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,355
- Uh, nice flowers.
- What's going on?

98
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,734
Selina was negotiating for land
for a wildlife preserve.

99
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,445
Some cartel just muscled her
out of the deal.

100
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,464
What do you mean
he won't take your calls?

101
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:40,574
You go there,
and kick down the door if you have to!

102
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,327
I want that land for the mountain lions.

103
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,001
I'm afraid I'm not going to be
very good company.

104
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,420
- Is there anything I can do?
- Not really.

105
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:54,772
Unless you can get me a meeting

106
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:56,590
with the chairman
of Multigon International.

107
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,094
What time's good for you?

108
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,099
Hey, I'm starting to like this guy.

109
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,863
Really, Wayne,
I do wish there was something

110
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,587
I could do for you
and your lovely friend,

111
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,242
but the deal is quite set.

112
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,877
You see, we're committed
to building a major resort.

113
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,213
Golf course, tennis courts,

114
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:38,465
bocce ball, the whole shot.

115
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:39,758
That's insane!

116
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:43,470
The land is in the middle of nowhere.
It's worthless except to wildcats.

117
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:50,143
My dear, you just don't understand
development potential.

118
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,395
As for the cats,

119
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,397
Multigon will take care of them.

120
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,315
One way or another.

121
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,150
Now, if you'll excuse me,

122
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,069
I've given you all the time I can spare.

123
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:02,614
Oh, you'll find
more time for me, Mr. Stern!

124
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,742
Before I'm through,
I'll have every environmental group

125
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,203
and animal rights activist
breathing down your neck.

126
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:11,581
They'll be looking at you,
and your project, so closely,

127
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:14,126
you'll feel like a bug in a bell jar.

128
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:19,881
Have a nice day.

129
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,570
I'm afraid
that Selina Kyle may be trouble.

130
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,032
We've come too far
to have our plans jeopardized

131
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,242
by some environmental fanatic.

132
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,746
Have someone keep an eye on Ms. Kyle.

133
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,628
I'm afraid
I wasn't much help after all.

134
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,548
Well, at least now
I know what their cover story is.

135
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,431
You know, it's awfully late for lunch.

136
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,767
Would you mind
if I took a rain check on our date?

137
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,562
Please?

138
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,025
Okay.

139
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,152
- Tomorrow?
- Thanks.

140
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,322
That'll give me time
to take care of some business tonight.

141
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:28,700
Actually, I plan to work late myself.

142
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,536
And so, boys,

143
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,248
we got to increase our cut
in the gambling operations.

144
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,668
Anybody got a problem with that?

145
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,265
Back off, boys.

146
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,101
I want a word with your boss.

147
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,852
But you can listen.

148
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:57,354
What do you want?

149
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,106
What do you know about Red Claw?

150
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,441
Why are you asking us?
We're no terrorists.

151
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,568
You're still scum.

152
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,487
And you hear things I don't.

153
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,447
I want Red Claw.

154
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,282
And until I get him,

155
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,203
I'm going to lean extra hard on you,
and all the other mob bosses.

156
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:17,249
If you think
I've been bad news before...

157
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:20,377
I get the picture.
I'll see what I can do.

158
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,309
If Stern won't admit
what's going on,

159
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,437
we'll have to find out for ourselves.

160
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,074
Despite our loss of arms,

161
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,827
thanks to Batman's interference,

162
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,663
we're going to proceed
according to plan.

163
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:07,799
Tomorrow at 2300 hours,

164
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:11,344
a train under military escort
will pass through Gotham.

165
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,890
It will be transporting
a strain of viral plague

166
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:18,560
that Interpol confiscated
from our eastern laboratories.

167
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:22,898
I cannot overemphasize the importance
of that plague to our cause.

168
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,319
All clear?

169
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,037
I believe Beethoven's
<i>Ode to Joy</i> will do the trick.

170
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:49,132
Remind me to thank Mama
for the piano lessons.

171
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,810
Outstanding.

172
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:11,613
We'll hit the train
outside the city, at this point.

173
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,496
What is that?

174
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,124
A cat at the end of its nine lives.

175
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,585
Let's go.

176
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,316
All right, I'm done.

177
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,794
She's in the ventilation system.

178
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,719
I think we're in over our heads.

179
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:33,820
Ow, ow, ow!

180
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,531
Ah!

181
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:52,255
Detour.

182
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,966
She's down here! Hurry!

183
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,351
Going up.

184
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,003
Hang on, Isis.

185
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,309
Isis, jump!

186
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,284
My hero.

187
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,047
That was for saving my cat.

188
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,924
Is that all it was for?

189
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:20,343
- Maybe not.
- I heard gunfire.

190
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,137
Occupational hazard.

191
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:24,305
No.

192
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,640
Let's keep the mystery.

193
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:28,685
If I don't unmask you, the police will.

194
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:29,853
Police?

195
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,104
Don't be silly.

196
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,982
You can't deny
there's something between us.

197
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,191
You're right.

198
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,569
And I'm afraid it's the law.

199
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,074
I'm sorry.

200
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,252
Never trifle
with the affections of a woman.

201
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:55,920
Until next time.

202
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,719
And there will be a next time.

203
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,357
Oh. Tough night?

204
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,942
It had its ups and downs.

205
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:21,446
But I did get pictures
of the fun family-resort site.

206
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,140
It looks like there's some kind of

207
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,117
abandoned military facility,
underground.

208
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,952
Very interesting.

209
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,455
We may save those mountain lions yet.

210
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,881
But who is going to save you?
