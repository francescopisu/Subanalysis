1
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:22,933
<i>Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells</i>

2
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,084
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

3
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:29,130
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open slay, hey!</i>

4
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:32,717
<i>Jingle Bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg</i>

5
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:38,973
<i>The Batmobile lost a wheel
And the Joker got away!</i>

6
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:56,282
<i>Crashing through the roof
In a one-horse open tree</i>

7
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:00,995
<i>Busting out I go
Laughing all the wheeeee!</i>

8
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,544
Come on, Batman,
it's Christmas Eve.

9
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,880
Let's kick back and get into the spirit.

10
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,425
The Joker's escaped
from Arkham Asylum, Robin.

11
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,845
And you really think he's gonna
make his move on Christmas Eve?

12
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,931
Even scum spend the holidays
with their families.

13
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,267
He has no family.

14
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,895
Okay, I'll make a deal with you.

15
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:30,358
If we go out on patrol, and Gotham
is quiet with no sign of the Joker,

16
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:35,237
we come back here, have Christmas dinner
and watch <i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>

17
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:39,533
You know, I've never seen that.
I could never get past the title.

18
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,744
It's a deal, then?

19
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,204
Deal.

20
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,118
Doesn't it warm your heart to see
everyone in the spirit of Christmas?

21
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,168
Bah Humbug to you, too.

22
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:37,675
You just can't believe
there's no use for us for one night.

23
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,721
There.

24
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,768
Hey, lady, hold up.

25
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,855
You dropped this package
a couple blocks back.

26
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,608
Oh, it's for my grandson.
Thanks so much.

27
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:57,445
Merry Christmas.

28
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,948
Now can we go home?

29
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:06,704
He could give lessons
to Scrooge.

30
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,711
The Christmas goose
will be ready shortly.

31
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,840
You know, we really should've done
one more sweep of the city.

32
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,842
Now just relax, Bruce.

33
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,636
You're gonna love <i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>
It's a great movie.

34
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,514
It's not relentlessly cheerful, is it?

35
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:27,983
No, it's about how much
of a difference

36
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,019
one man can make to a city.

37
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:31,645
Sound familiar?

38
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:39,028
Uh, wrong channel.

39
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,405
Some kind of Christmas special.

40
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,248
It's a Wonderful Life
<i>will not be seen this year.</i>

41
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,334
<i>In its place is the following.</i>

42
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,756
<i>Joker here.
Greetings, Gotham, and merry Christmas.</i>

43
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:03,761
<i>I hope you're watching, Batman.
This one's for you.</i>

44
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,156
<i>Live from Gotham City,</i>

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,911
<i>the show that nobody wants to see
but everyone will watch.</i>

46
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:44,218
<i>Yes, it's</i> Christmas with the Joker!

47
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:50,057
<i>And now, let's welcome our host,
the Clown Prince of Crime,</i>

48
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,101
<i>the Joker!</i>

49
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,771
<i>Greetings from Gotham City.</i>

50
00:05:55,855 --> 00:06:00,359
<i>And welcome to the first annual</i>
Christmas with the Joker.

51
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,950
<i>Oh, thank you, thank you.
Thank you very much.</i>

52
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:12,121
<i>Have I got a show for you tonight.</i>

53
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:16,876
<i>It's loaded with surprises
and mystery guests and Christmas jeer.</i>

54
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,628
Well, Batman,
you were sure right about the Joker.

55
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,297
Any leads?

56
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,009
I've accessed Gotham's
electrical mainframe.

57
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,803
And I'm zeroing in on the power surges

58
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,389
to pinpoint the location
of Joker's broadcast signal.

59
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,683
That's it.

60
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,978
I don't know, Batman, it seems too easy.

61
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,147
It's never easy with the Joker.

62
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,650
Oh, Batman, I hope you're watching

63
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,446
<i>'cause I've got
a very special surprise for you.</i>

64
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,869
Rumor has it, Christmas is a time
to share with family.

65
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:57,082
And since I don't have one of my own...

66
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,043
Aww!

67
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:02,254
I decided to steal one.

68
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:10,137
And here they are,
the awful Lawful family.

69
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:15,893
Aren't they just the cutest
family you've ever seen?

70
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,397
It's never easy with the Joker.

71
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:24,026
<i>Meet Daddy Lawful.</i>

72
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:27,446
You diseased maniac! I'll...

73
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,781
Hmm.

74
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:32,201
Looks like I'll have to teach
Daddy some manners.

75
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,955
And here's Mommy Lawful.

76
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,833
Help!
Somebody please help us. We...

77
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,921
Ho, ho, ho. Isn't she jolly?

78
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:47,967
And here we have little Baby Lawful.

79
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,427
Coochie, coochie, coo.

80
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:53,931
When I get my hands on you,
I'll rip your...

81
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:59,728
I'll bet Batman wishes
he had a family just like mine.

82
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,314
Personally, I think
relatives are a bore,

83
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:07,194
so Batman can have them
if he can find them by midnight.

84
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,155
Otherwise...

85
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,123
Hold tight, we're almost there.

86
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:23,419
<i>Hi, I'm Laffy,
Joker's helpful little elf.</i>

87
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:28,215
I'm here to present Batman
with a very special Christmas surprise.

88
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,092
Uh-oh, here it comes.

89
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:35,431
Gee, Joker, it's sure nice of you
to get Bat Breath a present.

90
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,434
Ho, ho, I'm just that kind of guy.

91
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,147
It's an exact replica of Gotham City.

92
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:47,234
It has everything,
even trains and bridges.

93
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,030
Bridges? I just love blowing up bridges.

94
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,490
Well, in that case,

95
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:57,619
let's go live to Donner and Blitzen
at the President's Bridge.

96
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,205
<i>Greetings, Donner.</i>

97
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,084
<i>How about singing us a merry tune
while you blow up the bridge?</i>

98
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,753
Sure, boss.

99
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,466
<i>Jingle Bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg</i>

100
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,729
That was great!

101
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:26,148
The fun has just begun.

102
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,943
<i>The 11:30 train
will be along any minute.</i>

103
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,742
We've gotta stop that train.

104
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,209
Oh, look, Laffy, Mommy Lawful
has something to say.

105
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,669
What's up, Mommy?

106
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,546
My mother's on that train.

107
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,383
Your mother?
Well, that's different, then.

108
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:57,429
Yeah, it'll be even
more exciting when it crashes.

109
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,823
You uncouple the passenger cars.
I'll get the engineer.

110
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,040
The bridge is out. Come on.

111
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,317
Bah Humbug.
I hate Batman and Robin.

112
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,652
Then let's get rid of them.

113
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,076
Oh, boy, let's build a snowman.

114
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,208
We've isolated
the Joker's broadcast signal.

115
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,793
It's coming from the observatory
on Mount Gotham.

116
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,143
There, the radar antenna.

117
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,645
What's that?

118
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,816
Careful, Robin. I'm sure there's
more to this than meets the eye.

119
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,781
<i>Merry Christmas, Batman.</i>

120
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:23,408
<i>I'm so glad you could join us.</i>

121
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,619
What's your game, Joker?

122
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:29,665
<i>Oh, just a little holiday
entertainment, Batman.</i>

123
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:34,586
I'm sure all the folks at home will
enjoy sharing this special occasion.

124
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,342
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
live from the top of Mount Gotham,</i>

125
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:43,512
the death of Batman.

126
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,525
When you care enough
to send the very blast.

127
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:02,698
We'll return in just a moment,
but first a word from our sponsor.

128
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,920
Robin, try and get inside
the observatory.

129
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,422
I'll draw its fire.

130
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:34,563
Whoops. Looks like we're experiencing
technical difficulty.

131
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,983
But don't worry, folks,
we're still on the air.

132
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,571
<i>Oh, no! Our cannon seems
to be out of control.</i>

133
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,283
<i>Gotham City could be in serious danger.</i>

134
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,198
Batman, Robin here.

135
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,540
Robin, Operation Cause and Effect.

136
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,709
Gotcha.

137
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:58,563
Batman?

138
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,109
I'm fine. But we're not any closer
to finding Joker's hideout.

139
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,735
What's our next move?

140
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,905
To be quite honest, I don't know.

141
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,247
Batman, it's almost midnight.
We have to do something.

142
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,626
It's up to the Joker now.
Only a miracle can save the hostages.

143
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:23,547
<i>Arrgh! Where's that Bat fella?
And that Robin fella?</i>

144
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,424
<i>Ooh, they're gonna spoil my Christmas.</i>

145
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,927
<i>What's the matter? Can't they figure
anything out? Time's up.</i>

146
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,596
<i>I'm rubbing everybody out at midnight.</i>

147
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:36,143
<i>But wait, we have
another present to open.</i>

148
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,230
<i>Let's not keep Mommy Lawful waiting.</i>

149
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:44,651
<i>Too bad Batman is such a party pooper.</i>

150
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,195
<i>Maybe he doesn't know how to get here.</i>

151
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,031
<i>All dressed up with nowhere to go.</i>

152
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:56,496
Well, I wonder what Mommy Lawful
is getting for Christmas.

153
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,542
Ooh! The suspense is killing me.

154
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:07,966
Is it? Can it be? Oh, yes!
It's a Betty Blooper doll.

155
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,262
And what do Better Blooper dolls do?

156
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,265
Why, you just wind them up...

157
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,228
And they wreak havoc on Gotham City.

158
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,818
I haven't seen
one of those dolls in years.

159
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,029
They don't make dolls like that anymore,

160
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:34,117
not since the Laffco toy factory
went out of business 14 years ago.

161
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,953
Third and Main, downtown.

162
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,615
Look sharp, Robin.

163
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,803
Where's that music coming from?

164
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:36,429
Good question.

165
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,274
Look out!

166
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,257
Stand ready. More on the way.

167
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:22,183
Stand clear, Robin.

168
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,706
They don't call you
"Batman" for nothing.

169
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,210
Snipers!

170
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:10,273
Where'd he go?

171
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,026
There he is.

172
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,952
- Huh?
- What?

173
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:26,039
Look out!

174
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:27,457
Whoa!

175
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,710
<i>I love you very much.</i>

176
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,133
Keep your eyes open for the Joker.

177
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,970
I'll save you the trouble, Batman.

178
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:46,017
Come and get your Christmas present,
or the kiddies get it.

179
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,271
Let them go, Joker. It's me you want.

180
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,817
Merry Christmas, Batman.

181
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,699
Well, go on, open it.

182
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,577
Don't do it, Batman!

183
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,162
Easy, Robin.

184
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:23,096
Oh, I can't stand it.

185
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:39,571
Robin, take care of 'em.

186
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:52,041
Run, run as fast as you can.
You'll not catch me, I'm the Joker man.

187
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,221
Merry Christmas, Joker.

188
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,682
Bah Humbug.

189
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,693
It was nice of Commissioner Gordon

190
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,780
to give you that recording
of <i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>

191
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,449
And it is a wonderful life.

192
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:27,786
It has its moments.

193
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,506
<i>Don we now our gay apparel</i>

194
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,383
<i>Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la</i>

195
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,850
Merry Christmas.
