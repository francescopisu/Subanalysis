180
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,435
Zucco.

181
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,356
Isn't Bruce coming down to eat?

182
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm afraid not tonight, Dick.

183
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,568
I've got a late meeting.

184
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,113
Could be fruitful.

185
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,322
Mmm. Very good, sir.

186
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,576
He has a meeting every night.
Who does he see?

187
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:17,040
Um, some of the most influential people
in Gotham City.

188
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,001
MAN: Come on, seven.

189
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,170
Snake eyes. (GROANS)

190
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:29,845
Tough luck.
Maybe I can change the way they roll.

191
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:35,642
Hey, you're a friend
of Tony Zucco's, ain't you?

192
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:38,019
I hear he's been
feeling the heat lately.

193
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,315
MAN: Lucky five.

194
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,152
Yeah, the Z-man's been
lying low, all right.

195
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,196
They say he's got bat problems.

196
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,742
Big bat problems.

197
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:57,372
I can't help wondering
how he's keeping out of sight.

198
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,332
You do an awful lot of wondering,

199
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,043
for someone we ain't ever seen before.

200
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,628
What'd you say your name was?

201
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:05,672
Smith.

202
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:11,178
Smith. That wouldn't be
Detective Smith, would it?

203
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,804
Or maybe Sergeant?

204
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,267
Check his wallet, Al.

Now, about Zucco...

210
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,548
No way. I ain't no squealer.

211
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,092
You're getting nothing out of me.
You hear? Nothing.

Stromwell. He's with Stromwell,

213
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,477
his uncle, okay? All right? (WHIMPERING)

215
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,999
Who's there?

216
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,298
Easy, Stromwell.

(GASPS)

218
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,261
You might try knocking some time.

219
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,514
This isn't a social call.

220
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,685
I've come for your nephew, Tony Zucco.

221
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:45,021
You can't just barge in here
making demands.

222
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,275
I want him bad, Stromwell.

223
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,985
Real bad.

224
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,196
- How should I know where he is?
- (GRUNTS)

225
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,032
I stopped looking after that loser
a long time ago.

226
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,703
If you protect him, Stromwell,

227
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:03,331
I'll be very grumpy.

228
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,043
You don't want to see me grumpy.

229
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,087
STROMWELL: Uh, yeah. I got you.

230
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,144
ZUCCO: Smooth, Uncle Arnie. Real smooth.

231
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:26,896
Yeah, you sure suckered
that pointy-eared freak.

232
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,191
- He won't be messing around here any...
- Jerk! Fool!

233

You and your
penny-ante extortion racket!

Look what you've brought on my house!

235

Hey, come on. Stop already.
We can handle the Batman.

From now on, Tony Zucco
gets my undivided attention.

247
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,924
How fortunate for Zucco,

248
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,301
because there's a little boy up there

249
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,762
who's just aching
for some of that attention.

250
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,847
I'm doing this for him.

251
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,602
I'm sure revenge
can be deliciously sweet.

252
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,397
However, at the moment,
he needs a friend.

253
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,733
Isn't that what you needed, sir?

00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,494

255
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,246
Fine.

00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,331
Sorry I haven't been around.

257
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,960
I forget how big and lonely
this place can be.

258
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,420
That's okay.

259
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,587
As it turns out,

260
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,923
I may have some free time
starting tomorrow.

How'd you like to catch
the Gotham Knights' season opener?

262
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,929
- Box seats.
- Great.

263
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,890
I know it must be very difficult.

264
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,976
If only I could've stopped him.

265
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,603
I saw him coming out of the tent.

266
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,939
I knew he didn't belong there.

267
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,149
I know.

268
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:35,900
You keep thinking,

269
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,987
"If only I'd done something differently."

270
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,699
"If only I could've warned them."

271
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,744
But there isn't anything
you could have done.

272
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,289
There's isn't anything
either of us could have done.

I wish I could say yes.

But it will get better in time for you.
That I promise.
