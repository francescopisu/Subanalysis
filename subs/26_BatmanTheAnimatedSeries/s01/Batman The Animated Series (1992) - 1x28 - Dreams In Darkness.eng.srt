1
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,585
Has the new patient quieted down?

2
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:29,130
Yes, Doctor. His hallucinations
seem to have stopped.

3
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,173
Such a pity, really.

4
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:36,554
To think, after all he's accomplished,
that he should end up here, like this.

5
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,349
Yes, he does seem calmer.

6
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:43,019
You can turn on the lights.

7
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:47,356
It's all right, Batman.

8
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,901
I'm Dr. Bartholomew, your psychiatrist.

9
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,405
Did you contact
Commissioner Gordon and Dr. Wu?

10
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:58,075
Calm yourself.
Everything is under control.

11
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,328
Haven't you listened to
anything I've told you?

12
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,456
He needs more time.

13
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,291
See that he's not disturbed.

14
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:08,544
Bartholomew,
we don't have any more time!

15
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,254
Now, now.

16
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,132
There's always time to heal.

17
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:16,594
Such a pity.

18
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,140
<i>"There's always time to heal,</i>"
<i>the doctor told me.</i>

19
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,850
<i>But he was wrong.</i>

20
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,602
<i>There was no time left.</i>

21
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,482
<i>Not for me, not for him
and not for Gotham City.</i>

22
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,526
<i>And as long as I remained
trapped in Arkham,</i>

23
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,362
<i>there was nothing I could do.</i>

24
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,115
<i>Except wait for the end
and remember the beginning.</i>

25
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:43,746
<i>The word on the street was
that something big</i>

26
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,623
<i>was going down at the Health Spring Spa.</i>

27
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,505
<i>I guessed a robbery,</i>

28
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,215
<i>but that night,</i>

29
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,800
<i>I guessed wrong.</i>

30
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,017
Yo. Getting set to make
the final connection.

31
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:08,729
<i>Superlative, Torchy.
Precisely on schedule.</i>

32
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,283
<i>He thought he was gonna do
something to the spa's drinking water.</i>

33
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,951
<i>I decided to make him think again.</i>

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,001
Huh?

35
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:32,795
Bummer.

36
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,715
<i>A-ha.
Precisely on schedule.</i>

37
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,341
<i>Now, Torchy.</i>

38
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,825
<i>He was in no condition to tell
me what he was trying to do,</i>

39
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,660
<i>or who he was working for.</i>

40
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,996
<i>My only clues were the strange device</i>

41
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,415
<i>he had welded to the drinking-water pipe</i>

42
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,376
<i>and one half
of a video communication link.</i>

43
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,963
<i>As for the gas,
I thought it had no effect on me.</i>

44
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,132
<i>But I was wrong again.</i>

45
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,053
What...

46
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,430
Alfred?

47
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:10,810
I beg your pardon, Master Bruce.
Did I startle you?

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,106
No. I must have been staring
at the screen too long.

49
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:21,487
Here are the reference materials you
requested on water-purifying systems.

50
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:24,114
Might one inquire what they're for?

51
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,911
Someone stole a huge
water-purification system last month.

52
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,580
This device is a miniature test model

53
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:35,334
which means someone was trying
to contaminate the spa's water.

54
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:38,128
Good heavens. With what?

55
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,174
The gas residue was completely oxidized.

56
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,970
I can't be sure. Yet.

57
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,266
<i>The man I'd captured
was still in the hospital.</i>

58
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,476
<i>The doctor said he was able to talk.</i>

59
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,771
Red eyes.

60
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,273
Those teeth.

61
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,858
Stay away.

62
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,777
<i>But what he had to say
didn't make any sense.</i>

63
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:05,197
<i>According to the chart,
he was hallucinating wildly</i>

64
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,784
<i>due to a massive fear reaction
in the amygdala of his brain.</i>

65
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,127
Who's in here?

66
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,421
Batman?

67
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,715
I need to know what's affected this man.

68
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,218
- Why?
- Because it may have affected me too.

69
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:30,014
Your blood titers are elevated.

70
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,182
You've been exposed to it also.

71
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:35,686
Percentage is smaller,
so it's taking longer to affect you.

72
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,439
But I will begin to hallucinate as well?

73
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,983
I'm surprised you haven't already.

74
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,903
But don't worry,
I can give you an antidote.

75
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,780
It will make you sleep for two days.

76
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,075
Batman, you must let me treat you.

77
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,747
Otherwise, in 24 hours, you won't
be able to tell reality from fantasy.

78
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:56,749
Batman?

79
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:04,048
<i>I couldn't risk being
out of action for that long.</i>

80
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:07,134
<i>What had happened at the spa
was only a trial run.</i>

81
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,678
<i>Someone was planning
to poison Gotham's water supply</i>

82
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,722
<i>with the same fear-inducing gas,</i>

83
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:16,101
<i>and I knew only one person
capable of such a deed.</i>

84
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,481
Robin!

85
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,672
Robin, look out.

86
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:46,632
Don't do it.

87
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,258
It's a trap.

88
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,594
<i>The hallucinations
were getting stronger.</i>

89
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,722
<i>I could've sworn I had
really seen Robin in front of me,</i>

90
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,474
<i>but I couldn't tell them that.</i>

91
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:58,394
<i>I was raving, incoherent.</i>

92
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:00,312
Look out.

93
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,440
Joker's got a bomb!

94
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:05,567
<i>Some thought I'd gone mad.</i>

95
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,903
<i>Others thought I always had been.</i>

96
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,573
<i>And so they put me
where they thought I belonged.</i>

97
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,534
Not yet.

98
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,162
His mask is at the root
of his delusional fixation.

99
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:20,666
To take it off might plunge him
into a catatonic state.

100
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,724
It's time we had another chat, Batman.

101
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,604
Now, tell me about
this supposed gas again.

102
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,732
I've already told you.

103
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,027
When the gas is put into
Gotham's water supply,

104
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:50,612
the entire city will be affected.

105
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,322
Why won't you believe me?

106
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,241
Easy.

107
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,996
Well, how could such a complex plan

108
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,707
be implemented
without attracting attention?

109
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:05,169
I think this plot
is just another delusion.

110
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,255
And deep down, you believe so too.

111
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,175
Otherwise, why come to Arkham?

112
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,803
The one place where
costumed delusional personalities

113
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,014
can receive compassion and help.

114
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,891
I didn't come here for help.

115
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,643
I came to find the criminal
behind all this.

116
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,479
Really, Batman.

117
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:28,150
As if a criminal could run
an outside operation from in here.

118
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,528
Jack Napier? Harvey Dent? Pamela Isley?

119
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:35,282
Or, as you call them,
the Joker, Two-Face and Poison Ivy.

120
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,035
We keep them all under constant watch.

121
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,829
They're not responsible
for this madness.

122
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,625
There's only one criminal twisted enough
to come up with such a scheme,

123
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,210
The Scarecrow.

124
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,255
Professor Crane? What nonsense.

125
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:53,509
I saw him this morning in his cell.

126
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,553
He's probably asleep even as we speak.

127
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,687
First truck's almost empty, boss.

128
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,231
Excellent.

129
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,651
Keep going. I expect no interference.

130
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,028
What about Batman?

131
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,404
Batman?

132
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,698
He's no longer of consequence.

133
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,369
It was no accident, his turning up
at the health spa, you know.

134
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,746
I leaked rumors of a burglary there.

135
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,248
You set him up?

136
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:25,999
Of course.

137
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,335
And now that he's been
exposed to the gas,

138
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:31,338
he's achieved the fate
he truly deserves.

139
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:33,882
You mean Batman's...

140
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,302
Oh, he's much worse than that.

141
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,596
Much, much worse than that.

142
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,860
Who's there?

143
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,890
Mom? Dad?

144
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:40,157
No. Stop!

145
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,825
No!

146
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,744
Don't go in there!

147
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:02,304
No!

148
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:16,026
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

149
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,570
Isn't that why I'm here?

150
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:21,448
Because I'm disturbed?

151
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,954
I asked an orderly to look in
on Professor Crane, and...

152
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:28,413
And he's not there.

153
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:33,377
He can't possibly have left the grounds.
Our security is absolute.

154
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:36,630
- Completely...
- No security is absolute.

155
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,299
The Scarecrow has already proved that.

156
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,593
But I think I know where he is.

157
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,095
Where?

158
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,846
Where's Arkham's water supply?

159
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,685
Arkham Cavern.
The asylum was built over it.

160
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,813
There's an underground river
that feeds the city reservoir.

161
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,481
I've got to get down there.

162
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,025
In your condition? I can't allow that.

163
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,652
You're staying here.

164
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:11,915
You're still very ill, Batman.

165
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:13,875
This will make you feel better.

166
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,681
The last truck's here.
Once we start pumping it,

167
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:30,392
there's no stopping
the chemical reaction.

168
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,977
Excellent.

169
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:35,814
The opportunities to study
the nature of fear will be unparalleled.

170
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:40,444
It's time for the greatest controlled
experiment in mass madness

171
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:42,362
to finally begin.

172
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,923
Don't worry, the police
will handle Professor Crane.

173
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,127
Get him!

174
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,125
Take me to the basement. Now.

175
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,210
No.

176
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:44,753
You're not real.

177
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,755
No!

178
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,180
Robin. Alfred.

179
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:56,848
You've got to help me.

180
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,184
It's too late for that, Bruce.

181
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:01,686
You've lived in darkness too long.

182
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:06,942
Yes. Do come along, Master Bruce.
It's time to go home.

183
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:22,457
The great Batman,
scared out of his mind.

184
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,417
How does it feel?

185
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,702
Full pressure on pump one.

186
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:01,204
<i>Mixing chamber two on standby.</i>

187
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,832
<i>We are go for injection.</i>

188
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,960
<i>Three minutes and counting.</i>

189
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,213
That's the last of it.

190
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,800
An entire city screaming in fear.

191
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,094
I wonder if we'll be able to hear it.

192
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:34,654
You've run out of time, Scarecrow.

193
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,449
This experiment in terror is over.

194
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,581
Get him.

195
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,963
He's been exposed to the gas, remember?

196
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:54,049
He'll be terrified of you.

197
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:15,820
- Turn it off!
- Turn it off!

198
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:26,164
Fool. Did you really think
I wouldn't have backup controls?

199
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,541
It's over, Scarecrow.

200
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,739
Ah!

201
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,569
It's gonna blow!

202
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,584
No! No!

203
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,261
Help me!

204
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,559
One second. One...
Send for an ambulance...

205
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,439
Well, he was right
all along.

206
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,942
This time, see if you can
keep him in there.

207
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:30,955
There you go.

208
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:32,749
As simple as that.

209
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,876
Thanks, Alfred.

210
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,086
It's good to know I'm safe here.
