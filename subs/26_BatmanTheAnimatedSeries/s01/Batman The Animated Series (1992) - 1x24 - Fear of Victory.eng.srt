1
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,262
<i>Hike!</i>

2
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,685
<i>Look at
Gotham State's Brian Rogers!</i>

3
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,312
<i>He's a one-man offense.</i>

4
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,066
<i>A repeat performance this weekend
against that tough Tech team,</i>

5
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:52,445
<i>all but guarantees Rogers
a big-buck Pro contract.</i>

6
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,074
Sounds like it's off to the Pros
for you, roommate.

7
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,784
Maybe. But he's right.

8
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,537
The scouts will be watching me
real close against Tech.

9
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,789
Ah, no sweat. You'll dazzle them.

10
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:06,000
I hope so.

11
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,502
Making the Pros
means I can help out my folks.

12
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,463
Maybe even put my sister
through college.

13
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,132
<i>Time for</i> Boseman's Bloopers,

14
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,384
<i>and boy, they were coming
off the walls this week.</i>

15
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,055
<i>Heavily favored middleweight champ,
Rudy Lovell, set two new records.</i>

16
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,057
<i>One for the shortest fight in history,</i>

17
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,142
<i>the other for the 50-yard dash.</i>

18
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:26,479
<i>Goalie, Rick Gale, came up
with a novel way to defend his goal.</i>

19
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:30,358
<i>Rather unorthodox,
wouldn't you say, Rick? But effective.</i>

20
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,528
<i>And here's top seed Chris Adams,</i>

21
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,365
<i>making it look like
she's in the wrong racket.</i>

22
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:40,493
<i>Seriously, though,
this was mighty puzzling behavior</i>

23
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,453
<i>from some of our finest athletes.</i>

24
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,080
I'll say.

25
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,672
Telegram for Brian Rogers.

26
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,342
- Uh, here you go.
- Good evening, gentlemen.

27
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,765
This is weird.

28
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,308
Let me see.

29
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,064
"Dear Brian, best of luck against Tech."

30
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,401
"And remember
that only a fool knows no fear."

31
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:16,487
"I'm betting on it. A fan."

32
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,864
As I said...

33
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,408
- Weird.
- Weird.

34
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,593
Hike! Hike!

35
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,573
Yet another bad pass by Rogers.

36
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,521
Brian Rogers is having the worst day
of his collegiate career.

37
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,691
Come on, Brian, get it together.

38
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,239
Uh, all right. All right.
Let's try a run.

39
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,032
Off tackle.

40
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,869
On third and 25, we need to pass!

41
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:06,829
Yeah, okay, okay.

42
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:08,205
Yeah, yeah, sure, pass.

43
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,332
Are you okay, man?

44
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,252
Yeah, yeah. No... No problem.

45
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,883
The ball is snapped.
Rogers is going back.

46
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,766
Ah! No!

47
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,850
Don't hurt me!

48
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,643
Don't hurt me!

49
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,411
They were so big and scary.

50
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,330
I couldn't...

51
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,415
It's gonna be all right, son.

52
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,502
We're gonna take you
to the infirmary for observation.

53
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,383
It was unbelievable, Batman.

54
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,261
The guy totally freaked,
right there on the field.

55
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,680
Brian Rogers. The Rock.

56
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,432
He was under a lot of pressure, Robin.

57
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,275
You can never tell when...

58
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,531
Uh-oh. Time to punch in.

59
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:38,087
Oh, no. Not him!

60
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,505
Come on. This way!

61
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:15,207
Robin!

62
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,460
He don't stop.

63
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,672
That's because
he don't know when to quit!

64
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,187
Robin, give me a hand.

65
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,107
I...

66
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,192
I can't.

67
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:45,195
Hey, Batman, catch this!

68
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,119
Ah!

69
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:54,747
No!

70
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,753
No!

71
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:17,895
Oh, my!

72
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,195
Oh, my.

73
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,831
Hey, boy blunder, what's the matter?
Bat got your tongue?

74
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,378
This will take care of bird boy.

75
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,396
All right, Robin.

76
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,772
Pull yourself together.

77
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,984
I don't know what happened to me.

78
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,735
I was scared to death.

79
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,070
I couldn't even think.

80
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,114
It was so unreal.

81
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,123
It's too strange,
that both you and your roommate

82
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,041
would have panic attacks
on the same day.

83
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,210
I still can't believe it!

84
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:24,878
I could've gotten you killed!

85
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:27,047
Calm down.

86
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,465
We'll get a lead on it.

87
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:38,934
Did you see this?

88
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,937
The screwy telegram?

89
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,105
Sure.

90
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,692
Hey, what's this?

91
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:47,943
Our lead.

92
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,369
Take it easy, fella.

93
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:06,795
I suspect the chemical is absorbed
through the skin.

94
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,765
- Nothing's happening.
- Yet.

95
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,819
Just as I thought.

96
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,868
The fear chemical
is activated by adrenaline.

97
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:40,871
So whenever you or Brian
or any of the other athletes

98
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:41,955
got agitated...

99
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,876
The stuff kicks in,
turning our excitement to fear.

100
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:48,629
But how long is this gonna last?

101
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,757
I'm afraid there's only one person
who can answer that.

102
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,593
The professor of fear himself.

103
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:55,928
The Scarecrow.

104
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,389
It can't be. He's locked up in Arkham.

105
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:02,309
Isn't he?

106
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:30,838
This is for Jonathan Crane.

107
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,922
I got it!

108
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,925
Hey, corn on the cob.

109
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:37,636
A scarecrow's gotta love that.

110
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,980
Has Professor Crane
lost his appetite?

111
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,529
You're not supposed to be here.

112
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,948
But the Scarecrow is.

113
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,283
What...

114
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,367
What do you mean?

115
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,035
He's in his cell.

116
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,954
I'd like to make sure of that.

117
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:07,457
Take my word.
I just saw him five minutes ago.

118
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,544
Then you won't mind
if I pay him a visit.

119
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,462
No!

120
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,714
No, you can't do that!

121
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,924
It's against the rules! You can't!

122
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:22,431
Stay with him, Robin.

123
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,725
Fine with me.

124
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,695
The cowl is familiar,

125
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,280
but I'm blanking on the face.

126
00:11:56,423 --> 00:12:00,093
No! Don't go in! Don't do it! No!

127
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,681
- Don't!
- Wait.

128
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,733
Professor Crane?

129
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:32,167
$27,800, $27,900, $28,000.

130
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,128
It's a pleasure doing business.

131
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,257
You've been winning
a lot here, Mr., uh...

132
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,344
You may call me Lucky.

133
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,972
Yeah? Well, Lucky,

134
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,725
that's what you must be,
because I ain't seen you lose.

135
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,436
Not even once over the last week.

136
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,063
Yes, well,

137
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:55,148
I make my own luck.

138
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,323
That Lucky knows something,

139
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,492
and I wanna know it, too.

140
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,456
Be persuasive.

141
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,099
Huh?

142
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,976
Lost?

143
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,104
You have that bewildered look,

144
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,732
but your sort always does.

145
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:21,234
I ain't lost. I'm looking for you.

146
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:25,113
I wanna know
how come you always win, Mr. Lucky.

147
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:27,449
It's quite simple, actually.

148
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:29,493
I fix the games.

149
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:33,955
You can't fix all those sports.
Nobody can.

150
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,085
O ye of little brain,
allow me to illustrate.

151
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,422
Here. You can read, can't you?

152
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:49,262
"Boo!"

153
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,264
Hey, is this some kind of joke?

154
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,351
It's no joke, I assure you.

155
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:58,146
It's the fear of victory
and the agony of...

156
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,690
The Scarecrow!

157
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:08,281
So, now you understand step one
in how I fix an athletic contest.

158
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,243
I shall proceed to step two.

159
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:14,413
No! No! Get away!

160
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,052
He's gonna get me. He's gonna get me.
He's gonna get me!

161
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,766
That's how we found him.
Scared as a rat at a cat convention.

162
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,852
I've never seen anything like it.

163
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,788
You haven't been watching
the sports channel.

164
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,938
Sports?

165
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,357
Oh, you mean those athletes?

166
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:46,236
- What's that got to do with...
- Put two and two together, Commissioner.

167
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,072
That goon in there
works for Leon the bookie.

168
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,323
And word has it,

169
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,617
he's been taking it on the chin lately.

170
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,996
You're telling me
that that walking pile of straw

171
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,081
scares the stuffing out of sports stars,

172
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,417
and then bets against their teams?

173
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,543
Exactly.

174
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:05,297
A perfect way to scare up
some quick cash for his sick schemes.

175
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,013
Steady, Dick.

176
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:14,764
You can do it.

177
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,185
No!

178
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,352
I'm not afraid!

179
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,730
I'm not afraid!

180
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm not... No!

181
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,575
I learned to walk on a high wire.

182
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:36,703
Now I can't stand
on a step stool without freaking.

183
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:37,871
I'm...

184
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:39,539
I'm no good to you anymore.

185
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,418
Easy, Dick.
It's bound to wear off.

186
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,587
But, in the meantime,
you've got to fight it.

187
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,297
Regain control.

188
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,798
Come on.

189
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,883
Where?

190
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,720
I thought we'd
catch a game tonight.

191
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:58,058
The Gotham Knights are favored 4-1,
thanks to their quarterback, Mitch Nole.

192
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,062
You think he's
gonna get a telegram?

193
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,356
I'd say it's a good bet.

194
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,025
I don't know.

195
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,277
I'll only get in the way.

196
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,697
You can be my extra set of eyes. Get in.

197
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,617
I'll drive real slow.

198
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,728
Okay, Robin.

199
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,689
Get it together.

200
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,032
Telegram for Mitch Nole. Oh!

201
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,119
What? What's wrong?
All I did was double-park!

202
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:00,745
I'll move it! I swear!

203
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,123
All right, Scarecrow.

204
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:48,043
What's your game plan this time?

205
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,095
Hut!

206
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:11,066
Mitch Nole is
ripping the Colonials apart!

207
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,277
Four hundred yards passing,
and the game's not over yet.

208
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,739
There's enough powder in that helmet
to panic a pachyderm!

209
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:20,992
Hut! Hut!

210
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:33,046
He should be prostrating himself,
crying for mercy!

211
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,090
Change of luck, Scarecrow?

212
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:37,842
You!

213
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:41,221
You're aware
that gambling is illegal in Gotham?

214
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,348
I need the money, Batman.

215
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,975
You know the cost
of chemicals these days.

216
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,896
And it'll take much more than this
to bring every pathetic person in Gotham

217
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:52,482
to their knees, kissing my feet!

218
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,693
No closer, Batman!

219
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,445
Unless you want a stampede
of half-crazed humanity,

220
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,322
crushing and clawing each other!

221
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:01,157
Oh, no!

222
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:09,499
Come on, Robin. Get a grip!

223
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,759
Now, what guarantee do I have
you won't follow me?

224
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:22,137
You have my word, Scarecrow.

225
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,389
Just don't drop the vial.

226
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:27,934
Actually, Batman,
I'd prefer a little insurance

227
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,270
that you'll be otherwise occupied.

228
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,722
It's a fumble!
This could mean disaster for Gotham!

229
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,350
Wait! Look at that!

230
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:15,064
What a recovery!

231
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,237
Good work, Robin.

232
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,951
I also snagged a helmet
that had some of this in it.

233
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,788
Looks like you've got a handle
on your problem.

234
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,040
Yeah. I'm getting there.

235
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,961
<i>The Gotham Knights
wasted no time signing Brian Rogers,</i>

236
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,465
<i>making our local champ
their first-round draft pick.</i>

237
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:43,009
Looks like your friend
is back on track again.

238
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,470
Yeah, I can't wait to congratulate him.

239
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:47,847
You can always send a telegram.
