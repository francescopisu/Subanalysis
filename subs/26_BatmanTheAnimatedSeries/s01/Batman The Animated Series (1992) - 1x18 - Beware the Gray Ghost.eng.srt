00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:25,793
<i>When crime haunts the night,</i>

2
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:29,213
<i>a silent crusader
carries the torch of justice.</i>

3
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,347
<i>Those with evil hearts beware,</i>

4
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:41,058
<i>for out of the darkness comes</i>

5
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:43,811
<i>the Gray Ghost.</i>

6
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,694
<i>Tonight's episode, "The Mad Bomber."</i>

7
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,553
Bedtime right after <i>Gray Ghost.</i>
Okay, Bruce?

8
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:24,268
<i>The city is rocked again
by the mysterious bomber.</i>

9
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:28,481
<i>Our only hope, the Gray Ghost!</i>

10
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,057
<i>"Pay up, or pay the consequences."</i>

11
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:07,144
<i>"One million in cash,
or the Piedmont Bank is next."</i>

12
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:09,605
<i>Signed, "The Mad Bomber."</i>

13
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:33,295
Batman.

14
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,593
"Pay up,
or pay the consequences."

15
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,763
"One million in cash,
or the Gotham Bank is next."

16
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,850
Signed, "The Mad Bomber."

17
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,563
<i>If only we knew
how he planted those bombs.</i>

18
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:53,899
<i>Fear not, chief.
I think I have the answer.</i>

19
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,404
Time for all little Gray Ghosts
to be in bed.

20
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,252
<i>The Gray Ghost.</i>

21
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,091
<i>And so,
another building is blown up</i>

22
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,802
<i>as Gotham's Mad Bomber
continues to demand</i>

23
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,721
<i>one million dollars from the city</i>

24
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:25,806
<i>to end his reign of destruction.</i>

25
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,475
<i>The question remains,</i>

26
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:32,813
<i>how are the explosives getting past
both police and bomb-squad experts?</i>

27
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,441
And, what does it have to do
with my old hero?

28
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,239
What can I do for you?

29
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:45,743
We're looking for a copy of a film.
Actually, a TV show.

30
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:47,369
We can't find it on video.

31
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:49,580
Well, you've come
to the right place, pal.

32
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:52,082
I got every TV show ever made here.

33
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,001
I collect them. It's my life.

34
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,587
I got it all.
Anything you want. Name it.

35
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,506
<i>The Gray Ghost.</i>

36
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,258
Uh, name something else.

37
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,511
You said you had everything.

38
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:06,388
Except <i>The Gray Ghost.</i> Nobody has it.

39
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,933
The studio that made that show, Spectra,

40
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,770
it burned to the ground 20 years ago.
The negatives went up like kindling.

41
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,188
A real shame.

42
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,818
So, <i>The Gray Ghost</i> doesn't exist?

43
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,152
Not anymore.

44
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:21,487
Sorry, pal.

45
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:39,046
So many actors.

46
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,883
I wish I knew the one
you're looking for, Master Bruce.

47
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,885
But I don't watch television.

48
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,762
I prefer my fireplace.

49
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,601
- I found him!
- "Simon Trent."

50
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,186
Dapper-looking chap.

51
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,272
And he's living
right here in Gotham.

52
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,260
Trent!

53
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,318
Trent! Do you hear me?

54
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:04,613
Trent! I know you're in there.

55
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,365
This ain't no homeless shelter.

56
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,659
Pay your rent or get out!

57
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:10,744
Lousy, has-been actor!

58
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:30,222
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me, Si.

59
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,766
Bad news. You didn't get the part.

60
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,399
I need to work, Frankie.
Get me something. You're my agent.

61
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,611
I try, Si. I really do.

62
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,530
But they still think of you
as the Gray Ghost.

63
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:47,656
Those who remember.

64
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,200
I can do other parts. I'm an actor.

65
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,162
<i>I know, Si. Hey,
we've been through this before.</i>

66
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,040
<i>Something will come up.
Just hang in there, okay?</i>

67
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:15,851
Argh!

68
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,847
Oh! The original Gray Ghost costume!

69
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,392
You sure you wanna get rid of this?

70
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,060
Positive.

71
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,566
I can't pay much, Mr. Trent.

72
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:07,069
Your <i>Gray Ghost</i> merchandise
just isn't much in demand.

73
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,488
I mean, no one's buying.

74
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:11,073
I know, Ted.

75
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,826
I'll take whatever you can give me.

76
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,004
Well, old friend,
you've paid the rent for the last time.

77
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:58,078
"Gray Ghost, meet me tonight
at the Gotham Art School."

78
00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,913
Signed, "A friend."

79
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,778
You?

80
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:33,781
I need your help.

81
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:57,846
What do you want from me?

82
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:01,767
Some madman
is blowing up Gotham, piece by piece.

83
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:04,937
Somehow, it's connected
to the Gray Ghost. To you.

84
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,440
What are you talking about?

85
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,443
I'm just an actor.
The Gray Ghost was a part I played.

86
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:15,114
The bombings in Gotham
are exactly like an episode

87
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,281
of <i>The Gray Ghost.</i>

88
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,242
I need you to remember how it was done.

89
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,495
I made hundreds of those shows.
They're all a blur!

90
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,998
Now, leave me alone.
Just leave me alone!

91
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,256
That noise.

92
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:52,484
Wait.

93
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,350
You know something.

94
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,352
You recognized that sound.

95
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,146
This is harassment.

96
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,772
I'm calling the police.

97
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:37,154
We know the next bomb
is going to hit the Gotham Library.

98
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:38,864
Help me.

99
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:00,302
Here's your answer. Take it and go!

100
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,553
Please!

101
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,398
I used to admire
what the Gray Ghost stood for.

102
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,443
I'm not the Gray Ghost.

103
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:18,987
I can see that now.

104
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:36,505
<i>Out of the darkness comes
the Gray Ghost!</i>

105
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:50,686
Popcorn, sir.

106
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,558
That's it.

107
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:31,059
That's the noise.

108
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,191
You've gotta be kidding me.

109
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,283
That's right, commissioner.

110
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,661
Remote-controlled toy cars
loaded with explosives.

111
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,868
We'll know what to look for
at the library, tonight.

112
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:33,622
There they are. Fire!

113
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:34,474
Hmm. No explosives.

114
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,600
A decoy?

115
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,831
Ahhh!

116
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,303
You.

117
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,306
Like you said,

118
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,974
you need my help.

119
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,726
Look familiar?

120
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,646
More than familiar.

121
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:23,190
It's identical.

122
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:26,234
Look. It even has
the Gray Ghost brand name.

123
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,028
Better check it for prints.

124
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:29,654
Thanks.

125
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:31,031
Hey, I owed you.

126
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:32,824
You got me my outfit back.

127
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,584
Gray Ghost.

128
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,919
Yes?

129
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:45,879
You want to give me a hand with this?

130
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:48,215
Uh... Sure.

131
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:05,732
Drive.

132
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,802
More of them. And they're gaining on us.

133
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,554
Try the green switch.

134
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,326
Hey, we did it, partner!

135
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:13,633
This place is amazing.

136
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:15,468
It's just like...

137
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,762
The Gray Ghost's lair?

138
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:20,599
It's almost an exact replica.

139
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,726
Let me show you something else.

140
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:34,821
As a kid, I used to
watch you with my father.

141
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:37,240
The Gray Ghost was my hero.

142
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:39,826
So, it wasn't all for nothing.

143
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:44,497
What did you find?

144
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,249
Fingerprints on the toy car.

145
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,752
And they belong to...

146
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:51,838
You, Simon Trent.

147
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,548
That's not possible.

148
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,801
Your prints are on this car.

149
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,762
You had the only copy of the show.

150
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,931
The Mad Bomber
followed the show step by step.

151
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:04,267
But, I'm not the Mad Bomber, Batman.

152
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:08,355
I'm not. I sold my Gray Ghost cars
months ago to pay for my...

153
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,398
No,

154
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,567
it can't be him!

155
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:29,167
Well, if it isn't
the Dark Knight himself.

156
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,878
You're finished, Mad Bomber.

157
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,006
I don't think so.

158
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,481
Time to put your toys away, little man.

159
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,816
I can't.

160
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,317
You see, I need the money,

161
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,027
to buy more toys.

162
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,821
I love toys.

163
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,239
They can play songs.

164
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,074
They can dance.

165
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,660
They can even eat money.

166
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,829
Oh, boy, can they eat money.

167
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:07,914
All my money.

168
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,124
And then,

169
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,876
I remembered an episode
of <i>The Gray Ghost.</i>

170
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,087
And I knew what else a toy could do.

171
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:15,839
It can carry a bomb.

172
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,633
It can hold a city for ransom.

173
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:20,844
Oh, the power of the toy.

174
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:23,054
It can earn millions.

175
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,349
Millions for the little,
old toy collector, me.

176
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,882
No!

177
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:03,178
My toys! My toys, my beautiful toys!

178
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,478
<i>Gothamites have
turned out in record numbers</i>

179
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,146
to celebrate the video release

180
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,149
of the long-lost <i>Gray Ghost</i>
television series.

181
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:19,235
And on hand, for the festivities
is the toast of the town,

182
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,405
the Gray Ghost himself, Simon Trent.

183
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,699
Please make it out to "Bruce."

184
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:30,705
There you go, Bruce.

185
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,707
Thanks, Mr. Trent.

186
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,754
You know, as a kid,
I used to watch you with my father.

187
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:39,839
The Gray Ghost was my hero.

188
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:41,674
Really?

189
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,843
And he still is.
