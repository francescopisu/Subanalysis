The Jazzman broke out of Stonegate.

174
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,615
He's gone to ground somewhere in Gotham.

175
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,286
You know he'll find a way
to get to Gordon.

176
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,790
Okay. Then I'm going after him.

177
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,894
You taught me everything I know
about crime-fighting, Bruce.

178
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,588
But the most important lesson
was to never give up.

179
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:44,521
No, Dick.

180
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,065
This is my hunt.

I'll be right back.

190

Yes. Get some rest now.

Maybe if I'd been younger,
could've been like you.

206
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,566

How about returning that suitcase
to its owner.

Hey, man, I am the owner.

212
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,764
You know, I was kind of hoping
I'd run into you.

I'd been in those places
like where you left me before.

Heard the rap, wasn't impressed.
But this time it made sense.

215
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,149
Maybe I was ready to hear it.
So I'm heading back home.

216
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:18,443
I guess I kind of owe it to you, Batman.

217
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,780
You probably saved my life.
I bet you hear this all the time.

I'll see you around.
