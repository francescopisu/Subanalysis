1
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:30,798
It's about time.

2
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,517
Good morning, Hill.

3
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,647
- Oh, good morning, um...
- Fugate.

4
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,232
Temple Fugate?

5
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:51,652
I should think you'd remember
the name by now, Counselor.

6
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:54,989
We've only been taking
the same train every day for...

7
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:58,534
One year, seven months and 13 days.

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,787
Right. The efficiency expert.

9
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,291
Six minutes behind schedule.

10
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,005
You seem pretty tightly wound
this morning, Fugate.

11
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,549
I have an important court hearing today.

12
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:16,927
There's been a $20 million judgment
against my company.

13
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,846
My attorney has appealed.

14
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:20,139
But if we lose,

15
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:22,350
it's the end of everything.

16
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,810
Temple, let me give you some advice.

17
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:27,897
I'm a lawyer.
Trust me, I know these things.

18
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,192
If that judge sees you
looking as tense and haggard

19
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:32,485
as you are now,

20
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,362
he'll think you were up to something.

21
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,821
Loosen up.

22
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,115
Do something to relax
before you go into court.

23
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,618
Get out of your routine
for a few minutes.

24
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,370
Do you take a coffee break?

25
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:44,080
Of course. Every day,

26
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:45,831
at 3:00 on the dot.

27
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,250
Then take it at 3:15.

28
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,712
But... My schedule.

29
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,256
Forget your schedule for one day.

30
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,177
Believe me,
it will make a new man out of you.

31
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,526
I needed those five minutes ago.

32
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,069
I'm sorry, sir, but...

33
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,779
Thirty-seven pages?

34
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:20,616
That would take a copier
exactly one minute and 49 seconds.

35
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,452
One more delay like this
and you're fired.

36
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,455
Your coffee, sir.
And those court documents you requested.

37
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:31,043
<i>Take your coffee break
at 3:15.</i>

38
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,879
<i>And get out of the office.</i>

39
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,465
Put that in a thermos, Ms. Perkins.

40
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,035
Aah!

41
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,290
You little brats!

42
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,381
No! No!

43
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:19,216
Don't do this to me!

44
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:23,179
My lawyer needs those papers.

45
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,863
Due to his failure to appear,

46
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:43,741
this court finds your client in default.

47
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,202
Summary judgment against him stands,

48
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,870
at $20 million.

49
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:52,082
No! You can't! I'll be ruined!

50
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,003
Then perhaps this will teach you
to be on time for a change.

51
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:45,177
Are you quite sure you won't stop
for breakfast, Master Bruce?

52
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,847
The meals they serve
at these fundraisers...

53
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,765
Mmm, ghastly.

54
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,810
Alfred, I'm sure Mayor Hill
will put out a good spread.

55
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,979
He knows you don't kick off
a reelection campaign

56
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,397
by poisoning your supporters.

57
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,445
Really? If he were
in a hurry to get to the food,

58
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,698
he'd be ahead of us
instead of behind us.

59
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,502
I take it taxi drivers
are no longer required

60
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,462
to obey traffic signals.

61
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,047
Climb off it, geezer.

62
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,424
You had the red.

63
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,796
It's nobody's fault.

64
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,051
Look.

65
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:30,556
The traffic signals are malfunctioning.

66
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,518
What the devil?

67
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:36,395
That is rude!

68
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:37,798
It's the same thing all the time.

69
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,482
I'll sue you.

70
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,784
There's the foul-up.

71
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,369
Mayor Over-the-Hill.

72
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,622
Nothing works right
in this city no more.

73
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,375
I fear this does not bode well
for his campaign.

74
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,127
No.

75
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,295
No, it doesn't.

76
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,464
And that may be exactly the point.

77
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,987
Another piece of outlandish graffiti?

78
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,074
Is this somebody's idea of a joke?

79
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,592
Hold it!

80
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:50,511
Well, well.

81
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,137
The Batman.

82
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,348
It's about time you showed up.

83
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:58,227
I suppose you want to know
why I've brought downtown Gotham

84
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,437
to a standstill, Batman. Hmm?

85
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,398
Well, let's just say

86
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:07,361
it's because I'm a civic-minded citizen
with a lot of time on his hands.

87
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,834
I want some answers, wise guy.

88
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:24,753
Talk!

89
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,921
A pity.

90
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,965
I don't know what to tell you, Batman.

91
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,093
Except, perhaps that the 9:15

92
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,971
is always six minutes early.

93
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,494
If the creep with the clocks
did sabotage the entire traffic system,

94
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,913
he had to have come here to do it.

95
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:01,790
Wait here.

96
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:08,797
My pleasure.

97
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,134
This is one of the finest back alleys
in all of Gotham.

98
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,877
What kind of saboteur

99
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,506
uses a $6,000 Metronex
to trigger a time bomb?

100
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,008
A saboteur with too much money?

101
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:56,011
Most jewelry stores
register the serial numbers

102
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,554
of the Metronexes they sell.

103
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,935
Let's see what the police database
turns up.

104
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:08,857
"Temple Fugate. 362 Brayfogle."

105
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,567
Let's go, Alfred.

106
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,201
It appears Mr. Fugate's neighborhood
has seen better days.

107
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,500
What is it about
that particular clock tower?

108
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,420
He's got more data on it
than anything else in the city.

109
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,463
There's been a slight blackout.

110
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,508
Just one city block,
between Schiff and Robinson,

111
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,010
west of Molldorf.

112
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,013
The location
of Gotham Mutual's main branch.

113
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,683
No doubt some malefactors
blacked out the bank,

114
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,935
to disable the locks on the vault.

115
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,813
Yes, the time locks.

116
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,981
- Fugate.
- Fugate.

117
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,523
<i>Sorry I couldn't be
with you in person, Batman.</i>

118
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,359
<i>But, I've got a train to catch.</i>

119
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:18,570
<i>This box contains
a high-speed vacuum pump.</i>

120
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,531
<i>I know you've got
all kinds of gas masks.</i>

121
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,700
<i>So, I'm putting you out of my misery</i>

122
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:27,120
<i>by simply removing
all the oxygen from the room.</i>

123
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,876
<i>The process will take 15 minutes,</i>

124
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,003
<i>which is exactly 17 minutes less</i>

125
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,588
<i>than the time it would take you</i>

126
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,967
<i>to burn through the door
with that oxyacetylene torch of yours.</i>

127
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:44,721
<i>Oh, and, I don't recommend
trying to open the pump's housing.</i>

128
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,724
<i>It's rigged
with a vibration-sensitive explosive.</i>

129
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,352
<i>Of course,
if you want to get blown to bits,</i>

130
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,229
<i>that's fine with me.</i>

131
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,857
<i>Either way, it's time to say
adieu, Batman.</i>

132
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,105
This magnificent station,

133
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,026
home of the world's
first fully-automated subway line,

134
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,778
is the fulfillment of my pledge to you,

135
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,867
to make our subways safer
and more efficient.

136
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,954
And so, I declare Gotham Central Station

137
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,998
officially open.

138
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,967
Let the first train arrive!

139
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,938
Where is it?

140
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,506
What an embarrassment.

141
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:47,719
I wanted that train here
at 2:30 on the dot!

142
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:50,722
<i>So, is this what you want?</i>

143
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:53,683
<i>A mayor who can't
even get a single subway train</i>

144
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,976
<i>to arrive on time?</i>

145
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,860
<i>Clear the platform, please.</i>

146
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,489
<i>Here comes some more
of our mayor's incompetence.</i>

147
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,239
Only minor injuries. Thank God.

148
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,199
Hill! Where's Hill?

149
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,954
<i>And in the wake of the subway accident,</i>

150
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,039
<i>this grim news,</i>

151
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,249
<i>Mayor Hamilton Hill has vanished.</i>

152
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,877
<i>The police have no leads
to his whereabouts</i>

153
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,837
<i>and they fear
he may have been kidnapped.</i>

154
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,476
Comfortable, Hill?

155
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,353
Well, you won't be for long.

156
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:06,149
At 3:15 on the dot,
those hands will come together,

157
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,443
and you'll be crushed like an insect.

158
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,779
3:15, Hill.

159
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:14,115
Does that time hold any meaning for you?

160
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,117
I don't know what you're talking about!

161
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,622
You told me
to take my coffee break at 3:15.

162
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:23,500
- What?
- You don't remember?

163
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,960
My court date?

164
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,922
Oh, my Lord!

165
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:30,173
The lawsuit!

166
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,969
Fugate, I swear,
I was only trying to help.

167
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:35,257
Don't hand me that.

168
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:36,555
You did it on purpose.

169
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:40,600
The plaintiffs were represented
by your law firm, Mr. Mayor.

170
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:46,398
But I had nothing to do
with that case, Fugate.

171
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:47,941
Liar!

172
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,943
Not that it matters anymore,

173
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:54,864
now that you have an appointment
to keep at 3:15 precisely,

174
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,950
with the grim reaper!

175
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,043
I'm here to clean your clock, Fugate.

176
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:09,045
Don't count on it, Batman.

177
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,048
When it comes to clocks, I am king.

178
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,383
<i>En garde!</i>

179
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,429
Huh?

180
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,014
Whoa!

181
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,537
Give it up, Fugate.

182
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,581
Hill committed no crime against you.

183
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,166
He did worse.

184
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,251
He made me late!

185
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,582
I could do this all day, Batman,

186
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,000
but your time is up.

187
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,190
I've studied
news footage of you.

188
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:53,393
And I know that it takes you

189
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:56,903
exactly 1/20 of a second
to throw a punch.

190
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,613
Very clever.

191
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,533
But it only takes me 1/30 of a second

192
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,326
to do this.

193
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,130
Huh?

194
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,907
Fugate!

195
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,492
You can't escape!

196
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:47,162
<i>Au contraire,</i> Batman.

197
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,999
You of all people should know

198
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,918
there's always a way out.

199
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,760
Fugate!

200
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,010
Well, he won't be doing
any more campaigning for a few days.

201
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,335
But at least the Mayor is safe.

202
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,837
No trace
of this Clock King, though.

203
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,548
How could anyone survive
a wreck like this?

204
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,926
If I could, he could.

205
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,052
Then,

206
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,179
you think we'll hear from him again?

207
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,139
I wouldn't be surprised, Commissioner.

208
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:49,265
In fact,

209
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,768
I'd say, it's only a matter of time.
