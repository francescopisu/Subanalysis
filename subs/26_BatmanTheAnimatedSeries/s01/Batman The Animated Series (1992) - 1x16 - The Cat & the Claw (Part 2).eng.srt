1
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,192
<i>Previously on</i> Batman...

2
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,570
Perfect, my love.

3
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,988
Let's go home.

4
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,492
<i>So, our new cat burglar
is a woman.</i>

5
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:19,662
You see, we're committed
to building a major resort.

6
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:23,249
The land is in the middle of nowhere.
It's worthless except to wildcats.

7
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,960
Tomorrow at 2300 hours,

8
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:30,006
a train under military escort
will pass through Gotham.

9
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,926
We'll hit the train
outside the city, at this point.

10
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
What is that?

11
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,935
A cat at the end of its nine lives.

12
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,689
I'll have to try
and trim those claws.

13
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:48,816
Hey!

14
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:57,533
Never trifle
with the affections of a woman.

15
00:01:57,658 --> 00:01:59,076
Until next time.

16
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:02,413
And there will be a next time.

17
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,994
You're late.

18
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:46,332
Can't you ever walk up to someone
normal-like?

19
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:48,459
I hear you have
some information.

20
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:51,170
Under one condition.
Lay off the South Side.

21
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:56,550
Keep this up,
and I'll be on you from all sides.

22
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,844
North, south, east and west.

23
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,138
Okay! I get the picture.

24
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:07,186
There's rumors about some train heist.

25
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:09,188
- When?
- Tonight.

26
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:10,272
Red Claw?

27
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:12,733
Don't know. It's real sketchy.

28
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,360
One thing I can tell you,

29
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:16,612
no one in the organization
is making the hit.

30
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:18,531
These are outsiders.

31
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,871
There's nothing here in the schedules.

32
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:28,958
A last-minute change?

33
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,292
I'd have been told.

34
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,671
What if it was a military train?

35
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,465
Something the government
wouldn't want us to know about?

36
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,759
Wouldn't be the first time.

37
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,011
Blasted Feds and their secrets.

38
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:54,775
You know, when I saw
those army commercials on TV,

39
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,445
they never said anything
about guarding no plague.

40
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,114
Who'd want to steal
a can of germs, anyway?

41
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,073
Huh?

42
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,463
That's got to do it.

43
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,691
Red Claw, watch out!

44
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,318
Red Claw, a woman?

45
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,863
Do you have a problem with that?

46
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,698
Not at all.

47
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:07,908
I'm an equal-opportunity crime fighter.

48
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,410
Stay back, Batman!

49
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,996
I hold the ultimate equalizer.

50
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:15,416
This plague kills indiscriminately.

51
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,667
You'll die, too.

52
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:20,337
Along with everyone else
within a 10-mile radius.

53
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,339
Can you risk it, Batman?

54
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,092
Go on, call my bluff.

55
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,971
You've finally met your match, Batman.

56
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,807
Not surprising it's a woman.

57
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,437
Yes, General, but if you'd warned us
about this shipment

58
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,771
we might've had a chance.

59
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,524
So, what do I do now,

60
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,443
evacuate 10 million people?

61
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:44,987
Maybe we can set up camp
around the Pentagon.

62
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,198
Listen, General, I'll call you back.

63
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,370
Gordon here.

64
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,997
Batman.

65
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,123
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

66
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,791
Have you heard from Red Claw?

67
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,460
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

68
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:03,422
<i>We've got 24 hours to come up
with $1 billion in gold bullion,</i>

69
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,799
<i>or she'll release the plague on Gotham.</i>

70
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,970
<i>To think, all this time
the Feds have been looking for a man.</i>

71
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:13,557
Lately I'm learning
never to underestimate the opposite sex.

72
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,892
I'll be in touch.

73
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,487
Bruce and Selina go to lunch, take two.

74
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,823
I can't tell you how much I've been
looking forward to seeing you again.

75
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,243
Well, this time, I promise
a much more exciting date

76
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,328
than our last one.

77
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,168
Hey.

78
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,003
This time you seem preoccupied.

79
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,339
Sorry.

80
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,091
An unexpected crisis.

81
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,384
You, on the other hand,

82
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,678
look like the cat
who swallowed the canary.

83
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,848
Things are going very well
on the mountain lion front.

84
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,101
I may get that land from Multigon yet.

85
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:58,435
Really?

86
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,270
What did you find out?

87
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,356
Let's just say, they plan on playing

88
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,608
more than shuffleboard
up at their resort.

89
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:06,944
What in...

90
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:09,613
Watch out!

91
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:12,282
An old boyfriend?

92
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,203
Here go your nine lives, kitty-cat.

93
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,648
- Busy fellow.
- What?

94
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:47,317
Nothing. Hang on.

95
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,222
Brace yourself.

96
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:42,017
Where'd you learn to drive like that?

97
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,292
Oh, I've been going
to the Paris Grand Prix for years.

98
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,626
You know, one of these days,
I think I'll enter it.

99
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,180
Well, you did

100
00:09:58,263 --> 00:09:59,908
promise me an exciting time.

101
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,684
It's not every date
where I get to fill out police reports.

102
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,561
Thanks for seeing me up.

103
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:07,272
Just wanted to be sure
they didn't try anything else.

104
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:10,859
What makes you think
they weren't after you?

105
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,319
A nice guy like me?

106
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:17,699
Good night, Bruce.

107
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,119
Selina, if you're
in some kind of trouble,

108
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,203
I wish you'd tell me.

109
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:22,871
Perhaps I can help.

110
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,833
I really care about you.

111
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,044
I haven't felt this way
in a long, long time.

112
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,796
Thanks, Bruce.

113
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,216
But I've never been able
to play the damsel in distress.

114
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,510
I'll be okay. Don't worry.

115
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,564
But, why would someone
at Multigon try to kill you?

116
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,834
Ten to one, it has to do
with those bunkers

117
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,151
under their resort site.

118
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:01,285
I think it's time I do some digging.

119
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:05,998
Not this time, Isis.

120
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,709
I'm afraid where I'm going,
they don't allow pets.

121
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,272
It's not that I question
your instincts, sir,

122
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,841
but why would Red Claw
wish to harm Ms. Kyle?

123
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,426
Why, indeed.

124
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,263
But somehow,
Selina has crossed Red Claw's path,

125
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:23,307
and I mean to find out where.

126
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,729
What an unusual color.

127
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,689
Ms. Kyle's, I presume.

128
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:40,449
No. It's a cat hair.

129
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,994
Curious, never seen one
quite that color.

130
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,497
Batman has.

131
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:55,399
Get away!

132
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,407
Huh?

133
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,439
I won't hurt you.

134
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:38,525
Red Claw is after you and Catwoman.

135
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:42,070
Catwoman? What are you talking about?

136
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:44,406
Maven, you must tell me
where she's gone.

137
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:45,907
These people are killers.

138
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,246
The Multigon site.

139
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,166
You're not safe here anymore.

140
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,917
Is there somewhere you can hide?

141
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,420
Well, I guess I could go...

142
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,213
Shh. Go quickly.

143
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,593
As long as you know who she is,
you should know how she feels.

144
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,720
She's in love with you.

145
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,044
This ought to keep you out of my hair.

146
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:14,788
These will certainly
enhance the resort's brochure.

147
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,754
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

148
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,886
I didn't think you cared.

149
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,971
Come on!

150
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,974
You've got to get out of here.

151
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,268
Me? What about you?

152
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,978
There's something I have to pick up.

153
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,276
Welcome to my little resort.

154
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,573
Plan on a short stay.

155
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,755
It's never dull, is it, Batman?

156
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:07,883
You may be surprised to know

157
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:11,303
these accommodations
are courtesy of your government.

158
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,892
They built this top-secret facility
to shelter high officials

159
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,311
in case of a nuclear incident.

160
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,648
Since you wanted
the plague so badly, Batman,

161
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,319
we've decided to give it to you.

162
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,824
What will you use to blackmail Gotham
if you waste it on us?

163
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,161
Why risk carrying such deadly contents,

164
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:38,330
when a placebo will do?

165
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,709
By the time they realize
the vial is a fake,

166
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,671
we'll be miles away
with their billion dollars.

167
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,259
The acid should eat through
in a matter of minutes.

168
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,263
Sound evacuation,
and begin sealing the compound.

169
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:59,518
We wouldn't want the plague
to harm the precious wildlife,

170
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:01,686
just the vermin in here.

171
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,360
Ugh. Would I like to
get my claws into them.

172
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,196
If I could just get some slack...

173
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,783
What this situation needs
is a woman's touch.

174
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,051
What a team.

175
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:34,886
Come on!

176
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:47,399
You've got to get out of here.

177
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,067
Not without you.

178
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,986
I'll be right behind you.

179
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,238
But first,
I've got to destroy the plague.

180
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,906
Now go!

181
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,744
Please.

182
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,931
Batman.

183
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,483
<i>This is
Police Commissioner Gordon.</i>

184
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,610
<i>You're completely surrounded.</i>

185
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,195
<i>Give yourselves up.</i>

186
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,619
Right where Batman said they'd be.

187
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:07,414
Looks like this resort is folding.

188
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:11,292
So are you.

189
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,671
For years, I've fought
to build my network.

190
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,300
I brought countries to their knees.

191
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:25,890
You will pay, pussycat.

192
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:33,440
You will learn
why everyone fears Red Claw.

193
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,286
Thank you, friend.

194
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,377
Something for you to remember me by.

195
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:56,004
Hmm.

196
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,386
Batman, where's the virus?

197
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,722
It went up in smoke,

198
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,724
with Red Claw's future.

199
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,060
I should've known you'd have it all
wrapped up before we got here.

200
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:14,355
Almost.

201
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,906
Maven?

202
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,034
Maven?

203
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,911
She's gone.

204
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,747
The terrorists were after both of you.

205
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,543
Have you told the police
you found your cat burglar?

206
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:37,253
Not yet.

207
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,588
Why not?

208
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:41,925
I didn't want you taken away
like a common criminal.

209
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,260
So, you do care.

210
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,559
More than you will ever know.
