1
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,792
<i>Harvey.</i>

2
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,919
<i>Harvey Dent.</i>

3
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,505
No! Keep away!

4
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,841
Leave me alone!

5
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,721
<i>Where are you going, Harvey?</i>

6
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,015
<i>You can't get away from me.</i>

7
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,684
<i>See what I mean?</i>

8
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,769
Stay away.
I want no part of you.

9
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,571
No.

10
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,369
Stop it!
Stop it, I said.

11
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,747
It's time, Harvey.

12
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,082
It's time.

13
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,547
No!

14
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:15,509
It's time, Harvey.

15
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,011
It's time.

16
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,347
Oh, Carlos.

17
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,223
It's you.

18
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:23,351
- Are you okay, Harvey?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:24,769
I must've fallen asleep.

20
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,438
I had a bad dream.

21
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,774
Well, you better wake up.

22
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,068
Gordon called.
They started the raid.

23
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:34,987
Let's go.

24
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,955
<i>This is Police Commissioner Gordon.</i>

25
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:47,166
<i>We have you surrounded.</i>

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,960
<i>Come out with your hands up,
and no one will get hurt.</i>

27
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,213
Count hard, Gordon!

28
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:54,840
Hey, Jim. How's it going?

29
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,094
Could be better.

30
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,179
Sir, the SWAT team is in place.

31
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,724
All right,
but wait for my order.

32
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:08,354
This oughta blow a hole
in their little barricade.

33
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,356
Help me get it up to the window.

34
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,547
Hey!
They're starting to move.

35
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,195
Let 'em try.

36
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:18,197
There ain't nobody
that can get in here alive.

37
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:29,333
Uh...

38
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,793
Oh, Frankie.

39
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:33,087
All units, stand by.

40
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,297
Get ready.

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,882
Set...

42
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:44,765
Hold your fire.

43
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,226
- It's him!
- It's him! Watch out!

44
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,865
What's going on in there?

45
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,868
Looks like they've got
a case of bat infestation.

46
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:07,329
- We give up.
- Let us out.

47
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,540
- Help.
- Get me out of here.

48
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,423
As your District Attorney,
I would like to commend

49
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:20,551
Commissioner Gordon
and his men for their fine work.

50
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:25,723
And thank you.

51
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,642
Mr. Dent, is it true that you were
the one who planned this raid?

52
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,937
Yes, and I'm glad to say
that another one of Rupert Thorne's

53
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,814
criminal rings has now been broken.

54
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:37,443
As I stated in my re-election campaign,

55
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,488
I will not rest until Gotham City

56
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,282
has been de-Thorned
once and for all.

57
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,535
You talk big, pretty boy.

58
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,288
But you ain't gonna be
when Mr. Thorne gets through with you.

59
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:56,337
He chews up and spits out
creeps like you for breakfast.

60
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,380
All right.
That's enough out of you.

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,641
Hey!

62
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,229
You little weasel,
I'll tear you apart.

63
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,065
Help! Get him off.
He's crazy.

64
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:17,566
Someone get him off me.

65
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,109
Hey, give me some help here.

66
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,695
Kick mud in my face, will ya?

67
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,072
Help!

68
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,991
Harvey!

69
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,493
Get a hold of yourself.

70
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,329
Jim, I...

71
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,665
I...

72
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,713
Come on.
You don't need this kind of publicity.

73
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,674
The guy's a maniac.

74
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,551
He's the one
who should be going to jail.

75
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,864
What in the name of heaven
did you think you were doing?

76
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,265
I don't know.

77
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,976
I guess
he just pressed the right button.

78
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:54,520
That's one heck of a button.

79
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,857
<i>Well, it was
another wild night in East Gotham.</i>

80
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,317
<i>As police intercepted
an arm shipment</i>

81
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,319
<i>which District Attorney Harvey Dent</i>

82
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,238
<i>is trying to connect
to Rupert Thorne.</i>

83
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,116
Hey, nice tie, boss.

84
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,702
<i>Unfortunately, Handsome Harvey</i>

85
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,287
<i>earned a new nickname tonight,</i>

86
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,373
<i>"Hot-head Harvey"
when he attacked one of the suspects.</i>

87
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,584
<i>Get him off.
He's crazy.</i>

88
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,545
My, this guy is crazy.

89
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,089
Yeah, crazy like a fox.

90
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:25,843
That little tantrum probably bought him
another 10,000 votes.

91
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,803
So, how about we see

92
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,847
how far he can swim
in a cement suit?

93
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,308
And bring the heat down on us even more?

94
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,684
Uh-uh.

95
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,103
I want this one in my pocket, boys.

96
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,857
We need to dig up some dirt
on our dashing DA.

97
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,942
Something really juicy.

98
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:44,737
Well, I'm afraid
that's going to be a problem.

99
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:47,239
Dent's so clean, he squeaks.

100
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,117
Just stay on his tail, Candice.

101
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,119
All men have something to hide.

102
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,288
The brighter the picture,

103
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:56,123
the darker the negative.

104
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:14,934
If we want to make this city
safe again,

105
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,603
then we have to come down
hard on these criminals.

106
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,730
I will not see
the people of Gotham...

107
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,775
Bruce, it was so nice of you
to sponsor this fundraiser for Harvey.

108
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,069
Well, Harvey and I go way back.

109
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:26,445
He's a great DA.

110
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,905
And an even better friend.

111
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,075
Though lately,
he seems awfully intense.

112
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,744
Is he all right, Grace?

113
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,245
That incident on TV...

114
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,749
I think the pressures of the campaign
get to him sometimes, that's all.

115
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,626
Yeah, I guess so.

116
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,545
Lately, he doesn't seem himself.

117
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,173
Oh, Mr. Dent, I want you to know

118
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:48,550
that I voted for you two times.

119
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,887
Well, ma'am, I trust it was
in two separate elections.

120
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,266
Mr. Dent, I have a question.

121
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,810
When are you going to marry

122
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,145
that gorgeous fiancée of yours?

123
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,025
Better marry her soon, Harv,

124
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,152
or I just might steal her away myself.

125
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,488
You do and I'll prosecute.

126
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,021
Harvey, you better look at this.

127
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,155
The judge just threw out the case
against Thorne's men.

128
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,040
But... But why?

129
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,939
The warrant wasn't complete.

130
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,460
The judge said
he had no choice.

131
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,962
He had to let them go.

132
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,339
Had to? But... But...

133
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:29,925
No!

134
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,386
I spent three months on that raid.

135
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,014
He can't overturn.
The fool.

136
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,974
He's been bought.

137
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,642
Like all the rest!

138
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,399
Harv, take it easy.

139
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,345
This kind of behavior
doesn't go over well with the voters.

140
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,030
Let go of me, you rich twit.

141
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,991
Harvey?

142
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,536
Grace? Bruce?

143
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:00,122
I'm sorry.
I don't know what...

144
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,915
Excuse me.

145
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:16,393
I just flew off the handle,
that's all.

146
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:18,640
Don't worry.
I've got it under control.

147
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:22,227
Harvey, you didn't just lose
your temper out there.

148
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,563
You were like another person.

149
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,356
I said I was sorry.

150
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:28,025
Maybe you should get some help.

151
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,651
He already is.

152
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,903
Grace.

153
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,488
Darling, Bruce is your friend.

154
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,448
Don't be embarrassed.

155
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,450
Lots of people
see psychiatrists, Harv.

156
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,297
Not when they're
running for public office.

157
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:41,121
You know how some voters
feel about shrinks.

158
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,457
Well, I for one, am proud of you

159
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:44,833
and relieved.

160
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,336
It takes a strong man
to admit when he has a problem.

161
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,172
Yeah, yeah,
just keep it under your hat, okay?

162
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,799
Don't worry.

163
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:53,592
If there's anything I know,

164
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,010
it's how to keep a secret.

165
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,648
You are now in a deep sleep.

166
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,525
Can you hear me?

167
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:10,734
Mmm-hmm.

168
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,741
Good. Now, Harvey,

169
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,911
I would like to speak
with your other personality.

170
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:24,081
I would like to talk
with Big Bad Harv.

171
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,085
I don't think he wants to talk.

172
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,796
He must
if we are to help you.

173
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,256
Please try.

174
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,693
Big Bad Harv?

175
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:54,319
Speaking.

176
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:58,699
It appears you and Harvey
are having trouble again.

177
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,450
The guy's a wimp.

178
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,287
Well, Harvey has special problems.

179
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:04,997
When he was young,

180
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:08,250
he felt very guilty
about his angry feelings.

181
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,252
So guilty,

182
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,962
that he hid them deep inside

183
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,630
until they became an illness.

184
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,008
You, Big Bad Harv,

185
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,552
represent these angry feelings.

186
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,221
Everyone feels anger

187
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:23,015
and it does no harm.

188
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:25,976
As long as it doesn't
result in bad behavior.

189
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,395
Once Harvey understands this...

190
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,441
Then maybe I'll go away, right?

191
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,984
Well...

192
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,820
I'm going nowhere, missy!

193
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,740
If anyone's leaving,
it's Mr. Goody Good.

194
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,495
And maybe you with him.

195
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,095
Did I do this?

196
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,476
Not you, but your other personality.

197
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,394
It's stronger than I suspected.

198
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,480
What am I gonna do?

199
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:13,690
I've always been able
to repress him before.

200
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,818
Harvey, I want you to admit yourself

201
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,489
to the psychiatric ward
over at County General for a few days.

202
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,324
No way, Doc.

203
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:24,094
You know I'm trying to get re-elected.

204
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,870
You're also trying
to save your sanity.

205
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,580
Isn't there any other way?

206
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,082
Please.

207
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,834
Well, I suppose if you cut back
on campaigning

208
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,962
and intensified our sessions,

209
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,213
we might be able to...

210
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,714
Great. I'll do it.

211
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,890
You just set up
the schedule and I'll be here.

212
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,303
Just so long
as we keep all of this a secret.

213
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:58,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

214
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,404
according to the latest count,

215
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,947
Harvey Dent is receiving a mandate

216
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,908
from the people of Gotham City
in the form of a landslide.

217
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,834
Now, now, let's wait
until all the returns are in.

218
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:17,337
Congratulations, Harv.

219
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,548
You're looking pretty calm
and collected.

220
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,591
I told ya I could handle myself.

221
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,844
In fact, I'm in such good spirits,

222
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,430
I might announce
a certain wedding date this evening.

223
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:29,057
Oh Harvey, do you mean it?

224
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,935
It's part of my acceptance speech.

225
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:38,650
Uh, sorry, Harv, phone call.

226
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:41,194
Hold those lips.
I'll be right back.

227
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,997
- Hello?
<i>- Congratulations, Harvey.</i>

228
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,207
<i>This is Thorne.</i>

229
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,792
<i>Rupert Thorne.</i>

230
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,170
What do you want, you slime?

231
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,797
Now, now,
is that any way to talk

232
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,175
to a man who's about to make you a deal?

233
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,636
I'm not interested
in your deals, Thorne.

234
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,764
Oh, I think you will be.

235
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,934
Unless of course,
you'd rather I speak with Big Bad Harv.

236
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:16,563
<i>Or perhaps,
you'd prefer I speak to the press first.</i>

237
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,983
- What do you want?
<i>- There's a limo waiting in the alley.</i>

238
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,693
<i>Take it</i>

239
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,779
<i>while you still have
a career ahead of ya.</i>

240
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,366
Darling, is something wrong?

241
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:28,700
No.

242
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:30,327
I have to see someone.

243
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,137
Would you mind
looking after our guests?

244
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,663
But the returns are just coming in.

245
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,714
I won't be long.
Thank you, darling.

246
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,798
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

247
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,553
Hey, Harv, what's up?

248
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,889
A surprise meeting.
That's all.

249
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,516
Now? With who?

250
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,244
Just mind your own business,
all right?

251
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,685
You're in trouble, aren't you?

252
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:58,313
My friend,
you don't know the half of it.

253
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:35,744
Stealing someone's
psychiatric file is pretty low, Thorne.

254
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,746
Even for a swine like you.

255
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:40,665
But it makes
for such fascinating reading.

256
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,751
Listen to this, boys.

257
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,003
It says here,
when Harvey was a little boy,

258
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,880
he was bothered by a bully.

259
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:49,424
Every day, the bully
would bug him after school,

260
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52,135
until one day little Harvey got so mad,

261
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,470
he slugged him one.

262
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,138
Ooh!

263
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,661
Of course,
the bully ran away,

264
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,477
which made little Harvey
feel very proud.

265
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,313
Until he heard
the bully was in the hospital.

266
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,024
That was some punch.

267
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,193
That's what Harvey thought.

268
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,655
Except the guy
was in the hospital for appendicitis.

269
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,158
But poor Harvey felt so guilty,

270
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,536
he never showed his anger again.

271
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:19,746
And that was the start of...

272
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,040
Big... Bad... Harv.

273
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,502
What do you want?

274
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,588
Just a few favors
from the DA's office.

275
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,382
You're dreaming.

276
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,592
Otherwise, as a concerned citizen,

277
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:35,095
I'd feel compelled
to give this to the press.

278
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,722
After all, the people of Gotham
have a right to know

279
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,057
the kind of person...

280
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,519
Or should I say
"persons" they've elected.

281
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:57,701
So, what do you say, Harvey?

282
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,327
Do we have a deal?

283
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:06,251
There's just one problem.

284
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,752
What's that?

285
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,922
You're talking to the wrong Harvey.

286
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,349
Get off of me.

287
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:24,936
No, Dent!

288
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:26,855
Let's get out of here.

289
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,732
Get away from me!

290
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,734
Thorne is mine.

291
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:32,902
Get them.

292
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,156
- Come on, let's get him.
- I got him.

293
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:02,849
Wild.

294
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,281
Give me that file.

295
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,330
I'll get him!

296
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,539
Look out, Dent.

297
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,678
Harvey!

298
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,606
Harvey.

299
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:53,983
No.

300
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,489
Doctor,
will he be all right?

301
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,158
He'll pull through.

302
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,411
He's lucky
Batman got him here so quickly.

303
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:05,991
What about his face?

304
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,664
That's a different matter.

305
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,041
A good plastic surgeon should be able

306
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,960
to repair most of the physical scars.

307
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,130
I'm more worried about the mental scars.

308
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,432
Looks like Dent's
finally out of your hair.

309
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,434
I wish I could be sure of that.

310
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,822
Now, you understand
there's going to be some scarring.

311
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:43,658
But I've already scheduled a surgery.

312
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,919
Give me a mirror.

313
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:56,731
Harvey, maybe you should wait until...

314
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,256
I said, give me a mirror.

315
00:20:58,631 --> 00:20:59,758
Now!

316
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,737
Harvey, what happened?

317
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,577
Harvey...

318
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,210
Goodbye, Grace.
