175
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,876
Let the earth tremble!

176
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:45,063
Let mortals know
the gods of old live again!

177
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,740
It's over, Maxie.

178
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,910
Alexander, destroy the bat demon.

179
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:03,582
- But, boss, maybe we shouldn't...
- Traitors! My harpies, awake.

180
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,459
Destroy all who oppose me!

181

(GROANING)

184
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,197
Ah.

185
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,532
Thank you, Bat... Look out!

186
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,243
Begone, thou foul bat demon!

187
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,125
Get thee back to the underworld
where thee belongs!

188
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,380
Such is the fate of all
who dare to thwart the gods.

189
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,902
Oh, no.

190
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,539
It's going to fire!

191
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,751
No!

192
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:13,712
That's mine!

(GASPS)

194
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,392
Maxie, no!

195
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,232
Get down!

196
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:43,116
(MAX SCREAMING)

197
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,216
Now, this is truly Olympus.

198
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,677
Surely, it can be no other place.

199
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,390
There's beautiful Demeter,
goddess of the harvest.

200
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:15,106
And double-faced Janus,
lord of beginnings and endings.

201
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,073
And merry Hermes,
the trickster of the gods.

202
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,544
Now at last, mighty Zeus is home.
