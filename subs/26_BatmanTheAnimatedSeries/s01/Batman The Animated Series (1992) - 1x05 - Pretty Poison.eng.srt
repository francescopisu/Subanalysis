1
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,552
My fellow citizens,

2
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:37,888
it is with great civic pride
that we gather here today

3
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,142
to break ground
on the new Gotham penitentiary,

4
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,728
which is been funded
by the Wayne Foundation.

5
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:48,357
As you know,
this project was the dream of one man.

6
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,152
And he's with us here today.

7
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:54,989
Gotham's new District Attorney,
Harvey Dent.

8
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:02,038
From this field of weeds and
wild flowers will grow a new institution

9
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,415
to build a better, safer Gotham.

10
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,634
Go! Go! Go!

11
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:10,898
This is Gordon. What?

12
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:14,318
We've got a prison break by air.

13
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,112
The chopper's heading this way.

14
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,135
We're home free.

15
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,020
Whoa! What was that?

16
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,188
Just some turbulence.

17
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:16,297
Thank you, Andre.

18
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,715
I'm starving. Let's eat.

19
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,929
Shouldn't we wait for your friend?

20
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,475
Bruce? Nah. He's always late.
He probably got hung up on business.

21
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,493
What happened?

22
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,583
I hear he's rich.

23
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,003
Yeah, Bruce runs around
with a high-class crowd.

24
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,399
But he still manages to get his kicks.

25
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,989
There's nothing
we don't know about each other.

26
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:27,618
Who... Who are you?

27
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:30,037
I'm your worst nightmare.

28
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,875
This is the police! Nobody move!

29
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,589
I think you'll like him.

30
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,424
If he's your friend, I know I will.

31
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,010
Big wings.

32
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:48,389
Yeah, yeah, big wings.
Move it along, pal.

33
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,310
Alfred, I'm running
a little behind schedule.

34
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,271
<i>I have alerted Mr. Dent, sir.</i>

35
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,858
<i>He and Miss Isley patiently await
your arrival at the Rose Cafe.</i>

36
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:00,943
How's the food there?

37
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,696
<i>In my humble opinion, sir, exquisite.</i>

38
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,874
I'll be taking the Cord this evening.

39
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,750
As I anticipated, sir.

40
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,712
It is idling out front
with a full tank of gas.

41
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,882
May I recommend
the Trout Amandine?

42
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,009
I'll give it a try, Alfred.

43
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,969
Wise decision, sir.

44
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:28,137
Bon appetit.

45
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,767
You should've seen Harvey's face.

46
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,607
Oh, look at the time. I have to run.

47
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,233
So soon?

48
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,570
I'm sorry. I have an early meeting
tomorrow. But you stay.

49
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,323
- No.
- I insist.

50
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,491
Spend some time with your crazy friend.

51
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:53,829
And call me the minute you get home,
Mr. District Attorney.

52
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,719
I'll call you.

53
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,220
Good.

54
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,681
- Nice meeting you, Bruce.
- Same here.

55
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:15,577
Well, I've been talking to my broker,
and his recommendation was that...

56
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,936
Ooh.

57
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,609
- So what do you think?
- Does she have a sister?

58
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,820
Nope. Pam's one of a kind.

59
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,822
That's why I asked her to marry me.

60
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,283
What?

61
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,702
Yup. That's the Page 1 headline.

62
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,872
Is it getting warm in here?

63
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,708
You're still flushed
from that last kiss.

64
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,294
Harvey, you just met her last week.

65
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:45,005
And I already know she's the one.

66
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,799
Gosh, it's hot in here.

67
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,343
Marriage is a major step, Harv.

68
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:52,179
- Don't you think you're rushing it?
- No way.

69
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:56,183
The moment I laid eyes on Pam,
love hit me right in the face.

70
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:04,024
Harv, you've lost your mind.

71
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,485
Knock it off.

72
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,570
Harv? Harvey?

73
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,703
Hang on, Harvey. Hang on.

74
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,778
- He's not breathing.
- What's the blood pressure?

75
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,303
Isn't that the District Attorney?

76
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,782
- Get his blood pressure, stat.
- Get the EKG

77
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,225
and move him into OR,
ICU Number 3, stat.

78
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,687
Do we have a pulse?
We need a pulse here.

79
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:47,776
Get the EKG and move him
into the OR, ICU Number 3, stat.

80
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:54,450
This is Gordon. What?

81
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,370
Harvey Dent's in a coma
at the medical center. Move out.

82
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,401
So, what's the story, Doctor?
Heart attack?

83
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,113
No, Commissioner.
Mr. Dent has been poisoned.

84
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:37,785
For criminy sakes.
Bullock, get down to that restaurant.

85
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:41,205
- What's it called, Wayne?
- Uh, the Rose Cafe.

86
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,666
The Rose Cafe.
And find out who did this.

87
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,085
With pleasure.

88
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,129
I want police guards
on duty here around the clock.

89
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,547
Yes, sir.

90
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,094
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.</i>

91
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:00,224
<i>Dr. Kravitz...</i>

92
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:04,144
Excuse me, Doctor. Are we talking
about food poisoning here?

93
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,270
I doubt it.

94
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,232
This is the most virulent strain
of poison I've ever come across.

95
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:10,275
We're doing everything we can,
Mr. Wayne.

96
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:12,194
Is Harvey going to make it?

97
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:14,238
The poison is racing through his system.

98
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:18,283
If he's going to make it,
we need to find the antidote, and fast.

99
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,389
So what'd you put in this mousse?

100
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,767
Chocolate, sugar, eggs, cream...

101
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,978
Strychnine?

102
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,813
No, no, no. No strychnine.

103
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,774
But I added just a pinch of vanilla.

104
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,527
You know who did it? Talk!

105
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,321
Hey, I just clean the dishes, okay?

106
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,662
We've isolated the toxin, Alfred.

107
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,041
Indeed we have, sir.

108
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:13,130
It is a lethal poison derived
from the plant <i>Rosaceae Vularis,</i>

109
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:16,425
commonly known as the wild thorny rose.

110
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,428
I'll get a plant sample
from the Gotham Botanical Gardens.

111
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,930
We can use it to work up an antidote.

112
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:25,684
- I'm afraid this is unfeasible.
- Why?

113
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:30,272
Because, sir, the wild thorny rose
has been extinct for nearly five years.

114
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,984
- Which means, I'm afraid...
- There's no antidote.

115
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,714
Fight, Harvey, fight.

116
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,637
Oh, Bruce, I came
as soon as I got your call.

117
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,181
- How is he?
- We're not sure.

118
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:08,852
- I want to see him.
- Sorry, ma'am, no visitors.

119
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,604
Commissioner Gordon's orders.

120
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:20,072
You should try to get some sleep.
Come on, I'll walk you to your car.

121
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,747
Promise to call me
if there's any change?

122
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,458
I will. You get some rest.

123
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,503
Harvey's lucky to have
such a good friend.

124
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,178
- Goodnight, Bruce.
- Goodnight, Pam.

125
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:56,650
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

126
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,569
Alfred, dig up anything you can
on Pamela Isley.

127
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,698
Who she is, where she's been,
what she does... The works.

128
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,366
<i>Consider it done, sir.</i>

129
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:12,958
What do you have, Alfred?

130
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,544
Well, sir, Miss Isley
is a research chemist

131
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,380
with Chez Gerard, the cosmetics firm.

132
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,675
She works on the development
of new fragrances.

133
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,262
Their newest
is a perfume called Nightshade.

134
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,306
<i>It's deadly.</i>

135
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:31,810
Miss Isley has a PhD in botany
from Gotham University,

136
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,730
where she offers
a monthly lecture series

137
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,566
on endangered and extinct plant species.

138
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:42,112
I think Harvey's engagement is off.

139
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:35,374
Oh, you've done so well today,
sweetheart.

140
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,292
Now get some rest.

141
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,922
And don't worry, I won't clip off
any more of your beautiful petals

142
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,840
unless I need them.

143
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:32,222
Huh?

144
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:04,087
What has my sweet little flytrap
caught this time?

145
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,478
Um, a little big for a fly.

146
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:34,951
Batman.

147
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,872
A late night rendezvous?
To what do I owe the honor?

148
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:41,041
Harvey Dent.

149
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,127
Oh, the poor District Attorney.

150
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,880
I hear he's not expected to live.

151
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,549
Oh, it's so sad.

152
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,973
Why, Isley?

153
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,602
Oh, please, call me Poison Ivy.

154
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,856
You see,
Harvey had to pay for his crime.

155
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,691
What crime?

156
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,402
Why, murder, of course.

157
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,322
Plowing up a field
of beautiful wild flowers

158
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,783
for that silly penitentiary of his.

159
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:19,538
This little rose would be extinct today,
if I hadn't saved my precious

160
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,831
from those horrible bulldozers.

161
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,211
The blood of those flowers
are on his hands.

162
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,384
Uh...

163
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:33,760
Hmm.

164
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,137
So his fate was sealed...

165
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,227
With a kiss.

166
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,271
And now,

167
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,273
so is yours.

168
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:02,539
Oh, what's wrong? Afraid I have cooties?

169
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:05,917
Oh...

170
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,712
Now you've gone and hurt my feelings.

171
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,716
Too bad. I was going to share
the antidote with you.

172
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:17,429
Lovely fragrance, don't you think?

173
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,059
I call it "Rose From the Dead."

174
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:50,503
No!

175
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,432
Murderer!

176
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,931
No!

177
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:17,841
Huh?

178
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:25,640
Enjoy extinction, Batman.

179
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,851
I'm not going alone.

180
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:30,895
No!

181
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:33,982
The bottle for the weed.

182
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,401
What's it going to be?

183
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:41,406
My baby.

184
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,575
My precious baby!

185
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,668
My pretty baby.

186
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,387
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.

187
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,765
Why? What happened?

188
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,059
You passed out
into your chocolate mousse.

189
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,020
But you're going to be fine.

190
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:15,523
Now, Harv, about your engagement
to Pamela Isley...

191
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,734
- We're good friends, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

192
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:19,611
I have to be honest with you,
don't I?

193
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,154
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay, then...

194
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:23,281
I think Pam is wrong for you.

195
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:24,449
Huh?

196
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:37,420
They can bury me in the ground
as deep as they like.

197
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:40,423
But I'll grow back.

198
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,467
We always grow back.

199
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:44,969
Don't we, baby?
