1
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,189
Without a doubt, this will
be one of the best museum exhibitions

2
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,233
Gotham City has ever seen.

3
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,444
You can be quite the humanitarian
on occasion, Bruce.

4
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:18,698
It's commendable. It's inspiring.

5
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,701
- It's deductible.
- The Scroll of Osiris.

6
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:23,953
Pity only half of it exists.

7
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,164
It's the oldest Egyptian document
known to man.

8
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,333
Yeah.

9
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,503
Oops!
I gotta go meet Tammy at Charday's.

10
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,423
Hmm. Such a pity.

11
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,130
Now, let's have a look at you.

12
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:18,966
Ubu?

13
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:22,178
You could've been
my successor, Detective.

14
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,348
Instead, you will suffer the fate
of all mortal flesh.

15
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,062
Snake venom?

16
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:16,732
From an Egyptian cobra.
Extremely deadly.

17
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,277
- You're certain it was Ra's Al Ghul?
- None other.

18
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,655
But I thought he died
in the Pit months ago.

19
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,281
So did I.

20
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,535
That piece of papyrus is obviously
very important to him.

21
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,704
- I have to find out why.
- Where are you off to now?

22
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,373
Just in case the stockholders ask.

23
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,126
Gibraltar. There's someone
I've been meaning to look up.

24
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:48,824
Beloved?

25
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,376
My father? Alive?

26
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,463
It was dear old dad, no mistake.

27
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,550
No, he would have found me.
He would have told me he was alive.

28
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,511
I know the face of my most
powerful enemy, Talia.

29
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,389
He took quite a risk
stealing that scroll from me.

30
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,016
Why does he want it so badly?

31
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,726
It's part of a map.

32
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,978
My father has the other half.

33
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,107
As long as I can remember
he's been obsessed with finding...

34
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,484
Finding what?

35
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,111
The tomb of the ancient
queen Thoth Khepera.

36
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,948
It lies somewhere
in the Canyon of Tombs.

37
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,075
Many who've sought it have vanished.

38
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,618
And why does Ra's seek it?

39
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,203
I don't know.

40
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:35,788
You must believe me.

41
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,958
I have to go after him, Talia.
Will you help me?

42
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:43,295
You are so like him,
making me choose between the two of you.

43
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,006
Oh, beloved, why has he forsaken me?

44
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,841
Does he think I've betrayed him?

45
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,386
I can't pretend to know
what Ra's thinks, Talia.

46
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,182
The only thing he and I have ever
agreed upon is our feelings towards you.

47
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,442
My father used to have
a hidden sanctuary in Cairo.

48
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,445
- Perhaps he still uses it.
- It's worth a try.

49
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,794
Artifacts from the king's tomb.

50
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,754
- Every one's a valuable treasure.
- In here.

51
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:28,757
- This place looks familiar.
- Guaranteed authentic.

52
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:36,265
How may I help you?

53
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,599
We're just browsing.

54
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,353
You could find no finer place
than this establishment

55
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,815
in which to obtain wondrous bargains.

56
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,608
This, for example,

57
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:49,903
a priceless relic
from the Seventh Dynasty.

58
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,530
The only one of its kind.

59
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:55,826
Another time, perhaps.

60
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,870
Hmm.

61
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,540
This is the place. I'm sure of it.

62
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,876
There's a secret entrance
to a lower level,

63
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,335
but I don't remember where.

64
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,795
This might help us.

65
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,564
An ultrasound imager.

66
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,016
Eureka.

67
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,782
This part of the store
is closed to customers.

68
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,647
- We make a good team.
- That we do.

69
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,540
The completed scroll?

70
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,042
Yes,
and a translation made by Ra's.

71
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:31,046
Did you really think
I would be foolish enough

72
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,007
not to have this sanctum
under observation?

73
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,930
Father! You really are alive.

74
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,932
Yes, Talia, I am alive.

75
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:46,854
No thanks, I regret to say, are due you
for my current state of health.

76
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,648
No, Father, you can't believe that.

77
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:52,234
I only tried to save the man I love.

78
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:54,945
You've got a serious
priority problem, Ra's.

79
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,991
What can be in that tomb that's more
valuable than the love of your daughter?

80
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,034
Power, Detective.

81
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,165
The power once held by almighty
Thoth Khepera, queen of two continents.

82
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,333
You surprise me, Ra's.

83
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,295
The world's oldest chauvinist
chasing after a woman?

84
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:15,048
Thoth Khepera
was not simply a woman, Detective,

85
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,925
nor merely a ruler.

86
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:20,179
Through her flowed
the power of the gods.

87
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,680
With no more than a gesture,

88
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:24,141
she controlled
the force of life and death,

89
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:29,313
and with it she kept a nation
under her thumb for 1,000 years.

90
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,357
You sound like a bad
Saturday afternoon serial, Ra's.

91
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,360
- This is sheer nonsense.
- No, Detective.

92
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,654
I know there is a power there
to be tapped.

93
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:40,949
My 600 years of life
are proof of that power.

94
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,705
Farewell, Detective.

95
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,457
Farewell, Talia.

96
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,294
It is said that one finds immortality
in one's offspring.

97
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:55,589
Alas, I know that to be a lie.

98
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,647
The air won't last much longer.

99
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,191
It's not the end
I would've chosen, beloved,

100
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,027
but if we must die,
I am glad we're together.

101
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,612
We're not licked yet.

102
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,877
Cover your ears, Talia, and pray.

103
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,396
Talia, I'll do whatever I have to
to stop him.

104
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,189
You must know that.

105
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,900
I do. And though it breaks my heart,

106
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,194
I will do what I must as well.

107
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,595
No sign of Ra's.
Looks like we beat him here.

108
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:29,850
- How did you know where to find it?
- I saw the scroll's translation.

109
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:31,184
For only a moment.

110
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,437
I'm a quick study.

111
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,668
The queen's sarcophagus.

112
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:59,296
It's not what it seems, Detective.

113
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:00,756
Father!

114
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,468
That chest contains
more than a mummy's corpse.

115
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:07,679
Remember, Thoth Khepera was immortal.

116
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,973
Her subjects deified her,

117
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:14,186
named her after the ancient gods
of infinite knowledge and eternal life.

118
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,104
And in a few short moments

119
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:21,526
I will be privy to those same secrets
of life and death.

120
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,008
No.

121
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,928
No!

122
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,133
Who are you?

123
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,802
I am Thoth Khepera.

124
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,890
Those who have joined me
share their knowledge with me.

125
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,892
We are legion.

126
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:19,811
I am called Ra's Al Ghul.

127
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:24,149
I have searched for you
for over 500 years.

128
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,526
Tell me your secret.

129
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:31,531
Grant me the powers of the gods
that legend says you possessed.

130
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,368
That knowledge can be yours
if you join us.

131
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,336
Come forward, Ra's Al Ghul.

132
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:48,632
Come and know the mysteries
of life and death.

133
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,777
Father.

134
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,910
No!

135
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,937
None may defile me and live.

136
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,171
Talia!

137
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,290
Run!

138
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,045
Keep going and don't look back.

139
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,964
I'll do what I can to stop that thing.

140
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,891
Infidel!

141
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,842
Daughter.

142
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,343
Father.

143
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,728
My apologies to you, daughter.

144
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:35,316
Though I had abandoned you in my heart,
obviously, you have not done the same.

145
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:51,040
- What will you do now?
- Take them back to the authorities.

146
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,501
Your father has much to answer for.

147
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,716
I am truly sorry, beloved,
but he is my father.

148
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,596
Please dismount.

149
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,652
Another time, Detective.

150
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,961
Yes, another time.
