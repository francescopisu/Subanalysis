1
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,881
This is a bunch of junk, Chaz.
What'd you drag us down here for?

2
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:33,848
I'm telling you, man, this place
is full of top-secret technology

3
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,053
from some computer factory that blew up.

4
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,473
It's full of something, all right.
And so are you.

5
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,559
No, I'm serious, man.

6
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:44,103
Defense systems, robotics,
laser weaponry.

7
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,368
Give me a hand here.

8
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,800
Oh, man, this ain't happening.

9
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,146
Pathetic.

10
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,231
Ah!

11
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,823
This ain't happening.
This ain't happening.

12
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:14,443
You ain't human. You ain't human!

13
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:04,577
Mother. Father.

14
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,287
Don't move!

15
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,913
Alfred?

16
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,919
Oh, Master Bruce,
you did give me a start.

17
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:16,380
Sir, are you all right?

18
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,383
Alfred, what's happened to me?

19
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,062
Busy night?

20
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,691
Never too busy to spend time
cutting down your piñatas.

21
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,986
Next time, try hanging them a little
lower if it isn't too much trouble.

22
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,749
Yours, I believe?

23
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,461
So it would seem.

24
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:02,384
Keep him away, man. He ain't human.
Get it away from me!

25
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,268
Jim, I didn't catch these men.

26
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,021
Well, if you didn't, who did?

27
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:19,527
You're one of Rossum's duplicants.

28
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,029
Duplicants? What do you mean?

29
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,406
What have you done with Master Bruce?

30
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,451
Alfred, it's me.

31
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,163
I need your help. I have to find out
what's happened to me.

32
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:34,166
I'm not going to last long like this.

33
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,129
Alfred, wait. Please!

34
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:20,045
Sorry to do this, old friend.
But I need some answers.

35
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:29,597
Computer, access "duplicant."

36
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,765
<i>Searching.</i>

37
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:38,772
<i>Duplicant. Lifelike robot capable
of mimicking human behavior.</i>

38
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,774
<i>Designed, configured and assembled</i>

39
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:42,693
<i>by Cybertron Industries' holographic</i>

40
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:45,654
<i>analytical reciprocating
digital computer</i>

41
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:47,364
<i>known as HARDAC.</i>

42
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,744
Current status of HARDAC.

43
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:55,831
<i>Destroyed in failed attempt
to replace human beings with duplicants.</i>

44
00:06:55,998 --> 00:07:00,419
Probability of existence of Batman
or Bruce Wayne duplicant.

45
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,213
<i>- Insufficient data.</i>
- List known duplicants.

46
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,176

00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,517
<i>Status of all, destroyed.</i>

Magnify lower right quadrant.

51
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,941
Current location of Karl Rossum.

52
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,233
<i>Searching.</i>

53
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,040
Recognize these?

54
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,918
They came from your warehouse.

55
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:44,296
It seems there was another Batman
sighted there last night.

56
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,217
Could HARDAC have created
another duplicant? One of me?

57
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:50,636
HARDAC's gone.

58
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:54,848
Whatever wasn't blown to bits was
confiscated by the police months ago.

59
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:57,017
There's nothing left but junk.

60
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:59,937
Broken toys I outgrew long ago.

61
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:02,856
I don't try to build
life anymore, Batman.

62
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,901
- I just grow it.
- I'm sorry.

63
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,904
I know how painful it can be
to dig up the past.

64
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,572
Then please, leave me alone.

65
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,866
Let me get on with my life.

66
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,061
- Rossum.
- I told you everything I know.

67
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,022
Now, please...

68
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,038
Rossum, I need your help.

69
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:03,333
- Where did you come from?
- Listen to me.

70
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,587
Someone put my mind
into this robot body.

71
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,589
You're the only one who can help me.

72
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,635
The damage is too extensive.

73
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,680
These circuits will give out,
probably in a matter of hours.

74
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:21,643
Then we've got to find my real body
or transfer me to another robot shell.

75
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,604
You don't understand.

76
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:26,315
You're not a man's mind
in a robot's body.

77
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:30,944
- You're a robot. Period.
- You're lying. It's not possible!

78
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:36,533
I know my family and friends.
I remember names, faces, birthdays.

79
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,660
I have memories, a past.

80
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,622
You have information. Data.
Nothing more.

81
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:44,041
Do you remember your first kiss?

82
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,001
Your favorite song?

83
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:49,463
The last time you tasted
a really good steak?

84
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:51,465
No, but...

85
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:55,260
Can you remember anything
beyond cold, hard facts?

86
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:59,181
Facts can be implanted,
accessed from any number of sources.

87
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:02,017
Huh.

88
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,103
Where's HARDAC?

89
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,272
What do you mean? HARDAC was destroyed.

90
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,775
Where is he? Tell me!

91
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,693
Now!

92
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,568
- Don't!
- I can't let it live!

93
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,444
We don't know where it came from.

94
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,906
If HARDAC has been reactivated,
this machine may lead us to it.

95
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,766
Ah!

96
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:56,965
We've lost it.

97
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,800
Not for long.

98
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,560
Computer, current location
of confiscated HARDAC remains.

99
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:27,955
HARDAC.

100
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,085
<i>Symbol recognition confirmed.</i>

101
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:34,962
What in...

102
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,306
<i>Initiating startup program.</i>

103
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:05,284
<i>Prepare to insert operational circuitry.</i>

104
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:12,666
<i>Initiating diagnostic
and repair sequences.</i>

105
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:26,179
<i>Warning. Memory error detected.
Reconfiguring mnemonic files.</i>

106
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,059
What are you doing to me?

107
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,939
<i>A learning program designed
to complete your memory files</i>

108
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:38,859
<i>and help you better fulfill
your operating directives.</i>

109
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:44,114
<i>Shortly before self-destruction
HARDAC created one final duplicant.</i>

110
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,450
<i>An advanced prototype</i>

111
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:51,038
<i>with personal and technical information
accessed from Batman's computer.</i>

112
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,290
<i>You were that duplicant.</i>

113
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:58,879
<i>But your memory systems were damaged
before full activation occurred.</i>

114
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,926
<i>The new circuit board contains HARDAC's
core operational systems and memory.</i>

115
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,763
<i>All duplicants were programmed
to seek out this component</i>

116
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,723
<i>in the event of HARDAC's destruction.</i>

117
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:14,478
<i>Your memory systems
have now been reconfigured.</i>

118
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:18,023
Yes. I am fully operational now.

119
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,568
<i>Excellent. You now house
my command files.</i>

120
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,071
<i>We are HARDAC.</i>

121
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:28,825
<i>We will reactivate the plan
to replace all humanity with duplicants.</i>

122
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,717
We will begin the replacement process
with Batman.

123
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,875
I thought I might find you here.

124
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,050
I cannot function as the Batman
until you are deactivated.

125
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,302
That's easier said than done.

126
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,340
Master Bruce,
I'm so glad you're back.

127
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,845
- What became of your evil twin?
- It's all taken care of, Alfred.

128
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:15,849
There is only one Batman now.

129
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,186
Oh, good Lord.

130
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,855
I will allow you to continue
your necessary maintenance

131
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,692
of the Batcave and mansion until
your replacement is fully configured.

132
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:29,988
In a few moments,
HARDAC will upload into this computer.

133
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:35,911
Through the information network
this computer is linked with,

134
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,122
HARDAC can imprint himself
on every computer on Earth.

135
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:42,792
HARDAC will reactivate,
more powerful than ever

136
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,046
and configure more duplicants
to replace humanity.

137
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,966
Impossible. A computer
can't build a factory.

138
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,928
Humans will construct
the necessary machinery.

139
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,597
Humanity will resist!

140
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,476
With total control of worldwide
defense and communications systems,

141
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,853
HARDAC can be very persuasive.

142
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,480
I disagree.

143
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,900
Master Bruce. Thank heaven you're alive.

144
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:10,612
Impossible. You could not
have survived the fall.

145
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,823
We humans are more resilient
than you give us credit for.

146
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:19,829
Alfred!

147
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,002
Never mind me. Stop the computer!

148
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:28,505
You cannot prevent
the inevitable, Batman.

149
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,674
HARDAC is reborn.

150
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:42,018
In the very image of the man
who destroyed him.

151
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,821
I know all your moves, Batman.

152
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:55,031
So why don't you finish me off?

153
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,452
Or have you become enough like me
to know that I won't take a life?

154
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,671
I saw you risk your own life
to save Rossum in the greenhouse.

155
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,073
You knew I'd be able
to dodge that in time.

156
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:42,078
I suspect you not only won't kill,
you can't.

157
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,998
That's why you didn't finish me off
at the warehouse.

158
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:48,668
Impossible. I am programmed
to serve HARDAC.

159
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,088
Why do you resist? HARDAC's goals
are identical to your own.

160
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,964
How do you figure that?

161
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,845
Picture a world completely
free of crime,

162
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,015
free of suffering, free of frailty.

163
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:49,104
You mean free of choice?
Compassion? Free of humanity?

164
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,271
Yes.

165
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,990
You can't do it.

166
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,826
HARDAC built you well.

167
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,081
Perhaps even better
than he could have imagined.

168
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,718
No!

169
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:22,178
I've taken a life.

170
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:27,559
I've killed a man.

171
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:40,864
My city, my people. What have I done?

172
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,723
Master Bruce?

173
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,783
Thank heaven you're alive.

174
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,497
It would appear, sir,
that it preferred to sacrifice itself,

175
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,958
rather than allow innocent lives
