1
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,622
<i>Three features make WayneTech's
new Raven X-111 stealth helicopter</i>

2
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,624
<i>unique among military aircraft.</i>

3
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,461
<i>The first is her
silent-running capability.</i>

4
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,350
<i>Making the Raven ideal for
reconnaissance and covert operations.</i>

5
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:51,110
<i>Another is her state-of-the-art
cloaking device.</i>

6
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:55,406
<i>This renders her invisible to all normal
forms of radar and sonar detection.</i>

7
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,876
Last, but certainly not least,

8
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,296
<i>there is her extraordinary
ZVF sensor system.</i>

9
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:15,092
<i>ZVF, as I'm sure you've heard,
stands for zero visibility flight.</i>

10
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:20,389
<i>With this new technology, feedback
from the aircraft's radar and sonar</i>

11
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,809
<i>is translated, not into blips
on a tracking grid,</i>

12
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,812
<i>but rather into
computer generated images</i>

13
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,731
<i>on a video display terminal.</i>

14
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:33,569
<i>But should you think the Raven X-111
has only defensive capabilities,</i>

15
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,945
<i>think again.</i>

16
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,664
Looks like it's going even better
than we'd hoped.

17
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,374
Wouldn't you say, Mr. Wayne?

18
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,708
I guess, Doctor,

19
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,920
though I still have serious misgivings
about building weapon systems.

20
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,050
Look out!

21
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,430
What are they trying to do?

22
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,110
Hey, what's that?

23
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,280
- Looks like the helicopter crew.
- But if you guys are here,

24
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,324
then who's flying the chopper?

25
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,245
Look at them.
Taking off like scared pigeons.

26
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,708
You find pigeons funny, my friend?

27
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,876
No, boss. Not me.

28
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,629
Good. You'll do well to remember that.

29
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,633
Attention. Attention.

30
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,219
This is the Penguin speaking.

31
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,181
I have taken control
of your precious Raven

32
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,810
and intend to be paid handsomely
for its return.

33
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,770
I will contact the mayor's office

34
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,690
with the instructions for delivery
of the ransom.

35
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,785
<i>As of this moment,</i>

36
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:09,331
<i>the most dangerous bird in the sky
is the Penguin.</i>

37
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,960
Master Bruce!

38
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:16,255
Home, Alfred. Now.

39
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:18,382
But, sir, you need medical attention.

40
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,178
No. I don't want the WayneTech
doctors examining me.

41
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,600
Call Leslie.

42
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,518
Have her meet us at the house.

43
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,438
Begging your pardon, sir,
but why so secretive?

44
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:36,150
Because I don't want anyone to find out

45
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,278
that I can't see.

46
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,912
It's too soon to know for sure, Bruce,
but it looks like it's only temporary.

47
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,372
It might last two, maybe three days
at the most.

48
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:54,585
Assuming, of course, you actually follow
my instructions for a change.

49
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,378
What happened?

50
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,548
It looks like the explosion flash
burned both retinas.

51
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,884
It'll heal better if you keep your eyes

52
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,386
completely covered
for at least 36 hours.

53
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,264
Otherwise, you could damage
your vision permanently.

54
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:10,684
So keep him home, Alfred,
even if you have to hog-tie him.

55
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,688
He needs to rest, which means
the Batman is off duty, too.

56
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,316
No way, Leslie.

57
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,652
Not as long as the Penguin
has that chopper.

58
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:24,907
If there is some question, Master Bruce,
I urge you to resolve it straightaway.

59
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,744
You've a call on your private line.

60
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:32,039
- Then let's go.
- In your condition, sir?

61
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:35,084
If you think a little inconvenience
like this is gonna stop me...

62
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,423
Indeed.

63
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,313
He didn't respond?

64
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,234
No, Mr. Mayor.
But I'm sure there's a reason.

65
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:04,572
Who cares? What's Mr. Trick-or-Treat
gonna do that we can't?

66
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,784
I got 12 details crawling over every
airfield and heliport in four counties.

67
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,744
<i>Quite a machine, this Raven.</i>

68
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:15,040
<i>Amazing what its communications
equipment can do, don't you agree?</i>

69
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,167
You received my instructions?

70
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,378
<i>They arrived by messenger this morning.</i>

71
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:22,715
You know, 100 million is a lot of money.

72
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:25,050
It'll take time to raise that much.

73
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,969
You're stalling, Hill.

74
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,514
Obviously, you're not
taking me seriously.

75
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,809
<i>I warned you not to make that mistake.</i>

76
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,396
<i>Apparently, I'll have to show you why.</i>

77
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:44,778
You should've seen his face
when I told him.

78
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,905
Yeah.

79
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,615
What the heck is that?

80
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,450
I don't know.

81
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,202
It's not making a sound.

82
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:03,464
Jam it, get us out of here!

83
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,223
- You sure this is a good idea, boss?
- Do as you're told.

84
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:14,767
Ow!

85
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,089
<i>As a warning
of what he'll do tomorrow night.</i>

86
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:32,201
<i>Amazingly, all those on the collapsing
bridge escaped with only minor injuries.</i>

87
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,168
Alfred, I've got to find some way
to stop him.

88
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,963
Sight or no sight.

89
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,764
I still think this is a terrible idea.

90
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,224
I mean, using electrodes

91
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,978
to connect this gizmo directly
to your brain's optic center?

92
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,688
Objection noted.

93
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,564
May I have the headpiece, please?

94
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:12,574
Those ZVF components I gave you,
you wired them into this thing?

95
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,868
I know how to follow instructions.

96
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:26,547
Just be careful with that power pack.
You have to keep recharging it.

97
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,523
Will it work, sir?

98
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,528
Only one way to find out.

99
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,052
Well done, sir.

100
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,931
I was aiming for its head.

101
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,141
It isn't perfect.

102
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:22,686
But it will have to do.

103
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,901
I can only pray that the same
technology that created this crisis

104
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,153
can help me put an end to it.

105
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,681
Just what I was afraid of.

106
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,810
According to the controller's office,
we can't come close

107
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:04,853
to putting that ransom together.

108
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,440
Not without shutting down
basic municipal services.

109
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,567
So, what other options we got?

110
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,694
None, gentlemen.

111
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,615
Which is why you're going to do exactly
what the Penguin wants you to.

112
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,210
<i>We interrupt our regular
programming for this special report.</i>

113
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:32,714
<i>This is Mayor Hamilton Hill
with a personal message for the Penguin,</i>

114
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,842
<i>wherever you may be tonight.</i>

115
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,802
<i>You've won.</i>

116
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:41,056
<i>Just bring the Raven X-111
to the drop site at midnight</i>

117
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,810
<i>and I promise you'll get everything
that's coming to you.</i>

118
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,856
You see?
I told you they'd knuckle under.

119
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:53,944
- But, boss, it sounds too easy.
- Relax.

120
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,571
With the Raven's instruments,

121
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,949
we'll be able to spot a trap
a mile away, literally.

122
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:02,703
And if in fact this is a double-cross,

123
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:06,123
may heaven help them all.

124
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:21,096
Scanners show the area is secure, boss.

125
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,184
In that case, gentlemen, it's payday.

126
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,495
Huh?

127
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,664
What? What?

128
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,798
Gotcha.

129
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,559
But... But how could he sneak up
on us like that?

130
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,187
That plane of his must have
a cloaking device, too.

131
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:37,089
This means war!

132
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,196
We're going down!

133
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,495
- Mayday!
- Mayday!

134
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,363
The laser cannons. Use the lasers!

135
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,219
<i>Red alert. Red alert. Traumatic impact.</i>

136
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,888
<i>Heat damage to fuselage.</i>

137
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,891
<i>Breach to hull.
Extensive structural damage.</i>

138
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:12,559
Tell me something I don't know.

139
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,277
<i>Sixty-five seconds
to total system failure.</i>

140
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,086
Look. That Bat's going down.

141
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,437
<i>Warning. Warning.
Electrical system failure.</i>

142
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,022
<i>Switching to auxiliary power.</i>

143
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,495
Happy landing, rodent!

144
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:42,941
Look. There!

145
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,128
Terrific.

146
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,980
No, my pointy-eared old friend.

147
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:24,733
You don't escape me that easily.

148
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:37,037
Look at the way he's moving.
There's something wrong with him.

149
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,623
Why, yes. I think he's injured.

150
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,794
Argh!

151
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,645
I'll handle him.

152
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:31,985
What's the matter, Bat...

153
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:33,069
Ahhh!

154
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:30,794
Your aim appears to be
a little off today, Batman.

155
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,715
I don't think you can hit
the broad side of a barn,

156
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,385
let alone the broad side of this bird.

157
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,929
You're blind as a bat.

158
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,931
Sightless and helpless.

159
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,727
You got one right.

160
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:11,751
And where do you think you're going?

161
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,007
You've hit a dead end, rodent.

162
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,854
You're only prolonging the inevitable.

163
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,976
Not possible.

164
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:13,313
You're supposed to be
helpless. Helpless!

165
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:19,402
I'd feel a lot better about this
if you'd listened to me.

166
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,661
Master Bruce?

167
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:30,747
Well?

168
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:35,502
My word, sir. Surely, you're not...

169
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,171
No, Alfred. I can see just fine.

170
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:41,382
And right now,
I've never seen anything prettier.
