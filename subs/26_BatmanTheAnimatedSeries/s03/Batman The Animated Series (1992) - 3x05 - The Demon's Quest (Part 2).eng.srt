1
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,401
<i>Previously on</i> Batman...

2
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,490
Who are you? How did you get in here?

3
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:18,035
I am he who is called Ra's al Ghul.

4
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,455
Your ward was abducted
on the same night as my daughter.

5
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,624
You're Talia's father?

6
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,041
My time is short.

7
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:28,546
I need a man to assume my position
when I am gone.

8
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:32,258
- But why me?
- Because you are most worthy.

9
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:34,635
And because my precious daughter
loves you.

10
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,889
- Forget it.
- Then this means we must be enemies!

11
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:41,309
You will regret this insult, Detective.

12
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,936
You will...

13
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,731
We must take him to the Lazarus Pit.

14
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:17,094
Put her down, Ra's. Now!

15
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,185
No, Father! Ah!

16
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:26,312
We must stop him.

17
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:30,191
The chemicals can revive the dying
but will kill a healthy person.

18
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,400
I get it, I get it.

19
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:36,781
No!

20
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,382
Stay back.

21
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,205
I can handle this myself.

22
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:16,404
Thank you, daughter.

23
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,784
And thank you, Detective,
for my daughter's life.

24
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,203
You look refreshed, Father.

25
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,830
Renewed.

26
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:31,627
But even a miracle such as
the Lazarus Pit has its terrible price.

27
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,171
Yes. It offers physical rejuvenation

28
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:38,634
but the stress of the transformation
leaves one temporarily insane.

29
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:42,179
And no man may reap
its blessings indefinitely.

30
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:45,182
Which is why I must ask you
again, Detective,

31
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,894
will you wed my daughter
and carry on for me when I am gone?

32
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,024
The answer is still no.

33
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:58,195
A pity. You leave me no choice.

34
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,200
You see, if you are not
with me, Detective,

35
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,578
you are against me.

36
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,204
Father, no!

37
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,248
He has seen too many of our secrets.

38
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:11,792
He knows too much
to be permitted to leave here.

39
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,595
But you would
destroy this place, our home?

40
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,096
Only a minor loss.

41
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:27,475
There is nothing here that cannot be
found in our desert stronghold.

42
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:30,853
And we must leave nothing behind
that might be later used against us.

43
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,451
Farewell, Detective.

44
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,037
Goodbye, beloved.

45
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,136
Robin! The rope!

46
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:36,877
Come on!

47
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,773
- You okay?
- Sure.

48
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:01,026
I wish I'd worn the thermal tights,
but other than that...

49
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,326
By the time we get down this mountain,

50
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,329
he could be halfway to his
desert stronghold, wherever that is.

51
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,958
Then we've gotta find out where.

52
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:21,338
He's going to realize his dream of
a green and balanced Earth at any cost.

53
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,634
Even if that means destroying
half the planet's population to do it.

54
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,012
But where do we
even start looking?

55
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:30,180
You were his prisoner
for a week.

56
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,932
You must have overheard something.

57
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,184
Well, there was one thing.

58
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:38,939
A word I heard several times.
It was, uh...

59
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,026
Orpheus. Yeah, that's it.

60
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:59,376
Orpheus. From Greek mythology.

61
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,672
He descended into the netherworld
to bring his beloved back from the dead.

62
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,299
But according to the database,

63
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:08,384
Orpheus is also the name of
a privately-owned satellite

64
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:11,387
launched into synchronous orbit
over a year ago.

65
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:14,808
- Coincidence?
- Yeah, right.

66
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,453
What's it orbiting over?

67
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,395
What else? A desert.

68
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,648
The Sahara desert.

69
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,902
And the exact coordinates have to
be Ra's al Ghul's desert stronghold.

70
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,493
We're within 100 kilometers
of the target area, Bruce.

71
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,038
Gotta hold her steady at 500 feet
to stay under their radar,

72
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,248
but you can still
eject at this altitude.

73
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,667
Then let's do it.

74
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,626
Huh?

75
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:29,508
Huh?

76
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,716
So you have finally arrived.

77
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,677
Hitch your mounts and follow me.

78
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,888
We must not keep the master waiting.

79
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,766
Quickly. Our time grows short.

80
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,524
You there! Did you not hear me?
What is the matter with...

81
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,779
Huh?

82
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,841
So my eyes did not deceive me.

83
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,719
You will pay for this trespass.

84
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:34,675
For this indignity,
I will see you suffer.

85
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,386
Enough!

86
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:41,974
What is the meaning
of this disturbance, Ubu?

87
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,771
Forgive me, master, but I discovered
this most unworthy one spying.

88
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,860
Oh? I believe I would have a closer look
at one so foolish.

89
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:57,322
Or so brave.

90
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:05,621
- You.
- My admiration for you

91
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:07,583
was well-founded, Detective.

92
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,835
Too bad I can't say the same.

93
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,255
- Shall I dispatch him, master?
- No.

94
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,258
For now, merely relieve him
of that cumbersome belt.

95
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:23,223
Oh, and search him. Make certain
that he conceals no surprises

96
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,642
which might enable him to escape.

97
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,938
You have nothing to lose by telling me
what you're doing here.

98
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,859
Yes, I suppose I do owe you
that much, Detective,

99
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:36,737
since, in many ways,
you are responsible for it.

100
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,654
You see, I had hoped
to achieve my vision

101
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:41,533
of an earthly utopia
gradually over time,

102
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,495
with my heir carrying on my work
after I was gone.

103
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,374
But your refusal to become my heir
has left me no other choice.

104
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,085
- His mask, master?
- No, leave it.

105
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,962
It is a mark of honor.

106
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:59,343
Even though because of him, I must
now use what I call the Lazarus effect

107
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,304
to achieve my utopia in one bold stroke.

108
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,889
How?

109
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:14,274
The material of the pit
is an unknown chemical stew

110
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,693
that bubbles to the Earth's surface
only at certain key places.

111
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:21,365
Even now my people are placing bombs,
such as that one,

112
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,284
over the various Lazarus Pits
around the world.

113
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,620
These bombs are electronically linked

114
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,706
<i>to a private satellite
already in Earth orbit.</i>

115
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:32,709
- Orpheus.
- Precisely.

116
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,711
And at the moment when
sun and moon are in proper alignment

117
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:38,714
to cause the greatest upheaval
in Earth's geomagnetic field,

118
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:42,177
I shall send a signal to that satellite
beginning a countdown.

119
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:45,013
<i>Five minutes thereafter,
one bomb will be lowered</i>

120
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:47,557
<i>deep into the heart of each pit.</i>

121
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,103
<i>The satellite will, in turn,
relay a microwave signal</i>

122
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:54,189
<i>that will detonate
all the bombs simultaneously.</i>

123
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:58,443
<i>The multiple explosions will result
in a global chain reaction.</i>

124
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:02,030
<i>All the Lazarus Pits throughout
the world will overflow.</i>

125
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,450
<i>The globe will be saturated
with their chemical solution.</i>

126
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:08,704
<i>And when the resultant cataclysm
has abated,</i>

127
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,831
<i>there will come a blessed peace.</i>

128
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:14,251
<i>And this poor, defiled planet</i>

129
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:19,548
<i>shall find itself restored
to its former pristine glory.</i>

130
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,676
But that will cost countless lives.

131
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,429
Actually, Detective, we have counted.

132
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:30,058
Two billion, fifty-six million, nine
hundred and eighty-six thousand.

133
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,604
A most impressive plan,
would you not agree?

134
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:39,192
Yes, I can see it clearly now
for the first time.

135
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,781
You are completely out of your mind.

136
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,202
Infidel dog.

137
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,962
This time I shall attend
to you personally.

138
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,226
Ubu.

139
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:18,899
I would prefer the detective live
to witness the realization of my dream.

140
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:26,448
Take him to the tower
to await my moment of triumph.

141
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:28,700
As you wish, master.

142
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,831
Wait.

143
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,340
To remember me, beloved.

144
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:55,852
Not so dangerous without
your precious belt, are you?

145
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,571
One can only wonder
why the master thought

146
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:09,074
it would require two of us to guard him.

147
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:23,588
My children, we stand
on the threshold of a great adventure.

148
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:27,300
Even now, the satellite Orpheus
is moving into proper alignment

149
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,512
and the moment of destiny
is finally upon us.

150
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,395
Father, it is not too late.

151
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,896
Surely there must be some other way.

152
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:43,525
No, daughter.
The decision has been made.

153
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,510
In five minutes,
the world will be forever changed.

154
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,978
Master.

155
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:08,485
Stop him! He'll ruin everything!

156
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,035
Infidel.

157
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,166
If you only knew how sick I am
of you calling me that.

158
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:38,682
Perhaps, Detective, it is time
that you and I finally finish this.

159
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:42,060
It is the only chance you will have
to stop that satellite.

160
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,022
Well?

161
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:51,444
- Are you man enough to face your better?
- If you insist.

162
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,318
Give it up, Ra's.
You'll destroy yourself.

163
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,078
It appears that we will both
perish together, Detective.

164
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,131
Accept it. You have no choice.

165
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,842
Give me your hand.

166
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,854
Victory is yours, Detective.

167
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:54,984
Perhaps it is time I am finally one
with the planet I so love.

168
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,186
You must understand, beloved,

169
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:33,815
I share my father's vision
and seek the same ends

170
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:36,359
but I do not choose his means
to those ends.

171
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,986
I know.

172
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,205
What's to become of me, then?

173
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,875
Am I to be your prisoner?

174
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:16,733
So it's finally over?
We've seen the last of Ra's al Ghul?

175
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,027
Looks that way.
