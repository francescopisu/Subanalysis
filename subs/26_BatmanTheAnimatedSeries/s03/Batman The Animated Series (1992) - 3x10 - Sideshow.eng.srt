1
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:32,091
Don't bother trying, Croc.

2
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,552
Those cuffs are stacked
polycarbon alloy.

3
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:36,429
Not even you can break them.

4
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:41,475
So they finally declared old Croc sane
and responsible for his crimes.

5
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,603
Took them long enough.

6
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,980
I hear they're giving him
his own cellblock upstate.

7
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,982
Your tax dollars at work.

8
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:51,736
Wake me if he busts out.
That would be a story.

9
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:00,828
You know, there's something the brains
back at the joint didn't think about.

10
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,455
Yeah, what's that?

11
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:06,834
Crocodiles got the strongest jaws
of any animal around.

12
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,922
Get back!

13
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:16,135
- What was that?
- Did you hear that?

14
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:18,846
Oh, man. Did he get loose?

15
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,223
I'm not going near that thing.

16
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:52,380
Batman? Come on.
Can't you do any better than that?

17
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:58,344
You want a piece of me?
Think you can take the champ?

18
00:02:58,427 --> 00:03:02,014
You're pumped full of sedative, Croc.
You won't get far.

19
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,809
Farther than you.

20
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,070
No.

21
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:53,847
- Looks like he's been hurt.
- See his chains?

22
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,182
The poor guy.

23
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:57,184
It's okay. We'll take care of you.

24
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:01,480
Oh, judgment,
thou art fled to brutish beasts.

25
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,441
And men have lost their reason.

26
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,944
Bring him, good Goliath.

27
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,336
Huh?

28
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,849
Rise and shine.

29
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:43,480
- Please try and drink some.
- Yes, it's good for you.

30
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:51,989
Ah, now, that's better, isn't it?
Sorry, we haven't been introduced.

31
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,158
Richard. At your service.

32
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:58,454
Like Richard III,
I too am rudely stamped.

33
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,956
You have to forgive our dramatic friend.

34
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,000
He's nuts about Shakespeare.

35
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,670
These two sylvan nymphs
are May and June.

36
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,006
- Pleased to meet you.
- Ditto.

37
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,341
And you've met Billy.

38
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,221
You're the one that pulled me
out of the drink, ain't you? I owe you.

39
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,099
And I'm Goliath. I helped haul you in.

40
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:23,437
So I'll buy you a medal.

41
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:28,400
No need to be shy.
We're all family here.

42
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,195
It must have been fate
that led you to us.

43
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,240
Yeah. What's a freak show
doing in the middle of nowhere?

44
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,951
You're one to talk, lizard lips.

45
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:42,581
June, he's a guest.
Our circus days are over.

46
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,418
We used the money we earned to buy
this farm so we could live in peace.

47
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:51,256
This is a sanctuary,
not only for us but for all our kind.

48
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:55,302
If you're willing to join in the work,
you too are welcome here.

49
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:57,638
Is that a fact?

50
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,566
- Hey.
- You did it!

51
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,487
- Bravo. Well done.
- I told you he was strong.

52
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,657
So tell us, friend,
from whence do you hail?

53
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,953
See, I was part of this freak show,
same as you,

54
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:24,414
only they kept me chained
like an animal. Day and night.

55
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,210
Forced me to live in a tank.
Made me do tricks.

56
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,295
- How awful.
- Jerks.

57
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:34,800
Yeah. They fed me
fish heads and stale bread.

58
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:40,347
When I tried to get away, they worked me
over pretty good, put me in chains.

59
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:50,482
Don't worry. Nobody will find you here.

60
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,860
Haven't seen a soul since we moved in.

61
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,029
That's good, real good.

62
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,039
Ah!

63
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:14,214
And they say the city's dangerous.

64
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,053
No, I don't mind
sleeping out on the straw.

65
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:24,683
- Go ahead and take my bedroom.
- Don't put yourself out for me.

66
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,852
The cot's too small anyway.

67
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,979
And tomorrow we'll go
swimming, right, Croc?

68
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,649
There's the coolest grottos along
the river. It's like another world.

69
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,904
Yeah, sure, kid.
Too bad I forgot my bathing suit.

70
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,200
That's right. Our new friend here
is going to need additional raiment.

71
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,163
- He means clothes.
- Yeah? You guys got money?

72
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:50,834
Just a small nest egg left over
from the purchase of this mill.

73
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,794
Fifty thousand.

74
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,340
Thank you, Goliath.

75
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,259
It's not something we like to broadcast.

76
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,931
Fifty grand?
A guy could go to town on that.

77
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,686
Croc?

78
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,609
- What you doing?
- Looking for a blanket. I'm cold.

79
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,528
I'll find you one.

80
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,032
I got it, shorty.

81
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,325
You know, Croc,

82
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,328
I know you feel a little funny
being here, but it's great.

83
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,958
It really is. No one stares at you,
laughing, making you feel bad.

84
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,418
You can be yourself.

85
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,212
Yeah, great. Whatever.

86
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:30,350
Huh?

87
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:36,440
Calm down. I won't hurt you.

88
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,693
I'm looking for someone.
Half man, half crocodile.

89
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:44,573
- He's in there, isn't he?
- No. Stay away.

90
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:48,744
He's one of us.

91
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,620
Croc, run!

92
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:59,796
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Don't worry. You won't.

93
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:17,939
You.

94
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,155
Richard, help!

95
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,751
Quickly. Quickly. In there.

96
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,681
Ha! Who's the freak now, Bats?

97
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,893
- Who is he?
- A nutcase in a mask.

98
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:58,105
- He's the one who put me in the tank.
- Don't listen to him.

99
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,024
His name's Killer Croc. He's dangerous.

100
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:06,154
Quiet! Don't think you're
gonna fool my friends, do you?

101
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,782
They know my story. I'm one of them.

102
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:13,954
Yes. And his chains speak more
eloquently than any words of yours.

103
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:19,084
Listen to me. He's an escaped convict,
a cold-blooded killer.

104
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,669
I said shut up!

105
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,882
What he said, it's not true, is it?

106
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,176
You're being square with us,
aren't you, Croc?

107
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:33,515
'Course I am. I ain't the one who
attacked big boy in his sleep, am I?

108
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,852
What are we gonna do?

109
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,771
Get rid of him.

110
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,649
What do you mean?

111
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:48,405
If he gets loose, he'll bring 'em all
down on us. No one's safe.

112
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,532
The bat's gotta go.

113
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,920
It's your last hunt, Bats.
And now you're the prey.

114
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,591
Croc, no. Don't do this.

115
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,177
- You can't.
- It's not right.

116
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,847
I can and I will.

117
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,809
No killing.

118
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,395
Why, you dirty...

119
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:26,610
Stay out of this!
This is between me and the bat.

120
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,238
- But you can't kill him.
- He's still a human being.

121
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:35,076
- Who are you calling human?
- Oh, Croc.

122
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,581
Alas, I fear that the chameleon
has shown his true colors.

123
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:44,294
I think you should leave, my friend.
We've had enough of these shenanigans.

124
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,841
Well, kid, looks like we're gonna
have to postpone that little swim.

125
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,218
Watch out!

126
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:53,428
Hey!

127
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:03,021
The bigger they are, eh, Bats?

128
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,949
The evil that men do...

129
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,535
Stuff the Shakespeare.

130
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,995
You're lucky you're still around
to recite it.

131
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:21,665
You I'm not done with yet.

132
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:29,881
All right.

133
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:47,774
Hey!

134
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:52,279
Lookie here, Bats.
Got a couple of souvenirs.

135
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,409
One for you too.

136
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,662
Don't want you talking about me
when I'm gone.

137
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:02,932
Give it up, Bats. You can't take me.
I got the high ground. I got the gun.

138
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,935
I know a way in.

139
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,752
Huh?

140
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,348
Hyah!

141
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:44,808
You're guano, bat.

142
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:38,570
What?

143
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:01,676
Show's over, folks.

144
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,977
Okay, guys. All set.

145
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,647
Why, Croc?
Why did you turn on us like that?

146
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,942
We could have helped you.
We could have done something.

147
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,404
You said you can be yourself
out here, remember?

148
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,449
Well, I guess that's what I was doing.

149
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:26,034
Being myself.
