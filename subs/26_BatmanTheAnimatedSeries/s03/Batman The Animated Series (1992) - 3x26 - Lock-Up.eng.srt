1
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:19,787
Don't take me
back there! Please!

2
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,957
Look at me, Batman.

3
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,750
I'm shaking with fear.

4
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,086
Me, the Scarecrow.

5
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:29,797
I wasn't even
going back to crime this time.

6
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,341
I just had to get away from him.

7
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:41,392
I'll take it from here, Batman.

8
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,438
Lyle Bolton, Chief of Security.

9
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,566
Congratulations, Professor Crane.

10
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,570
You're the first inmate
to escape Arkham under my charge.

11
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,656
You're also the last.

12
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,578
I won't let you and the people
of Gotham City down again, Batman.

13
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:14,675
That Bolton's a 10 on the creep-o-meter.

14
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,720
But it seems like he's doing a good job
keeping the inmates in check.

15
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,388
Maybe too good.

16
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,355
I've called this informal inquest

17
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,358
to address certain allegations
brought to my attention.

18
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,943
Are you sure this hearing
was necessary, Wayne?

19
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:36,113
Bolton was brought to Arkham
on a Wayne Foundation grant.

20
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,407
With his knowledge
of high-tech security systems,

21
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,451
I felt he was the perfect man
for the job.

22
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,870
If anyone objects to my methods...

23
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:46,374
Please, tell me.

24
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:50,544
Ms. Quinn.

25
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,547
Do you have any complaints
against Mr. Bolton?

26
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,847
I got nothing to say.

27
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,517
But surely you must have
something you wish to...

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,686
You got a hearing problem or something?

29
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,816
No, <i>nada,</i> ixnay, zero, zilch,
bupkes, nothing! Okay?

30
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,278
It's all right.
I promise, you can speak freely here.

31
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,745
- Mr. Bolton, he's a...
- A hard worker!

32
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,622
A real stand-up guy.

33
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,582
No complaints here, Chief.

34
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:33,170
Professor Crane, you've been
sitting here for 10 minutes.

35
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,298
- Don't you have anything to say?
- No, sir.

36
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:40,177
And yet yours
was the loudest voice of protest.

37
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,305
You must have some misgivings
about my methods.

38
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:46,809
It seems I was mistaken.

39
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,772
Well then, based on today's testimony,

40
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,983
I propose extending
Mr. Bolton's contract

41
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,906
for an additional 18 months.

42
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:58,612
No! You can't! You don't know
what he's doing to us!

43
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,780
Shut up!

44
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,344
Don't listen to jerk-face here.
He don't know what he's saying!

45
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,034
No, it's all true!

46
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,579
If we don't speak up now,
we'll never get another chance!

47
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,748
He threatens us,
takes away our privileges,

48
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,291
even when we're good!

49
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:12,376
We've heard enough of this nonsense.

50
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,254
He says,
"Scum like us must be kept in line."

51
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:19,800
That's why he chains us down at night
and electrifies our doors.

52
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,052
He held me over a can
filled with termites.

53
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,805
You hear me? Termites!

54
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,265
He's an animal.

55
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:27,868
- A monster.
- Keep him away!

56
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,976
Shut up!

57
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:30,311
All of you!

58
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,630
You're all scum.

59
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:01,258
You should be beaten within an inch
of your misbegotten lives.

60
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,802
I've seen enough!

61
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,137
Lyle Bolton, you're dismissed!

62
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,014
Before I came here,

63
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:11,352
Arkham was a revolving door
for every maniac in Gotham.

64
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,646
I kept them in. Me!

65
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:18,859
Now I realize I was wrong
to punish those pathetic miscreants!

66
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:21,445
They're only symptoms.

67
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,113
You're the cause!

68
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,990
The gutless police,

69
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:29,286
mindless bureaucrats,
and coddling doctors!

70
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:34,708
You should all be locked up
in a cage without a key!

71
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,592
Mr. Bolton,

72
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,805
any comments about your dismissal
and the charges of extreme behavior?

73
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:52,893
This city is an open wound
begging to be stitched.

74
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,770
<i>Since that day three weeks ago,</i>

75
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,982
<i>Lyle Bolton has been unavailable
for further comment.</i>

76
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:00,985
<i>Next up on</i> Gotham Insider,

77
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:04,280
<i>she's gorgeous, she's deadly
and she's back in town.</i>

78
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,092
<i>- Once again, Poison Ivy has recently...</i>
- Look at the way these monsters

79
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,118
are turned into heroes.

80
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,205
It all starts with the permissive,
liberal media.

81
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,291
<i>The villainous vixen of vines
made off with...</i>

82
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:33,267
Thanks for the exclusive, Mr. Wayne.

83
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:36,520
Do they always include
such a sumptuous meal?

84
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,523
Only when the topic
is a successful Wayne Corp merger.

85
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,984
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne.
You have an urgent phone call.

86
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,194
If you'll excuse me.

87
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:02,755
What the...

88
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,633
Great.

89
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,736
Summer?

90
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,562
The time has come
to cleanse Gotham of the real criminals.

91
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,733
You apprehend them, Dark Knight,
and Lock-Up will put them away.

92
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,486
Together we can make
this city safe again.

93
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,571
By kidnapping innocent victims?

94
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,824
I don't think so.

95
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,618
If you're not part of the solution,

96
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,870
then you're part of the problem.

97
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,351
You disappoint me, Batman.

98
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,813
I thought you'd wanna see
this media leech get her comeuppance.

99
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,636
Just what this town needs,

100
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,014
another psycho in a Halloween costume.

101
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:28,984
This is Lyle Bolton's handiwork.

102
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,028
No one configures a lock like him.

103
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:34,323
You mean this Lock-Up nut
is the security creep from Arkham?

104
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,699
Without a doubt.

105
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,328
Another fine villain made possible
by a grant from the Wayne Foundation.

106
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:42,790
Only kidding.

107
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:47,920
Bolton's last known address.

108
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,463
See what you can find.

109
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,934
Nice look. Early Alcatraz.

110
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,170
Dr. Bartholomew?

111
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:43,517
Commissioner?

112
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,477
I lit the signal, Bats.

113
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:50,190
That nutcase took the commish
and gave me these new cuff links.

114
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:54,486
Took me 15 minutes to hit the switch
on your overgrown flashlight.

115
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,364
You got any idea
what this is all about, cowl-head?

116
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:58,866
I think so.

117
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,450
First Summer Gleeson,

118
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,494
then Bartholomew, and now Gordon.

119
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,454
Put extra security around Mayor Hill.

120
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,582
You mind letting me in on the joke?

121
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:10,377
Typical.

122
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,425
You want me to hide during a crisis?

123
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,135
How will that look to the voters?

124
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,220
This is overkill, Detective.

125
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,015
I have the finest security system
in the city.

126
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:24,975
It's virtually impenetrable.

127
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:26,435
Virtually.

128
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,314
But not completely.

129
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,692
If we can slip through, so can Lock-Up.

130
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,745
Mayor!

131
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,476
Forget to pay a parking ticket?

132
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:14,691
Move it.

133
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,535
Ahh!

134
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,627
I see your taste in prisoners
is improving, Bolton.

135
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:38,507
You have three seconds
to release those bars.

136
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:41,551
If you let us go now, Bolton,
I can guarantee leniency.

137
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,055
No.

138
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,728
I don't do leniency.

139
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,029
Still nothing.

140
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,033
Just as I suspected from the rust.

141
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,911
A high salt content like seawater.

142
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:12,249
Hey. What if F-84
is the serial number of a ship?

143
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,877
Bingo.

144
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,342
The Halsey was used
as a temporary prison

145
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,094
while Stonegate was being built.

146
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,804
Computer.

147
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,890
Name of security chief
during Operation Stonegate.

148
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,394
Well, blow me down.

149
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,078
I've homed in on his power source.

150
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:54,791
Shut down the security systems.
I'll take care of Bolton.

151
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,381
You brought this on yourself, Batman.

152
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,909
You're resourceful, Dark Knight.

153
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:31,620
But sooner or later, you're mine.

154
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,475
No regard for authority.

155
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,644
We'll soon change that.

156
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,491
You think that was my only defense?

157
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:13,370
It's over, Bolton.

158
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,166
Face it, Bolton.

159
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,876
You've already lost.

160
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,294
No!

161
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,973
Amazing what a little
corrupted computer code will do.

162
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,530
I still have my prisoners.

163
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,754
- Commissioner? Mr. Mayor?
- Down here.

164
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,800
Hang on, I'll get you out.

165
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,895
I was working with you, Batman.

166
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:04,105
You apprehended the scum of the earth,

167
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,066
and I kept them locked away!

168
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,818
I've seen how you treat your prisoners.

169
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,570
Forgotten and scared.

170
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,489
Without hope or compassion.

171
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:15,492
Can it be you actually care
for those creatures?

172
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,827
You're just as crazy as they are.

173
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,333
Almost got it.

174
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,126
Robin, hurry!

175
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:51,152
I could have rid Gotham of the fools
in city hall and the police department.

176
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,655
We could have made our own order!

177
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,783
I was born to fight your brand of order.

178
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:58,827
If that's your decision.

179
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,409
Stay close. I think this is the way out.

180
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,205
We could have been a team.

181
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,341
Batman!

182
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,490
Batman?

183
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,762
I keep asking him
to teach me that trick.

184
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,571
Hey, look, guys.
The big shot's back.

185
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:15,880
Now you shall learn new lessons in fear.

186
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,559
They thought they could trap me
in a world of lunatics,

187
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,477
but I showed them.

188
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,897
Now, I can keep an eye on everyone.

189
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,444
They'll never slip past me again.
