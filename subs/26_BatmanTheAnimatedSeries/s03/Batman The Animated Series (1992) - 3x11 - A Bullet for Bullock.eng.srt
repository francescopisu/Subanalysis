1
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:35,261
Hey!

2
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,247
Commissioner?

3
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,249
Nope. Me.

4
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,418
I got a problem.

5
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,962
And you want my help?

6
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,382
Let's get something straight
from the get-go.

7
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,761
I think you're a freak and a menace,
and those are your good points.

8
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,139
But the commish says you serve
a purpose, so I go along.

9
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,143
I appreciate your honesty.
What's the problem?

10
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,062
Somebody's got it in for me.

11
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:28,230
Tried to give me
a fender massage last night.

12
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,775
It ain't the first time. Last week too.

13
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,151
Any suspects?

14
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,445
So many they could
have their own zip code.

15
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,031
I've put a lot of guys away
and they hate me for it.

16
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:40,201
Looks like one of them hates me
enough to do something about it.

17
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:44,038
Why me?
Why not just go to the department?

18
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,165
I step on a lot of toes.

19
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,377
I don't want Internal Affairs
looking at me too close.

20
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,962
They might find some things
I don't want found.

21
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,006
- Are you on the take?
- Watch it, freak!

22
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,258
I never took a dime from nobody!

23
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,969
I just bend the rules
a little sometimes.

24
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:00,346
You understand.

25
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,223
We're not all that different.

26
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,726
We're on the same side,
but we're not the same.

27
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:10,106
I'll help you find out who's after you,
but you've got to collar them clean.

28
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:12,983
File copies of my cases
from five years back.

29
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,985
Don't wanna run them on the system here.

30
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,862
You find the guy then tell me.

31
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,408
I'll take it from there.
Sound fair, partner?

32
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:47,935
Ugh.

33
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,316
There's a doormat outside, Mr. Bullock.

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,903
Really? I thought you were
the doormat around here, Nivens.

35
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,285
Don't crowd me, dork,
or I'll wipe my feet on you.

36
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,454
Ahem.

37
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:10,458
Take out your garbage once in a while.
Your apartment stinks.

38
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,960
I won't have roaches in my building!

39
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,088
And turn the heat down
when you're out all day!

40
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,965
Happy holidays, Nivens.

41
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,265
Huh!

42
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,906
Thank heaven for rent control.

43
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,368
We are speaking of the
same person, are we not?

44
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,831
Harvey Bullock? The detective
who looks like an unmade bed?

45
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,208
The same.

46
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,086
He came to you for help?
It must be serious.

47
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,299
It'll take the system a while
to collate and cross-index the names.

48
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:01,926
I'll be back later.

49
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,138
I thought you were through
with your rounds for tonight.

50
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,976
Not yet. I have a feeling Bullock's
going to need a guardian angel.

51
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:24,031
Stay sharp. These perps are bad news.

52
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:26,909
Scagged a couple of bank guards
Christmas day.

53
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,543
Police! Nobody move!

54
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:41,757
Hey! Hold it!

55
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,045
Give it up, hairball!

56
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:39,189
What are you doing here?

57
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,818
Watching your back. Good thing, too.

58
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,988
I asked you to find a name,
not hold my hand.

59
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,656
You're welcome.

60
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,119
I have some questions.

61
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:55,247
Later. After my shift.
Where do I find you?

62
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,624
I'll find you.

63
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:00,753
Show-off.

64
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,590
On your feet.

65
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,884
Harv? You need a hand up here?

66
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,637
Just reading this jerk his rights.

67
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,972
You got the right to remain silent.

68
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,850
If you give up that right
you'll probably bore me to tears.

69
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,227
So keep your trap shut, dog-breath.

70
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,574
Questions, remember?

71
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,037
Sheesh! You take some chances, freak.

72
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,667
- Are these all the threats you received?
- Yeah.

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,669
I'm thinking of starting a scrapbook.

74
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,613
You dusted them for prints?

75
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,133
Yep. <i>Nada.</i>

76
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,761
Hand-delivered to my mailbox.

77
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,848
Someone's gone to a lot
of effort to scare you.

78
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:56,942
But I don't think
they're trying to kill you.

79
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:01,480
Yeah? That attack last night
seemed pretty sincere.

80
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:07,194
A professional hit man would
do you here, not on the street.

81
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,654
So what?

82
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:12,032
The guy who gets whacked by an amateur
is just as stiff as a pro job.

83
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:17,621
When you gonna get me
that list of names?

84
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,087
I wonder how Gordon puts up with this.

85
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,623
Bullock? You okay?
You don't look so good.

86
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,876
I mean, you never look good,
but today you look worse.

87
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:50,005
After 15 years working in this cesspool,
I'd like to see how good you look.

88
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,674
Well, you're sure
full of holiday spirit.

89
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,218
What are you doing for New Year's?

90
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:57,221
Same thing I did for Christmas.
My laundry.

91
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,986
- Bullock.
- You got what I want, pointy ears?

92
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,490
You were right, Bullock.
A lot of people don't like you.

93
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,534
The list of suspects was a long one.

94
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,954
Does the name Vincent Starkey
mean anything to you?

95
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,039
Vinnie the Shark? Yeah.

96
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:26,542
The dirtbag threatened me in open court.

97
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,045
Ran a drug lab in South Gotham.
I broke it up when I was in Vice.

98
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,005
He got 10 to 20 in Stonegate.

99
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:36,260
Starkey was a model prisoner.
He only did eight years.

100
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,345
He's out, Bullock.

101
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:42,141
I cost him an empire.
He'd love to see me take a dirt nap.

102
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,767
Where do we find him?

103
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,104
I'm working on it.
I want you to follow up on a lead.

104
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,314
Hey, what am I, some wet-eared rookie?

105
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,151
Nobody tells me
how to conduct an investigation.

106
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,027
Do you wanna live, Bullock?

107
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,905
Then pay attention.

108
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:02,202
Summer Gleeson did an exposé
on South Gotham crack houses last week.

109
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,256
She might have heard something
about Vinnie.

110
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:06,206
So, see the woman, huh?

111
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:09,459
- What are you gonna do?
- Make a few inquiries.

112
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:12,087
Inquiries? Like what?

113
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:15,465
Hey, pal, this is my life
we're talking about here!

114
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,843
Bats! Bats!

115
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,933
Bullock? What are you doing here?

116
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,229
Need a favor, Gleeson.
That shoot you did down in crack town?

117
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:32,107
You still owe me
for the last favor I did you.

118
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,985
Hey, Summer,
where's your Christmas spirit?

119
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:36,570
You know you can trust me.

120
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,531
I trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

121
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,869
Come on, Gleeson.

122
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:48,207
You're lucky I talk to you
at all, Bullock.

123
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,502
Tell you what. Come back in an hour.

124
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:29,581
Here you go, my friend.
And a happy New Year to you.

125
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,418
Free enterprise.
What makes America great.

126
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,301
Batman!

127
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,095
What... What do you want?

128
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,931
Not what, slime ball, who.

129
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:47,182
Vinnie the Shark.

130
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,977
He's not my connection anymore.

131
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,645
Wrong answer.

132
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,079
Take two.

133
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,415
Okay, okay, okay!

134
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,803
Aren't you a piece of work.

135
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:28,932
You gotta help me, Gleeson.
I need to find Vinnie the Shark.

136
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,060
You wanna find a shark?
You can jump in Gotham Bay!

137
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:35,272
You've blown it big time, Bullock.
Don't ever come to me again.

138
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:39,651
Summer, cut me some slack.
This guy's looking to whack me.

139
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,738
Look on the bright side.
You'll make the 6:00 news.

140
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,251
Taxi.

141
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:05,719
Get in.

142
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,512
Hey!

143
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,894
You got a serious
attitude problem, freak.

144
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,645
You want the Shark or not?

145
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:16,938
You know where he is?

146
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:20,942
He's running rock crystal out of
an abandoned auto plant out in Bayside.

147
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,112
Nice starship you got here.

148
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,365
What's this for?

149
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,825
Passenger ejector seat.

150
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,502
Something about this still bothers me.
Starkey's not one to make idle threats.

151
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,712
Why would he warn you to leave town?

152
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,923
The sicko wanted to see me sweat.

153
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,674
Come on, let's get this over with.

154
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:59,314
Careful with that merchandise, boys.
You break it, you buy it. <i>Capisce?</i>

155
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,708
Nobody move!

156
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:23,713
Nice entrance.
Still haven't lost your sense of timing.

157
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:27,676
Hey!

158
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,636
Down!

159
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:39,980
Taking out the Batman
will make me look good in Gotham.

160
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,568
But the real pleasure's
gonna be taking you out, Bullock.

161
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,371
Eight years I waited
to do this, Bullock.

162
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,791
Now it's payback time.

163
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,872
Merry Christmas, Vinnie.

164
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,707
And happy New Year.

165
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,588
Just call me Santa.

166
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:32,384
And guess who's on top
of my naughty list?

167
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,888
- No, Bullock!
- Relax, cowl-head.

168
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,057
This dirtbag don't get off that easy.

169
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,060
- The rest of the gang?
- Taken care of.

170
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,020
Good. I'll radio for a wagon.

171
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,188
You think it's over?

172
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:48,775
Had to be Vinnie. Yeah. It's over.

173
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,318
It's your call.

174
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,321
By the way,
I still think you're a freak.

175
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,698
But...

176
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,074
Thanks.

177
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,417
Okay, Vinnie.

178
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,921
They say confession's good for the soul.

179
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,300
You wanna tell me why
you sent me those letters?

180
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:17,429
You've taken one too many shots
to the head, Bullock. What letters?

181
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:21,099
Listen, scum-face,
I don't feel like playing games.

182
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,018
I got a pile of paperwork,

183
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,229
and Internal Affairs is all over me
like a cheap suit!

184
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,439
So spill it!

185
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:30,442
What are you gonna do? Send me to jail?

186
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,278
I'm telling you, I don't know
what you're talking about!

187
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,530
Get him out of here.

188
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,411
It's just gotta be him, Montoya.

189
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,496
There ain't nobody else.

190
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,257
You should've taken my advice, Bullock.

191
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,969
You should've left town.
I tried to scare you out.

192
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,138
I didn't want it to come to this.

193
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,724
I know you.

194
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,477
Stay back!

195
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,689
You wouldn't take the hints,
so now I have to settle it this way.

196
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,817
It's your fault. I tried to warn you.

197
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,911
I thought this wasn't over.

198
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,295
- Nivens?
- Why wouldn't you move?

199
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,255
Why wouldn't you get out?

200
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,134
You and your late hours
and your filthy habits.

201
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,639
Do you have any idea
what your apartment's worth these days?

202
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:44,641
You wanted my apartment?

203
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,560
You mean all this
was about rent control?

204
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,397
No! I wanted you gone!

205
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,608
You're not a tenant,
you're a pestilence!

206
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,319
You insult me. You treat me like dirt.

207
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:00,365
No jury in the world
would've convicted me!

208
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,913
They wouldn't have convicted me!

209
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:11,084
Somebody like Vinnie wants to pop me,
that's no surprise.

210
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,044
But this...

211
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:17,048
You know, it's funny.
I was thinking of moving anyway.

212
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,217
Neighborhood's really been
going downhill lately.

213
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:22,095
Look, I guess I owe you for this.

214
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,557
Forget it, Bullock.
You've got enough problems.
