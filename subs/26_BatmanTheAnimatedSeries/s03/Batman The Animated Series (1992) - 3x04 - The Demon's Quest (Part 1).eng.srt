1
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:58,117
Hey!

2
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,587
No word then, Master Bruce?

3
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,173
None. And I've scoured the entire city.

4
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:58,260
No one has seen either Robin
or Dick Grayson for two days.

5
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:02,306
I really should remain
upstairs then, sir.

6
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,516
Lest he call.

7
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,603
Oh, by the way, this came for you
an hour ago by messenger.

8
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,960
No. It can't be.

9
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,054
So.

10
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,932
They know your identity, detective.

11
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,768
Who are you? How did you get in here?

12
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,402
You must forgive Ubu, detective.
He is well-trained.

13
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,574
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am he who is called Ra's al Ghul.

14
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,910
The Demon's Head.
I thought you were only a legend.

15
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,371
I am quite real.

16
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,999
And as I am sure you realize by now,

17
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,253
my reputation for resourcefulness
is well-deserved.

18
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,589
As you can see,
we have a common problem.

19
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:20,259
Your ward was abducted
on the same night as my daughter.

20
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,304
You do remember my daughter?

21
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,806
- You're Talia's father?
- Yes.

22
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,728
But surely you would not expect her
to mention me by name.

23
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,858
Keep your distance! I am merely old.

24
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,319
Older, perhaps, than you can imagine.

25
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,572
But not so old that I cannot
assist you in your search.

26
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:46,494
I get the message. Okay, then.
For openers, look at the blade.

27
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:49,497
It's used by a cult of mercenaries
based in Calcutta.

28
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,709
Even the rope appears to be made
of a hemp indigenous to that area.

29
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,711
Well done, detective.

30
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,840
You are worthy of your reputation.
To India, then.

31
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,968
Come, I have an aircraft waiting.

32
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:07,848
Infidel!

33
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,520
Forgive my servant.

34
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,481
He feels that no one should precede me.

35
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,525
Call it overzealousness.

36
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,115
I think I'll call it strike one.

37
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,794
You still have me at a loss,
Ra's al Ghul.

38
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,671
Just how did you learn who I am?

39
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:43,092
I control a vast
global organization, detective.

40
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:48,347
Obviously, Batman's activities
require certain costly implements.

41
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,226
It was a simple matter for my people
to learn which wealthy Americans

42
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,687
were amassing what Batman might require.

43
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,941
The one who matched my daughter's
description of you was Bruce Wayne.

44
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,194
Next time I'll have to glue my mask on.

45
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:06,699
Do you need help?

46
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,702
I need nothing.

47
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,957
As Napoleon told me,
a strong will can fuel a frail physique.

48
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:35,978
How can you be certain, detective,
that those we seek are to be found here?

49
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,315
I make it my business to know
things like that. Here.

50
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,317
There's an incense shop.

51
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,944
Infidel!

52
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,204
Okay. That's two.

53
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:11,555
Yes.

54
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:42,002
No!

55
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:47,257
Yes. Unless you tell me how to find
the mercenaries who did this.

56
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:51,971
They have fled with the boy
and the woman.

57
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,975
Where?

58
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,565
To Malaysia. In a pagoda
in the shadow of Mount Merapi.

59
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,026
I know nothing more, I swear it!

60
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:29,800
Look at it, detective,
one of the last of the rain forests.

61
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,011
The world depends upon its oxygen,

62
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,681
yet the rich see only
profit in its destruction.

63
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:40,561
You who belong to the overclass
have much to answer for.

64
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,149
Bruce Wayne donates millions of dollars
a year to preserve these forests.

65
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,988
Which are being depleted
at the rate of 120,000 acres a day.

66
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,658
Does your money solve this problem? No.

67
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,745
It will take more than wealth,
it will take power.

68
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,748
And, I fear, ruthlessness.

69
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:08,756
Humankind must be forced to serve
the planet instead of its own appetites.

70
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,301
And you're the one
who'll do the forcing?

71
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:15,804
I am qualified, yes.

72
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,391
But I may not have sufficient lifetimes
left to me.

73
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,561
Master, ahead. Look!

74
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:26,815
In the shadow of the volcano,
just as the Indian said.

75
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,776
Let us hurry.

76
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,403
The next piece of
our puzzle surely waits within.

77
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,735
Sweet dreams, tabby.

78
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,958
Congratulations, detective,
on thwarting our tormentors.

79
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,464
Obviously, our quest was meant
to end here.

80
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:59,426
Maybe, maybe not. Look at this.
A map of the Himalayas.

81
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,595
There's a faint scratch,

82
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:05,057
almost certainly made by
a fingernail tracing a route.

83
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,684
Indeed. I am familiar with that area,

84
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:10,896
and the nearest field large enough
to accommodate my aircraft

85
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,940
is 100 miles from our destination.

86
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,069
So I will arrange for a helicopter
when one is needed.

87
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,782
After you.

88
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,620
Hmm.

89
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,998
Hmm.

90
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,346
The mountain in question
is directly ahead.

91
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:48,475
I've radioed for my men.
They await me on the mountaintop.

92
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,312
- While I descend the hard way.
- You must search for clues.

93
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,232
If we perceive any danger,
we can signal you with...

94
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:01,280
Master, we must get you
to one of the pits.

95
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,325
- Pits?
- Ignore him, detective.

96
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:08,161
We must stay on the hunt
for the sake of the children.

97
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,623
All right. If that's the way
it's to be played.

98
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,813
- Robin.
- Huh?

99
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:00,607
- Batman!
- You okay?

100
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,359
Am I glad to see you.

101
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,236
I'll have you free in a minute.

102
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,608
- Been here long?
- A couple days, I think.

103
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,444
I still don't know who grabbed me.

104
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,118
I do.

105
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:13,930
Ra's al Ghul.

106
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,273
Obviously, your little accident
wasn't fatal.

107
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,651
I imagine you and Ubu left the chopper
when I wasn't looking.

108
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:31,615
Indeed. At the moment it exploded,
it was proceeding on automatic pilot.

109
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:34,910
So how long have you known, detective,

110
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,120
that I planned your ward's capture?

111
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,663
Almost from the beginning.

112
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,916
How could you have known
that Robin and your daughter

113
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:42,751
were abducted on the same night?

114
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,045
Unless I had done the abducting?

115
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,671
Exactly.

116
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:49,591
And do you think I'd have let you
take me anywhere in your plane

117
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:51,634
unless I suspected
you meant to lead me somewhere?

118
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,180
For one thing, there were
all those would-be assassins.

119
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,349
They knew where we'd be and when.

120
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,019
Someone had to be tipping them off.
That someone had to be you.

121
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,940
Then there was Ubu.
Always by his master's side,

122
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:08,568
always very picky about letting you
go ahead of everyone else.

123
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:13,657
Except in Malaysia, where you knew
there was danger waiting.

124
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,034
I am deeply impressed.

125
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,869
As am I.

126
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,670
Ready to go?

127
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,259
Well, if you say so.

128
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,511
Though it was just starting
to get interesting.

129
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:40,892
The master gave you
no permission to leave.

130
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:43,270
I didn't ask for any.

131
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:53,446
And that's three.

132
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:09,004
Wait. I can't let you leave like this.
My father meant you no harm.

133
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,677
- He had a funny way of showing it.
- My time is short.

134
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:17,971
I have no sons.

135
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:21,558
I need a man to assume my position
when I am gone.

136
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,978
Then it was a test? But why me?

137
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:30,108
Because you are most worthy.
That is now proven beyond any doubt.

138
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,986
And because my precious daughter
loves you.

139
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:43,496
Forget it.

140
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,461
Then this means we must be enemies!

141
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,422
You will regret this insult, detective.

142
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,217
You will...

143
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,347
Father!

144
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:11,066
- He's dying!
- I've had it with your little games.

145
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:13,234
No game, I swear it!

146
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,953
Pulse is bad. He can't fake that.

147
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,415
We must take him to the Lazarus Pit.

148
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,639
You want us to put him in that?
You're crazy!

149
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:46,226
No, listen to me,
I know it is difficult to believe,

150
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:51,272
but the pit is what keeps him alive.
What has kept him alive for 600 years.

151
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:56,444
- Batman?
- Please, you must believe me!

152
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,784
We have no choice.
He's stopped breathing.

153
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:33,940
We've killed him.

154
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:37,193
No. All is well.

155
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,160
Put her down!

156
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:34,834
I said put her down!
