1
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,538
Hey!

2
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:04,749
Who's in here?

3
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,797
This is the fourth
identical poisoning this month.

4
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,520
We've kept the victims alive so far,

5
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,689
but we're not even sure
what kind of poison it is.

6
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:31,192
Why don't you ask the woman who made it?

7
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,319
Poison Ivy.

8
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,738
She was our first guess,
but we ruled her out.

9
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:38,240
- You mean she's still in Arkham?
- No.

10
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,576
She completed her rehabilitation
six months ago.

11
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,994
The board gave her a clean bill.

12
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,165
And now, wealthy bachelors are being
struck down by an unknown toxin.

13
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,334
Sounds like Ivy's MO to me.

14
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,878
I don't think she's interested
in single men anymore.

15
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,254
Hmm?

16
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,506
You haven't heard?

17
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:55,883
Not only did Pamela Isley
clean herself up,

18
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,593
she also got married.

19
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:12,358
Hi. Come on in.

20
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,569
Thank you, Ms. Isley.

21
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:19,281
My pleasure, Commissioner,
though it's Carlyle now.

22
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,575
Mrs. Pamela Lillian Carlyle.

23
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,621
This is my husband, Steven.

24
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,791
Hello, Commissioner.
Nice to see you again.

25
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,793
Dr. Carlyle is our liaison

26
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,996
between the board at Arkham
and the police department.

27
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:36,549
You also teach classes
on criminal psychology at Gotham State.

28
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,217
I've read some of your works.

29
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,760
They were very impressive.

30
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,262
Thank you.

31
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,724
But I get the feeling
this isn't a social call.

32
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,060
Someone is poisoning and robbing
wealthy young men.

33
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:52,648
As painful as it sounds,
all clues point to your wife.

34
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:56,110
- That's outrageous! Pamela hasn't...
- Darling, please.

35
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,780
Batman, I don't doubt
that I was your first,

36
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,532
and probably only suspect.

37
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:05,494
Over the years, you and I
have had a rather intense relationship.

38
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,831
But that's all in the past, believe me.

39
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,834
I look back on what I was,
and I shudder.

40
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:15,379
Locked away in Arkham
with the obsessed and the insane

41
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,090
and me just as lost as any of them.

42
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,801
And then I met Steven.

43
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:24,430
His love and guidance
brought me into the light again.

44
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,391
Mom, Dad,
the Batmobile's outside!

45
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,310
It is, it is! We saw it!

46
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,812
Whoa!

47
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:35,524
Cool. Batman's really here!

48
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:40,613
Mommy, you didn't tell us
you know Batman.

49
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,991
That was a long time ago, sweetie.

50
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,869
These are my boys, Chris and Kelly.

51
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,914
- Hi.
- Can we ride in your car?

52
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,875
Come on, guys.
Let's leave Mom alone for a minute.

53
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,046
Bye, Batman.

54
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,799
I never thought about
having kids before.

55
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:01,842
I can't.

56
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,054
Nature's little tradeoff
for my hyper immune system.

57
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:10,559
And yet, when I met Steven's boys,
something inside me just melted.

58
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:12,812
I guess there really does come a time

59
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,189
when a woman wants
something more in her life.

60
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,191
At least this woman does.

61
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,652
Steven doesn't care about my past.

62
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:22,571
He and the boys accept me
for who I am now.

63
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,866
I don't know who has been duplicating
my old crimes,

64
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:29,870
but I can assure you, gentlemen,
Poison Ivy is dead.

65
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:41,674
Don't tell me the great Dick Grayson
is spending the night in for a change?

66
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,926
Hey, we got finals coming up.

67
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,596
But what about those cheerleaders
I always see chasing you around?

68
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:50,182
Can't they help you pass calculus?

69
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,269
- That's not the reason I asked you over.
- Oh, no?

70
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,730
No. I just thought it would be fun
to get together

71
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,317
and study and talk and, um...

72
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,735
And?

73
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,333
Hello?

74
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,960
It's me.

75
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,753
Oh, hi.

76
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,715
I wasn't expecting to hear
from you tonight.

77
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,758
I'd better go.

78
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,135
Uh...

79
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,553
Do you have company?

80
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:30,764
Not anymore.

81
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,516
Sorry.

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,562
I need you to check on a teacher
there at GSU. Steven Carlyle.

83
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,231
I was in his class last year. Nice guy.

84
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:42,359
- He's not in trouble, is he?
- Possibly.

85
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,486
See what you can find on him.

86
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,239
Family history,
places he's worked, anything.

87
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,658
Right. I'll check back with you later.

88
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:52,620
Cindy?

89
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,985
I'm so sorry.

90
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,365
It's all my fault.
If only I hadn't left him.

91
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,824
It's all right.

92
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,912
I had just gone back to my room
when I heard a loud crash.

93
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:38,040
I ran down here, and Dick was gone.

94
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,012
And you saw no one
leaving the dorm?

95
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,210
No.

96
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,672
I don't think Dick
is the only victim, Mr. Wayne.

97
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,007
You mean they kidnapped him
to get at me.

98
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:50,803
It fits the pattern. Wealthy single men,
all targets of robberies.

99
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:54,181
Only, in your case, you have something
more valuable to hold for ransom.

100
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,559
My ward.

101
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,132
Keep driving, or your neck gets
a new air hole.

102
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,175
What do you want?

103
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,722
I do the talking.

104
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,434
Bring five million in cash to the docks
tomorrow midnight.

105
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,311
Come alone, or the kid is history.

106
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,897
Nod if you understand.

107
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,525
Smart boy.

108
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:10,549
I expect
there's no other option?

109
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,303
The money's not important.
Getting Dick back is.

110
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,721
Agreed, Master Bruce.

111
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,933
But even so, didn't the kidnapper
leave some clue for Batman to follow?

112
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:23,353
Just my torn shirt.
I'll have to fall back on my instincts.

113
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:27,191
And right now, they're saying
Ivy's fairy tale lifestyle

114
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,859
isn't everything it seems.

115
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,791
Wait for me, guys.

116
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,169
Bye, honey. Love you.

117
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,273
<i>What's she doing now, sir?</i>

118
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,651
Buying squash.

119
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,278
I've been keeping tabs
on her all morning.

120
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,966
And so far, she's done
nothing more incriminating

121
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,784
than return an overdue video.

122
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,160
Even paid the late fee.

123
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,580
<i>Could it be Poison Ivy truly
has reformed?</i>

124
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,667
I want to believe it. Why can't I?

125
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:33,340
The greenhouse checks out too.
Nothing but plants and flowers.

126
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:34,466
<i>Sir?</i>

127
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,677
Later.

128
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,647
- Can we watch cartoons?
- After your homework.

129
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:54,278
This is a dead end.
I haven't found anything that...

130
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,286
There are laws against spying on people.

131
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,832
There are laws against
poisoning them too.

132
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,128
Look around, Batman.

133
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:15,299
I've got a nice house, a little garden
and a family that loves me.

134
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,926
Why would I jeopardize that?

135
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:21,513
For the first time in my life,
I'm happy.

136
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:24,057
I'm beginning to think you're right.

137
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:27,269
Batman?

138
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:30,522
Good luck.

139
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,358
You too, Mrs. Carlyle.

140
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:52,586
Wayne,
kick the case over here.

141
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,421
Let me see the boy.

142
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,593
The money. Now!

143
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,559
Send out the boy.

144
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,063
You hear me?

145
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,731
I hear you.

146
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,261
Goodbye, Mr. Wayne.

147
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,914
Time to hit the drink.

148
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,253
I guess I should be grateful that thing
used a fist on me and not poison.

149
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,923
Right. But we're still in the dark
as to who's behind this.

150
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,884
You don't think it's the plant lady?

151
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:07,095
All she wants is to be left alone
with her husband and sons.

152
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,016
- Sons?
- Carlyle's two boys, Chris and Kelly.

153
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:12,392
I know Chris and Kelly.

154
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,480
I was in Carlyle's class when his ex
brought them to visit last year.

155
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,191
I thought Carlyle had custody.

156
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,777
No. And here's another shocker for you.

157
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,946
Chris and Kelly are girls.

158
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,183
Hmm.

159
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,195
No sign of Ivy.

160
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:06,822
What's that?

161
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,198
Insurance.

162
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,131
Plastic?

163
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:50,115
Just a happy little homemaker, huh?

164
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,802
- Dr. Carlyle?
- Help me.

165
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,141
She's insane. Has to be stopped.

166
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,853
- You don't know what she's done.
- Mommy.

167
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:33,158
Mommy.

168
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:34,576
No.

169
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:41,124
It... It isn't possible.

170
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,543
- Mommy.
- Mommy.

171
00:16:44,544 --> 00:16:46,379
I was her doctor in Arkham.

172
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,632
She said she wanted to reform.

173
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,344
I trusted her, let her get too close.

174
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:05,565
One little kiss, and dear Steven
was my slave.

175
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,485
He was useful in signing
my release papers,

176
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:12,072
and for supplying certain raw materials
for my experiments

177
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,700
but the marriage was, well, a fake.

178
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,037
And these mutations?

179
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,540
Our children, Batman.

180
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,544
Plant-based life forms
enhanced with Steven's DNA.

181
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,004
They're not truly human.

182
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,550
In fact, their life spans are somewhat
like certain rare flowers

183
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,553
that blossom and die in a few days.

184
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,054
I see.

185
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:38,431
At first it looks like a child.

186
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,809
Then it resembles Dr. Carlyle.

187
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,271
- And in its final phase...
- In its final phase,

188
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,022
before it burns itself out...

189
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:51,027
The creature becomes my willing enforcer
and bodyguard.

190
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,868
Thief and kidnapper
is more like it.

191
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:03,665
It costs money to raise a family.

192
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:07,210
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Yes, I have.

193
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:10,797
I meant it when I said I wanted
a family that loves me.

194
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,383
I just wanted it on my terms.

195
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,219
Lady, you're nuts.

196
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,555
Well, that's your opinion.

197
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:21,474
Probably the last one
you'll ever have, too.

198
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,934
Kids?

199
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,231
That water I fed them
contained a super active growth formula.

200
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,776
True, it cuts their life span down
to just a few minutes,

201
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,528
but that's more time than you've got.

202
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,348
This way, Doc.

203
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:19,366
Great. She gave her little family
the formula too.

204
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,329
Stay with Carlyle!

205
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,927
Anyone else want their weeds whacked?

206
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,156
Come on.

207
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,375
My darlings!

208
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:15,588
Weed killer.

209
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,800
I figured what you were up to
involved plants

210
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:21,136
so I pumped your water tanks
with herbicide.

211
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,848
What was the tip-off, Batman?
Steven's kids?

212
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,310
You couldn't replicate them as girls,
not with Carlyle's DNA.

213
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,730
So, you took your chance with boys.

214
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,774
But Ivy could replicate herself.

215
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,529
What?

216
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,165
Guess you weren't the only one
with an escape plan, huh, Batman?

217
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,351
Most of the stolen property
was still in the lab

218
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,395
along with Ivy's toxin formulas.

219
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,190
Well, at least we have Ivy's toxins
to form an antidote.

220
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,817
I'm just sorry she got away.

221
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:21,905
Me too, Robin. But I don't think
we'll see her again anytime soon.

222
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:28,745
<i>Ivy lost everything she had.</i>

223
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,915
<i>Everything she said she ever wanted.</i>

224
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,088
<i>For what it's worth,
I believed her when she told me</i>

225
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,342
<i>for the first time in her life,
she was happy.</i>
