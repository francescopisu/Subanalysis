1
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,792
What's keeping him?

2
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,860
Commissioner Gordon?

3
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:59,118
- Forget it, Stavros.
- Your meeting's been canceled.

4
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,586
He's on his way, boss.

5
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,602
No! No!

6
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,911
Please, please. It's not what you think.

7
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,997
I wasn't gonna say anything. Honest.

8
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,457
Silence!

9
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,626
First you transgress against me.

10
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,213
Then you force me to descend
to the mortal plane.

11
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:55,633
And now you say I know not what I think?

12
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,259
No!

13
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,179
To the depths of Tartarus with you.

14
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,280
He's a lucky guy. If those tires
hadn't absorbed the shock, he...

15
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,574
Just a minute.
The weather was perfectly clear tonight,

16
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,077
and you're telling me that man
was struck by lightning?

17
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:26,831
I guess you'll have to ask him
what happened whenever he wakes up.

18
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,759
His name is Yanni Stavros.

19
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,303
He works
for Maximillian Shipping Lines.

20
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,556
As a scheduler.

21
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,600
- You know him?
- He's been under Interpol investigation

22
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,562
for selling vital shipping schedules
to hijackers.

23
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,983
That fits. Stavros had offered
to give me some information

24
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,546
so he could cut a deal with the feds.

25
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,820
What kind of information?

26
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,322
Ever hear of something called an EDC?

27
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,533
The Electron Discharge Cannon.

28
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,493
A fourth-generation energy weapon

29
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,371
being developed
by a combined US-European alliance.

30
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,916
Then you probably know
this prototype was stolen last month

31
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,668
while it was being shipped overseas.

32
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:14,604
<i>This film contains
classified information</i>

33
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:19,008
<i>on defense project 406562,
the Electron Discharge Cannon.</i>

34
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,010
<i>For authorized personnel only.</i>

35
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:25,139
And you think Stavros was either
involved in the theft or knows who was.

36
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,482
I pray that he does,

37
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,568
because if that infernal device
falls into the wrong hands...

38
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,906
Maybe it already has.

39
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,998
The grand jury is building another case,

40
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,000
and I can't stop them this time.

41
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,504
There are allegations of bribery,
extortion and racketeering,

42
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,464
all pointing back to you, Max.

43
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:03,677
Sure, I'm your assistant, but there's
only so much I can do on my own.

44
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:08,599
Max? Maxie? Come on,
look at me when I'm talking to you.

45
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:12,102
You bore me with these tales
of petty human concerns.

46
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,563
You're doing it again, Maxie.

47
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,316
You are Clio, my muse of history.

48
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,069
Amuse me with tales of ancient times,

49
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:23,197
when mortals trembled
at the name of Zeus.

50
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,825
You want a story? I got one.

51
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,827
Seems there was this guy named Max,

52
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,871
who, because he had been lucky so far
in the smuggling racket,

53
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:35,251
believed himself to be untouchable,
superior, godlike.

54
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,380
There's a cynical edge to your voice
I don't appreciate.

55
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,009
Know you not I am above mortal
constraints of right and wrong?

56
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,303
No one is above the law, Max.

57
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,350
I make my own laws.

58
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:57,439
Maxie, please. Don't look at me
as if you don't know me.

59
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,028
What's happened to you? To us?

60
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,448
After all we've been through together.
After all we meant to...

61
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,827
What's that?

62
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,547
Who dares?

63
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,840
Of course.

64
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:28,262
Like the shadow of ebon-winged night,
he rises from the dark realm.

65
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:32,600
Behold, the coming of my brother,
Lord Hades!

66
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,568
Welcome, Lord Hades.

67
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:45,529
Be serious, Max. That's Batman.

68
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,115
But Batman is a mere mortal.

69
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,286
And what mortal could reach
the summit of Mount Olympus and survive?

70
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,665
Come, dark brother. Avail yourself
of the nectar of the gods.

71
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,792
No, thanks.

72
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,378
I just want to ask you
a few questions about...

73
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:06,592
Hold. The words of the gods
are not for the ears of mere muses.

74
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:11,013
Yep, that's me,
just a lowly muse. Whatever.

75
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,726
Now, my brother, what brings you to me?

76
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:18,729
Has Lord Vulcan
been causing you trouble again?

77
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,443
The Batman? Upstairs?

78
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,946
What do we do?

79
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,907
If His Lordship wants us, he'll holler.

80
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,869
You're taking this too lightly, Alex.
We're in trouble.

81
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,204
Maxie's worse than ever.

82
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,832
When was the last time you saw him
wear real clothes in the office?

83
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,835
You know the boss and Greek stuff.
It's his thing.

84
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,090
Well, his thing is about to blow
this shipping firm out of the water.

85
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:47,758
And maybe Maxie with it.

86
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,470
An Electron Discharge Cannon?

87
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,431
You run one of the world's
largest shipping firms.

88
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,685
I thought you might know
how the hijackers were able to move it.

89
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,896
Why should Zeus be concerned
about the weapons of man

90
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,691
when he can call forth
thunderbolts of his own?

91
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,617
This audience is at an end.

92
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,412
Awake, my harpies.

93
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,087
Begone, Lord Hades.
Get thee back to thine own realm.

94
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,257
Do not come again
to Olympus until bidden.

95
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,342
I think I get the message.

96
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,290
Oh, Max, what's happening to you?

97
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,678
Hey, you called, boss... I mean,
thou didst summon us, O great Zeus?

98
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,430
Indeed I did.

99
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:19,558
For you are to be among
the first pitiful mortals

100
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,728
to bear witness to
the dawn of a new age.

101
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:32,738
Soon all mortals will tremble once more

102
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:36,241
at the fury of Zeus reborn!

103
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,417
Come back to me, Maxie.

104
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,840
What do you want?

105
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,470
The same thing you do.

106
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,057
To help Maximillian Zeus.

107
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,939
He wasn't always this way, you know.

108
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:11,652
But then business got bad and
he started handling cargo for the mob.

109
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:16,782
After a while, with the pressure,
the tension, things got confused.

110
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,368
He's not living in
the real world anymore.

111
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,162
Maybe you can relate to that.

112
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:27,417
You're the only one who can get me
close enough to help him,

113
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,379
while some of the man
you knew still exists.

114
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:07,708
This is as far as I can take you.
Now you're on your own.

115
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,337
Batman?

116
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,226
This isn't the roof.

117
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,148
Sorry, Ms. Droukas. Boss's orders.

118
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,734
This is as far as you go.

119
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,409
Like Bellerophon astride winged Pegasus,

120
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:46,538
yon foolish mortals
dare encroach on sacred Olympus.

121
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:50,500
- Does he mean us?
- Get thee back unto the mortal plane!

122
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,009
No, Maxie! Not the cops!

123
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,460
I don't believe it.

124
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,774
- It's on fire!
- It's gonna crash.

125
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:45,681
- It's gonna explode.
- Oh, no!

126
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,224
Get back!

127
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:01,989
Feel the wrath of Zeus,
thou insignificant...

128
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,492
Max, what have you done?
You could have killed someone!

129
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:09,162
How dare you speak with such disloyalty!

130
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,165
But, Maxie, please, you know I love you.

131
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,503
Clio? I'm sorry. I can't...

132
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,174
Thou art no longer fit to be among us!

133
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,969
Tie her to the thunderbolt of Zeus.

134
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,492
But, boss, don't you think
you may be carrying things a bit...

135
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,268
Alexander, will thou do my bidding?

136
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,232
Nothing personal, Ms. Droukas.

137
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:51,288
So, no longer like an eagle
against the sky,

138
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:56,543
but as a worm crawling though the dirt
does Lord Hades try to regain Olympus.

139
00:13:56,626 --> 00:14:00,380
Look on my works,
ye mighty, and despair.

140
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:29,451
<i>Heracles bested 12 labors
before I received him.</i>

141
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,246
<i>And so it shall be with you, bat demon.</i>

142
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:53,702
<i>So, you have survived my hydra.
But many more challenges await.</i>

143
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,745
Alas.

144
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,663
Farewell, my dark brother.

145
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:07,067
Be not afraid, my muse.

146
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,862
For once thou hast been cleansed
by the fire from Olympus,

147
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:15,450
thou shalt be as a goddess
at my side throughout eternity!

148
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,832
Let the heavens scream!

149
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,876
Let the earth tremble!

150
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:45,063
Let mortals know
the gods of old live again!

151
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,740
It's over, Maxie.

152
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,910
Alexander, destroy the bat demon.

153
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:03,582
- But, boss, maybe we shouldn't...
- Traitors! My harpies, awake.

154
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,459
Destroy all who oppose me!

155
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,197
Ah.

156
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,532
Thank you, Bat... Look out!

157
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,243
Begone, thou foul bat demon!

158
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,125
Get thee back to the underworld
where thee belongs!

159
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,380
Such is the fate of all
who dare to thwart the gods.

160
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,902
Oh, no.

161
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,539
It's going to fire!

162
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,751
No!

163
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:13,712
That's mine!

164
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,392
Maxie, no!

165
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,232
Get down!

166
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,216
Now, this is truly Olympus.

167
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,677
Surely, it can be no other place.

168
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,390
There's beautiful Demeter,
goddess of the harvest.

169
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:15,106
And double-faced Janus,
lord of beginnings and endings.

170
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,073
And merry Hermes,
the trickster of the gods.

171
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,544
Now at last, mighty Zeus is home.
