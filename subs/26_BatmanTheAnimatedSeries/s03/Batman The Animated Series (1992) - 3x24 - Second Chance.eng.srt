1
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,665
You think Dr. Crest is right?

2
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:07,627
You think this operation
will make Harvey okay again?

3
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,045
I don't know.

4
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:12,548
We can only hope.

5
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,729
Give me that file.

6
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,402
- I'll get him.
- Look out, Harvey!

7
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:43,412
Harvey!

8
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,546
Harvey.

9
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,007
No.

10
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,484
Your bad side
is almost completely submerged.

11
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,195
You've done very well
in therapy, Harvey.

12
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,239
You're more in control now,

13
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,243
able to make decisions for yourself
without relying on chance.

14
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,870
Now it's time for the final step,

15
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:28,290
erasing the scars that created Two-Face.

16
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:31,127
I believe that once you are whole again,

17
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:35,715
your mind will be strong enough
to banish Two-Face permanently.

18
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,510
- Bruce Wayne picked up the tab for this?
- Yes.

19
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,971
Good old Bruce.
He's never given up on me.

20
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,849
Always been my best friend.

21
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:49,478
I remember when we used to close
the town at the Half Moon Club.

22
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:51,397
Most fun we ever had.

23
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:54,567
Heard they were tearing
the old place down.

24
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:58,279
I guess nothing good lasts forever.

25
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,032
He's ready. Let's do it.

26
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,752
No! What are you doing?

27
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,003
Stop!

28
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:22,636
Come on!

29
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,849
Sorry, his insurance
don't cover this.

30
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:33,689
Don't hurt him.
Boss wants to handle Dent personally.

31
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,608
Said he wants to teach him some respect.

32
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,320
Take a load off.

33
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,863
Ow!

34
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,007
Man, talk about malpractice.

35
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,681
Hey. Slow down.

36
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:13,729
You take the sedan.
I'll go after the other one.

37
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,089
Clean your windshield, mister?

38
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:03,654
Hmm.

39
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,701
Scratch one bat.

40
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,837
The van was registered to Rupert Thorne.

41
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,506
But Harvey was in the sedan.

42
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,257
It was headed for Stonegate.

43
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:49,259
The Penguin's in Stonegate.

44
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,762
He's had a grudge
against Two-Face for a while now.

45
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:53,722
Maybe this is his revenge.

46
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,516
Sorry I wasn't able to stop them.

47
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:57,893
I'm sure you did your best.

48
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:01,146
Don't gush all over me.
It's embarrassing.

49
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:11,407
Sorry. Harvey's my friend.
I'm worried about him.

50
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:14,326
Right, and I'm just the kid in tights.

51
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,287
I'll see you
after I've checked out Thorne.

52
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,054
<i>I remember when we used
to close the town at the Half Moon Club.</i>

53
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,849
<i>Most fun we ever had.</i>

54
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,335
May I help you?

55
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:24,063
Frankie here says they found you
snooping around my roof. Why?

56
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,900
- What are you trying to find?
- Not "what," Thorne, "who."

57
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,320
Somebody grabbed Harvey Dent
out of Gotham Central Hospital.

58
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:36,158
Somebody nabbed Two-Face,
and you thought I did it?

59
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,535
That's great.

60
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:41,288
I wish. I really hate that guy.

61
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,207
He tried to put me out of business.

62
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,250
I've been planning what I'd do

63
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,170
if I ever got my hands on him again,
and I'll tell you...

64
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:51,090
No, better yet, as long as you're here,

65
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:52,424
I'll show you.

66
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,678
Boys, take the Boy Wonder here
down to Gotham Gate Bridge

67
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,056
and see how well he flies.

68
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,101
Thanks for giving an old man
a good laugh, kid.

69
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,812
Nice knowing you.

70
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,643
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to fish around here.

71
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,229
Can't do it anymore.

72
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,232
Know why? Too much garbage.

73
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:52,734
You wouldn't believe the stuff
people toss in the river.

74
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,070
It's disgusting.

75
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,624
People today got no respect
for Mother Nature.

76
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,085
Sooner or later, just you wait.

77
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,211
They'll be sorry.

78
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,891
Not all the garbage is in the river.

79
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,363
Dance, my little ones.

80
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,532
Dance for Penguin.

81
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:46,330
Excellent.

82
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:48,665
A terpsichorean triumph.

83
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,170
And what might you be doing out there?

84
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,214
Catching insects for dinner?

85
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,257
I'm looking for Two-Face.

86
00:11:57,507 --> 00:12:00,677
Why? Did you lose him?

87
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,722
Somebody kidnapped him
from Gotham Central tonight.

88
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,433
You and he had a disagreement
some time ago.

89
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,435
- Didn't you?
- It's true.

90
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,313
Harvey stole a rare <i>avis</i>
right out from under my beak

91
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:12,564
several months ago.

92
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,943
A jewel-encrusted statuette
of a two-headed roc.

93
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:17,778
It was worth millions.

94
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:22,908
But, my dear rodent, I'd never kidnap
a fellow rogue out of a sickbed.

95
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,868
It just isn't done.

96
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,704
- Honor among thieves?
- Absolutely.

97
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,165
If I were going to attack Harvey,
I'd do it

98
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,044
face-to-face, to-face. So to speak.

99
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:35,921
Like this!

100
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,569
Over here, you fools.

101
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,489
He's down there. Down there.

102
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,382
Any luck with Thorne?

103
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,426
Thorne didn't kidnap Harvey.

104
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,011
Neither did the Penguin.

105
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,430
But I think I know who did.

106
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:46,950
Doctors and nurses working in the O.R.

107
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,202
wear paper socks over their shoes,

108
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,456
so this footprint had to be made
by one of the kidnappers.

109
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,875
Masonry dust.

110
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,127
I know where to find him now.

111
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,546
Find who? Who did this?

112
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,757
Harvey's worst enemy.

113
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:03,425
I'll take it from here.

114
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,469
Wait a second. You might need me.

115
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,970
Not this time, Robin.

116
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,473
This is something I have to do alone.

117
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:32,454
You may as well come out.

118
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,664
I know everything now.

119
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,552
You hated Harvey Dent

120
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,180
and would do anything to destroy him.

121
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,349
Why not?

122
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,476
He was gonna destroy me,

123
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:57,354
just like I'm gonna destroy you.

124
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,904
You kidnapped yourself.

125
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,781
I should've seen it right away.

126
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,201
One red herring clue wasn't enough.
You had to leave two.

127
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:56,538
I couldn't let that wimp
Dent destroy me.

128
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,875
I had to teach the little man
some respect.

129
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,670
Everybody needs respect.

130
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:05,505
You're your own worst enemy, Harvey.

131
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,551
No. I'm your worst enemy.

132
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:10,886
See this?

133
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,431
It's the remote control
for that detonator.

134
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,143
Once my boys and I
get down to the ground,

135
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:20,854
I'll use it to set off that dynamite.

136
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,358
Unless, of course,
the coin says different.

137
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,694
What do you say, Batman?

138
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:30,238
Feeling lucky?

139
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,325
Looks like I don't have
much choice.

140
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:37,662
Let it hit the floor.

141
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,080
I wanna see it.

142
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,377
That can't happen.

143
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,137
No. It isn't possible.

144
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,349
It can't land on edge.

145
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,226
It has to be heads or tails.

146
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,103
How can I decide
if it isn't heads or tails?

147
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,241
On edge, it's still on edge.

148
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,122
No!

149
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,605
Heads or tails. I have to know.

150
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,982
Heads or tails.

151
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,913
Harvey. Pull yourself up.

152
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,333
I can't. I'll drop the coin.

153
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,793
Drop it. Save yourself.

154
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,837
I... I don't know what to do.

155
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,339
The coin won't tell me.

156
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,299
It can't tell you anything.

157
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:56,801
I switched coins when you grabbed me.

158
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:04,726
Good thing I decided to tag along
after all.

159
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,854
It's a trick coin.

160
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:09,773
It'll always land on edge.

161
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,983
It's your decision now, Harvey.

162
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,777
Life or death.

163
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,571
The coin or me.

164
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:36,091
Batman, help me.

165
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,471
Never.

166
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,974
Harvey!

167
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:17,799
Bruce. Good old Bruce.

168
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,634
Always there.

169
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:21,302
You never give up on me.

170
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,642
He's right.

171
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,936
- You're always there for him.
- Yes.

172
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,313
Just like you're always there for me.

173
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,275
Hey, what are friends for?
