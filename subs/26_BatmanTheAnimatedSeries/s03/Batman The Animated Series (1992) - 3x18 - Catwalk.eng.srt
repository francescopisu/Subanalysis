1
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,125
<i>Poor baby. I used to
be just like you.</i>

2
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,420
<i>A child of the night, wild and free.</i>

3
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:40,474
<i>I was the cat who walked by herself,
and the city was my hunting ground.</i>

4
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,644
<i>I'd prowl through Gotham each evening,</i>

5
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:47,815
<i>going where I liked
and taking whatever I wanted.</i>

6
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,792
<i>Until I met him.</i>

7
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,321
<i>I gave him my best fight,
but in the end,</i>

8
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,407
<i>kitty got her claws clipped.</i>

9
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,627
<i>Had to promise I'd be a good little pet
and walk on a leash.</i>

10
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:53,047
<i>Even if it killed me.</i>

11
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,691
Oh, you just say that
to all the beautiful girls.

12
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:16,237
Selina? Excuse me.

13
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,032
Selina?

14
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:28,499
"Extinction." I can relate to that.

15
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,459
You're in a cheery mood.

16
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,212
Giving up Catwoman
hasn't been easy, Bruce.

17
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,423
I miss the excitement, the danger.

18
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,467
Sometimes I feel so tempted.

19
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,137
Even though you'd be risking prison?

20
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,180
Tell me I'm not in a cage now.

21
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:44,557
Bruce Wayne.

22
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,226
I wondered where
you'd been hiding yourself.

23
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,688
And whom, may I ask,
is your attractive date?

24
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,941
- Veronica Vreeland, meet Selina Kyle.
- We've met.

25
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,446
- At the wildlife fundraiser last year?
- Oh, of course.

26
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:01,907
- Love what you've done to your hair.
- Thanks.

27
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:05,661
Since you're so devoted
to wildlife, Selina,

28
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:09,248
I can't wait to hear what you think
of the museum's new conservation hall.

29
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:13,043
I had it built in honor
of my grandfather, Stanton Vreeland.

30
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:16,881
He was the first to realize the
importance of preserving rare animals.

31
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:20,593
Not surprising, considering
how many of them he obliterated.

32
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,094
Excuse me?

33
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,472
Stanton Vreeland was a playboy sportsman

34
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,349
who'd blow away anything
that wandered into his gunsight.

35
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,644
He had to preserve animals
or he'd have nothing left to shoot.

36
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,229
Is that right?

37
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:33,647
Uh-huh!

38
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,026
In fact, most of these critters are gone
thanks to trigger-happy jerks

39
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:39,528
- like old Grandpa.
- Selina.

40
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,656
But, Bruce,
Miss Vreeland asked me what I thought.

41
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:44,575
I think you've said enough.

42
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,036
Yes, perhaps I have.

43
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,752
Just once I'd like to throw a party
without some kook showing up.

44
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,545
Uh. Excuse me.

45
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,513
Well, that was pretty rude.

46
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,389
Just the cat in me, I guess.

47
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,977
Look, Bruce, it was sweet of you
to invite me, but I don't fit in here.

48
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,772
Sometimes I feel like
I don't fit in anywhere.

49
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,367
Taxi.

50
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,707
- Your ride, Miss Kyle.
- Hey. What the...

51
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:44,552
- Let me out, you big ape.
- She's a live one.

52
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,263
In two seconds, that'll be more
than I can say about you.

53
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,932
Calm down, pussycat.
We're all friends here.

54
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,519
Dummy, don't keep
our pretty guest in the dark.

55
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,563
Yes, sir, Mr. Scarf ace.

56
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:57,481
Ah! That's better.

57
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,609
You gotta be kidding.

58
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,614
What's she laughing at?
My fly ain't open, is it?

59
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:08,033
- No, sir.
- So, what's the gag?

60
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,663
Come on. You know. "What's the gag?"

61
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,039
Can it, sister.

62
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,668
This is Scarf ace you're dealing with
and I don't stand for no disrespect.

63
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,714
I'd do as he says, ma'am.
Mr. Scarf ace can be quite insistent.

64
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:23,716
I don't think anyone's talking to you.

65
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,635
- No, sir. No, sir.
- Right.

66
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:28,721
So, what do you want with me?

67
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,681
My boys happened to be in the museum

68
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:33,267
when they saw your little set-to
with Miss Ronnie V.

69
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,686
They also seen you licking your whiskers

70
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:38,063
at the sight of Ronnie's
pretty sparklers.

71
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,149
You're boring me, log.

72
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:46,238
So, what if I could provide you with a
foolproof plan for snatching those rocks

73
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,699
with no risk of you getting caught?

74
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:53,203
Pass. Kitty's been staying in at night.

75
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:56,874
It's not the greatest, but it beats
the pound, if you know what I mean.

76
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,667
Now that's a darn shame.

77
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:02,171
And I thought for sure you'd want
a chance to get even with the Vreelands.

78
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,506
Not just for yourself, you understand,

79
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,343
but for all those
poor little stuffed critters

80
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,804
what never had the chance to fight back.

81
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,015
Oh! Barf.

82
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,516
It's a 50-50 cut.

83
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,727
Take it or leave it. You in, or what?

84
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:38,791
You know what, Isis?

85
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,711
Extinction's for wimps.

86
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,519
Mastodon, check.

87
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,063
Cave bear, check.

88
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,523
Saber-tooth.

89
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:03,607
Huh?

90
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:11,448
Well, where did you come from?

91
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,912
Aw, poor girl.
Must've wandered in and got lost.

92
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,664
I'll let you out back.

93
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,965
Excuse me, Mr. Scarf ace,

94
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:31,635
but isn't it cruel to take advantage
of that nice Miss Kyle?

95
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,804
Hold my hat, will you?

96
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,349
- Bam!
- Ow!

97
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,685
That's what you get
for going soft on me.

98
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:41,228
Yes, sir.

99
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,650
There. The guard's putting
the cat out like I planned.

100
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,986
<i>Catwoman should have
all the time she needs</i>

101
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:50,821
<i>to lift the jewels and split.</i>

102
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,907
This one's for the Vreelands.

103
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,872
But plans can change, can't they, Rhino?

104
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:01,623
Right, boss.

105
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,175
Huh?

106
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,347
Great. Someone else
is hitting the place.

107
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:21,977
Okay, boys, to work.

108
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,707
Sorry, kitty. You're taking the fall.

109
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,220
Hold it.

110
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:01,141
Could you please give me a hand?

111
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,894
This dinosaur seems to
have fallen on me.

112
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:08,232
- How did you...
- It's a dull story, handsome.

113
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,005
The Catwoman.

114
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:33,632
Watch out!

115
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:44,434
- Where is she?
- Couldn't have missed her.

116
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,612
Looks like the hunt's on again, Isis.

117
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,033
I think a quick trip
out of town is in order.

118
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,286
Don't buy your ticket yet.

119
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,498
What a pleasant surprise.

120
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:10,169
Though I should warn you, breaking
and entering is against the law.

121
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:14,381
You would know. Care to explain what
you were doing at the museum tonight?

122
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:19,136
Look, I was there earlier for a party,
and I kind of lost my temper.

123
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,889
I went back to apologize,
and the place was empty,

124
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,432
except for the burglars.

125
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:27,227
I happened to have my outfit in the car,
and I thought if I nailed the robbers

126
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,688
I could work up some
points with the cops.

127
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,356
Maybe even with you.

128
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:37,070
I know how bad this looks for me,
but it wasn't my fault.

129
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,412
Would you come back to the museum
and tell your story to the authorities?

130
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:48,707
I suppose, if you're with me.

131
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:53,253
- After all, we do make a good team.
- When we're on the same side.

132
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,481
The police are still
talking to the guard.

133
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,691
That gives us a few minutes
to look around.

134
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:17,319
I was looking at this exhibit earlier.

135
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:21,657
It's brand-new. Why would
they remove the animals so soon?

136
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:28,121
This lock's been sprung.

137
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,124
Our thief is clever,
using dummy cards to cover his tracks.

138
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,003
An extinct-animal trophy is worth
a fortune to the crook who can fence it.

139
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,881
"All those poor little
stuffed critters."

140
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,008
That's what he was after all along.

141
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,219
You're not telling me something.

142
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:45,013
You know what's wrong
with our relationship?

143
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:47,975
You always let me get too close.

144
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:55,691
Excuse me.
I have a date with a scratching post.

145
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,839
We don't have to make this difficult.

146
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:21,300
But somehow we always do.

147
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:26,680
Selina?

148
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,863
In here!

149
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,759
That's right, Penguin.

150
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:48,261
I got your bird just like I promised.

151
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,889
Of course, it'll cost you extra.

152
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:55,394
Hey, you don't want it, fine.

153
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,313
I can always use it for pillow stuffing.

154
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:00,607
Ah...

155
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,984
See there? I knew you'd be reasonable.

156
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,199
While I got you on the horn,
can I interest you in a Tasmanian tiger?

157
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,284
A steal at only two mil.

158
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:16,039
No, huh? That's okay.

159
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:19,376
I got a client dying
to get her paws on it.

160
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,719
I thought I saw a pussycat.

161
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,003
Let go!

162
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:10,635
You know, I never had much use
for animals, except Rhino here.

163
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,387
Thanks, boss.

164
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,265
Then it hit me, some rich geeks
will pay big bucks

165
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,517
for critters they can't go out
and shoot no more.

166
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:20,103
You know what these things
are worth dead?

167
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,771
More than my life, I bet.

168
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,440
You win, kitten.

169
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,360
I needed a dummy to keep the cops busy
while I grabbed the stiffs.

170
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,739
So you conned me
into that phony jewel robbery.

171
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:33,116
Too bad for you you figured it out.

172
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:38,663
Now we're gonna find out if there really
is more than one way to skin a cat.

173
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,583
- Rhino.
- No!

174
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,425
Ow!

175
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,885
Lousy fleabag.

176
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,065
Oh, Great. Him, I don't need.

177
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:09,319
I don't know whether to bite you
or kiss you.

178
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:15,283
Later.

179
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,708
Get me out of here.

180
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:30,757
Hurry!

181
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,427
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

182
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,305
- Put me down.
- Sure.

183
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,018
Uh-oh.

184
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,520
Mr. Scarf ace!

185
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:50,694
Let's let the chips fall where they may.

186
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:55,407
Get me off of here. Dummy, help me.

187
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,800
Help, help! Someone do something!

188
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,177
Please, let me save him.

189
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,097
Hmm, nah!

190
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:23,310
Dummy, please!

191
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:34,946
Phew!

192
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:38,116
Phew!

193
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,043
Huh?

194
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:04,309
That's one way to remove a splinter.

195
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,231
What's wrong, Ventriloquist?
Cat got your tongue?

196
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,568
Please, I never hurt you.

197
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:17,113
Scarf ace, he's another person.
Not me, really.

198
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,199
But he's inside you somewhere.

199
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:22,494
And I'm going to keep scratching
until I find him.

200
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,123
Don't make it harder on yourself.

201
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,210
- He cost me my freedom.
- No.

202
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,088
You gave it up.
From the very start I suspected

203
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:35,291
there was more to this business
than you were telling.

204
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,593
So I put a transmitter on your cat
back at your apartment.

205
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,346
It led me here in time to hear
your confession.

206
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,933
- Why did you do it, Selina?
- I have to be who I am.

207
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,646
I realize now I can't change that.
Like I told someone else tonight...

208
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:51,815
It's just the cat in me.

209
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,952
It's priceless, Batman.
The last of its kind.

210
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,955
Will you take me in
or let it become extinct again?

211
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,999
The lady or the tiger, darling.

212
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,251
Your choice.

213
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,361
<i>I am the cat who
walks by herself.</i>
