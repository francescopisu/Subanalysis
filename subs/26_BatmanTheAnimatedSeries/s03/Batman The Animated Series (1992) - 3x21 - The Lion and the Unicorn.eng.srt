1
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,533
That's good enough, Alfred.

2
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:36,470
The people I deal with out there
won't mind a little lint.

3
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,558
A job worth doing and all that rot,
Master Bruce.

4
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,021
I do wish you would put on a shirt.

5
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,273
You're apt to catch cold
in this dank cave.

6
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:57,783
Yes, folks, a perfect 10
for Dick Grayson to take the gold.

7
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,994
And the crowd goes wild.

8
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:02,663
Yeah!

9
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,707
- Did you hear me, Master Dick?
- Yeah, all right!

10
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,586
Yes, Alfred. Right away, Alfred.

11
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:20,014
I've fixed your supper.
It's upstairs, in the oven.

12
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,517
- What would we do without you, Alfred?
- I shudder to think.

13
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,404
- Good evening. Wayne Manor.
<i>- Alfie?</i>

14
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,407
- It's your cousin Freddie.
- Frederick?

15
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:42,036
<i>I say, old thing, could you
meet me at the usual place?</i>

16
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:43,829
<i>It's rather urgent.</i>

17
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,666
Yes, of course. I'll leave immediately.

18
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,459
Now what?

19
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,936
Hey, was a butlers' strike called?

20
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,855
I came down for breakfast,
and all I found was this.

21
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,399
Where's Alfred?

22
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,153
"Dear Master Bruce, my apologies for
leaving so abruptly."

23
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,240
"I've just learned of a personal matter
involving a cousin of mine"

24
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:21,117
"that must be resolved immediately."

25
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,828
"I shall endeavor to return
in a few days."

26
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:25,621
"Your obedient servant, Alfred."

27
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:27,331
Must be pretty important.

28
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,720
Alfred wouldn't leave
a dirty dish unwashed

29
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,419
if England were sinking into the sea.

30
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,045
I know.

31
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,523
- Frederick?
- Hello. Is that Alfie?

32
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:55,359
- Mr. Pennyworth will do.
- Right then.

33
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,113
It's Freddie sent us.
Wants you to come with us.

34
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:02,950
- Frederick sent you?
- That's right, old love. Come along now.

35
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,578
- We'll pop around and see him.
- I think not.

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,790
Frederick knows I hate being called
Alfie as much as he hates Freddie.

37
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,127
- What have you done with him?
- Grab him, Bert.

38
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,022
Hello?

39
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,859
Good evening, Master Bruce. I'm so sorry
to have disturbed your rest.

40
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,862
Alfred. Are you all right?
Where are you?

41
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:43,115
I'm at the Yorkshire Arms
just at the moment. In London.

42
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,368
- London, England?
- There's only one, Master Bruce.

43
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,163
I seem to be
in a bit of a sticky situation,

44
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,050
and I was wondering if you...

45
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,836
Come along easy, gramps.
We don't want to hurt you.

46
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,172
I'm afraid I'll have
to ring off now, sir.

47
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,591
It seems I have unexpected guests.

48
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:01,967
Alfred, are you there?

49
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,178
<i>Alfred? Alfred!</i>

50
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,647
Before he came to the States,
Alfred did some work as an <i>attaché</i>

51
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,273
in the British Security Services.

52
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,985
More desk jobs than fieldwork,
but he acquired quite a reputation

53
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:24,365
for defusing diplomatically dangerous
situations in high-security areas.

54
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,408
And I thought he was just a nice old guy

55
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,497
who polished the silver
and fixed me sandwiches.

56
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,996
He's fixed more than that in his time.

57
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,625
Underneath Alfred's very proper exterior

58
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,961
is a highly resourceful
government agent.

59
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:39,213
He mentioned his cousin.

60
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,674
As far as I know,
he has no living relatives.

61
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:46,011
And cousin can sometimes mean a fellow
member of an intelligence organization.

62
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,764
Well, I hear England's nice
this time of year.

63
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,175
End of the line, mate.

64
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,095
It's good to see you again, old man.

65
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:30,306
I'm sorry it has to be under
such circumstances.

66
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,142
Exactly what circumstances
are we talking about?

67
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,769
My heavens! Red Claw.

68
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,273
So pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mr. Pennyworth.

69
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:43,485
If you do exactly as I say,
you might live to see tomorrow.

70
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,207
Bruce, over here.
Looks like he put up a struggle.

71
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,725
Poor Alfred.
He must have been petrified.

72
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,295
I doubt it.

73
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,422
He was pretty formidable in his day.

74
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:05,215
Come on.

75
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:12,806
Two blokes just came out
of Pennyworth's room.

76
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,768
Right.

77
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,065
Where they off to, then?

78
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,026
I don't know about this, Ernie.

79
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,530
- Where'd they go?
- We're chasing a pair of poxy ghosts.

80
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,327
Stone the crows!

81
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,690
Gotcha.

82
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:05,567
May I see your license?

83
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,426
When they wake up,
they'll tell us who they're working for.

84
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,483
I don't think
we'll have to wait that long.

85
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,473
Red Claw.

86
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,728
<i>I've wasted enough courtesy
on you two.</i>

87
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,480
Courtesy? None that I've seen.

88
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:47,192
I want this missile silo operational.

89
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:51,196
I intend for the British government
to give me £5 billion

90
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,116
to keep me from wiping London
off the map.

91
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:57,286
You understand, old man,
I had no choice in the matter.

92
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,288
But of course, dear boy.

93
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,624
Each of you holds half the firing code
for this missile.

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,794
I want that code. Or else.

95
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,838
Madam, impossible.

96
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:11,300
We are both signatories
to the Official Secrets Act.

97
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,719
I've already thought of that.

98
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,732
Still no word from Castle Blairquhan.

99
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,068
Our post there has never missed
a check-in.

100
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:32,738
Here's more bad news.
Agent Frederick has been listed missing.

101
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,531
I don't like this.

102
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:37,618
Frederick was part of the original
security team at Blairquhan.

103
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:42,164
- Him and that fellow from Clerical.
- Pennyworth, Alfred Pennyworth.

104
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,124
Our apologies for intruding.

105
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,876
You were saying something
about a castle?

106
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,711
How did you get in here?

107
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:51,465
We don't have time for protocol.
Pennyworth is also missing.

108
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,135
We have reason to think he and Frederick
might be in considerable danger.

109
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:57,179
What was the name of that castle?

110
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:59,765
And why should we give you
that information?

111
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,559
Because I can give you Red Claw.

112
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:11,693
Blairquhan. Castle Blairquhan
on the west Scottish coast.

113
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,404
It was the base for Project Excalibur.

114
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:17,407
Blairquhan is the last
of our land-based missile silos.

115
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,494
Do you think that's what
Red Claw is after?

116
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,788
Apparently so.

117
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,083
Truth serum?

118
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,129
Of course. The old methods
are still often the best.

119
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,196
Fight it if you like.

120
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,383
You won't hold out for long.

121
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,468
But it might be amusing.

122
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,721
Well, anything to amuse a lady.

123
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:43,267
If lady is the word I want,
which I doubt.

124
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:45,853
Aw, sticks and stones.

125
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,957
Won't... I... I won't.

126
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:11,253
Give me your access code
for the missile activator.

127
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,546
Never.

128
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,465
You'll get nothing but gibberish
out of me, madam.

129
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,678
I come from haunts of coot and fern.
I make a sudden sally.

130
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,599
And bicker down the valley.

131
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,811
And people wonder why no one takes
Britain seriously anymore.

132
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,647
The code, old man. Now.

133
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,983
Fourteen...

134
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:39,990
14 Gurrier's Crescent, Blairquhan Upper.

135
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:48,290
Absurdly simple like most passwords.
Now, as for you.

136
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,920
"Half a league, half a league,
half a league onward..."

137
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,049
Desperate valor to the last.
Not that it will help you.

138
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,220
Sooner or later, the serum always wins.

139
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,341
Looks clear.

140
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,577
Impossible! How could he
have learned about this?

141
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:20,484
- That's one less thing to worry about.
- Two less things.

142
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:24,196
- Dennis, you're always the humorist.
- Did you hear that?

143
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:46,218
<i>Londoners. Your ancient city may pride
itself on having survived</i>

144
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,970
<i>plagues, fires, even the Blitz.</i>

145
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:54,267
<i>But unless £5 billion are delivered
to me by midnight tonight,</i>

146
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,812
<i>there will be nothing left to survive.</i>

147
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,899
<i>We have Blairquhan Castle
and its missile installation</i>

148
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:03,985
<i>and the codes to operate the missile.</i>

149
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,947
<i>You have one hour.</i>

150
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,658
<i>Otherwise, I'll be forced
to plant this warhead</i>

151
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,868
<i>in the middle of Trafalgar Square.</i>

152
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,288
<i>And if I do that, well...</i>

153
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:18,291
<i>God save the queen.</i>

154
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:23,713
Is it smart to make demands before
we get the other half of the go code?

155
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,216
I will have the code
in a matter of minutes.

156
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,486
Give me the code, or I'll...

157
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:51,491
The lion and the unicorn
fighting for the crown.

158
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,872
He can't be resisting the drug
this long. It's impossible.

159
00:15:57,747 --> 00:16:00,750
- The lion and the unicorn fighting...
- Wait. He's not resisting.

160
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,961
This doggerel is the code.

161
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,174
"The lion and the unicorn".

162
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:13,555
At last!

163
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,094
You three, come with me.

164
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,138
Watch them.

165
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,685
Fan out. This is the only access
to the control room.

166
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,021
They'll have to come through here.

167
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,154
Take them.

168
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,643
And here I thought all you dusted
was furniture.

169
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,854
A Louis Quinze. What a pity.

170
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:51,653
Goodness me.

171
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,074
- Dear Lord!
- Do you two have the destruct code?

172
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:33,231
I don't suppose you'd consider
coming out of retirement?

173
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:36,025
And taking up civil service
pay grades again?

174
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,946
Hardly, old man. I've become accustomed
to my style of living.

175
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:43,408
It's a great pity.
It was just like old times.

176
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,452
Give my best to Whitehall.
