1
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:28,921
- Night, Brian.
- See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,601
Hey, what's the matter?

3
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,185
Are you lost, honey?

4
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:47,106
My big brother went away
and left me by my lonesomes.

5
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,985
Big brothers aren't supposed to do that
to their baby sisters.

6
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,739
Here. Dry your eyes,
and I'll help you find a policeman.

7
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:58,618
- He'll get you home safe and sound.
- You're so nice to me.

8
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:02,455
But then, you always was
the nicest one, Tippy.

9
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,832
You! But how...

10
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,172
Sorry I had to play roughs, Tippy.

11
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:13,215
I didn't mean to.

12
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,804
Gotham Insider <i>asks,</i>

13
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,264
<i>"Where are they now?"</i>

14
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,684
<i>When her sitcom, Love That Baby,
premiered 20 years ago,</i>

15
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:26,812
<i>little Mary Louise Dahl
became an overnight sensation.</i>

16
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:33,319
<i>As the adorable Baby-Doll, young Mary
quickly captured the hearts of millions.</i>

17
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:35,696
Whoa...

18
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,703
<i>Well, Baby, you'd better have
a pretty good explanation for this.</i>

19
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,581
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

20
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,630
I remember this show
from when I was a kid.

21
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,507
It still stinks.

22
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,803
Be that as it may, three of the cast's
original actors disappeared last week.

23
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,269
And these two?

24
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,397
Ms. Vance is in a show
at Gotham Rep.

25
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,024
I have police bodyguards
following her everywhere.

26
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,612
But that other one, Mary Dahl,
dropped out of sight years ago.

27
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,032
Ironically, the same thing that brought
her fame turned her into a recluse.

28
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,410
I read about her once
in a medical journal.

29
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,912
She was born with systemic hypoplasia,

30
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:27,373
a rare condition that
kept her from aging.

31
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,168
Would you believe
she was 20 years old in that clip?

32
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,464
She'd be about 30 now.

33
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,177
It's obvious someone has a vendetta
against these actors.

34
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,024
We'll study this
and call you back if we...

35
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,389
<i>All units, all units!</i>

36
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,142
<i>Gunfire reported at Gotham Rep.</i>

37
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,893
<i>They're making a try for Vance.</i>

38
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,647
Stay down!

39
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,651
Let me go.

40
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:58,612
- Why are you doing this?
- Quiet!

41
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,865
The lady asked you
a question, creep.

42
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,410
How about an answer?

43
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,506
Hey!

44
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,802
- Ah!
- Robin!

45
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:37,318
No. Help!

46
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,033
- They're getting away.
- We'll get them.

47
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,047
No!

48
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,344
Mommy!

49
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,815
I lost my mommy!

50
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,691
It's okay.

51
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:19,360
Oh, my baby.

52
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,403
Mommy!

53
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,988
Naughty, naughty baby.

54
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,074
Haven't I told you not to run off?

55
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,618
I didn't mean to.

56
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:29,912
Hold it.

57
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:32,873
Naughty Mr. Batmans.

58
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,375
You play too rough.

59
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,758
I got 'em!

60
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,177
It's me, dope.

61
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,401
Where am I?

62
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,236
Huh?

63
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,322
It can't be.

64
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,371
Tod, June, Brian?

65
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:14,248
Tammy. She got you, too.

66
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,083
Is this some sort of bad joke?

67
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,044
What are we doing on the old set?
And in these clothes?

68
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:22,006
Welcome home, sister Suzy.

69
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,009
I've missed you so.

70
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,762
Mr. Happy-Head says he missed you, too.

71
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,848
Mary? Mary Dahl?

72
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,349
Is this a joke?

73
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,311
No, sillies. I'm Baby, remember?

74
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:39,273
It's Suzy and Tippy,
and Mumsy, and Daddy, and Baby,

75
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,403
together again forevers and evers.

76
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,037
I don't care what Mayor Hill says.

77
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,915
The people have a right to know,
and if he won't talk to us...

78
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,670
I'll call you back, Marv.

79
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,590
Since when are you
interested in has-been actors?

80
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,760
Since that one's been kidnapping
her costars.

81
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,969
You're serious?

82
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,221
She's been picking them off, one by one.

83
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:15,184
- Any reason she'd have a grudge?
- Actually, they should hate her.

84
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,772
Dahl put them out of work when she quit
the series to become a dramatic actress.

85
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,986
<i>What, will these hands never be clean?</i>

86
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,864
<i>Here's the smell of the blood still.</i>

87
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:33,369
<i>All the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand.</i>

88
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:37,498
Ew!

89
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,124
That's what the critics said.

90
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,003
Baby's dramatic career flopped, and when
she tried to start her TV show again

91
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,421
the networks turned her down.

92
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,424
That still doesn't explain
why she's after her old cast.

93
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,260
Maybe there's a clue
in these old episodes.

94
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,887
You can borrow them if you want.

95
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:55,265
And when you crack the case,
you can pay me back with an exclusive...

96
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,977
Interview.

97
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:10,155
Isn't this the best-est?

98
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:14,451
Having breakfast, just like old times.

99
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,330
- Oh. Oh, it's swell, Baby.
- Great.

100
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,251
Uh-oh!

101
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:25,379
Here comes Buster, begging for scraps.

102
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,684
Bad boy, Buster.

103
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,935
Go away.

104
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,610
Hey, guess what's today. Anybody know?

105
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,656
Oh, Come on. Guess.

106
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:01,582
It's my births-day!

107
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,751
Yay, yay for me!

108
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:06,253
You mean you had us brought here

109
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:09,381
just so you could throw yourself
a surprise party?

110
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,843
That's it. I always knew
you were a selfish little brat.

111
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:15,220
Always throwing your temper tantrums

112
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:17,806
and making life miserable
for the rest of us.

113
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,225
Well, this time you've gone too far.

114
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,644
Expect a call from my lawyer.

115
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:31,779
Hi-ya!

116
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:36,033
- Tod!
- Isn't Mariams a treasure?

117
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:38,827
I couldn't gets through the day
without hers.

118
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,413
Naughty, naughty, Daddys.

119
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:46,710
Mustn't yell at your Baby like thats.

120
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:49,922
You're not my daughter.
And we're not a family.

121
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:51,965
We're actors, remember?

122
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:56,136
You canceled our show because you whined
you weren't getting enough attention.

123
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,555
But I knows now I made a boo-boo.

124
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,687
It was hard for me
out there.

125
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,774
I studied and trained and auditioned,
but no one wanted me.

126
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,944
Aww...

127
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:21,120
Over the years, I remembered how happy
I was with all of you around me,

128
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:24,498
and the folks at home
watching me each week. Me.

129
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,625
Baby-Doll.

130
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:32,881
Now I'm Baby for good,
and everyone will love me agains.

131
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,341
Hugs, hugs!

132
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,596
Aww.

133
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:48,564
Remember that time Poison Ivy
nearly smothered us in those vines

134
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:50,774
with the really sharp thorns?

135
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,986
- Yes.
- This is worse.

136
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,946
I did learn one thing, though.

137
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,532
Baby hasn't gotten every member
of her cast.

138
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,952
In the last season,
the show's ratings began to drop,

139
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,204
so the producers introduced
a new character.

140
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,540
Baby's little cousin Spunky.

141
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:12,796
Oh.

142
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,509
According to these, Dahl was furious
she was upstaged on her birthday episode

143
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,136
and walked off the series.

144
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:23,182
So why hasn't she gone
after cousin Spunky?

145
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,021
Maybe she's waiting
for the right occasion.

146
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:52,085
Excuse me. Excuse me!

147
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:55,255
My baby was taking a nap,
and your music woke her up.

148
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,341
Hey, I have to practice, you know?

149
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:02,262
You're still a stinky jerk-face, Spunky.

150
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:13,398
Wake up, sleepyheads.

151
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,944
Huh?

152
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:19,488
It's time for my birthday party.

153
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:21,073
Yay!

154
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,076
We're gonna have so much funs.

155
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,916
- Ready when you are, Ms. Dahl.
- Goodies!

156
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,504
You all remembers what happened
the last time I had a births-day.

157
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,967
Poopy old Spunkys pushed my head
in the cake.

158
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,095
Everybody laughed and laughed.

159
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:46,556
Well, I'm laughing now.

160
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,853
What are you mad at me for?
It wasn't anything personal.

161
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,524
We were just playing characters
in a TV show.

162
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,011
It was real to me.

163
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,861
Everybody loved Baby-Doll
until you came along.

164
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:01,947
You made them forget me.

165
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,495
Now Baby's gonna get evens.

166
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:21,091
- No, don't. Stop her.
- Help! Wait!

167
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:26,972
It's never too late
to have a happy childhood.

168
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:42,821
Blow out the candle, Spunky.
Bet your wish doesn't come trues.

169
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,295
Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Cheater!

170
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,721
Mr. Happy-Head says
you're really gonna get it nows.

171
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,664
Thanks, partner.

172
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,208
Anytime.

173
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,880
No fairs. No fairs.

174
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,466
He wasn't Spunky at alls.

175
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:47,302
I told Spunky what you were up to.
We switched places.

176
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,555
Batman rigged me with a transmitter
that led him here.

177
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,351
Ah, aren't you Mr. Smarty-Heads.

178
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,727
Mariam!

179
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,087
Wow, lady, you're good.

180
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:23,547
It's a living.

181
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,257
Hi-ya!

182
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,054
Hi-ya!

183
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,944
Get the hostages out.
I'll go after Dahl.

184
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:50,157
Right. Hang on, folks. I'll have you
back to reality in a second.

185
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,082
Yay!

186
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,200
Watch it, kid.

187
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,631
Hmm.

188
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:59,809
- It's Batman.
- Cool. Hey, Batman, down here.

189
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,353
Hey, do you see what I see?

190
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,231
- Look at those people. It's Batman!
- It's Batman.

191
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:06,316
- Look.
- Wow, it's Batman.

192
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:25,979
Silly Mr. Batmans, can't catch me.

193
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:31,651
Don't run away.
I know you're scared, confused.

194
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:35,655
- I can help you.
- Liar, liar, cape on fire.

195
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,838
Nows we're playing by my rules.

196
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,804
Game's overs, Mr. Batman.

197
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:02,974
I wins.

198
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,064
No fair!

199
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,834
Look.

200
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,462
That's me in there.

201
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,422
The real me.

202
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,675
There I am.

203
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,720
But it's not really real, is it?

204
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:46,267
Just made up and pretend like my family
and my life and everything else.

205
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,733
Why couldn't you just let me
make-believe?

206
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,484
I didn't mean to.
