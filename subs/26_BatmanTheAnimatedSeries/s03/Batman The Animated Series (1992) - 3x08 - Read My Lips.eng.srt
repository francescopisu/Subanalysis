1
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:50,151
Not a bad night's take.

2
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,148
- What happened to the lights?
- What the heck?

3
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,687
Here.

4
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,777
Put them on. Hurry.

5
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,560
Now.

6
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:37,258
It went down smooth, Scarf ace,
just like you said.

7
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:42,221
That's just the beginning, boys.
Soon we're gonna own this town.

8
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,249
Have pity on
an old man's blood pressure.

9
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:11,542
What is it, Jim?

10
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,128
We're taking a pounding
over this new gang.

11
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:17,590
Their boss puts heists together
smooth as a Swiss watchmaker.

12
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,967
- What have you got for me?
- Not much.

13
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,720
We don't know who the boss is
or any of the gang members.

14
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,097
But a home video enthusiast
taped the gang

15
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,057
leaving the scene of their latest crime.

16
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:29,268
- Interested?
- Always.

17
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,899
Let me know if you need any... Help?

18
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:53,292
Not much of a plot, is it, sir?

19
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:07,848
They're clever. Masks, gloves.
No way they can be identified.

20
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,487
A tattoo.

21
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,731
Who you looking for, bat-breath?

22
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,817
First guess is you.

23
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,610
Don't get wise with me.

24
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,195
I might not like you.

25
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,823
You're breaking my heart, Rhino.

26
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,575
I ain't scared of you,

27
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,286
but you ain't gonna
trick me into taking a swing at you.

28
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,996
You got nothing on me.

29
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,082
You seem to have me confused
with the police, Rhino.

30
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:18,669
I want information,
and I'll get it any way I please.

31
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,045
Who's your boss?

32
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,173
You want information, watch the news.

33
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,271
You've got a hard head.

34
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:40,065
How about using it for something
other than a blunt object?

35
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:53,037
Well, if it isn't Charles "Rhino" Daly.

36
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,250
- Why don't you run along home?
- Your ma's probably waiting up.

37
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,301
Guy like that,
I'm not so sure a bullet would stop him.

38
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,720
Hey, I'm not so sure
a tank would stop him.

39
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,030
I gotta see the boss.

40
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,535
He's sleeping.
He said he's not to be disturbed.

41
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:37,539
Hey, man, it's important.
Batman's on our case.

42
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,000
I see. I'll see what I can do.

43
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,260
Sir, I'm terribly sorry.

44
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,554
Hey, I'm sleeping here.

45
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,808
I lay down, I close my eyes,
what's that tell you?

46
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:58,435
Yes, sir,
but Rhino says it's important.

47
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,855
Oh, Rhino says
it's important, huh?

48
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:05,234
Well, it better be or there's
gonna be fireworks, get me?

49
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,861
Okay, take me out there.

50
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:17,913
This better be good, yous mugs.

51
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,718
Okay, talk, Rhino. What's so important
I can't get a good night's sleep?

52
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,679
Eh, Batman's got me figured, Scarf ace.

53
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:37,975
I don't know how, but he came down
on me like a cast-iron safe.

54
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:41,353
Batman? We're talking real trouble.
What are we gonna...

55
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,231
Hey, hey! Who you talking to, creep?

56
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,150
He's just the hired help.

57
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,819
I'm the boss here. You talk to me.

58
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:52,656
Sorry, boss. He's new.
He don't know the score.

59
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,159
Yeah, well, he better
get with the program pretty quick.

60
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,578
I don't stand for no lack of respect.

61
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:01,206
This Batman business
can only mean one thing.

62
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,710
We got us a squealer.

63
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,504
No, boss, that can't be.

64
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,424
None of us wanna screw up
a sweet deal like this.

65
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,426
Glad to hear it, Mugsy,

66
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:16,180
'cause if there is and I find him,
it's drapes for that rat!

67
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:18,932
Now, Mr. Scarf ace,
remember your blood pressure.

68
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:23,604
Shut up! I want your opinion,
dummy, I'll pull your string.

69
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,819
He's just tired. Irritable.
He's really a genius, Scarf ace is.

70
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,739
You mean the Ventriloquist is a genius.

71
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:37,868
Nah. Like Scarf ace said,
he's just hired help.

72
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:40,412
Scarf ace, he's the real brains.

73
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,233
Mr. Scarf ace?

74
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,500
My advice to you? Don't make a sound.

75
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:10,919
I'm looking for evidence.

76
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:13,422
Evidence of your previous robberies.

77
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,092
- Robberies?
- Don't be coy.

78
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,303
Cooperate and it could go
easier for you.

79
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:21,221
He... He doesn't tell me anything.

80
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,348
Not his plans,
not where he hides the loot.

81
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,976
I swear I'm just a flunky.
I know nothing.

82
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,105
You can think I'm dumb,
just don't talk to me like I'm dumb.

83
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:34,234
I don't know anything, I tell you.
Let me go before he...

84
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:38,488
Hey, who's making
all the racket? That you, dummy?

85
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:44,203
Oh, no. Don't let him find me with you.
You don't know how dangerous he is.

86
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,371
He sees me talking to you, I'm a goner.

87
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,664
Please.

88
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,083
Dummy, get in here.

89
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,506
Sorry, Mr. Scarf ace,
I couldn't sleep.

90
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:01,053
I need my beauty rest here,
dummy. That's twice you waked me up.

91
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:05,474
Do it again, you're gonna be wearing
a pine overcoat, get me?

92
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,895
You're sweating.

93
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:12,272
What's going on?
And don't feed me no apples.

94
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:15,817
Nothing, sir.
I was just having a bad dream.

95
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,111
What did you leave that window open for?

96
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,864
This ain't no meat locker. I'm cold.

97
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,866
Yes, sir, I'll shut it right now.

98
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,219
It's called multiple personality
syndrome disorder, Alfred.

99
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:45,639
Two personalities in one brain,
completely separate.

100
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,059
Neither one knows what the other
is thinking. Listen.

101
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:52,104
<i>Batman's so hot,</i>

102
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:55,774
<i>let's see him swim Gotham Bay
in concrete boots.</i>

103
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,070
<i>A good idea,
Mr. Scarf ace.</i>

104
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:04,491
<i>Bet your bow tie I'm right,
dummy. Say, who dresses you anyway?</i>

105
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:08,996
<i>You're such a kidder, Mr. Scarf ace.</i>

106
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,207
I'd swear it was two separate people.

107
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,585
You're not alone.
Even the computer is fooled.

108
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,297
When I studied with Zatara the magician,

109
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,258
he taught me about ventriloquism
and voice-throwing.

110
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,094
How to make your voice seem
to come from across the room.

111
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,847
This Ventriloquist could give
Zatara lessons.

112
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:32,311
You've had your share of odd opponents,
sir, but this one does take the biscuit.

113
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:36,231
Any idea where he, or they,
will strike next?

114
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,818
No. Scarf ace keeps his plans secret
until the last minute.

115
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:43,280
I'll just have to listen in
for as long as it takes.

116
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:46,825
All right, yous mugs, listen good.

117
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:51,496
There's a shipment of platinum gonna be
loaded onto the luxury liner <i>Majestic.</i>

118
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,623
- We're gonna...
- But, platinum?

119
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,585
But, boss, don't they send
stuff like that by freighter?

120
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,174
I'm talking here!

121
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:04,509
Okay, okay. Sorry, boss.

122
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:10,766
It's a trick, see? They think no one
will suspect the shipment's on a liner.

123
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,518
But they're like yous mugs. Stupid.

124
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,479
Not smart like me.

125
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,981
We'll slip in,
get the goods and skedaddle

126
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,858
before the ship leaves the harbor.

127
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:21,360
One more thing.

128
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:23,945
I smell a double-cross.

129
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,324
Woke up last night
with one of them whatchamacallits.

130
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:29,368
Prima... Primanotion.

131
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,996
- "Premonition"?
- Don't put words in my mouth!

132
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,999
All I'm saying here is
I got this feeling

133
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,293
somebody here is out to get me.

134
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,879
And I'm gonna get them first.

135
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,840
I don't know who it is yet, but I will.

136
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,717
And when I do...

137
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:52,599
Now, here's the details. Listen up.
I ain't gonna repeat myself.

138
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,195
Yippee ki-yay.

139
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:02,919
Uh-oh.

140
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,845
See? The Bat's not so tough.

141
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,890
Comes up against Scarf ace,
he's just another dummy.

142
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,268
It was a trap, Bats, start to finish.

143
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,146
And you fell for it like
a world-class sucker.

144
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,858
The dummy here spilled the beans
you'd been in his room.

145
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:11,029
I had the room searched
and lookie what I found.

146
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,414
You're not as smart
as you think you are, Scarf ace.

147
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,251
I'd watch my mouth if I were you, Bats.

148
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,379
One bullet through that rope
and you're history.

149
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:29,256
Get my point?

150
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:34,052
How do you think I found this place?
The phone book?

151
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:36,680
I had help. Inside help.

152
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,975
My primanotion. I knew I was right.

153
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,936
Which one of you louses is it?

154
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,896
It ain't me, boss.

155
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,858
I know it ain't you, Rhino.
You're too stupid to be a traitor.

156
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,360
Ooh, thanks, boss.

157
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:54,698
But whoever it is, they're gonna pay!
Big time! Who is it?

158
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:57,742
You don't talk,
you get the ultimate massage.

159
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:02,414
- And If I tell?
- Maybe you just get run over by a truck.

160
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:05,083
Tempting, but no.

161
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,127
Have it your way. Rhino.

162
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,883
- Hold it!
- This is getting old, Bats.

163
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,344
Last chance. Who's the traitor?

164
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,555
Him, the Ventriloquist.

165
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,519
No! No! He's lying.
I told you when he came into my room.

166
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:28,607
So what?
Maybe you did 'cause I had you cornered.

167
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,442
Heard you talking to Batman.

168
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,432
Shut up, you blockhead.

169
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,157
What did you say?

170
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,453
It wasn't me. I didn't say that.
My lips didn't move.

171
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:44,414
So what? You're a ventriloquist.

172
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:48,710
You're also a lying, yellow,
liver-bellied, two-faced...

173
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:52,464
No, Scarf ace, not me. I'm loyal.
I'd never...

174
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:56,176
He's been feeding me information
in return for legal protection.

175
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:59,179
You're going
up the river, sawdust-for-brains.

176
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,932
Why, I ought to...
Waste the four-flusher.

177
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,853
Go on. I gave an order. Ice him. Do it!
Do it now!

178
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,359
But, boss, we ventilate
the Ventriloquist, you're, you know...

179
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,694
I'm surrounded by traitors.

180
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,738
Okay, fine.

181
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:20,158
You want something done right,
do it yourself.

182
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:26,289
Spare me, Scarf ace. Please.
I've always been loyal to you.

183
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:30,335
Go ahead, plead, beg.
It ain't gonna do you no good.

184
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:33,380
You're lunch meat, you lousy, no... Ah!

185
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,758
I'm hit, boys. Get him!

186
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:55,360
Take him, Rhino!

187
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,112
No problem.

188
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:03,386
Ah!

189
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,614
The medication has helped him immensely.

190
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,117
His other personality
seems to have totally submerged.

191
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,124
- That's very good work.
- Thank you.
