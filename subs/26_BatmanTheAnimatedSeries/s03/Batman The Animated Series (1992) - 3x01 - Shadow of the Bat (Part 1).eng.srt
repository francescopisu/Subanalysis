1
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,224
This place gives me the willies.

2
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,392
No kiddin'.

3
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,186
Why do we gotta do this stuff
in the middle of the flipping night?

4
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,029
Maybe you'd prefer moving
contraband in broad daylight,

5
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,405
when the cops might notice.

6
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,910
Jeez, boss. You shouldn't
sneak up on guys like that.

7
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,454
Just get this stuff loaded.

8
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,582
I never liked this place.

9
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,216
<i>This is the police.
We have you surrounded.</i>

10
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,885
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

11
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:21,682
I can't be seen here. Hold them off.

12
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,091
That's right. Nice and easy.

13
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,009
Hey!

14
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,763
I never liked this place.

15
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:20,658
Come on, then. You're not taking
Rupert Thorne without a fight.

16
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:22,868
You?

17
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,042
If I gotta go down,
I'm taking you with me.

18
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,861
Careful, Gil.

19
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:59,405
Don't make this hard
on yourself, Thorne.

20
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,407
Step out where we can see you.

21
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:04,034
Not even if I could, flatfoot.

22
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,746
Look.

23
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,045
Don't you just love it
when he gives them to you gift-wrapped?

24
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,885
<i>The deputy commissioner, Gil Mason,
who last night was instrumental</i>

25
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:22,678
<i>in capturing Rupert Thorne...</i>

26
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,490
<i>Mason attributed the incriminating
evidence against Thorne</i>

27
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,057
<i>to a mysterious informant.</i>

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,395
<i>And the commissioner and I won't rest
until every crime kingpin,</i>

29
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,106
<i>hustler, and two-bit crook
is off the streets.</i>

30
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,902
You'll ruin your eyes changing channels
so fast, Master Bruce.

31
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,779
Not to mention your attention span.

32
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:44,450
One would think the fall of Thorne
would bring a smile even to your face.

33
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,453
I'd love to know who this
mysterious informant is.

34
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:50,873
This is the third gang lord Mason's
brought down in as many months.

35
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,709
Yes, it's quite alarming.

36
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,922
If this continues, you might even
be forced into taking a vacation.

37
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:16,190
You know, Dad, if you and Gil
keep nailing bad guys like this,

38
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:22,863
people will start thinking you two
are Batman and Robin.

39
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,074
What can I say? Gil is a godsend.

40
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:30,037
- And he's not bad-looking, either.
- Dad.

41
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,710
I just got you to stop treating me
like a kid,

42
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,548
and now you're trying to marry me off.

43
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,717
Hey, don't think I didn't see you two
at that fundraiser last week.

44
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,302
Thick as thieves you were.

45
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,478
Mr. Mason, you must be psychic.
We were just talking about you.

46
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,021
Come in, come in.

47
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,859
- Hey, Gil. What's doing?
- Another tip on a case?

48
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,612
Believe me, Jim, I don't wanna be here.

49
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,031
But I thought it would be best
coming from me.

50
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,992
What is it? What's wrong?

51
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,288
James Gordon, I have a warrant
for your arrest.

52
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:15,291
This is a joke, right?

53
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,671
- On what charges?
- Accepting bribes.

54
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,840
You can't be serious.

55
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,718
The department has reason to believe

56
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:29,054
that you've been taking money
from Rupert Thorne for years.

57
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,975
What? Dad's never
taken a bribe in his life.

58
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:35,185
I'm sorry, Barb.

59
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,688
You have the right to remain silent.

60
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:40,107
If you give up that right,
anything you say...

61
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,609
I know my rights, Gil.

62
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,740
Dad.

63
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,285
Don't worry, Barbara.
It's all a mistake, you'll see.

64
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:53,248
Commissioner, do you have
a statement?

65
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,874
I'm sorry, Barbara. I really am.

66
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,814
Commissioner Gordon,
just a statement, sir.

67
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,524
What about
these corruption charges?

68
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,894
Ms. Gordon,
do you have a statement?

69
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,073
We'll see about this.

70
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,254
But you're the DA, Janet.
You've worked with my father.

71
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,299
- There must be something you can...
- The evidence is solid, Barbara.

72
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,177
Money deposited to your father's name
in laundered accounts.

73
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,554
Witnesses who swear
they saw him take bribes.

74
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,599
That's not sufficient cause
to deny him bail.

75
00:07:55,683 --> 00:08:00,396
True. But we also found deposit receipts
for a South American bank.

76
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,481
We have to consider him a flight risk.

77
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:04,775
This is crazy. My father would never...

78
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,695
Maybe you don't know your father
as well as you think.

79
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,989
Maybe none of us do.

80
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,455
Don't you believe her, kid.
Your pop's the best there is.

81
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,125
That's why the department's
putting on a rally for him.

82
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:26,547
- Harvey, that's a wonderful idea.
- Yeah. Wish I could say it was mine.

83
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,883
Just because I have a job to do
doesn't mean I'm not on your side.

84
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,762
I'm going to see Jim Gordon gets
all the public support we can muster.

85
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,016
All the top cops will be there,
including yours truly.

86
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,060
So don't worry your pretty little head.
Should be quite a show.

87
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:46,316
Yes, and I know someone who'd be
a real showstopper, if I can get him.

88
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:45,084
I was wondering when you'd get
around to me.

89
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,460
I got a look at the evidence.

90
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:50,297
<i>Those deposit receipts were
perfect forgeries, dated months ago.</i>

91
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:52,424
<i>Doesn't look like Thorne's handiwork.</i>

92
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:53,592
Then who?

93
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,221
Word on the street is
a new syndicate is moving in.

94
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,807
Could be a connection.
I'll check it out.

95
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,976
<i>- Anything you need?</i>
- Yes. Check on Barbara.

96
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,436
Keep her out of this.

97
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,858
But you have to come to the rally.

98
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:15,280
The public respects you. If they see
you there, they'll know Dad's innocent.

99
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,200
Sorry, but there's more to this
than a simple frame-up.

100
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,577
And I'm not gonna find out
by appearing at rallies.

101
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,745
But don't you see?

102
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,706
The best thing you can do for him,
is to keep out of it.

103
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,875
The people behind this are dangerous.

104
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:35,717
"I'm a professional,
don't try this at home," huh?

105
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,678
Sorry, Batman.

106
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:40,597
You being at the rally
could decide if Dad goes free.

107
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,434
So you'll be there, one way or another.

108
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,209
- You called me, boss?
- The rally's tomorrow night.

109
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:13,088
Everything's in place.
You know what to do.

110
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,760
Will you at least wear a transceiver?

111
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,888
I can monitor from here
in case they try to...

112
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,764
No, too easy to detect.

113
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:25,934
Hey. I didn't miss
a Bogart festival in film class

114
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,645
just to sit on my butt here
while you hit the streets.

115
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,606
There has to be something I can do.

116
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,321
Do you make public appearances?

117
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,333
<i>After all Commissioner Gordon
has done for Gotham City,</i>

118
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:53,086
<i>the least the city can do for him
is grant him bail.</i>

119
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,009
Showtime.

120
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,225
Bruce? What in...

121
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,935
- That's him, all right.
- It's Batman.

122
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,145
Batman!

123
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,564
- I knew it.
- He knows Gordon's innocent!

124
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,400
Grandstanding psycho.

125
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:28,580
Touchdown.

126
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,802
And the crowd goes wild.

127
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,602
What the...

128
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:48,827
Wait!

129
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,668
A girl?

130
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,579
The lady's with me, gents.

131
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,962
Are you crazy?
You're lucky you didn't get killed.

132
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,965
- Come on. They're getting away.
- This is nuts.

133
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,332
Yuck.

134
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,261
Great. She's gone, too.

135
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,598
Funny, I don't remember
a Batgirl in our little club.

136
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,864
<i>All Gotham is talking
about the mysterious Batgirl,</i>

137
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:40,480
<i>who foiled an assassination attempt
on acting commissioner Gil Mason.</i>

138
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,859
Expanding membership
in the crime-fighting club?

139
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,570
If I find out who she is, I'll...

140
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,948
Hey. Look at that.

141
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,214
Mr. Mason ducked before he saw the guns.

142
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,175
Almost as though he expected it.

143
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,264
Batgirl, sheesh.
What's next, Weasel Woman?

144
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,600
Huh?

145
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:39,873
Gotcha.

146
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,135
Gil, you know
those guys who shot at you?

147
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,779
Well, I think I know who one of them...

148
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,685
Something wrong, Barbara?

149
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,980
I didn't know you had company.

150
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,108
Oh, no problem.
My friend here was just leaving.

151
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,863
Oh, yeah, gotta run. Listen, I'll see
you at the business meeting, Gil.

152
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:12,989
Miss.

153
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,702
So, welcome to my humble abode.

154
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,329
Uh...

155
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:21,623
I just came over to...

156
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:25,627
To see if you're okay.
I was worried about you.

157
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,421
Hey, I appreciate that.
I really do. Drink?

158
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:31,716
Oh, gee, I'm sorry,
I was just on my way to see Dad.

159
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,344
But I'm sure I'll catch you again.

160
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:02,163
Yeah, boss, like Batman, only a dame.
She almost screwed up everything.

161
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,860
No, don't worry. No one can hear me.

162
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,387
Right, boss. I'm heading back right now.

163
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:43,348
What am I gonna do?

164
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:46,476
If Gil's involved in this,
there's nobody I can trust.

165
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,861
And if Batman's not around...

166
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:06,454
What do you think, Woobie?

167
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,041
Could use a little work, huh?

168
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,379
It appears we have a prowler.

169
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,684
Who are you? What are you doing here?

170
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,229
Matches Malone. Heard about a new mob.

171
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:34,691
- Thought I could make some more dough.
- Is that so?

172
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:37,152
Well, you heard right.

173
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:40,321

181
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:42,050

182
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:47,013
