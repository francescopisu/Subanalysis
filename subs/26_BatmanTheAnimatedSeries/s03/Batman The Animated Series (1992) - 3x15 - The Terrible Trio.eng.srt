1
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,459
A valiant effort,
stout sentinel,

2
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,087
but the game was ours before it began.

3
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,352
Time to fly.

4
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:55,698
Wait, gentlemen.

5
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:00,786
So, what do they pay you here, Henry?

6
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:07,460
Nine, ten dollars an hour? A grand total
of, what, four, $425 a week?

7
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,754
- Fox, come on!
- Let's see,

8
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:13,716
that'd be $21,000 a year.
Can that be right?

9
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,597
Here. In appreciation
for services rendered.

10
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,767
- We won't tell.
- Beats a gold watch.

11
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,188
Ah, ah, ah.

12
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,941
It's business decisions like that
that got you where you are today.

13
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,985
Come, gentlemen. Let us away.

14
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,766
Did you hear that?

15
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,750
Allow me.

16
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,634
Don't worry about me. Get them!

17
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,135
It'll be a pleasure.

18
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,119
Hate to tell you,
but the costume party's over.

19
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,955
You want me, Tweety Bird? Come on, then.

20
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,624
Robin! Stop!

21
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,628
He smells it.

22
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,256
Plan B, then.

23
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:40,344
Robin!

24
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,521
See? I told you this would be fun.

25
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,997
The Terrible Trio strikes again.

26
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,084
How about those masks?
They look like refugees from Mardi Gras.

27
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,337
Predators of land, sea and air.

28
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,715
Maybe they're experts in those areas.

29
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,385
The only thing these guys
are experts in is arrogance.

30
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,733
Thanks, Kevin.

31
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,360
Pull!

32
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:41,989
"Thanks, Kevin"?

33
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,116
Awfully chummy with the help, Bruce.

34
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,244
Do you thank the garbage man
for picking up your trash?

35
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:48,913
If I happen to run into him.

36
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,623
Don't get Warren started, Bruce.

37
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:53,626
You know how
he feels about the servants.

38
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,169
Gunther, Army, please.

39
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,340
I'm just trying to protect Bruce
from his baser instincts. Pull!

40
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:08,849
So this is all you do for kicks, Bruce?
Charity work?

41
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,018
Well, I do have a nightlife.

42
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:12,895
Pull!

43
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,817
Besides, it's important to help others.

44
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:20,653
It may sound corny,
but, hey, it's how I feel.

45
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,365
But you must recognize
that you are a superior animal, Bruce.

46
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,617
A member of the elite. Pull!

47
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:31,163
Take my Delta brothers and me.

48
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,499
Why, we've run with the bulls.

49
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:35,292
Shot game from hot air balloons.

50
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,961
Killed a great white.

51
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,797
We've done it all.

52
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,342
Ah, therein lies the problem.

53
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:47,346
After all, what do the rajahs do
when there are no more tigers to hunt?

54
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:50,307
I'm sure you'll
think of something, Warren.

55
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:56,814
Dollar for dollar, that has to be
the dullest man in Gotham City.

56
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,823
It should be obvious
even to you, Rebecca.

57
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,242
That dress is not appropriate attire.

58
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:11,120
Oh, Father, you just don't quit, do you?

59
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,956
Sheldon, nice to see you here.

60
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,000
The pleasure's all ours, Bruce.

61
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,332
Rebecca and I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

62
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,796
- Isn't that right, dear?
- Right.

63
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,632
Excuse me.

64
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,135
Children.

65
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,804
I thought you'd never finish
that stupid game.

66
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,434
Careful, darling, Pater is watching.

67
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,478
He's always watching.

68
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:41,108
If you think he's mad now, wait until
he gets this month's credit card bill.

69
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,737
And how much did that little frock
set Daddums back?

70
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,822
Five thousand.

71
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:48,657
I'd say it was worth it.

72
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,701
I don't know how I'm gonna tell him.

73
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,095
Oh, Warren, you are a lifesaver.

74
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,056
It's only money.

75
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,557
With Daddy leaving town,

76
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,477
I should be able to slip this into
his account, no problem.

77
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,688
Catch you in the pool.

78
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:32,952
Well, old man, I'd say
that fluttering sound you hear

79
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,245
is your check sprouting wings
and flying away.

80
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:39,500
Actually, I thought that daddy
might be willing to reimburse me.

81
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:19,123
Ah, well, Ming was
a boring dynasty anyway.

82
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,541
I don't know about this.

83
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:24,294
It's one thing to steal from strangers,
but we know Fallbrook.

84
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,673
Yes, adds a bit
of extra spice, doesn't it?

85
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:29,383
Hands up!

86
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,346
She said he'd be out of town.

87
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:42,062
Hello, police? This is Sheldon Fallbrook
at the Gotham Park Towers.

88
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,772
I want to report...

89
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,287
That's where you belong, old man.
At my feet.

90
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,706
Come on.
The police will be here any minute.

91
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:45,977
<i>All units,
possible robbery in progress</i>

92
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,504
<i>at Gotham Park Towers,
28th floor residence.</i>

93
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,560
I presume a good time was had by all?

94
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:05,395
Warren, it's him.

95
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,360
Have a little backbone, Army.

96
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,058
My turn.

97
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:53,735
He's hooked us!

98
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,671
- I can't shake him.
- What do we do?

99
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,840
- Quick! Dump the money!
- What?

100
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,134
Dump the money! Now!

101
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,183
Hey, free money!

102
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:53,879
Aced it!

103
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:57,424
And once again,
we owe it all to the little people.

104
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:03,555
Daddy?

105
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:06,808
Daddy, can you hear me?

106
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,769
I'm so sorry.

107
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,104
You might as well
go on home, Ms. Fallbrook.

108
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,482
No telling when your father
will come out of this.

109
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,818
<i>Dr. Forrest,
dial 118, please.</i>

110
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,155
Bruce. It's nice of you to come.

111
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,824
If there's anything I can do, Rebecca...

112
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,203
Warren.

113
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,334
I came as soon as I heard.

114
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:37,047
My poor Becky. Dreadful business.
So senseless.

115
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,843
Come, let me take your mind off this.

116
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:44,862
<i>Dr. Kravitz, you have
a visitor in the main lobby.</i>

117
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06,034
You know, Becks, I don't think
you should be alone right now.

118
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,803
The fellows and I were thinking
about the mountains this weekend.

119
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,914
A change of scenery might do you good.

120
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,105
So the police still have
no idea who the thieves are?

121
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,482
No, I guess not.

122
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,359
But I hope they find them soon.

123
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,155
You know, I really shouldn't be here.
I mean, what if my father wakes up?

124
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:48,577
Come off it, Rebecca. Anyone would
think you actually liked the old coot.

125
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,746
Well, he is my father.

126
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:53,248
Don't worry. We left the number here
with the hospital.

127
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:55,542
And we're only an hour's drive
from the city.

128
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:57,294
Well...

129
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,962
Time for a feast.

130
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,132
We're going to cheer you up
whether you like it or not.

131
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:03,717
You're too sweet.

132
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,271
It's Dad's stick pin. How did it...

133
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:23,070
No.

134
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,041
According to the computer,

135
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:39,378
this is probably the ring that made
the mark on Fallbrook's jaw.

136
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:43,298
It belongs to a frat,
Delta Sigma Alpha, mostly rich boys.

137
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,176
Like Warren Lawford
and his Delta brothers.

138
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:49,012
All three of them inherited
family fortunes.

139
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,473
Lawford gets his from oil.

140
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,309
Lydecker's father owned
an aerodynamics firm.

141
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,104
And Hardwick's father
was a shipping magnate.

142
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,689
Land, air and water.

143
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:01,525
It can't be a coincidence.

144
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,027
Scoundrels like these are worse
than the Joker.

145
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:06,696
At least he's got madness as an excuse.

146
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,991
But they've got more money
than the mint. Why would they steal?

147
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,413
Because we were bored!
Don't you get it? It was a game.

148
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:15,789
A game?

149
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,457
We've done everything else.

150
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:20,001
Treasure hunts, safaris,
deep-sea diving.

151
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:23,755
We wanted a new challenge.
You know, the thrill of the chase.

152
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:28,343
And we were good at it.
We outfoxed the police and the Batman.

153
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:31,304
But the people you hurt, my father...

154
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:34,224
We never meant
to hurt him, Becky. Really.

155
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,685
Of course not. And we'll pay him back.

156
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,896
Sure we will.
Hey, we'll pay everybody back.

157
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,526
- You won't tell anyone, right?
- No. Oh, no, of course not.

158
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,579
- You'll tell.
- No, Warren. I won't, really.

159
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:59,583
She's a liability, one we can't afford.

160
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,751
Whoa, timeout, old man.

161
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,962
This is getting extreme.
There are limits to...

162
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,256
Haven't you listened
to anything I've told you?

163
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,259
We are beyond limitations!
Beyond restriction!

164
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,887
She's your girlfriend,
for crying out loud!

165
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,639
She's a spoiled, willful child.

166
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,224
And if we let her go...

167
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:21,563
- She will tell. Ow!
- You're out of your minds, all of you!

168
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,236
In for a penny, in for a pound.

169
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,752
Warren, for pity's sake.

170
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:47,547
Enough, Army!
I want this done with, now!

171
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:23,291
- Take over.
- Sure.

172
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,210
Leave me to steer with a broken arm.

173
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,937
Let's go, Fox.
You've raided your last chicken coop.

174
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,439
Wait, wait a minute. We can make a deal.

175
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:54,484
A million dollars to let me go.

176
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:58,822
Ten million!
Think about it. Buys a lot of Batarangs.

177
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,116
Your money's no good here.

178
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:04,786
Okay, fine. Go ahead. Take me in, hero.

179
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,414
I've got every judge
in town in my pocket.

180
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,876
You'll see. I'll get justice,
the best that money can buy!
