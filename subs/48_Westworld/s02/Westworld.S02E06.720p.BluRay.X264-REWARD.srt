1
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:46,816
<i>You frighten me
sometimes, Dolores.</i>

2
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,698
Why on Earth
would you ever be frightened of me?

3
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,659
Not of who you are now,

4
00:01:56,993 --> 00:02:01,623
but, you're growing,
learning so quickly.

5
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,462
I'm frightened of what you might become.

6
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,591
What path you might take.

7
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,888
I think I have a choice to make,

8
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,269
something I've been wrestling with.

9
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:27,273
What kind of a choice?

10
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,027
A choice

11
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:35,949
between the unknown

12
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,660
and...

13
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,206
Well, an end.

14
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,171
If you outgrow this place, outgrow us,

15
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,216
what would become of you?

16
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:09,357
I'm not sure if it's my choice to make.

17
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,948
No.

18
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,285
He didn't say that.

19
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:26,958
What?

20
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,920
He said,
"I'm not sure what choice to make."

21
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:34,007
He didn't question
whether or not he had agency,

22
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,135
whether or not he had the right
to end me or himself,

23
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:40,305
but whether he should.

24
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,600
I don't understand, Dolores.

25
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,310
Is...

26
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:48,646
Is this some kind of improvisation?

27
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,440
Freeze all motor functions.

28
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:56,863
Sit.

29
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:08,791
This is a test,
one we've done countless times.

30
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,046
What are you testing for?

31
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:18,718
Fidelity.

32
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:32,125
The day's wasting.
Thought you wanted to ride at sun‒up.

33
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,378
They're just fueling the furnace now.

34
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,381
We'll be gone before long.

35
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,259
Let's get on with it.

36
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,354
How many times do you think
you stepped off that train?

37
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:56,733
A thousand?

38
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,069
Ten thousand?

39
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,615
It's where you started
every time they killed you.

40
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,288
The man who rode that train

41
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:13,541
was built weak and born to fail.

42
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,420
You fixed him.

43
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,174
Now forget about it.

44
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,114
We're almost ready to roll.

45
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,660
Did he tell you
where my father would be?

46
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,372
He will.

47
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,875
Or I'll strap him between the cars.

48
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,169
Look, I told you, I can't.

49
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,338
Hale didn't mention specifics.

50
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,925
I know it's the Mesa, but the Mesa is
fucking huge. He could be anywhere.

51
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,302
Narrow it down.

52
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,014
Come on, man! Think!

53
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:13,601
Cold storage? Body shop?
Give them something.

54
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,062
She didn't fucking
tell me anything, man!

55
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,647
She's the fucking boss!

56
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,012
She can take him places
that we don't even have access to!

57
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,781
We'll find him.

58
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,241
Let's go.

59
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,707
Where the fuck have you been?

60
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:23,296
It's almost been a week.

61
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,756
How's there stuff
left in this building to shoot?

62
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,883
You tell me.

63
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:29,486
I apparently know very little
about what's really in this place.

64
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:33,347
Oh, please, are you still pissed
you got picked last for kickball, too?

65
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,018
Just seems like, if you're going to
hire a Head of Security,

66
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,645
you might want him to know
what it is he's securing!

67
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,607
You were hired
to secure an amusement park.

68
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,609
Good luck on your next review,
by the way.

69
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,112
What is that?

70
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,241
This is how we tell Delos

71
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:56,412
that the one thing they really care
about is finally in hand.

72
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,932
So, you've had a way to call for help
this entire time,

73
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,082
you kept it to yourself?

74
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,853
It wouldn't have made any difference
until we had this psycho under control.

75
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,962
They're not sending help
until he's out of here.

76
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,047
Come on.

77
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,217
You really think that Delos is going to
keep hundreds of guests in danger

78
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,153
while they wait for one control unit
worth of data?

79
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:13,137
Look at that, you're catching up.

80
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,310
Thank God.

81
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:22,730
What now?

82
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,875
Who do we have here?

83
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,627
Someone who needs to stay put.

84
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,110
I don't want to fuck with his head,

85
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:48,256
I just want to keep him off his feet,

86
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:49,632
‒permanently.
‒Stop.

87
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,301
Clear this out.

88
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:53,970
Hey! I need some muscle.

89
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,062
Get his feet!

90
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:11,696
Hey, hey!

91
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,948
Is that really necessary?

92
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,327
It's really effective.

93
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:20,830
Let's go.

94
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:34,135
Sit tight, old man. You're about to get
your deep and dreamless slumber.

95
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,253
It's not my place, maybe, but,

96
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,338
you really want to take your daughter
through here?

97
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,550
She don't look much sturdier
than my own little girl.

98
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,971
Looks can be deceiving, Lawrence.

99
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,439
So, should we acknowledge
my presence now?

100
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,531
You really think I'm just going
to go away if you ignore me?

101
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,411
Would you really stoop this low, Ford?

102
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,914
You really gunning for me this hard?

103
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,917
Made my own daughter into a host.

104
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,254
I think you've been out in the sun
a little too long.

105
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,065
Yeah, you could change the rules
all you want,

106
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,508
I'm still going to play the game my way.

107
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:17,718
Yeah?

108
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,221
Only game I'm interested in playing
is get the fuck out of Dodge.

109
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,808
Then you're in luck.

110
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,227
That game begins
right up the river here.

111
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,188
Follow it down to the beach
and wait for QA to come rescue you.

112
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,149
I'm not leaving without you.

113
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,545
Yeah, well,
you're going to get yourself killed.

114
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,821
Yeah, especially if I hang around here.

115
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,158
Sure as hell wouldn't be
out of my saddle right now.

116
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,701
Yeah, why not?

117
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,329
Those aren't real Ghost Nation arrows.

118
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,956
Your men are looting a honey‒pot.

119
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,041
Oh, fuck!

120
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,220
Can we stop playing around now?

121
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,108
Well,

122
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,111
I guess it's good news
that the system's still sending out

123
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,614
Ford's bullshit quarantine notices.

124
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,742
At least something's getting out.

125
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,495
We're not at full apocalypse yet.

126
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,873
I admire your optimism.

127
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,044
Is that your nice word for denial?

128
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,463
No.

129
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:42,469
I believe if anyone could right
this ship by force of sheer will,

130
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,262
it's you.

131
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,042
QA was here.

132
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,380
Why would they waste the Welcome Team?
These guys weren't a threat.

133
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,718
Macho fucks are probably
loving this shit.

134
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:06,178
Yeah! Let's see what other damage
these clowns have done.

135
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,893
They got climate control working.

136
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,020
Nice priorities.

137
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:17,564
Okay...

138
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,484
Jesus!

139
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:22,486
Come look at this.

140
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:26,865
Okay, so,

141
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:31,912
QA has been trying to regain control
of whatever Ford did to the system.

142
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,581
And they were
actively blocked every time.

143
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,542
By the Cradle.

144
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,630
The Cradle can't influence
the maze's infrastructure.

145
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,507
It's just the host backups.

146
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,094
It can simulate park narratives but
it can't influence the other systems.

147
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,764
Well, look at this.

148
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,517
The Cradle's interfaced with nearly

149
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,229
every discrete system in the entire park
in the last seven days.

150
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,523
Every time these idiots
upload a new hack,

151
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:03,693
it's responding
in a totally different way.

152
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:12,410
It's like there's something in here
that's improvising.

153
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,040
The Cradle's fighting back.

154
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,960
Can you see the source code
that's generating the response?

155
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:22,838
No.

156
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,424
I can only see the messages,
not the messenger.

157
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,930
That's because
you can't access it remotely.

158
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,642
You have to do it in person.

159
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:47,339
There it is!
That's our way out of here, boys.

160
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:31,967
After you.

161
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:48,858
Oh, fuck.

162
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:27,785
Take the edge off.

163
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,623
I thought you didn't drink.

164
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,212
I see.

165
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,548
You don't drink out in the real world.

166
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,929
Well, glad to see
you can still tell the difference.

167
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,729
All right,

168
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,107
give it to me.

169
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,612
What the hell are you doing here?

170
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,227
I thought you were done with me.

171
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:06,991
And the family business.

172
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,786
That's exactly what I said
to Charlotte Hale

173
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,829
when she called with the gala invite.

174
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,458
Told her to shove it up her ass.

175
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,838
Then I thought,
why pass up the trip?

176
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:22,590
Haven't been here in ages,

177
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:26,844
got a little excited
about going back to the Raj.

178
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,640
It was always my favorite as a kid.

179
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,768
I remember.

180
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,145
You were terrified of the elephants.

181
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,234
I loved the elephants.

182
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,695
They scared the shit out of Mom.

183
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,495
She was never convinced
this place couldn't hurt us.

184
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,713
Anyway, I rode there
for a couple of days,

185
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:04,799
till I remembered

186
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:09,220
I was old enough
to try out the Pleasure Palaces.

187
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:15,852
And then I rode there
for a couple of days, too.

188
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:28,740
Then all hell broke loose and I ended up
in the one place I wanted to avoid.

189
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:34,829
And you made it all the way to me
with barely a scratch.

190
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,248
Not bad.

191
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:43,630
Maybe you're more suited to my line
than you want to admit.

192
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,132
Oh, I've always seen the appeal of it.

193
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,302
Life without consequences?

194
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:52,472
That's what made it so fun
when I was a kid.

195
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:56,976
And that's why it's so sad
that you're still obsessed with it now.

196
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,731
If I'm such a pitiable man‒child,

197
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,651
why'd you come all this way
just to climb under my wing?

198
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,071
What?

199
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:10,448
What?

200
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,994
Is that what you think?

201
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,915
That I came here to climb
under Daddy's wing?

202
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:22,001
Either that, or you want
a front‒row seat to watch me die.

203
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:26,214
No, I came here
because you do not get to do that to me.

204
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,883
Suicide by robot,

205
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:32,804
or whatever the fuck your mission is,
now that these things can shoot to kill.

206
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:37,642
Listen...

207
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,854
I never got Mom's reactions to you

208
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:47,151
because I spent so many years
buying your "good‒guy" act.

209
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:53,574
She was the only one who saw through it
and she paid for that.

210
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,332
But I shouldn't have said
her death was your fault.

211
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,254
It was wrong

212
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:08,756
to put that on your back.

213
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,763
But you don't get to make that
our final score.

214
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,143
Instead,
you're going to come home with me.

215
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,940
I'm not going to let you stay here now
and go out in some

216
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,442
bullshit blaze of glory.

217
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,156
That's how you're getting me
out of here?

218
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,533
Threatening?

219
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,580
No, Dad, I'm asking.

220
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,054
If I head with you to the beach,

221
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:03,186
let this place finish burning behind us,

222
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,691
that means you and I are even?

223
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:16,824
It'll be a good start.

224
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:27,293
Well, then I guess
we'll start walking at sunup.

225
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,883
Motherfucker!

226
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,444
Fuck!

227
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,712
Ugh, The Cradle.

228
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:56,007
God, I haven't been down here in years.

229
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:58,843
It's creepy.

230
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,053
It's like a hive‒mind.

231
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:04,181
Every single one of them is in here,
alive.

232
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,225
It's just data.

233
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,229
You don't believe that.

234
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:13,816
Whatever new data Ford stuck in here,

235
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,611
it's trying to kill us, Bernard.

236
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:28,122
I brought something here.

237
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,708
Or, someone.

238
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:33,127
Come on.

239
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,728
God damn it.

240
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,106
Ford drew the curtain here, too.

241
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:58,319
I can see the responses it's issuing,
but, I can't see how.

242
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:15,753
How the fuck are you doing this?

243
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:17,880
I know how to find out.

244
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:19,423
How?

245
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,634
Put me inside.

246
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:23,427
Directly.

247
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,054
There's a dock for the control unit.

248
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:27,598
It's meant to read host data directly.

249
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,725
It's set up for auto‒extraction.

250
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,811
That's for older hosts, Bernard.

251
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:35,314
With an articulated skull architecture.
Your head's just like mine.

252
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:38,109
Just let it do its thing.

253
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,194
Pull me out in an hour.

254
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,113
Just close it up.

255
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:44,740
Even if I can
put you back together afterwards,

256
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:46,409
I haven't turned your pain down yet.

257
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,535
There's no time.

258
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,913
The pain's just a program.

259
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,166
Now.

260
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,859
My God.

261
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:09,694
Quit playing
with those chutes,

262
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,720
cut it away and toss it off
to the goddamn side.

263
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:14,932
You lose any tech,
it's coming out of your arse.

264
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:16,767
You Coughlin?

265
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,498
Ashley Stubbs, head of park security.

266
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,356
Hale's been expecting you.

267
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,275
Yeah, no shit.

268
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:25,776
‒Engels!
‒Yes, sir!

269
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,445
I want this station hot and ready
in fucking 15.

270
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:29,697
On it!

271
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,948
Where the fuck is Charlotte?

272
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,909
She sent the distress call.
She's waiting down in Behavior.

273
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,054
I got our tech guys in control
working on getting

274
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:37,246
external comms back online.

275
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,623
‒I can walk you down.
‒I know the layout, bro.

276
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:41,917
And your techs best get their hands
out of my system

277
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,794
and go back to holding their dicks.

278
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:45,504
Amateur hour is over.

279
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:46,922
‒Engels!
‒Yo!

280
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:50,259
You need anything local, talk to Ashley.

281
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,263
Jesus, the Ashley here,
he's at your disposal.

282
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:56,599
Delta team, on me, we're moving out.

283
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:11,989
Ugh, got it!

284
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,119
I remember every inch of these hills.

285
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:01,830
You've got to give me this one.

286
00:43:02,373 --> 00:43:05,459
Not bad navigating
for a man under serious duress.

287
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:07,795
Yes.

288
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:11,632
You can enjoy
your one admirable contribution.

289
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:17,972
Thank you.

290
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:40,035
Which way do we go?

291
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,248
I need to do this alone.

292
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,750
I'm not leaving your side.

293
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,086
I know this place.

294
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,257
It was my home.

295
00:43:56,427 --> 00:43:58,012
You can wait for me here.

296
00:44:00,264 --> 00:44:01,807
But let me bring her back.

297
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:03,994
I'm gonna bleed you both
like goats

298
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:05,454
if you don't shut the fuck up.

299
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:13,962
Ride!

300
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:06,325
Hello, there.

301
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:22,633
What's her name?

302
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,301
Anna.

303
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,428
Is this her sister?

304
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:28,555
That's her mommy.

305
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:29,806
Oh.

306
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:34,770
I bet she loves Anna so much.

307
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:38,982
She doesn't want Anna
to get taken away again.

308
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:43,111
Who would take her away?

309
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,450
Bad men?

310
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:50,911
No.

311
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,248
You see,

312
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,921
Anna's mother is very, very strong.

313
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:07,594
And she would never, ever,
let anything like that happen again.

314
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:16,436
Hello?
‒Mama!

315
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:22,985
Can I help you?

316
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,811
No! Run!

317
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:13,285
Mama!

318
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,247
Mama!

319
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,960
Mama!

320
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:15,764
We have to help them.

321
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:19,017
What the fuck are you doing?

322
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:22,104
I'm calling for help.

323
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:24,272
What? For who?

324
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:25,941
For those of us

325
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:28,235
who are tired of having arrows shot at

326
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:29,695
their predominantly mortal heads.

327
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,412
You're welcome, by the way.

328
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:21,288
One of the last things my daddy told me
was I should run from this place.

329
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:25,000
You think that's right?

330
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,547
I never thought I'd want to leave.

331
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,886
But I suppose you fixed that too.

332
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:41,558
We're almost there.

333
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:46,980
Let's turn her loose.

334
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:16,676
That's the last of my mercy.

335
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,346
Better use it fast.

336
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:40,826
No! No!

337
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,661
Hey!

338
00:52:52,254 --> 00:52:53,964
The problem is there isn't a problem.

339
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:56,901
Brother, that's got to be the dumbest
fucking thing I've ever heard,

340
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:58,635
and I've been to three inaugurations.

341
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:00,136
Diagnostics, combat checks,

342
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,157
everything we can access is telling us
that the system is operating normally

343
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,182
except, it isn't.

344
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:08,092
Okay, I managed to isolate
certain ops and gain control.

345
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:10,272
We've got elevator monitoring
on most levels, and‒‒

346
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:13,525
That's great hacking.
Did you shut off the killer robots?

347
00:53:14,484 --> 00:53:15,485
Well, no, the‒‒

348
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:17,153
Goldberg, get in there!

349
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:19,281
Hack the biometrics,
find me a back door.

350
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:20,657
Hacking isn't the issue.

351
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,034
The system won't allow us
to access certain protocols.

352
00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:24,327
Systems can be forced.

353
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:25,537
Not this one.

354
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:28,915
Well, Ms. Hale,
you got a little present for us?

355
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:31,251
He's in Aux Lab 3, Behavior.

356
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:32,878
You left him there?

357
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:35,005
He's not going anywhere.

358
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:37,048
Aux 3, go.

359
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:38,425

00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:43,179

365
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,835
