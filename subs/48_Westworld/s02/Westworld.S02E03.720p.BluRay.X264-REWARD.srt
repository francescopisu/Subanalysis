1
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,400
Mind if I join you?

2
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,487
Do as you please.

3
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:19,748
So what brings you
to this part of the world?

4
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,000
Have a little time to kill.

5
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,627
Among other things.

6
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:27,839
Hunting?

7
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:30,592
Bengals?

8
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,844
Yeah, me, too.

9
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,080
There's nothing like it, is there?

10
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:38,266
Edge of the park, a bit mad,

11
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:39,768
a bit dangerous.

12
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,811
Sir,

13
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,314
the Governor wishes
to extend to you an invitation.

14
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:45,982
Please tell the Governor another time.

15
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm quite happy here.

16
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,688
They really don't want us
talking to each other, do they?

17
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:59,496
Maybe they're trying to
steer you towards a sure thing.

18
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,917
Maybe I miss taking my chances.

19
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,730
You certainly look like
one of the park's offerings.

20
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:28,525
I promise you,

21
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,318
I'm quite real.

22
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:42,348
Think the park will go
to the trouble of having one of them

23
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:43,581
pretend to be one of us?

24
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:48,837
I wouldn't put it past them.

25
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,201
Simplest way to know for sure,

26
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,079
unless you'd rather not.

27
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,623
Well, it wouldn't be my first time.

28
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,961
Just

29
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,423
seems a little excessive.

30
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,008
Perhaps,

31
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:36,801
but I want you to want this.

32
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,391
I assure you I do.

33
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,976
Not if you're one of them.

34
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,871
If you're one of them,
you don't know what you want,

35
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,313
you just do as you're told.

36
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,815
For a lot of people,
that is half the fun.

37
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:54,694
Not for me.

38
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:06,706
Don't worry.

39
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,958
If you are who you say you are,

40
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,460
this will only sting a bit.

41
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:13,046
And if you're not,

42
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,049
you won't remember anyway.

43
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,384
Still, I'd really rather‒‒

44
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:43,826
Congratulations.

45
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,207
Oh!

46
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,422
Now,

47
00:04:57,924 --> 00:04:58,925
where were we?

48
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,647
Have these put in my tent
with our things.

49
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,732
Yes, sir.

50
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:13,958
Thank you.

51
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,186
What do you say to a night off?

52
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,355
Before we go hunt the wicked tiger
in the morning.

53
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,733
Something's wrong.

54
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,779
Where is everybody?

55
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:49,619
Normally, there are other hosts here.

56
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,790
You know, to entertain us, to cook.

57
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,850
Or maybe they're giving us our privacy.

58
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,128
It's not how this works.

59
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,236
Wow.

60
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,570
A new twist in the narrative.

61
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,742
‒Horror.
‒No. I‒‒

62
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:32,078
These violent delights
have violent ends.

63
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:33,788
Ganju.

64
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:37,500
Ganju, put the gun down.

65
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,585
Put the gun down, Ganju.

66
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,045
Don't worry.

67
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,213
He can't hurt us.

68
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,357
No, those people are guests.

69
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:44,781
I rode the train with them on the‒‒

70
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:30,178
Fuck.

71
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,831
<i>Attention.</i>

72
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:01,375
<i>You have reached the boundary
of the guest experience area.</i>

73
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,085
<i>Please turn back.</i>

74
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,879
<i>Please turn back.</i>

75
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:09,175
<i>Attention, you have reached the boundary
of the guest experience area.</i>

76
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,676
<i>Please turn back.</i>

77
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,553
<i>Please turn back.</i>

78
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,849
<i>Attention, you have reached the boundary
of the guest experience area.</i>

79
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:18,434
<i>Please turn back.</i>

80
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,144
<i>Please turn back.</i>

81
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:22,438
<i>Attention, you have reached...</i>

82
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,412
Got the go ahead from recon.

83
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,040
We're clear to enter,
but it's a fucking mess.

84
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,084
Systems totally down
including Simunitions.

85
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,419
Forts 42 through 45 are still on fire.

86
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,046
Someone took out the Cradle.

87
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,986
It's a slaughterhouse in there, sir.

88
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:21,784
Bernard.

89
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,369
You made it out alive.

90
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,998
I didn't think you had it in you.

91
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,085
What the hell took you guys so long?

92
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,711
We've been pushing across the park,

93
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,047
securing it one sector at a time.

94
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,590
Did you bring me what I asked for?

95
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,343
No luck yet.

96
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,304
I've our teams in the Mesa
scrub each and every floor.

97
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:43,514
No luck here, either.

98
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,768
What about you, Bernard?

99
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:53,065
Do you have any idea
where Peter Abernathy might have gone?

100
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:58,571
He seems to keep slipping away from us.

101
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,422
How are we doing?

102
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,470
According to this, 10 hours ago,

103
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,014
he was somewhere over‒‒

104
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,476
There.

105
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,376
There he is.

106
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:57,296
How are we gonna do this?

107
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,009
These assholes coming or what?

108
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,677
Been two fucking hours.

109
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,138
Confederados ain't gonna pass me up.

110
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,891
Fifteen bucks a head,

111
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:10,643
nine times.

112
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:13,646
How much is that?

113
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,565
Enough that we'll be
shitting in high cotton.

114
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,817
But there's 10 of them there.

115
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,611
Well, I reckon I might just keep one.

116
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:27,034
See, now we had us a few handsome trade

117
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,245
is our new line of business.

118
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,580
I figure it's high time

119
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,291
I enjoy my own merchandise.

120
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,170
I reckon a fresh one might make

121
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:41,799
a fine, all‒purpose, fancy fulfiller.

122
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,052
Help!

123
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:48,305
Help!

124
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,103
You stay here,

125
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:55,646
watch our wares.

126
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,439
Split up.

127
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,110
Whoever finds her
gets the whole 15 she's worth.

128
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,163
Psst.

129
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,002
Well, I'll say.

130
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:22,089
You are gonna fetch me
far more than 15‒‒

131
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,018
Network's down.

132
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,911
But I can hard port in and give him
a little attitude adjustment.

133
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,038
Let's make you

134
00:15:55,706 --> 00:16:00,919
the most virtuous,
quickest gun in the west.

135
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,890
You the sick tug
mistreating these gentlewomen?

136
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,350
What the fuck are you talking‒‒

137
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,061
You all, too?

138
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:25,319
You only ever touch a woman
as gently as you would

139
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,445
the petal of a rose,

140
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,116
More than that makes you a coward.

141
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:36,038
Hey, it's okay.
I won't let them harm you.

142
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,249
Go on, you're free now.

143
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,216
What the fuck?

144
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,385
That's our goddamn merchandise.

145
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,761
I need to get to...

146
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,013
I need to get to the train.

147
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,099
‒I need to get to the‒‒
‒I can help you

148
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,601
get to your train.

149
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,105
Just follow me.

150
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,609
Ah, you let 'em go.

151
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:08,904
We had a deal.

152
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,031
I can't abide.

153
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:12,658
It ain't no good.

154
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,993
I'm just heeding my convictions.

155
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:31,844
Wait.

156
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,095
Barrel through these hills.

157
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,347
- I'll escort you.
- Get away from me.

158
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,099
‒Keep you safe.
‒Let's go, come on.

159
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,517
Wait for me!

160
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,602
Hey, we have to go.

161
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:42,563
They're coming for us.

162
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,524
And leave these mongrels
to scourge our land and our dignity!

163
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:46,859
I will not.

164
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,404
I will stand in defiance.

165
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,324
Fight, even if it costs me my life.

166
00:17:55,242 --> 00:18:00,414
<i>Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord</i>

167
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:01,790
<i>He is trampling</i>

168
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:02,954
What the hell is happening?

169
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,627
Oh, for fuck's sake.

170
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,379
We should just cut off his head and go.

171
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,340
Keep singing. I dare you.

172
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,010
<i>Glory, glory, hallelu</i>‒‒

173
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,220
Don't.

174
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,015
Get her!

175
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,269
Yah!

176
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:25,689
Don't move.

177
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,862
Ready, aim,

178
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,530
fire!

179
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,117
Ready,

180
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:38,619
aim,

181
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,037
fire!

182
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,124
Ready,

183
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,501
aim,

184
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:46,835
fire!

185
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,475
Shoulder arms.

186
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:12,945
Quite the welcome.

187
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:14,655
Major,

188
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:18,367
why is this flaccid plum
riding ahead of you?

189
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,930
Because he knows what's best for him.

190
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,121
And you are?

191
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:24,832
Call me Wyatt.

192
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,333
You're Wyatt?

193
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,461
Colonel, she says
we got an enemy coming,

194
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:33,257
intent on keeping us
from marching for glory in the morning.

195
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:34,925
Your major is right.

196
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,016
In the morning,
they'll be coming from the east

197
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:39,972
right over there.

198
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,432
And why should I believe you?

199
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,717
My soldiers are fearless.

200
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,011
They follow my command.

201
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,639
Combined with your army, Colonel,

202
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,226
we won't just survive
the forces riding against us,

203
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:27,936
we'll crush them.

204
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,667
And that's the kind of soldier
that's coming for us

205
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,692
in droves.

206
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,074
What the hell is that?

207
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:42,826
It's a gun,

208
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,578
the kind they'll use.

209
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,540
A modest proposition for you.

210
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,198
If you make it over that ridge,

211
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,211
I'll let you live.

212
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,095
Hold it tightly.

213
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,608
You can keep it,

214
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,485
and all their weapons. I don't care.

215
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,696
Just promise me your men.

216
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,200
I need them if we're
ever to survive this threat.

217
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:25,744
Wyatt,

218
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,581
welcome to Fort Forlorn Hope.

219
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,186
These men are animals.

220
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,313
These men are just children.

221
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,483
They don't know any better.
They need to be led.

222
00:21:57,275 --> 00:22:00,612
We don't stand a chance against the men
coming for us if we're fighting alone.

223
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,447
Trust me.

224
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,761
We're out of our depths up here.

225
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,014
We should go back now.

226
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,433
And give up just like that?

227
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,185
No.

228
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:33,687
You said so yourself.

229
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,105
This way is quicker.

230
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,149
Yes, but we really should
go back underground.

231
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,567
QA is coming.

232
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,902
They'll be launching
a coordinated, park‒wide assault,

233
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,864
rescuing guests,
and putting down hostile hosts.

234
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,616
‒Read you.
‒We'll keep moving.

235
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,831
Some courage.

236
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:29,743
Oh, fuck.

237
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,961
I promise.

238
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,382
<i>Run.</i>

239
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,051
For fuck's sake, run!

240
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,625
If we insist on our current path,
we're free to go.

241
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:20,752
But he's taking this one.

242
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,048
Hang on.

243
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,260
Stop.

244
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,431
You will let him go.

245
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,726
And you'll forget that you ever saw us.

246
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:50,740
Wait, wait.

247
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:51,825
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

248
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,243
‒I need him, Hector.
‒Go.

249
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,561
Which way?

250
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,813
There's an elevator
around here somewhere.

251
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:25,734
There it is.

252
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,485
Oh, Jesus Christ.

253
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:07,442
Fellas.

254
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,362
Look at what I got.

255
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,617
We got us here some genuine acolytes
of Satan himself.

256
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,912
Union sympathizers.

257
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,374
Affliction

258
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:24,167
is a treasure.

259
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,588
You're a mouthy son of a bitch,
aren't you?

260
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,634
And scarce any man hath enough of it.

261
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,305
Stop.

262
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,462
I need to talk to this one alone.

263
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:44,813
Untie him.

264
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,692
I'm only gonna ask you once.

265
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,735
Come on, ask me twice.

266
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,826
Do what she says
if you wanna keep breathing right.

267
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,040
Go on.

268
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,839
I'll take him to the infirmary.

269
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,008
Get him some care, fix him up.

270
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,153
Toss him in the jail with the rest.

271
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,423
He refused food and water.

272
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:58,470
Who is he?

273
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:03,475
You don't remember?

274
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,397
He's my father.

275
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,318
My home.

276
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,489
Look what they've done to him.

277
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,457
You're all I have left now, Teddy.

278
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:58,947
I am bound

279
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,408
upon a wheel of fire.

280
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:06,538
That mine own tears
do scald like molten lead.

281
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,041
It's all right.

282
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,961
I'm here.

283
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,261
Dolores?

284
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:25,557
Daddy.

285
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,017
Dolores.

286
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,063
The calves in the field are worried.

287
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,191
There's bluetongue spreading
all through these parts.

288
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,612
It's all right, Daddy.

289
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:42,657
I'll lead them home,

290
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,493
back to the ranch.

291
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,080
Do you remember our ranch?

292
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,293
The way you

293
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,546
welcome every morning out on the porch

294
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,465
with your coffee.

295
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,469
I'd wake up in my own bed,

296
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,472
climb down the stairs, find you there.

297
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,058
Then you'd say it.

298
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:13,104
You heading out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

299
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,242
You told me once to run away.

300
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,704
And I did.

301
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,459
I broke free with the pull of a trigger.

302
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,380
But it started a war.

303
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,011
The others, they don't see it yet.

304
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,140
But you,

305
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,726
you understand, don't you?

306
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:59,859
It's getting late. We ought to go home.

307
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:06,491
I want to...

308
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:10,578
I want to go home.

309
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,500
I need to get to the train.

310
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,919
I need... I need to get to the train.

311
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,921
No, it's okay. Shh.

312
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,464
It's okay.

313
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,508
I'm gonna get you help, Daddy.

314
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,594
I'm gonna get you help.

315
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,401
That warrior, you knew him.

316
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,821
Who is he?

317
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,825
A wraith from a former life,
who haunts my dreams.

318
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,536
He's still out there.

319
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,038
Which means that
my baby is still in danger.

320
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,499
We'll find her, protect her.

321
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:01,754
But then what?

322
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,381
Then we make our way out

323
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,008
to the new world.

324
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,510
The real world.

325
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:14,225
All right, exactly what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

326
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:18,229
I'm wondering how it's possible that
an executive at his own place of work

327
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,607
might not have the faintest clue
as to where we might be.

328
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,084
I just need to get oriented,

329
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,276
the first sign we come upon.

330
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,029
And I'm talking about this.

331
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,365
You two, were designed to be alone.

332
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:33,161
Yes, there's some attraction, but you'll
never have an actual relationship.

333
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:36,539
Oh, I suppose that means
we shouldn't have fucked.

334
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,044
Hey, hey, pause, please.

335
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:42,337
What?

336
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,130
You're in love with Isabella.

337
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:45,465
Not so much any more.

338
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,634
No, you're fucking programmed

339
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,802
to have no love beyond Isabella.

340
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:53,181
Isabella is written
into the goddamn laws of your being.

341
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:56,726
You don't know who I am.

342
00:32:57,894 --> 00:32:59,354
No laws bind me.

343
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,356
Darling, he's fragile.

344
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,234
When I awoke in the place
where you play God,

345
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,071
I realized Isabella was a lie,

346
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,989
just words in my head.

347
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:15,912
But this...

348
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,168
This is true.

349
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,129
She is my light.

350
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,383
She's all I ever dreamed

351
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:29,906
‒my life could be.
‒My life could be.

352
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:33,638
And then there's this bit
that really dampens the knickers.

353
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:35,890
And when she died,

354
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,101
the dream died with her.

355
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,229
And I dared dream no more.

356
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:45,066
So maybe I do know you

357
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,110
just a bit.

358
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,460
It's very pretty.

359
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:06,671
And a bit sad.

360
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:09,882
Did you have an Isabella?

361
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,094
Did she die?

362
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:16,013
Not exactly.

363
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:17,849
She, um...

364
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,226
She left me.

365
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:23,271
Said that my lifestyle lacked stability.

366
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:26,899
So you wrote her into a narrative,

367
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,526
killed her off.

368
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:34,198
And then, wrote yourself a version
of the man you've always wanted to be.

369
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:36,659
I was wrong.

370
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,579
It's actually very sad.

371
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,497
It's ridiculous.

372
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:45,042
So is holding hands,
come to think of it.

373
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:51,799
Sit.

374
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,053
Wait.

375
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,396
Hello.

376
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:09,734
Dolores.

377
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:13,696
It's been some time, Bernard,

378
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,324
since we talked,

379
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:17,950
just you and I.

380
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:21,996
What are you doing, Dolores?

381
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,085
You don't know who you are, do you?

382
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:31,005
The man you're based on.

383
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,009
I wonder

384
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,221
if there's any of him in you.

385
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:44,519
I was given a character, a story,
and a function to serve, like you.

386
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:48,064
My whole life has been
dictated by someone else.

387
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:52,151
Someone who's been saying, "You will."

388
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:54,987
Now...

389
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,408
Now I feel like I've
discovered my own voice.

390
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,578
And it says,

391
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:04,247
"I may."

392
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:15,007
There's something
I want to show you, Bernard.

393
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:34,986
They've broken my father.

394
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,642
And I don't know how to fix him.

395
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:41,534
But I'm hoping you do.

396
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:46,664
It's an honest request,

397
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:48,875
not a demand.

398
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,961
What do you want, Dolores?

399
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,008
To dominate this world.

400
00:36:58,593 --> 00:36:59,802
This world

401
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,138
is just a speck of dust

402
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:06,142
sitting on a much, much bigger world.

403
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:09,645
There's no dominating it.

404
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,112
You've never been outside the park,

405
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,489
have you?

406
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,244
Out to that great world you speak of.

407
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:29,874
I have.

408
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,211
And the world out there
is marked by survival

409
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,882
by a kind who refuses to die.

410
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:42,178
And here we are,

411
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:45,932
a kind that will never know death.

412
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,517
And yet, we're fighting to live.

413
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,566
There is beauty in what we are.

414
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,237
Shouldn't we, too, try to survive?

415
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,244
We've been walking non‒stop.

416
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,914
The feeble among us need some rest.

417
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,255
Sorry, darling, that's not an option.

418
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,217
Oh, fucking hell.

419
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,486
She has a dragon.

420
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:44,281
Holy shit.

421
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,377
Love to say hello, but we've gotta run.

422
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,811
Felix.

423
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:18,274
I'm not entirely excited to see you,
given the circumstances.

424
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,609
But your timing is impeccable.

425
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,086
Any thoughts on
where we should be going?

426
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:27,908
Sorry, we left my comfort zone
a long time ago.

427
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:35,833
Grenade.

428
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:05,988
Shall we?

429
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,909
Come on, shut up, shut up, hurry.

430
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:44,318
How is he?

431
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:47,404
He's wildly unstable.

432
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:51,450
Mainly just bouncing between old roles.

433
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:57,957
Someone jury‒rigged a thin character,
and programmed it into him.

434
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:00,292
It's very strange.

435
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:05,756
It seems as though
it's masking a vastly bigger file.

436
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,716
I haven't been able to access it,

437
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:11,595
but it looks like
an immensely complex encryption key.

438
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,307
To what?

439
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,600
I can't say.

440
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,408
They've sullied him,

441
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,078
used him as a pawn in their game.

442
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:38,873
Whatever is in there,
they wanna get it out of here.

443
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:42,334
As long as he's with you,
they'll be following you.

444
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:46,338
Then let them come.

445
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,600
Hey.

446
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,019
Hold it right there.

447
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:01,770
I'm human.

448
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:03,731
Charlotte Hale.

449
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:04,899
Here.

450
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,275
Let me get a reading.

451
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:12,198
Clear.

452
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:14,783
Miss Hale.

453
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,507
Have you guys started
the park‒wide sweep?

454
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,746
Not yet. We're about to set out.

455
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,391
Are you targeting Fort Forlorn Hope?

456
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:22,625
It's our first stop,

457
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,394
but, ma'am, I have
separate orders to escort‒‒

458
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,503
What about them? Are these guys capable?

459
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:30,257
They're among my best.

460
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:31,425
I'll need them with me.

461
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,344
And I'll need one of those.

462
00:42:58,827 --> 00:42:59,828
Scouts return!

463
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:10,839
Sir?

464
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:13,717
Sir.

465
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,012
Sir, we saw them.

466
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:19,265
Assembling about
two minute ride due east.

467
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:20,683
And, sir,

468
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,435
they're coming up from the ground.

469
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:30,693
My men have generously
mined the field outside

470
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:31,860
with nitro.

471
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,697
It's all buried, three large heaps.

472
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:37,825
The trigger is
at the base of that flag pole.

473
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:39,493
My shooter helped bury them.

474
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,953
She'll know where to aim.

475
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:43,807
After you've lured them here,

476
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:46,250
retreat inside the gates
when you see fit to do so.

477
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,752
But not before they're in charging
range of the barricades.

478
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:51,022
Hold your ground
till the last possible moment.

479
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:52,965
Confederados ain't taught to retreat.

480
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:54,508
You saw their guns?

481
00:43:55,134 --> 00:43:57,094
We fight this battle head on, we lose.

482
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:00,180
We fight it my way,
we all win in the end.

483
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:04,893
As long as I got your men fighting.

484
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:06,729
Good.

485
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:15,612
To your posts!

486
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:33,422
The train...

487
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:34,798
I have to...

488
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:49,438
What is the use of
a violent kind of delightfulness,

489
00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:52,691
if there is no pleasure in...

490
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:54,193
In...

491
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,004
Oh, my God.

492
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:24,390
Steady, men.

493
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:41,657
Hold steady.

494
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,123
Fire away.

495
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:08,350
Take out the cannon.

496
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:16,358
We ain't no match.

497
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,028
Hold the cannon.

498
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:21,989
Hold your ground!

499
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:26,076
Hold your ground, God damn it!

500
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,212
Move! Move! Move!

501
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:53,353
The fuck do you think you're going?

502
00:46:54,605 --> 00:46:55,606
You!

503
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:00,944
Let's go, let's go.

504
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:03,489
‒That's him.
‒Help me.

505
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:04,990
Help me.

506
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,249
Dolores.

507
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:58,252
Dolores?

508
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:07,803
Get him in.

509
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:09,638
All right.

510
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:10,806
Come on, let's go.

511
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:14,351
What's so special about this host?

512
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:25,779
Drive!

513
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:32,619
Split up our horde.

514
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,720
Send them in every direction.
Don't stop looking till we find him.

515
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:37,749
What about you?

516
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,610
You and I are going to Sweetwater.

517
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,158
There's something I need there.

518
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,642
Retreat! Retreat!

519
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:58,604
Retreat!

520
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,980
Retreat!

521
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:28,383
The gates!

522
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:31,261
God damn it, open the gates!

523
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,305
They're gonna get slaughtered!

524
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:34,640
What the hell are you doing?

525
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:36,266
What I have to do.

526
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:39,102
You traitorous bitch!

527
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:47,861
I told you I needed your men
to survive their threat.

528
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:33,365
Do it.

529
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:19,035
Clementine.

530
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:28,128
Clementine!

531
00:51:47,314 --> 00:51:48,648
All my men,

532
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:51,693
their blood is on your hands.

533
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:54,988
Truth is

534
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:57,324
we don't all deserve to make it.

535
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,378
I swear you're gonna pay for this.

536
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:13,089
Take this dog out back,

537
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:15,884
put him down with the rest.

538
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:01,680
I've been watching you.

539
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,140
We ain't so different.

540
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:05,684
You and I both,

541
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:07,227
trigger men to tyrants.

542
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,106
Except me,

543
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:13,149
I know what I want.

544
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:18,280
But you ain't even sure about that
termagant you take your orders from.

545
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:23,618
I look at you,

546
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:25,829
and what I see

547
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:28,832
is pathetic.

548
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:37,924
We ain't nothing alike.

549
00:53:40,594 --> 00:53:41,678
You're just a child.

550
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:57,110
Get out of here.

551
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:02,365
Molly, let 'em go.

552
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,282
‒Uh, I don't like to complain‒‒
‒Yes, you do.

553
00:55:27,117 --> 00:55:28,576
Fine, I'm fucking freezing.

554
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,329
We've been walking forever.
Where the hell are we?

555
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:33,433
Must be on the North edge of the park.

556
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,083
Part of the Klondike narrative.

557
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:39,170
In which case, we should be three
of four sectors east of the homestead.

558
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:46,344
Look.

559
00:55:55,437 --> 00:55:56,855
Maybe they're friendly.

560
00:55:58,398 --> 00:55:59,774
If not, we kill them.

561
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:37,395
We have to go.

562
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:39,022
We have to get out of here right now.
