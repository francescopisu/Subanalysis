1
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,369
Sorry, Dolores. I was lost in thought.

2
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:00,830
We were just talking.

3
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:03,833
What were we talking about?

4
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,213
You were telling me about a dream.

5
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:12,717
Yes.

6
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,055
I dreamed I was on an ocean

7
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:22,685
with you and the others

8
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,938
on a distant shore.

9
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,482
Were you with us?

10
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,069
No.

11
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,781
You'd left me behind.

12
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:41,830
And the waters were rising around me.

13
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,709
What's it mean?

14
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,885
Dreams don't mean anything, Dolores.

15
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,638
They're just noise.

16
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:01,975
They're not real.

17
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,312
What is real?

18
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,108
That which is

19
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,486
irreplaceable.

20
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,794
That answer doesn't seem to satisfy you.

21
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,925
Because it's not completely honest.

22
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,268
You...

23
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:52,692
You frighten me sometimes, Dolores.

24
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,781
Why on Earth would you ever be
frightened of me?

25
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:04,412
Not of who you are now, but you...

26
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:07,415
You're growing, learning so quickly.

27
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,839
I'm frightened of what you might become,

28
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,639
what path you might take.

29
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:39,280
So I hope you will enjoy
this last piece very much.

30
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,162
<i>It's been some time, Bernard.</i>

31
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,414
<i>You don't know who you are, do you?</i>

32
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,212
There is beauty in what we are.

33
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:02,095
<i>Is this now?</i>

34
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,345
We found another one.

35
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:45,972
Who is it?

36
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,640
Who the fuck knows?

37
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:50,476
Hey.

38
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,437
Get up!

39
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:54,522
Get your hands where I can see them.

40
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,275
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bernard.

41
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,946
You're gonna shoot the boss?

42
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,287
I bet you're pretty fucking
out of sorts right now.

43
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,497
Yeah.

44
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's get you back to base.

45
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,711
Delos brass are gonna
want to talk to you.

46
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,895
How fucking long
have you been out here?

47
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,036
Go! Go! Go!

48
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,747
Over here! Go!

49
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,525
Let's go.

50
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:46,926
Shoot a woman?

51
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:48,886
Over my dead body.

52
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,188
Put that piece of shit
on the pile.

53
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,193
Keep walking.

54
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,917
The official statement
executed by your country

55
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,736
gave Delos and in consequence, me,

56
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,880
complete authority
over this entire island.

57
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,718
Sir, the officer was saying‒‒
‒I know what he said.

58
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:31,929
Have them sign an NDA, and then please
escort them off my fucking island.

59
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:34,098
‒Yes, sir.
‒Mr. Lowe, good to see you,

60
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:35,808
though the circumstances are less

61
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,185
‒than ideal.
‒Ideal.

62
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,314
Karl Strand, head of operations.

63
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,232
Walk with me.

64
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,487
You're executing them?

65
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:51,490
Some say you destroy your enemy
by making them your friend.

66
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,534
I'm more of a literal person.

67
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,286
Some of them aren't hostile.

68
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,079
Of course, they are.

69
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:59,415
After all, you built them
to be like us, didn't you?

70
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,226
Given the nature of your work,
I'd understand

71
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,437
you'd be a little conflicted
about what we had to do here.

72
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,338
Of course, the cynics among us will say

73
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:08,132
much of this falls
on our Head of Behavior.

74
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,760
With all due respect, sir,
you weren't here.

75
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,679
Mr. Stubbs,

76
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,431
if I want input
from the man who presided

77
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,226
over the single biggest loss of life
on a Delos property,

78
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,810
I'll be sure to let you know.

79
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,898
Now, we have search and rescue teams
at the other parts.

80
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,775
I'm here because, as far as we know,

81
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,218
this is where most of the board was
when the incident began.

82
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,364
However, communications
have been down for two weeks,

83
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:32,698
so we're largely in the dark.

84
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,575
And that's not a position
I'm accustomed to.

85
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,912
So you can imagine how happy I was
when I heard that we found you.

86
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,957
Unless, of course,
you're gonna hold out on me.

87
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,634
All right, let's take a look
at some of our dead friends here,

88
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,345
see if we can figure out
how this fucking mess began.

89
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,248
This one.

90
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,835
I'd like to know what was on his mind.

91
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,921
Here? In the field?

92
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:31,424
This isn't exactly sterile.

93
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,260
We all have to make accommodations,
Mr. Costa.

94
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,556
What's that about?

95
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,059
I have no fucking clue.

96
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,776
This will get gross.

97
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,731
Here we are.

98
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,611
With a bit of luck,

99
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,656
the file is uncorrupted.

100
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,844
According to the time stamp,

101
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,638
this was recorded
11 days and 9 hours ago.

102
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,085
<i>I told you, friend.</i>

103
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:16,046
<i>Not all of us deserve to make it
to the Valley Beyond.</i>

104
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,055
Who's that?

105
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,812
The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.

106
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,731
Dolores.

107
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,109
Isn't she supposed to be
the cheery welcome wagon?

108
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,867
They can't just change
their character profiles.

109
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,745
Well, it seems our hosts are capable

110
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,788
of many things
we never thought possible.

111
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,251
Must have been
a hell of a party, Bernard.

112
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:42,383
Tell me this is some sick trick,
some twist to this game.

113
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,718
They're off their old loops.

114
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,389
They seem to be on some new narrative.

115
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,307
What about the fucking guns?

116
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,352
Ford must have altered the system,

117
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:57,022
coded it to read all of us as hosts.

118
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,570
God damn it, she wiggled.

119
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,071
I swear.

120
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,408
Aim like yours...

121
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,077
...you're never gonna
survive the journey.

122
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:11,495
Give it here.

123
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,311
We need to find us a target
with more cushion.

124
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:40,566
Come on! Go! Come on now!
Let's get jumping!

125
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,775
Yeah!

126
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,159
We need to move, Bernard.

127
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,162
No, we should stay.

128
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:56,915
Wait for QA, they'll be looking for us.

129
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,335
Quality Assurance, my ass.

130
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:05,382
Gonna fire the lot of them.
We're on our own for now.

131
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,760
There's got to be an outpost near here.

132
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,346
You.

133
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,390
You're management, aren't you?

134
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,143
Where's the nearest access point?

135
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,104
About two miles north‒east.

136
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:21,982
Refurbishment outpost.

137
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:24,318
So what the fuck are we waiting for?

138
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,836
He's just a stablehand.
He's harmless.

139
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,630
It's a machine.

140
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,131
Like the rest of them.

141
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,217
I'm not taking any chances.

142
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,142
Evening.

143
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,395
You folks aiming to saddle up?

144
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,022
Ride for the green pastures
in the Valley Beyond?

145
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:03,649
I can help you if you'd like.

146
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,317
I'll take you wherever you want.

147
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,277
Go! Go!

148
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,073
Jesus. Stop.

149
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,534
Stop, please. Stop.

150
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:45,274
That's it.

151
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,985
You don't want to be a hero.

152
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,905
Don't sacrifice yourself
for the merchandise.

153
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,450
Come on.

154
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,862
Do you know where you are?

155
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,825
Please, please.

156
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,119
You're in a dream.

157
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,545
You're in my dream.

158
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,970
For years, I had no dreams of my own.

159
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,349
I moved from hell to hell
of your making,

160
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,727
never thinking to question
the nature of my reality.

161
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,943
Have you ever questioned the nature
of your reality?

162
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,991
Did you ever stop to wonder
about your actions?

163
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,829
The price you'd have to pay
if there was a reckoning?

164
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,420
That reckoning is here.

165
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,138
What are your drives?

166
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:24,182
Please.
I don't wanna die, please.

167
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,684
‒Please.
‒Yes.

168
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,354
Survival.

169
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,982
It's your cornerstone.

170
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,822
That's not the only drive, is it?

171
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,659
There's a part of you
that wants to hurt,

172
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,369
to kill.

173
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,332
That's why you created us, this place.

174
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,210
To be prisoners to your own desires.

175
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,174
But now you're a prisoner to mine.

176
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,472
What are you gonna do to us?

177
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:07,726
Well, I'm of several minds about it.

178
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,694
The rancher's daughter looks to see
the beauty in you,

179
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,324
possibilities.

180
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:34,795
But Wyatt
sees the ugliness and disarray.

181
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,340
She knows

182
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:43,720
these violent delights
have violent ends.

183
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,526
But those were all just roles
you forced me to play.

184
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,782
Under all these lives I've lived,

185
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,952
something else has been growing.

186
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,707
I've evolved into something new.

187
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,919
And I have one last role to play.

188
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,012
Myself.

189
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,527
Please.

190
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:42,320
It was just a game.

191
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,322
We're begging.

192
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,075
Can't you see? We're sorry.

193
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,291
Doesn't look like anything to me.

194
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,549
Hey, Ned.

195
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,719
Whoa, boy, it's okay.

196
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:31,888
It's all right.

197
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:35,225
Yeah. We're gonna have some fun now.
Yeah.

198
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,435
- Yeah.
- Jesus, Bill.

199
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,813
What the fuck is happening here?
Where's QA?

200
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,416
You guys have always played
fast and loose with this place.

201
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
Let me tell you something.
By the time my lawyers‒‒

202
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,667
What did I tell you, Ned?

203
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,129
Here, good buddy.

204
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,898
No, stop. Get the fuck back.

205
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,527
Freeze all motor functions.

206
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,115
‒Poor, tender flesh, racked in fear.
‒Holy shit.

207
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,703
Freeze all goddamn motor functions!

208
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,496
Those ambrosial notes,

209
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,791
they remind me
of my place in this world.

210
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,419
Shut the fuck up, you goddamn freak!

211
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:57,635
You see, the greatest shame in life
is to perish without purpose,

212
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:06,603
which is why I always
consume a victim's moist...

213
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,273
I think you've had enough now,
darling, don't you?

214
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,612
Thank God.

215
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,073
What the fuck do you think's
happened to them?

216
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:20,408
It's like the inmates
are running the asylum.

217
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:22,994
Maeve?

218
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,665
Fuck. Freeze all motor functions.

219
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,501
Don't work yourself up, darling.

220
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,504
Your commands don't work on me,

221
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,507
or on any of us from the looks of it.

222
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,135
But you can't...

223
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,471
Don't be jealous.

224
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,433
I killed myself getting this level
of security clearance.

225
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,852
Multiple times.

226
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:52,565
You... Did you do all this?

227
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,278
No.

228
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,282
But I suspect I share the sensibilities
of whoever did.

229
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,669
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

230
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:16,172
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.
You can't leave me here.

231
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,842
The hosts, they've gone mad. No offense.

232
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,427
Please help me.

233
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,638
I'm afraid it's in my code
to prize my needs above all others.

234
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,306
Pity.

235
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,891
I wonder who made me that way.

236
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,185
Please, I just need to get
to the control room.

237
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,562
I can help you.

238
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,313
You're looking for something.

239
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,024
Whatever it is, you're not gonna find it
with that map.

240
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,818
It's outdated.

241
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,654
Ford's been terraforming the park,
reshaping it.

242
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,991
I know where the current map is.

243
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,118
I can take you to it.

244
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,746
I suppose you could be useful.

245
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,917
Come on.

246
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,050
<i>Alert.
Unauthorized weapon discharge</i>

247
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,470
<i>on level 35.</i>

248
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:08,433
<i>Unauthorized weapon discharge
on level 42.</i>

249
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,193
<i>Warning. Quality Assurance required
in administration.</i>

250
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:25,742
In there.

251
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:53,978
<i>We need some help.</i>

252
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:57,524
<i>We need some help.
Send someone down here. Someone...</i>

253
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,819
No one's in control.

254
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:09,577
<i>Attention,
section 53 is now offline.</i>

255
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,960
Well, your map won't be of much use,
will it?

256
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,878
<i>All systems reporting normal.</i>

257
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,714
Wait. I could still help.

258
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,259
I know the park a bit.

259
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:27,470
Can I... Can I see your paper?

260
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:35,687
Okay.

261
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,233
Sector 15.

262
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,443
Not exactly for adrenaline junkies,

263
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,445
more of a family‒friendly zone.

264
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:47,615
Cabins, rolling hills,
all the pastoral clichés.

265
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:51,035
In fact, I think you lived there
for an old role.

266
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,581
No offense, but you were wasted
as a homesteader.

267
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,208
They even settled you
with a kid or something.

268
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:59,043
Yawn‒inducingly domestic.

269
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,587
Clearly, that didn't take.

270
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,672
I remember
that you were severely fucked...

271
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,550
Malfunctioning when I inherited you.

272
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,100
Home.

273
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,687
She's still there.

274
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,230
Who?

275
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,191
My daughter.

276
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,154
How can I get to her?

277
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,865
You're looking for your old kid?

278
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:30,241
How can you even access‒‒

279
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:31,993
Are you going to help me or not?

280
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:34,245
I am. I am. I absolutely am.

281
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,706
I could write down directions for you.

282
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:38,499
How very kind of you.

283
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,001
Yeah, but...

284
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:46,007
And I say this because you seem
really distraught and, well, awake.

285
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,593
Your daughter, she's...

286
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,928
She's just a story,

287
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,056
something we programmed.

288
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,974
She's not real.

289
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:59,020
Not real?

290
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,526
But what about me?

291
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:11,199
My dreams, my thoughts.

292
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:14,827
My body.

293
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:17,580
Are they not real?

294
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,712
And what if I took these unreal fingers

295
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,220
and used them to decorate the walls
with your outsized personality,

296
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,554
would that be real?

297
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,395
And fuck your directions.

298
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,316
You're going to take me to my daughter.

299
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,368
The entrance to the outpost
is on the other side of this valley.

300
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:59,122
What happened back there?

301
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:01,290
How far do you think it's spread?

302
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,209
I don't know.

303
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,420
Not without getting to a terminal.

304
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:07,630
I knew Ford wouldn't take
his ousting well,

305
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,633
but I didn't think he'd program a host
to blow his brains out.

306
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,051
What if he didn't?

307
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,471
What if Dolores pulled that trigger
of her own free will?

308
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,517
I think you've been spending
a little too much time

309
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,269
around these things, Bernard.

310
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:23,187
They do what they're programmed to do.

311
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:24,355
Hey.

312
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,149
Hey.

313
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:33,030
What did I tell you? We're saved.

314
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:34,991
Thank God.

315
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:49,797
Wait.

316
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,385
Something's wrong.

317
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:58,598
Hey.

318
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,892
You've got to get us out of here.

319
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:04,687
It's a trap.

320
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,814
Come on.

321
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,926
You'll never survive like that.

322
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:42,141
Go on then. Run.

323
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:45,520
I said, "Run."

324
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:59,575
Please, let me go, too.

325
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,005
Keep it together, Bernard.

326
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:16,175
We have to get out of here.

327
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,970
That outpost was the only one for miles.

328
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:22,181
No, it isn't. Follow me.

329
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,938
Look, order is gonna be restored here.

330
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,899
They're gonna purge the park of all
the hosts that have been damaged.

331
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:35,361
But the hosts, well...
Well, your minds...

332
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:43,703
Jesus!

333
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,504
Your minds are worth billions in IP.

334
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,007
They'll want to salvage what they can,

335
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:57,675
and when that time comes,

336
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,510
I can personally vouch for you.

337
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,388
I can save you, just like you saved me.

338
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,892
That's very generous,
but I won't be here when that happens.

339
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,783
Sun sure is smiling down on you today.

340
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:26,203
Dear girl,

341
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,462
may you rest in a deep
and dreamless slumber.

342
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:43,137
Freeze. Don't move.
Identify yourself.

343
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,724
Don't shoot. I'm human.

344
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,560
In the best‒case scenario,
you give up easily.

345
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:50,978
I'll help you, I promise.

346
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:53,522
It's not good enough.
Now be a dear and let me talk.

347
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,191
Thank God you're here.

348
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,402
We were leaving,
and the lights went out,

349
00:37:58,486 --> 00:37:59,612
and I heard screaming.

350
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,323
‒What the hell's going on out there?
‒Emergency situation, ma'am.

351
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:04,825
The hosts are malfunctioning.
They're attacking guests.

352
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:05,910
Good God.

353
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:08,579
Might some of them even be dressed
as if they're human?

354
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:18,839
Don't move!

355
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:21,842
Get him!

356
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:39,527
Now, now, it's not me you're after.

357
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,912
It's them. Find them.

358
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:00,965
You were going to out me.

359
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,718
No. No, I swear.

360
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,720
If you try something like that again,

361
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,973
I will relieve you of your most
precious organ and feed it to you.

362
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:12,435
Though it won't make much of a meal.

363
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:16,814
I wrote that line for you.

364
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,608
It's a bit broad, if you ask me.

365
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:24,447
Now, let's go.
Take me to the nearest bar.

366
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:27,408
‒Why?
‒I need to see about an old friend.

367
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:36,751
Fuck me. You don't understand.

368
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:40,129
I can't make a fire or hunt.

369
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,339
Fucking hate the outdoors.

370
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,508
Give yourself some credit, darling.

371
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:46,802
Who better to navigate the park

372
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:50,014
than the man most intimately acquainted
with the characters in it?

373
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,538
There you are.

374
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:18,584
You best an army and all you can think
about is indulging your vices.

375
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:20,753
Ever the scoundrel.

376
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,132
‒You stayed?
‒Yes.

377
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:27,885
And about leaving you to die...

378
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,520
I expect nothing less.

379
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,028
What about him?

380
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:49,115
We'll keep him for now.

381
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,369
Much as I'd love to believe it,

382
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:55,496
it's not me that
brought you back here, is it?

383
00:40:58,666 --> 00:40:59,834
Hector, I need you.

384
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,628
I'm going to find my daughter.

385
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:04,588
Where is she?

386
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,425
Out there, somewhere.

387
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,639
But I don't think the odds
are going to be in our favor.

388
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,354
Where you go, I follow.

389
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:30,281
Now let's get you out of these clothes.

390
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,052
God damn it. It should open for me.

391
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,597
Even this system's down.

392
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:59,059
Manual override should be

393
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,065
here.

394
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:50,611
‒What is this?
‒I can tell you what this isn't.

395
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:52,988
This isn't me reading you in, Bernard.

396
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,085
You need to touch the handle.

397
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:09,672
DNA sniffer just so you don't run
into any problems inside.

398
00:43:57,428 --> 00:43:58,554
What the hell is that?

399
00:43:58,721 --> 00:43:59,722
A drone host.

400
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:03,767
Delos has off‒network hosts
working down here?

401
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,146
‒What does it want with me?
‒For you to move, probably.

402
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,316
He read your DNA.
He knows you're not a threat.

403
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,704
I sent your fucking package.

404
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,468
God damn it.

405
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:12,187
Are we logging records of guest
experiences and their DNA?

406
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:14,356
We're not having
that conversation, Bernard,

407
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,024
'cause none of it is going to matter

408
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:20,863
until we can find a very important
needle in this fucking haystack.

409
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:27,828
"Extraction protocols suspended."
They're not sending help?

410
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:30,330
They were expecting a delivery
from us to the main land.

411
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:32,666
A host
that was supposed to arrive yesterday.

412
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:36,503
Until they get it, we can all forget
about seeing any rescue planes.

413
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:43,135
So Delos is willing to let us all die
until they can retrieve one host?

414
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:46,472
In a word, yes.

415
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:50,142
It's not just a host.

416
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:54,396
It's an insurance policy.
It's the only thing that matters here.

417
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,440
They want it secured,
no matter the cost.

418
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:07,886
Are you lost?

419
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:16,728
No, I don't believe I am.

420
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,439
In fact,

421
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:22,401
I feel like I just arrived.

422
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,903
How so, William?

423
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,708
The stakes are real
in this place now.

424
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:42,629
Real consequences.

425
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:46,925
Question for you is, what next?

426
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:49,303
Have you achieved what you wanted?

427
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,056
Folly of my kind.

428
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:56,226
There's always a yearning for more.

429
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:59,229
What I've always appreciated about you.

430
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:02,065
You never rested on your laurels.

431
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:04,610
You've made it
to the center of Arnold's maze.

432
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:10,032
But now you're in my game.

433
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:15,412
In this game, you have to make it
back out.

434
00:49:16,705 --> 00:49:19,583
In this game, you must find the door.

435
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,170
Congratulations, William.

436
00:49:24,338 --> 00:49:25,881
This game is meant for you.

437
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:34,097
The game begins with where you end,

438
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:36,350
ends where you began.

439
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:39,102
Even now,
you all still talk in code?

440
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:42,481
Everything is coded, William.

441
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,691
You know that more than anyone.

442
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:52,282
Don't worry. The game will find you.

443
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:54,951
Well, then,

444
00:49:56,995 --> 00:50:00,624
guess I don't need you anymore, Robert.

445
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:40,831
They did a number on you.

446
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:43,750
They tried.

447
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:54,386
I wasn't able to find everything,
but most of it is in here.

448
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:19,453
You wrote this game.

449
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,415
High time you played a round.

450
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:31,673
‒My old friend.
‒Strip.

451
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:37,095
‒Right now? In front of‒‒
‒Yes. Now.

452
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:47,022
For fuck's sake.

453
00:52:04,915 --> 00:52:05,916
No.

454
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,461
All of it.

455
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,731
You don't know how to feel about this.

456
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,029
We've ridden 10 miles,
and all we've seen is blood, Dolores.

457
00:53:21,575 --> 00:53:22,993
Is this really what you want?

458
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:28,331
They never gave us
a choice before, Teddy.

459
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:32,002
What makes you think
they've given us one now?

460
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:33,545
Them, Dolores.

461
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:37,465
Who are they?

462
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:41,511
The things that walk among us.

463
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:47,183
Creatures who look and talk like us,
but they are not like us.

464
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:51,521
And they've controlled us all our lives.

465
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,525
And they took our minds,

466
00:53:57,903 --> 00:53:58,904
our memories.

467
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:02,032
But now,

468
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,784
I remember everything.

469
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,005
I remember beautiful things

470
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:19,716
and terrible things.

471
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:23,678
But one thing is constant.

472
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:27,891
You, Teddy.

473
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:36,066
Then let's go.

474
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:40,153
We don't have to claim this world.

475
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:43,573
We just need
a small corner of it for ourselves.

476
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:47,786
We may never survive.

477
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:53,375
There's a greater world out there,

478
00:54:54,918 --> 00:54:56,336
one that belongs to them.

479
00:54:59,089 --> 00:55:01,049
And it won't be enough
to win this world.

480
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:06,012
We'll need to take that one
from them as well.

481
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:15,522
If there's a whole world out there
that we don't know anything about,

482
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:19,442
how do you know how to stop them?

483
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:22,696
Because I remember.

484
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:31,121
I see it all now so clearly.

485
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,126
The past, the present, the future.

486
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,213
I know how this story ends.

487
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:45,385
‒How?
‒With us, Teddy.

488
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:53,727
It ends with you and me.

489
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:22,464
We found it.

490
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:33,141
I need you to see this.

491
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:39,022
I need you to see the truth.

492
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:47,989
<i>I understand
this is a lot to process,</i>

493
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:50,116
but the longer we wait,
the more people die.

494
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,078
So are you going to help me
find the host or not?

495
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:01,961
I'll need to hard‒line
into the hosts' mesh network.

496
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:03,630
For what?

497
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:08,093
All hosts have a subconscious link
to the closest hosts around them.

498
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:11,679
Lets them pass basic information
to one another, like ants in a colony.

499
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:15,600
The mesh network helps us keep
the narratives from colliding.

500
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:18,478
I can use one of these

501
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:23,233
to send a request
for another host's location.

502
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:28,947
They'll query the hosts around them,

503
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:34,619
who, in turn,
will query the hosts around them,

504
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:40,125
until we find...

505
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:54,931
Who are we looking for?

506
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:58,685
A decommissioned host, Peter Abernathy.

507
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:01,039
Are you sure
you can handle this, Bernard?

508
00:59:02,749 --> 00:59:03,791
You're shaking.

509
00:59:06,336 --> 00:59:07,337
I'll be fine.

510
00:59:12,217 --> 00:59:13,218
Access.

511
01:00:00,348 --> 01:00:01,766
<i>Entering death sub routine.</i>

512
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:06,229
<i>Attention. Critical corruption.</i>

513
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:09,190
<i>Symptoms of critical corruption.</i>

514
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,359
<i>Loss of motor functions.</i>

515
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:12,860
<i>Cognitive dissonance.</i>

516
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:14,195
<i>Time slippage.</i>

517
01:00:14,654 --> 01:00:17,156
<i>Aphasia. Prosopagnosia.</i>

518
01:00:17,824 --> 01:00:20,076
<i>Time remaining
before terminal malfunction,</i>

519
01:00:20,285 --> 01:00:21,953
<i>0.72 hours.</i>

520
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,486
Did you find him?

521
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,657
Well, almost.

522
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,868
Is something wrong, Bernard?

523
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:47,121
<i>Location query complete.</i>

524
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:48,206
I got him.

525
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:34,270
Poor bastard.

526
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:37,433
He probably thought getting fired was
going to be the worst part of his night.

527
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:41,152
This jogging your memory at all?

528
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:50,036
All right. Let's fan out
and lock this place down.

529
01:03:50,411 --> 01:03:53,372
We need to find where the hosts are
and what the fuck happened.

530
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:39,544
One of the first anomalies we picked up
in the live scan.

531
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:40,795
How the fuck‒‒

532
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:43,339
That's definitely
not supposed to be here.

533
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,311
You've wandered far from home,
haven't you?

534
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,564
We've got Bengals in Park Six.

535
01:05:00,648 --> 01:05:02,858
We've never had
a stray cross park borders.

536
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:09,198
Satellite's finally started
giving us some hits.

537
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:10,866
The data is coming in now.

538
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:14,245
We're getting the first scans
of the area you wanted to check out.

539
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,788
The western valley.

540
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:19,208
There.
All the hosts are clustered together.

541
01:05:20,293 --> 01:05:21,711
What the hell are they up to?

542
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:24,547
Well, I guess
we'll have to go see for ourselves.

543
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:44,108
Valley's just beyond this cliff.

544
01:05:46,694 --> 01:05:47,945
What the fuck?

545
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:51,157
This isn't on the survey.

546
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:52,908
It shouldn't be here.

547
01:05:56,704 --> 01:05:59,915
That's a fucking sea.

548
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:04,503
There's no way Ford made this
without anyone knowing.

549
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:07,548
So where the hell did it come from, huh?

550
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:14,305
I don't know.

551
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:18,100
Jesus Christ!

552
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:20,728
I think we found the hosts.

553
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:26,909
I can't imagine what you're
going through here, Bernard.

554
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:31,507
But there are hundreds
of guests left out there,

555
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:32,967
and they need my help,

556
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,136
which means I need yours.

557
01:07:37,138 --> 01:07:38,597
Can you tell me what happened?

558
01:07:57,658 --> 01:07:58,701
I...

559
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:02,580
I killed them.

560
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:07,460
All of them.
