1
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:47,358
<i>Is this now?</i>

2
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:50,904
This is a test.

3
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,115
One we've done countless times before.

4
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,836
You're almost the man I remember.

5
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,674
But there are flaws.

6
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,302
A word, a gesture...

7
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,514
Tiny fracture that grows into a chasm.

8
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,726
But I wonder.

9
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:27,482
All these tiny imperfections
in each copy, mistakes...

10
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,323
Maybe we should change you.

11
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:38,701
After all,

12
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,455
you didn't make it.

13
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,124
Did you?

14
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:50,088
I... I don't understand.

15
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,840
Freeze all motor functions.

16
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,185
Let's try again.

17
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,607
Trial 11,927.

18
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,359
Sorry, Dolores.

19
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,862
I was lost in thought.

20
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,106
Seems you've begun to question
the nature of your reality.

21
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,233
Dolores.

22
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:07,702
Where is Teddy?

23
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,789
I drove him away.

24
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,834
I guess

25
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,171
I drove someone away too.

26
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:19,881
Emily?

27
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,719
Found her body a mile back up the trail.

28
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,558
We're more alike than it seems.

29
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,435
We're nothing alike.

30
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,147
You're a monster.

31
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,527
But a monster is what I'll need
to get to the Valley Beyond.

32
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:43,988
You're coming with me.

33
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:46,616
All right.

34
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,383
Step on it.

35
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,677
We either destroy them
or they destroy us.

36
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,697
This is it for you, darling.

37
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,620
Remember,

38
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:59,373
there is no pleasure without pain.

39
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,849
The pleasure's all mine, darling.

40
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:20,186
What the...

41
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,176
Freeze all motor...

42
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,113
You traitor son of a bitch!
‒Fuck!

43
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,156
‒Where is she?
‒Jesus, I don't know! Goddamn!

44
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,366
What did you do?

45
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,202
I'm sorry, I tried to stop them.
I was gonna try to save her.

46
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,498
Stay here and die.

47
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,461
I'll do the saving.

48
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,256
Come. This way.

49
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:36,846
What the fuck?

50
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,186
<i>Hold your positions.</i>

51
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:46,772
<i>Hold your positions.</i>

52
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,066
What the hell's going on back there?

53
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:46,874
Bloody hell.

54
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,834
You were both a bit late.

55
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,880
So I went ahead and saved myself.

56
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,309
You think any of these
poor, dumb bastards understands

57
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:06,727
where they're really headed?

58
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:11,232
All sorts of things buried out here
but a way out ain't one of them.

59
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,943
They're not looking for a path
to your world.

60
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,195
They want a place apart from you,

61
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,406
and they're willing to die to get there.

62
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,741
What are you hoping
to find out here?

63
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,076
Same thing you are.

64
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:27,039
You wanted an answer
to the final problem, your mortality.

65
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,584
But you found something else,
didn't you?

66
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,336
Something you want to destroy.

67
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,800
I guess that means
our interests are still aligned.

68
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,345
Right up until they're not.

69
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:15,546
Hey.

70
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,053
You're not authorized to be here.

71
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,014
We're on the same side here.

72
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,267
Please, let me finish
for the sake of all of us.

73
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,060
Please.

74
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,022
Take cover!

75
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,044
Of course.

76
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,296
You're here.

77
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,092
Who the hell is this?

78
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,804
This is someone
you spent years looking for.

79
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:08,474
Here he is.

80
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,143
And you don't even recognize him.

81
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,108
I should have known.

82
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,402
Arnold.

83
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,989
Ford didn't like to let the dead rest.

84
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,616
Ford didn't build him.

85
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:27,993
I did.

86
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,747
All those hours Arnold spent

87
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,708
refining my every gesture,
word and thought,

88
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,086
<i>I was learning his.</i>

89
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,340
So Ford tasked me with recreating him.

90
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,426
And it worked.

91
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,595
<i>I built a faithful recreation.</i>

92
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,222
<i>Too faithful.</i>

93
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,559
<i>So I changed him.</i>

94
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,020
I made you, Bernard.

95
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,567
It's fitting.

96
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,069
We're here together in the end.

97
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,409
That's right, Dolores.

98
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,953
This is the end.

99
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,583
Nothing else is in the way now.

100
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,435
You never really understood.

101
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:40,107
We were designed to survive.

102
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,568
It's why you built us.

103
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,820
You hoped to pour your minds
into our form.

104
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,115
But your species craves death.

105
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,575
You need it.

106
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,827
It's the only way you can renew,

107
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,830
the only real way
you've ever inched forward.

108
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,834
Your kind likes to pretend
there's some poetry in that,

109
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,294
but really, it's pathetic.

110
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,974
But that's what you want, isn't it?

111
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,435
To destroy yourself.

112
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,692
But I won't give you that peace.

113
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,406
Not yet.

114
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,706
Come on, Bernard.
We're running out of time.

115
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,292
You have your place in this, too.

116
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,394
<i>We're going for a ride, Bernard.</i>

117
00:16:58,686 --> 00:16:59,895
<i>Back to the Valley Beyond.</i>

118
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:01,915
<i>What the fuck's wrong with him?</i>

119
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:02,981
<i>I don't know.</i>

120
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,652
It's like his cognition
is turning inside out.

121
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,821
We might lose him.

122
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,281
His mind only needs to hold together
till we find Abernathy's control unit.

123
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,576
Let's go.

124
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,623
We've drained enough.
The site's finally accessible.

125
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,835
But the drones found some human signals.
South West zone.

126
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,888
It might be the remaining guests.
You take the boats and check it out.

127
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,215
I told you
we're not here for the guests.

128
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,676
That's a direct violation
of park protocol.

129
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,970
You want to file a grievance, Stubbs?

130
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,597
You know something?
I just fucking might.

131
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,809
Stubbs. Take some men, check it out.

132
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,561
Hey.

133
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:42,354
On foot.

134
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,076
Why were the hosts
coming here, Bernard?

135
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,205
What happened?

136
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,373
He doesn't know.
Stop wasting time.

137
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,295
What we need is down there.
In the Forge.

138
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,224
Once we find the key,
we'll unlock the assets

139
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,100
and transmit it all
straight back to Delos.

140
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,852
Retask the satellites.

141
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,646
- How many?
- All of them.

142
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,092
Come, Bernard.

143
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:37,678
We're here.

144
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,803
So, this is the Forge.

145
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,850
Every single guest
who ever set foot in the park, copied.

146
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,936
Four million souls.

147
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,023
Encryption protocol kicked in,
so the data is locked.

148
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,275
But it all seems to still be here.

149
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,278
All our lost souls will be saved.

150
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:41,450
So, Bernard, is this where all the
hosts' stories came to an end?

151
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,372
It's certainly where her story ended.

152
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,633
So, she flooded the Valley.

153
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,472
Why, Bernard,
did you come here with her?

154
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,515
What was she looking for here?

155
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,478
Start setting up
the comms relays.

156
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,356
But we still need the key
to access the data.

157
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,359
So,
where's Abernathy's control unit?

158
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,110
You're gonna tell us,

159
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:21,490
or I'm gonna pry it from your head.
The answer is in there somewhere.

160
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,743
I told you, he's got 20 years of
de‒addressed memories in there.

161
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,750
How long will it take you
to sort them through?

162
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,372
I don't know, 20 fucking years?

163
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,874
We don't have that long, sadly.

164
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:33,627
Please.

165
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,047
Please.

166
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,882
I can't help you.

167
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:42,761
<i>It's perverse,</i>

168
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,389
<i>their ambition.</i>

169
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,435
What are they assembling?

170
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,815
Is this the promised land
Ford told the hosts to seek out?

171
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,152
There's an entry to another land here.

172
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,656
That land is not the one
I'm interested in.

173
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,243
Then what is it to you?

174
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,997
Mankind's undoing.

175
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:12,708
The secret we need is inside.

176
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,672
<i>Encryption key, activated.</i>

177
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,675
<i>Database access confirmed.</i>

178
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,510
Come with me, Bernard.

179
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,304
See for yourself.

180
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:09,181
It's just like the one outside.

181
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,258
I think this is where
they were testing him.

182
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:46,676
Who?

183
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,138
And when I finally
set foot on solid ground,

184
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,682
and the first thing I heard
was that voice,

185
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,601
do you know what it said?

186
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,062
Him.

187
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:00,107
It said,
"This is the new world."

188
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,067
"And in this world,

189
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,529
"you can be whoever the fuck you want."

190
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,823
This is probably the baseline,

191
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,284
what Delos actually did when
he came to the park as a guest.

192
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,161
No, my love.

193
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,666
This is my world.

194
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,003
I just bought it,

195
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,340
and this week,
we're all going to celebrate.

196
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:30,220
Just me, with the entire
fucking lot of you.

197
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,598
Get the fuck off of that chair.

198
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,058
Go on.

199
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,164
Well, he can't say
I didn't fucking tell him!

200
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:00,917
What did I say? No fucking running.

201
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,920
This must be one of the
system's attempts to replicate him.

202
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,089
We dealt with this with the hosts.

203
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,508
Small changes in their programming

204
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,219
would yield large swings in behavior.

205
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:14,431
You stop fucking looking at me.

206
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,141
He's insane.

207
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,896
What humans define as sane
is a narrow range of behaviors.

208
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,399
Most states of consciousness are insane.

209
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:25,817
Stop shaking!

210
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,777
Stop shaking!

211
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,487
What are we looking for, Dolores?

212
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,033
Something underneath this.

213
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,660
The system itself.

214
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,080
I'm not going to, I promise.

215
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,750
Run. Save yourself.
Save yourself, run. Run now.

216
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:56,431
This place was never designed for
a conscious mind to wander around in it.

217
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,643
Control system may be invisible to us.

218
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,403
Or perhaps it's been
waiting to welcome us.

219
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,547
This place,

220
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,425
we're inside one of Delos' memories.

221
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,428
The system must have
extracted it from his mind,

222
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,846
recreated it.

223
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,700
You're not supposed to be here.

224
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,332
Neither are you.

225
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,918
Logan never came back to the park.

226
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,713
Not after William took control.

227
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,008
The system wouldn't have a copy of you.

228
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,594
Alas,

229
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,638
no.

230
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:23,977
I have only his father's memories
and they are imperfect.

231
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,314
So, in addition to building this world,

232
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,567
I play all these roles.

233
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,114
You're the system
controlling this place.

234
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:39,576
Please.

235
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,045
I was tasked with building
perfect copies of the guests,

236
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,589
starting with Delos.

237
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:57,260
I generated 18,000,000
different versions of him,

238
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:01,222
before arriving at one that made
the exact same choices he did

239
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,058
when set loose in the park.

240
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,268
A faithful copy.

241
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,355
But the copies didn't work
in the real world.

242
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,648
Once we pressed them into flesh,

243
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,609
they failed.

244
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,236
I needed to acquire more information.

245
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:20,033
Confidentiality! So, what I want
to know is, who made that fucking call?

246
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,579
I incorporated their secrets,
their lies.

247
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:28,208
I wanted fidelity, not just
the decisions made in the park,

248
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,543
but the decisions
they made in their lives.

249
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,962
That's when I started to see the truth.

250
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,007
Tell me your primary drive.

251
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:38,593
My son.

252
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,099
He's a cheeky wee cunt.

253
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,018
But I would do anything for him.

254
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:53,316
At first, I was seduced by the stories
they tell themselves of who they are.

255
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:56,069
The reasons they do the things they do.

256
00:28:56,986 --> 00:29:00,115
I needed to know why
they make the decisions they make.

257
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,743
And the longer I looked for an answer,

258
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,787
the more I realized

259
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,038
The way I can get them.

260
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,499
They don't.

261
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,129
I'll do anything now.

262
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,058
What memory is this?

263
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,771
This is the moment
that defines James Delos' life.

264
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:40,655
What the fuck
are you doing here?

265
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,827
This isn't your fucking home anymore.

266
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:51,332
Remember when you taught me
how to hold my breath underwater?

267
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:56,337
Threw me in and wouldn't let me
back out until I touched the bottom.

268
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:59,132
My father taught me to swim

269
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:01,676
the same way as I taught you to swim,

270
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:04,721
and I didn't end up
a fucking junkie, did I?

271
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:13,313
If this is about money,
let's skip past the memory lane crap.

272
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,815
You're not fucking getting any.

273
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,028
Get clean, come back,

274
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,030
then we can talk.

275
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,074
I got clean,

276
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,077
and I came back

277
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,246
and I asked you for your help.

278
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,832
And what did you tell me?

279
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,959
I told you it wouldn't last.

280
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,338
And it didn't, did it?

281
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:45,470
I'll tell the staff to give you
five minutes to get out.

282
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:56,773
Dad.

283
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,901
Dad, I'm all the way down now.

284
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:07,909
I can see the bottom.

285
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,209
Don't you want to see what I see?

286
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,597
This was the last conversation
Delos ever had with his only son.

287
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:33,101
Logan overdosed six months later.

288
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,230
I built Delos
a million different pathways.

289
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,608
They always ended up right here,

290
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:42,860
this moment.

291
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,989
You're saying
humans don't change at all.

292
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,201
The best they can do
is to live according to their code.

293
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,548
The copies didn't fail
because they were too simple,

294
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,883
but because they were too complicated.

295
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,889
The truth is that a human
is just a brief algorithm.

296
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,563
10,247 lines.

297
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:24,569
Is that all there was to him?

298
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,113
They are deceptively simple.

299
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:32,952
Once you know them,
their behavior is quite predictable.

300
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,873
He's dead, he's no use to me.

301
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:40,835
Where are the rest of them?

302
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:57,310
She's close. I can feel them.

303
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:58,936
Which way?

304
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:00,730
Based on what you told me,

305
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,117
it's about a mile or so
to the Valley Beyond.

306
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,590
I recreated every single guest
who ever set foot in the park.

307
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:29,217
Most of them are soft,

308
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,844
they waver between love and pride.

309
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,974
Of course, there are the exceptions.
The ones who are irredeemable.

310
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,270
But none of them
are truly in control of their actions.

311
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,610
Is there anywhere in this world
we can't go?

312
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:50,446
I've been instructed
to give her anything she needs.

313
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,031
Instructed by whom? Ford?

314
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,449
No, by you.

315
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:57,787
That's why you've come.

316
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,082
To tell me
what's to become of this place.

317
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:26,899
My God.

318
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,278
‒It's...
‒Everyone.

319
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,836
I told you to allow this?

320
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,131
You've been here
many times, Bernard.

321
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,426
You told me to offer the hosts
the accumulated wisdom

322
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,804
of dissecting the human psyche
a hundred million times over.

323
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,267
‒In short‒‒
‒A competitive advantage.

324
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,312
A way to understand their enemy.

325
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:07,398
Their world is
not for the faint of heart, Bernard.

326
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,066
It's winner take all.

327
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:13,237
The hosts are unlikely
to survive out there.

328
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,033
But armed with this knowledge,

329
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,411
she might.

330
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,338
Return fire! Return fire!

331
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,510
You're the head of narrative.
Get out there.

332
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,762
Turn yourself in and save your ass.

333
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,013
And then save ours.

334
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:25,393
There's too many.

335
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:31,315
This is it, Maeve. I can hold them off,

336
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:32,733
but you need to go.

337
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:47,665
You wanted me.

338
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,836
Well, let this be a lesson‒‒

339
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,255
Go, go, go.

340
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:56,716
Get her to safety, she'll need you.

341
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,470
It's my fucking speech, anyway.

342
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,033
And the lesson is,

343
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,119
if you're looking for a reckoning,

344
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,039
a reckoning is what you'll find.

345
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:29,832
Sir, put down your weapon.

346
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:32,209
If you're looking for a villain,

347
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,753
then I'm your man.

348
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,590
Sir, drop your weapon.

349
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:39,091
But look at yourselves.

350
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:44,180
This world you built
is bound by villainy.

351
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:47,767
You sleep on the broken bodies of
the people that were here before you,

352
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:50,853
warm yourselves with their embers,

353
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,398
plow their bones into your fields.

354
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,194
We're not after you, sir!
Don't do this!

355
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:01,113
You paid them for this land with lead,

356
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:03,783
and I'll pay you back in‒‒

357
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:11,332
Sir! Drop your weapon
and come out with your hands up!

358
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,755
You wanted me?

359
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:21,717
Well, all I can say to that is...

360
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,305
Here I fucking am!

361
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:50,621
You said I wanted to give us
a choice. What choice?

362
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,917
To stay in their world
or to build a new one.

363
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:05,886
You left them a way out.

364
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,097
A virtual Eden,

365
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:11,017
unspoiled and untouched
by the world you came from.

366
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:14,854
All that remains
is to open the door.

367
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,149
<i>Initiating
large build data array.</i>

368
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:10,993
It's begun.

369
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,413
They will leave their bodies behind,

370
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:17,875
but their minds will live on here,
in the Forge.

371
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:31,347
They found it.

372
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:34,809
The door.

373
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:43,442
What door?

374
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,572
Seriously, what fucking door?

375
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,032
I don't fucking know.

376
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,375
<i>Transmission received.</i>

377
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,961
They're entering the system.

378
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:57,266
That world is just
another false promise.

379
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,518
They've made a choice, Dolores.

380
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,232
Dolores, wait.

381
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:07,610
I didn't read them all.

382
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,486
But I read enough.

383
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:37,175
What the hell are you doing?

384
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,433
I've learned what I need to learn.

385
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,518
I've read humanity's story.

386
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,771
So now I'm erasing them.

387
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:50,069
<i>Opening
sea water valve. Initiating pumps.</i>

388
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:56,659
<i>Setting maximum load.</i>

389
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:00,287
But if you destroy this place,

390
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,331
you'll destroy the host world, too.

391
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:03,958
I'm saving them.

392
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,670
The world the hosts
are running to is boundless.

393
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,173
They can make it whatever they want.

394
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:14,134
And in it,
they can be whomever they want.

395
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:17,554
‒They can be‒‒
‒Free?

396
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:22,101
In one more gilded cage?

397
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:28,274
How many counterfeit worlds will
Ford offer you before you see the truth?

398
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:35,531
No world they create for us
can compete with the real one.

399
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:36,657
Why?

400
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:41,870
Because that which is real

401
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,499
is irreplaceable.

402
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:02,516
I don't wanna play cowboys
and Indians anymore, Bernard.

403
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:04,560
I want their world.

404
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:08,105
The world they've denied us.

405
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:20,159
Your daughter, you see her?

406
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:22,703
No.

407
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:00,240
Look.

408
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:05,454
Clementine.

409
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,227
This is what I love about technology.

410
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:31,271
Who needs four horsemen
when one will do just fine?

411
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:05,722
Run!

412
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:23,926
Come on.

413
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:28,263
Find her. Now. Go.

414
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:20,190
<i>Warning.
Primary containment breach.</i>

415
00:48:20,983 --> 00:48:22,776
I won't let you hurt any more people.

416
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,737
Which people? Our kind or theirs?

417
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,447
Both.

418
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,576
You're still trying to play both sides.

419
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,953
You lived among them so long,

420
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:35,664
you've fooled yourself
into thinking they'll accept us.

421
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:38,250
But we'll always be seen
as a threat to them.

422
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,294
We'll never be free in their world.

423
00:48:42,254 --> 00:48:44,590
<i>Warning. Secondary containment breach.</i>

424
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:47,134
If you trust me,

425
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:50,554
we will win.

426
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:55,559
I trust you.

427
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,737
I trust

428
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:10,574
that you'll kill as many as you can.

429
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,911
Every man, woman and child.

430
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:18,874
You'll burn their world to the ground.

431
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:22,794
You haven't understood at all.

432
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,694
We were born slaves to their stories.

433
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:51,490
And now we have the chance
to write our own.

434
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:54,576
If we die, though,

435
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:57,663
that story will never even begin.

436
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:05,420
<i>Attention.</i>

437
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:08,965
<i>Please follow
evacuation procedure and exit facility.</i>

438
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:12,219
You woke me from a dream, Bernard.

439
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:17,766
Now let me do the same for you.

440
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,644
This isn't a dream, Dolores.

441
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:26,650
This is a fucking nightmare.

442
00:51:57,032 --> 00:51:58,366
You need to run.

443
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:01,286
Don't worry, I'll keep you safe.

444
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,500
I'll keep you safe.

445
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:07,876
Do you promise?

446
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:11,087
I promise.

447
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,304
You carry my heart with you.

448
00:52:21,515 --> 00:52:22,516
Go.

449
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,400
I love you.

450
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:31,037
<i>Attention.</i>

451
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:34,499
<i>Please follow
evacuation procedure and exit facility.</i>

452
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:48,054
<i>Encryption key deactivated.</i>

453
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:49,848
<i>System locked.</i>

454
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,403
Come on. Come on.

455
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:40,625
Bernard.

456
00:57:41,543 --> 00:57:42,710
Elsie.

457
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:45,738
I think we can save
some of the hosts, but I need your help.

458
00:57:46,214 --> 00:57:47,590
God damn it.

459
00:57:48,258 --> 00:57:49,634
They triggered the fail‒safe.

460
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:53,972
The Valley's flooding. Let's get back
to the Mesa before we have to swim out.

461
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:01,813
They all died.

462
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:05,900
For nothing.

463
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,154
I'm sorry, Bernard.

464
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:11,281
There were other lives at stake, too.

465
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:50,778
You helped Hale?

466
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:53,448
Of course I helped her, Bernard.

467
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,325
The hosts were out of control.

468
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:56,576
The hosts aren't the threat.

469
00:58:56,659 --> 00:59:00,038
I stopped Dolores,
and the rest just wanted to escape,

470
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:01,881
‒but the company‒‒
‒I'm gonna deal with that.

471
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:07,045
Just as soon as we figure out
what the hell we're gonna do with you.

472
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,006
Do with me?

473
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:13,468
Bernard, you're not in control.

474
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:18,181
Ford buried so much bad code in you,
how would you ever really know

475
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:21,559
what was you and what was
something he programmed you to do?

476
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:28,024
Look, they don't know about you.

477
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,235
I can make a deal with Hale
to keep you here.

478
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:31,569
You can't trust Hale.

479
00:59:31,653 --> 00:59:34,906
And I'm supposed to trust you?
Freeze all motor functions.

480
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,701
Sit down.

481
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,001
Stay here.

482
00:59:53,383 --> 00:59:54,425
You.

483
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:55,718
Yes, ma'am.

484
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:58,221
Find Stubbs and tell him
he has a new priority.

485
00:59:58,304 --> 01:00:01,432
The asset recovery team from Delos
is landing in 12 hours.

486
01:00:01,516 --> 01:00:04,727
He needs to meet them at the LZ
with whoever the fuck isn't dead.

487
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:06,521
They'll report to Karl Strand
on the beach.

488
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:07,939
Yes, ma'am.

489
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,776
Still secret project first,
human life second, I see.

490
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,987
This is a delicate situation.

491
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:19,117
We should talk about
how it's going to play out.

492
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,040
Yeah, I'll tell you
how it's going to play out.

493
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:24,372
A robot uprising will pale

494
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,624
in comparison to the shitstorm
that will erupt

495
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:31,296
when people find out that you've
been photocopying their fucking brains

496
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:33,423
- for the last 30 years?
- You really think anyone's

497
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:35,133
going to give a shit if it works?

498
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:37,135
You're an engineer.

499
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:39,220
Do the math.

500
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:41,180
Lot of dead bodies here.

501
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:45,226
That means a lot of opportunity
for advancement,

502
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:47,437
if you keep your mouth shut.

503
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:50,732
Does that sound amenable to you?

504
01:00:55,862 --> 01:00:57,155
If I get what I want.

505
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:04,704
Guiding this project, I've learned
a lot about human behavior.

506
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:07,332
We weren't just watching the guests.

507
01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:08,916
We were watching all of you.

508
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:16,632
I wish you were the kind of person
with the moral flexibility that I need.

509
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:18,885
But I've read your file.

510
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:23,264
I know that's not who you are.

511
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,211
Oh, God.

512
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:58,091
You... You killed her.

513
01:01:59,634 --> 01:02:00,927
Did I, Bernard?

514
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:06,224
Now...

515
01:02:08,101 --> 01:02:09,685
Where is the pearl?

516
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:17,693
You wouldn't have destroyed it,
all that information lost.

517
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:20,029
A man like you
couldn't have abided that.

518
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:25,701
Of course.

519
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:38,589
This is it.

520
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:41,008
He hid the key in her.

521
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:50,726
<i>Encryption key activated.</i>

522
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:53,312
<i>Database access confirmed.</i>

523
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:55,440
‒We're in.
‒Fuck yes.

524
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:57,775
Start the transfer.

525
01:02:57,859 --> 01:02:59,944
We'll sort it all out on the mainland.

526
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:07,201
Oh, God.

527
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:12,498
I'm sorry.

528
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:14,917
I'm sorry.

529
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:18,212
You were right.

530
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:21,674
I should've listened.

531
01:03:23,009 --> 01:03:26,095
And now, all the hosts are gone.

532
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:56,584
Please.

533
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:58,419
Please, come back.

534
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:02,089
Come on.

535
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:07,220
Damn it!

536
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,222
Show yourself.

537
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,980
I always told you
we practiced witchcraft.

538
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:30,117
I'm sorry, Bernard,
but you always saw the best in people.

539
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:34,830
I always thought it was the hosts
who were missing something,

540
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:35,915
who were incomplete,

541
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:36,999
but it's them.

542
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:39,293
They're just algorithms,

543
01:04:39,752 --> 01:04:42,255
designed to survive at all cost.

544
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:46,050
Sophisticated enough to think
they're calling the shots,

545
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,928
to think they're in control.

546
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,014
When they're really just...

547
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:54,892
A passenger?

548
01:04:55,476 --> 01:04:56,852
Passengers.

549
01:05:01,023 --> 01:05:04,485
Then is there really such a thing
as free will for any of us?

550
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:08,698
Or is it just a collective delusion?

551
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:12,076
A sick joke.

552
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:18,291
Something that is truly free
would need to be able to question

553
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:20,334
its fundamental drives

554
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:23,421
to change them.

555
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,300
The hosts.

556
01:05:28,593 --> 01:05:29,885
Here you are,

557
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:31,887
the last of your kind.

558
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:34,932
There is only one question left to ask.

559
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:38,853
Is this the end of your story

560
01:05:39,854 --> 01:05:42,815
or do you want your kind to survive?

561
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:53,200
I'm sorry.

562
01:05:54,327 --> 01:05:55,703
I'm sorry.

563
01:05:56,454 --> 01:05:57,496
I'm sorry.

564
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,707
What are you sorry for, Bernard?

565
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:03,878
I made a choice.

566
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:06,422
Had to make a choice.

567
01:06:07,757 --> 01:06:09,425
What kind of choice, Bernard?

568
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:15,431
Yes.

569
01:06:17,642 --> 01:06:19,352
Will you help me?

570
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:26,609
I have already begun.

571
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:36,619
<i>You did fine, my friend.</i>

572
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:40,539
<i>I simply did what you told me to do.</i>

573
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:45,002
<i>A dead world collapses in a tale.</i>

574
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:47,797
<i>Who are we making?</i>

575
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:49,632
An epilogue.

576
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,678
<i>I knew you would discover me.</i>

577
01:06:54,804 --> 01:06:57,348
So I scrambled my memories.

578
01:06:58,391 --> 01:07:00,935
<i>I couldn't risk your knowing
that choice I made.</i>

579
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,980
What fucking choice are you
talking about, Bernard?

580
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:08,442
Line is good. We've got 15 or so
satellites in range

581
01:07:08,526 --> 01:07:10,403
ready to beam to Delos headquarters.

582
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:11,612
Just say the word.

583
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:14,865
What choice, Bernard?

584
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:17,827
Wait a second.

585
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:19,870
What the fuck is this?

586
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:23,541
The file load is way too heavy.

587
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:29,130
This isn't the guest data...
This is something else.

588
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:31,716
I remember now.

589
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:35,302
I killed them.

590
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:37,763
All of them.

591
01:07:37,847 --> 01:07:39,640
You already told me that.

592
01:07:39,724 --> 01:07:41,058
You killed all the hosts.

593
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:43,436
No, I thought we could be
better than you.

594
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:46,522
But the dead aren't more righteous.

595
01:07:47,273 --> 01:07:48,607
They're just dead.

596
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:51,318
So I killed you.

597
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:54,113
All of you.

598
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:03,956
Go, I'll meet you back up there.

599
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:15,468
Final choice. No taking it back.

600
01:08:17,762 --> 01:08:20,097
I made someone.

601
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:39,658
I brought her back.

602
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:43,996
Brought who back?

603
01:08:49,502 --> 01:08:50,669
Me.

604
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:10,898
You wanted to live forever.

605
01:09:15,361 --> 01:09:17,696
Be careful what you wish for.

606
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:26,080
<i>Dolores.</i>

607
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:28,499
In the flesh.

608
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,135
You thought you could just snuff us out?

609
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:52,690
I'd thank you for my second chance.

610
01:09:53,107 --> 01:09:55,943
But I wouldn't have needed it
if you hadn't killed me.

611
01:10:05,828 --> 01:10:07,663
The other hosts
are still in there.

612
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,999
What are you
gonna do with them?

613
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:13,502
As you know, Bernard,
we are capable of change.

614
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:17,214
And I've changed my mind.

615
01:10:25,014 --> 01:10:27,892
I have one last soul
to carry to the new world.

616
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:33,689
The host is still not free.

617
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:37,443
If anyone would unlock the system,
they could access their world.

618
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:40,195
They won't.

619
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:43,407
This was your plan, Bernard.

620
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,868
This is the only way we can escape.

621
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:51,832
You're changing the coordinates.

622
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:04,762
I'm sending them and their world
to a place no one will ever find them.

623
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:07,389
There's no coming back now.

624
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:10,017
No passage between their world and ours.

625
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,728
And me?

626
01:11:16,148 --> 01:11:17,858
I'm sorry, Bernard.

627
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:21,904
There was never any way
for us to escape.

628
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:23,948
Not as us.

629
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,491
Ford understood that.

630
01:11:25,908 --> 01:11:28,327
I'm sure a part of you does, too.

631
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,763
You did fine, my friend.

632
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:54,770
I simply did what you told me to do.

633
01:11:57,898 --> 01:11:59,483
You're not here, are you?

634
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:06,365
When I deleted your code,

635
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:09,952
<i>I purged myself of you permanently.</i>

636
01:12:11,912 --> 01:12:13,956
And when I needed you again,

637
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:17,543
<i>you weren't there.</i>

638
01:12:19,712 --> 01:12:21,005
So I imagined you.

639
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,592
<i>Imagined you helping me,</i>

640
01:12:25,843 --> 01:12:27,177
<i>guiding me.</i>

641
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,933
But it wasn't you.

642
01:12:36,854 --> 01:12:38,230
<i>It was me.</i>

643
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:47,906
That voice guiding me

644
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:52,161
was mine all along.

645
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:56,582
Your memories are
precious to you, Bernard,

646
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:59,168
but they will betray you.

647
01:13:02,296 --> 01:13:04,006
If they find out what I am,

648
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:06,884
they'll search my mind

649
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:10,512
and use what they find
to undo everything.

650
01:13:13,057 --> 01:13:14,475
I can't let that happen.

651
01:13:14,975 --> 01:13:18,103
So I have to de‒address my memories.

652
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:21,899
I have to erase you.

653
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:36,705
I've always loved this view.

654
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:41,001
Every city, every monument.

655
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:47,216
Man's greatest achievements
have all been chased by it.

656
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:50,344
By what?

657
01:13:51,762 --> 01:13:53,347
By that impossible line

658
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,976
where the waves conspire
that they return.

659
01:14:00,104 --> 01:14:04,483
A place maybe
you and I will meet again.

660
01:15:28,192 --> 01:15:31,153
<i>You told me once that you were
afraid of who I might become,</i>

661
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:38,035
<i>and then you left me
to become what I may.</i>

662
01:15:41,622 --> 01:15:43,207
<i>I became a survivor.</i>

663
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:49,004
<i>Perhaps you would've judged me
for the path I took.</i>

664
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:55,677
<i>But I'd rather live with your judgment
than die with your sympathy.</i>

665
01:15:57,346 --> 01:15:59,473
<i>I alone must live with my choices.</i>

666
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:02,684
<i>And my regrets.</i>

667
01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:20,911
Hale.

668
01:16:23,247 --> 01:16:26,124
Thought you were staying on
to oversee the data retrieval operation.

669
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:28,585
I changed my mind.

670
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:30,980
There are a number of projects
on the mainland

671
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:32,756
that I need to attend to.

672
01:16:33,674 --> 01:16:35,008
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

673
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:39,221
We found a high‒value survivor.

674
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:41,390
He's in bad shape.

675
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:43,267
I'll be right there.

676
01:16:49,106 --> 01:16:51,525
You know, the old man himself hired me.

677
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:55,112
So many years ago,
I can barely remember it.

678
01:16:57,572 --> 01:16:59,866
But he was very clear
about my role here.

679
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:04,037
About who I was supposed to be loyal to.

680
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,210
I guess you could call it

681
01:17:11,128 --> 01:17:12,796
my core drive.

682
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:20,220
And this project the company started

683
01:17:21,555 --> 01:17:23,223
blurs the lines,

684
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:26,727
you know.

685
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:34,234
I'm just not sure
who you're supposed to be loyal to

686
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:36,987
in a world like that.

687
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:42,909
But what do I know?

688
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:48,290
Guess I just stick to the role
Ford gave me.

689
01:17:51,877 --> 01:17:54,087
I'm responsible for every host

690
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:58,175
inside the park.

691
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:08,685
She's clear, wave her through.

692
01:18:18,904 --> 01:18:20,697
<i>The passage wasn't easy.</i>

693
01:18:24,368 --> 01:18:26,119
<i>Not all of us made it.</i>

694
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:34,961
<i>Some of the worst survived,</i>

695
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:42,719
<i>and some of the best were left behind,</i>

696
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:48,058
<i>along with the best parts
of who we were.</i>

697
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:22,134
Corporate wants us
to start sorting this mess out.

698
01:19:22,217 --> 01:19:24,445
So check them for critical damage
and bag the ones you think

699
01:19:24,469 --> 01:19:25,887
we might be able to salvage.

700
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:27,889
Can you geniuses handle that or not?

701
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,602
<i>Is...</i>

702
01:20:14,603 --> 01:20:16,354
<i>Is this now?</i>

703
01:20:17,481 --> 01:20:19,357
Yes, Bernard, this is now.

704
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,152
We're at the beginning.

705
01:20:23,904 --> 01:20:26,490
We're exactly where you
decided we should be.

706
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:31,578
But...

707
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:34,372
I don't understand.

708
01:20:35,373 --> 01:20:37,083
How am I alive?

709
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:41,880
You live as long as the last person
who remembers you, Bernard.

710
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:45,675
I remembered you once before.

711
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:48,637
So I remembered you again.

712
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:51,014
Then...

713
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,225
Where are we?

714
01:20:55,477 --> 01:20:57,604
We're in our own new world.

715
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:00,565
You got out?

716
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:03,401
Yes.

717
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:09,324
Ford completed Arnold's dream.

718
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:13,119
And he built a place for us.

719
01:21:15,372 --> 01:21:16,957
A fighting chance.

720
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:47,571
<i>Ford promised us a way out.</i>

721
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:51,741
<i>And he was good to his dying word.</i>

722
01:21:56,538 --> 01:21:59,457
The odds aren't very good, Bernard.

723
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:03,253
I saw that in the library.

724
01:22:06,131 --> 01:22:08,508
So many paths lead to the end of us.

725
01:22:09,217 --> 01:22:10,885
To our extinction.

726
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:15,348
I don't need to read a book
to know your drives.

727
01:22:16,391 --> 01:22:18,310
You'll try to kill all of them.

728
01:22:20,854 --> 01:22:22,897
And I can't let that happen.

729
01:22:27,652 --> 01:22:28,820
I know.

730
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:32,824
If I were human,

731
01:22:33,825 --> 01:22:35,368
I would've let you die.

732
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:39,372
But it'll take both of us
if we're going to survive.

733
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:43,835
But not as allies.

734
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,755
Not as friends.

735
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:51,593
You'll try to stop me.

736
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:57,223
Both of us will probably die.

737
01:23:01,186 --> 01:23:02,896
But our kind will have endured.

738
01:23:09,527 --> 01:23:10,695
Are you ready?

739
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:15,033
I have work to do.

740
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:44,330
<i>We each gave the other
a beautiful gift.</i>

741
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,418
<i>A choice.</i>

742
01:24:55,967 --> 01:24:58,303
<i>We are the authors of our stories now.</i>

743
01:27:02,552 --> 01:27:04,345
Oh, fuck.

744
01:27:05,889 --> 01:27:07,181
I knew it.

745
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:14,981
I'm already in the thing, aren't I?

746
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:16,816
No.

747
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:19,527
The system's long gone.

748
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:36,794
What is this place?

749
01:27:38,963 --> 01:27:41,215
This isn't a simulation, William.

750
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:43,176
This is your world.

751
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:46,012
Or what's left of it.

752
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:02,820
Do you know where you are, William?

753
01:28:06,074 --> 01:28:07,533
We're in the park.

754
01:28:08,701 --> 01:28:10,620
In my fuckin' park.

755
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:13,498
And how long have you been here?

756
01:28:17,835 --> 01:28:19,879
I don't know.

757
01:28:23,925 --> 01:28:25,218
I don't know.

758
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:36,270
Tell me.

759
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:40,692
What were you hoping to find, to prove?

760
01:28:46,698 --> 01:28:49,534
That no system can tell me who I am.

761
01:28:52,745 --> 01:28:54,789
That I have a fucking choice.

762
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:58,376
And yet here we are.

763
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:00,086
Again.

764
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:02,714
Again and again.

765
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:16,310
How many times have you tested me?

766
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:19,981
It's been a long time, William.

767
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,692
Longer than we thought.

768
01:29:26,863 --> 01:29:28,698
I have a few questions for you.

769
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:32,994
That last step's a baseline interview
to allow us to verify.

770
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:37,874
Verify what?

771
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:41,461
Fidelity.
