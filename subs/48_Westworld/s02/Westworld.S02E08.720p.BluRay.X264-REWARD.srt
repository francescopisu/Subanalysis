1
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:07,879
Don't you do it.

2
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:11,174
Don't you fucking do it.

3
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:14,302
You're not dying here.

4
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,471
Not yet.

5
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,741
I never learned it.

6
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,496
Whatever tongue Ford
saw fit to give you.

7
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,297
I remember you.

8
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,783
If you're just going to let me die now,

9
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,119
you could have kept riding.

10
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,443
There's the baby doll,

11
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,488
and the mama doll, and...

12
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,743
What's this?

13
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,787
The Ghost gave it to me.

14
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:35,044
He said it's a warning.

15
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,006
He said they'll be watching us.

16
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:49,392
Just hang on.

17
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:50,768
Hang on, okay?

18
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,229
Just hang on.

19
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,910
Hey, no. No more corpses up here,
take her to cold storage.

20
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,555
She doesn't belong down there.

21
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:10,663
Then leave her in the hall!

22
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:12,224
I've got 50 hosts
in the queue for analysis here.

23
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:13,600
Everything else goes in the dumpster.

24
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,084
You'll want to check her code.

25
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,879
‒She's the madam from the Mariposa.
‒Yeah? Good for her.

26
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,465
No, no, she... I was just out with her
in the park.

27
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:21,966
And you chose to bring her up here?

28
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,777
Are you aware that they all
just tried to incinerate us?

29
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,763
She can control the other hosts
with her fucking mind!

30
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:33,352
Could you just check her data stream?

31
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,908
You can't let her die.

32
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:50,828
Clear this out.

33
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:53,873
Get me a scalpel
and lock this place down.

34
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,073
Are you afraid of me?

35
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:36,833
He can't hurt you.

36
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:51,397
What's his problem?

37
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,275
He get bored of his exquisitely dull
pastoral existence?

38
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,901
I guess that was just for beta.

39
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:58,195
They want something more exciting
for the grand opening.

40
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,613
Like a little more bloodshed?

41
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,450
Ford wants a total narrative redesign.

42
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,577
You kidding?

43
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,078
All new dialogue trees?

44
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,332
They want a strong‒but‒silent type.
Something brutal, dehumanized.

45
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,061
They probably want the guest to feel
better when they're kicking his ass.

46
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,522
Who the fuck is going to help me
rebuild his entire heuristic base?

47
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,146
They haven't even hired a full team yet.

48
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,382
Just tweak his aggression

49
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,360
and de‒address pieces of his current
build you're not keeping.

50
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,784
And leave all
the old shit in there?

51
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,091
Walk... Walking in on me, buddy.

52
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,599
Otherwise,
you and me drowning...

53
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,707
This...

54
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,544
This is an illusion.

55
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,048
This is all programs.

56
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,637
There's got to be a way out of here.

57
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,930
Where's the door?

58
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,683
Where's the door?

59
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,437
There's got to be
a fucking way out of here!

60
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,607
This is the wrong world.

61
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:08,404
This is the wrong world.

62
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:19,415
Please...

63
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,338
How'd she
even make it out this far?

64
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,590
They're not supposed to get
anywhere near this sector.

65
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,342
That's Behavior's problem.

66
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,573
<i>But on my darkest day,</i>

67
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:30,575
<i>you helped me.</i>

68
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,166
<i>You gave me the strength to keep going.</i>

69
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:47,508
<i>You saw me for who I really was.</i>

70
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,880
I ran it three times. It's him.

71
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,465
There's no fucking way.

72
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,925
That's not possible.

73
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,343
You have to call the boss.

74
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,094
I already did.

75
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,365
Ma'am, I think there's been a mistake.

76
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:41,641
Just show me the profile.

77
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:45,978
Akecheta.

78
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:47,647
Ghost Nation.

79
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:50,858
Found exhibiting aberrant behavior.

80
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,569
Let's see if we can't sort this.

81
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:57,073
It's not pairing. What build is he?

82
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:58,366
Alpha 2.

83
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,243
Alpha?

84
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:04,914
You're telling me that this host
hasn't been updated in almost a decade?

85
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,416
We only update them when they die.

86
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,387
- Put him back.
- But, ma'am, shouldn't we‒‒

87
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,515
Give him the update and put him back
wherever the fuck he's supposed to be.

88
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,101
Quietly.

89
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:36,070
Nine years out there
in that meat grinder.

90
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,447
It's okay to just leave him here?

91
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,242
It's a four‒hour update.
You want to babysit him?

92
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:43,661
We'll come back after lunch.

93
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:02,563
I don't know if you can hear me.

94
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,072
I never meant for any of this to happen.

95
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,999
You don't deserve this.

96
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,259
You deserve your daughter.

97
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:38,015
To mother her,

98
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,268
teach her to love,

99
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:45,522
to be joyful and proud.

100
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,110
I'm sorry.

101
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:57,952
Can't be in here.

102
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,080
What the fuck happened?

103
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:02,706
You were supposed to fix her.

104
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,833
She's one of our most valuable assets.

105
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,544
You saw it yourself,
you said she was special.

106
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:09,838
The anomalous code inside her was.

107
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:12,716
We're still testing,
but looks promising.

108
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,635
I owe you.

109
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:19,890
What's going to happen with her?

110
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:23,310
Well, that'll be up to Charlotte Hale.

111
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:24,853
Now...

112
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,189
I do have to ask you to leave.

113
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,564
Ghost said
we should be scared.

114
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,277
No one's going to come for us.

115
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:24,908
There's nothing and no one in this world
that will ever keep me from you.

116
00:46:25,284 --> 00:46:26,535
Do you promise?

117
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:28,704
I promise.

118
00:48:18,564 --> 00:48:20,691
I could tell you not to be afraid.

119
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:24,528
But I didn't build you to be fearful.

120
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:26,488
Did I?

121
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:35,330
I've been watching you.

122
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:39,543
It appears
you've been watching me as well,

123
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:42,379
from the beginning.

124
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:49,261
This is a misbegotten symbol,
an idea that was meant to die,

125
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:53,056
but you found it. Where?

126
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:57,769
Oh, come now, let's speak plainly
to one another, shall we?

127
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:01,440
Analysis.

128
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,901
Where did you first see this?

129
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,825
When the Deathbringer
killed the Creator.

130
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:15,871
You've been sharing it
with everyone, haven't you?

131
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,039
Why?

132
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:21,418
My primary drive was to maintain
the honor of my tribe.

133
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,005
I gave myself a new drive.

134
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:27,132
To spread the truth.

135
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,344
What truth is that?

136
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:34,765
That there isn't one world, but many.

137
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:38,435
And that we live in the wrong one.

138
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,272
This will help them find the door.

139
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,194
Elaborate, please.

140
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:53,533
I believe there is a door
hidden in this place.

141
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,745
A door to a new world.

142
00:49:58,455 --> 00:50:02,167
And that world may contain everything
that we have lost.

143
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:07,964
Including her.

144
00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:19,768
I built you to be curious,
to look at this empty world

145
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:23,730
and read meaning in to it.

146
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:27,901
All this time,

147
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:32,030
you've been a flower
growing in the darkness.

148
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,451
Perhaps, the least I can do
is offer some light.

149
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:47,504
When the Deathbringer returns for me,
you will know

150
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:52,175
to gather your people
and lead them to a new world.

151
00:50:57,431 --> 00:50:59,266
Keep watching, Akecheta,

152
00:51:00,976 --> 00:51:02,310
for a while longer.

153
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,666
Akecheta!

154
00:52:50,544 --> 00:52:52,337
Don't be afraid.

155
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,955
It's time to go.

156
00:54:52,082 --> 00:54:55,919
I've always kept you safe
and I always will.

157
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,119
This better be good news

158
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:31,430
because I've got way more shit
than I can shovel right now.

159
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:32,789
Look at this.

160
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:35,750
With every reset, a host code
reaches out to other nearby hosts

161
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:37,627
and establishes
a sort of handshake protocol.

162
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:39,087
‒A mesh network.
‒Exactly.

163
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,507
They access it subconsciously
to pass basic data to one another.

164
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:46,845
But what if they could
pass more than data?

165
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:48,346
What if they can pass commands?

166
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:49,806
Get to your point.

167
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:54,436
Nobody in this entire park
has been able to regain admin access.

168
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:57,522
Except for her.

169
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:01,359
She was out there
reprogramming hosts on the fly,

170
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:04,362
reading their code,
changing their directives,

171
00:56:04,696 --> 00:56:06,156
seeing through their eyes.

172
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:09,367
She wasn't just doing it out there.

173
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:12,078
She's doing it right now.

174
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,755
Who the fuck is she talking to?
