1
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:54,032
<i>Well, you've got your diamonds</i>

2
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:58,328
<i>And you've got your pretty clothes</i>

3
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:02,457
<i>And the chauffeur drives your car</i>

4
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,669
<i>You let everybody know</i>

5
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:10,381
<i>But don't play with me</i>

6
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,176
<i>'Cause you are playing with fire</i>

7
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,516
<i>Your mother, she's an heiress</i>

8
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:24,187
<i>Owns a block in Saint John's Wood</i>

9
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,525
<i>And your father be there with her</i>

10
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:32,570
<i>If he only could</i>

11
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:36,866
<i>But don't play with me</i>

12
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,577
<i>'Cause you're playing with fire</i>

13
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,343
<i>Your old man took her diamonds</i>

14
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:59,514
<i>And tiaras by the score</i>

15
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:04,310
<i>Now she gets her kicks in Stepney</i>

16
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,939
<i>Not in Knightsbridge anymore</i>

17
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:12,360
<i>So don't play with me</i>

18
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:15,488
<i>'Cause you're playing with fire</i>

19
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,172
<i>You have a visitor, Mr. Delos.
Shall I send him in?</i>

20
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,175
About time.

21
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,818
William, my boy.

22
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,528
Where the hell have you been?

23
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,572
It's good to see you again, Jim.

24
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,576
Thank fuck for that.

25
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:47,538
The most potent thing these cretins
will give me is grapefruit juice.

26
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,541
Here.

27
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:02,762
It's a little early for me.

28
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,641
Little fucking late, you mean.

29
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,978
Besides, if you aim to cheat the devil,

30
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,271
you owe him an offering.

31
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:21,739
So when can I get out of here?

32
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:22,991
Soon.

33
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,827
The observation period is almost over,

34
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,538
and the last step
is a baseline interview.

35
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:34,043
It's a conversation that will give them
something to refer back to.

36
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:37,463
All right, well, let's get on with it.

37
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,507
This is the interview.

38
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,611
They're thinking
that it should be conducted

39
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,095
by someone that's familiar to you.

40
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,179
A friendly face.

41
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:49,100
It's about capturing your frame of mind,
your mood, your sense of humor.

42
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,561
I own a biotechnology company,

43
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:57,150
and I'm dying of a disease
whose research I defunded 15 years ago.

44
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:00,737
I think my sense of humor
is fucking intact.

45
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,032
My patience, on the other hand...

46
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,284
Fair enough.

47
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,203
I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions.

48
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,042
Do you know where you are?

49
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,295
Carlsbad, California,

50
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:21,466
in some office park
I'm probably overpaying for

51
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,052
along with the rest
of this fucking endeavor.

52
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,720
And how long have you been here?

53
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,056
Far too fucking long already.

54
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,141
I've got a business to run.

55
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:33,561
What is the purpose of these questions?

56
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:36,939
Like I said, they're just trying
to establish a baseline.

57
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,274
For what?

58
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,651
Fidelity.

59
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,405
So what's the idea?

60
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:50,161
That afterwards, you and I
have the exact same conversation?

61
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,749
It seems a little far‒fetched,
doesn't it, William?

62
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:24,320
No whiskey, no tobacco, low on ammo.

63
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,949
Wherever it is you're taking me,
we best get there soon.

64
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:14,996
Let me go.

65
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:16,873
What are you doing?

66
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:37,226
These tracks are supposed
to head north, not west.

67
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:41,606
Seems like Ford's game
has multiple contenders.

68
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,609
The best detour's through Las Mudas.

69
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,612
What, that two‒bit town?

70
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:50,489
‒Got a better place‒‒
‒Oh, cut the crap, Lawrence.

71
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,658
I know you have family there.

72
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:56,454
Looks like Ford's arranging
their reunion.

73
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,774
Clementine.

74
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:26,776
Where are we?

75
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,638
Hello?

76
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:57,515
Who's there?

77
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,953
Elsie?

78
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,080
Are you fucking kidding me?

79
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,623
Stay the hell away from me.

80
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,102
You're okay.

81
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,272
Don't move.

82
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,816
I'm not gonna hurt you.

83
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,526
It's too late for that, asshole.

84
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:51,861
You choked me out.

85
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:55,114
You left me here with a bunch
of fucking protein bars and a bucket.

86
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,282
It wasn't me.

87
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,492
It was Ford. He forced me.

88
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,785
Oh, he forced you?

89
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,456
You knew too much.
He couldn't risk you stopping him.

90
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,874
Stopping him from what?

91
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,918
Ford wrote a game.

92
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,170
And we're all in it.

93
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,756
Now all the hosts are free

94
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,634
with no constraints, no safeguards.

95
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,053
What are you talking about?

96
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,598
Please, please.

97
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,224
What the hell is wrong with you?

98
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:25,061
Please, please.

99
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,896
Elsie, please.

100
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,564
Please.

101
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,150
No. Hey.

102
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,281
Elsie, please.

103
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:49,085
Cognitive lock...

104
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:03,724
You...

105
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,142
You rotated out.

106
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,979
Where did you go when you rotated out?

107
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:12,775
You have a family.

108
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,193
You have an ex‒wife.

109
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:16,695
You have...

110
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,698
A backstory.

111
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:24,870
Shut him down.

112
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,082
Okay. Okay.

113
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,334
I can...

114
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:32,461
I can de‒task your systems.

115
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,380
I can put you in safe mode.

116
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,092
Don't worry.

117
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,219
I'm not gonna break you, asshole.

118
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:41,595
Not yet.

119
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,556
You've got too much shit to answer for.

120
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,017
You're gonna be out

121
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,606
in three, two, one.

122
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,394
Is this now?

123
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,939
You have extensive cortical damage.

124
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,027
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you shot yourself.

125
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,865
I altered your code
to ignore the physical damage for now,

126
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:46,160
but you're not gonna last long
without cortical fluid.

127
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,963
With any luck, you'll survive
till they call in the cavalry.

128
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,929
Elsie, wait.

129
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,515
Elsie.

130
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,518
Wait.

131
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,480
No one's coming for any of us.

132
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,525
Delos doesn't want them to.

133
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,193
What? Why?

134
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,778
There's something here.

135
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,197
Something they've been working on
a long time.

136
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:26,450
Delos won't call in the rescue
until they've ensured it's safe.

137
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,160
Elsie, please.

138
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,371
I won't last without cortical fluid.

139
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,206
Even if I wanted to,

140
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,875
we don't have any tools.

141
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,002
We're in Sector 22.

142
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,088
I mean, there's nothing
out here for miles.

143
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,512
Bernard?

144
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,348
What the hell are you looking at?

145
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,454
Bernard.

146
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,498
What the hell is wrong with you?

147
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,586
There's a facility here.

148
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,381
What?

149
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:26,510
I think Ford had Clementine
bring me here for a reason.

150
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,985
I told you there's...

151
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,404
There's really nothing
around here for miles.

152
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,947
It's hidden.

153
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,241
It's part of their project.

154
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:08,469
What the hell is that?

155
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,862
Where does that go, Bernard?

156
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,825
I don't remember.

157
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,955
It's a whole lab.

158
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,179
What the hell happened here?

159
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,103
Oh, my God.

160
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,272
This is a control unit printer.

161
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,024
What are they doing with this?

162
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,352
Bernard.

163
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,439
What the fuck is that?

164
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,069
Don't threaten it,
and it won't hurt you.

165
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,626
What the hell were they doing here?

166
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,836
I think they were watching the guests.

167
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,633
What would they want with the guests?

168
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:54,927
Great.

169
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,929
Cortical fluid, okay.

170
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,690
Please.

171
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,611
Bernard.

172
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,572
Did you have something to do
with this project?

173
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,867
I don't know.

174
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,286
I don't think so.

175
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,247
Is Ford in control of you now?

176
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,084
Ford's dead.

177
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,295
Fuck me.

178
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,466
Okay. Okay.

179
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,844
Stay with me, Bernard. Stay with me.

180
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:37,970
Okay.

181
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,768
This is gonna hurt.

182
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,997
This can't be happening
because none of this is real, right?

183
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,206
It's gonna be okay.

184
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,457
Someone will rescue us.

185
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:12,004
Seems to me like our rescue's
in the same boat we are.

186
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,823
She said, "Time is coming,"
or, "Something is coming."

187
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,411
Spend enough time in the park
to learn the language?

188
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,166
Other people tend
to ignore their narratives.

189
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,877
I don't like other people very much.

190
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,213
I've been watching them
since they ambushed me.

191
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:56,524
They keep the humans close,

192
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,228
but they're not killing us,
just the hosts.

193
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,862
Yeah. No offense, but I'm not gonna
stick around to test that theory.

194
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,614
It's safer to wait
for the first responders, all right?

195
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,599
There's a protocol for evacuation.

196
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,017
I'll get you out of here.

197
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,227
Thanks,

198
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,606
but, uh,
I'm not looking to get out of here.

199
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,114
Home sweet home, Lawrence.

200
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,840
Where the hell is everybody?

201
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:56,942
Whiskey.

202
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,485
Nothing fancy.

203
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,367
You don't seem too happy
to be home, Lawrence.

204
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,828
I've never been the domestic type.

205
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,957
By some fluke of nature,
I got myself a wife and a daughter

206
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,667
who think I'm the moon.

207
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,920
Truth is, I'm a son of a bitch.

208
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,215
The kindest thing I ever did
was to keep away.

209
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,889
The grand reserve,
only for our most distinguished guest.

210
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,101
Hey, hey, hey.

211
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,729
I haven't even shot anybody yet.

212
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:36,565
What's your problem?

213
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:51,580
You harbor even the faintest
ambition in using that thing,

214
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:55,584
and I'll turn that pretty face of yours
inside out.

215
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,929
Someone took a chunk out of you boys.

216
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,390
What happened to the rest of you?

217
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,059
Double crossed

218
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,561
by some bitch name of Wyatt.

219
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,397
Good for her.

220
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:18,690
On your feet.

221
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,448
Move.

222
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,630
Papa!

223
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,305
Now,

224
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:55,185
me and my men here have a long journey
ahead of us.

225
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,399
We need food, whiskey,

226
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,443
and ammunition.

227
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:07,364
You people have some village elder
who can speak for you,

228
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,949
make some kind of a deal?

229
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:32,806
I ain't interested
in making fucking deals.

230
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,475
You understand?

231
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,231
We know you motherfuckers are rebels.

232
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:48,238
So you're gonna tell me
where the fuck you hid your weapons,

233
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,698
or you're gonna die.

234
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,241
The second we tell him,

235
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,035
he's gonna kill us all anyway.

236
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:58,498
We don't even need you
to talk, motherfuckers.

237
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,671
‒I will cut your fucking throats.
‒They got my family, my daughter.

238
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,259
You told me you had a daughter.

239
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,099
Did I?

240
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,852
I don't know. At some point?

241
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,897
You ain't exactly forthcoming.

242
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,318
But I remember that much.

243
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,613
Point is,

244
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,492
you think she'd want to watch you
gunned down in front of her?

245
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,829
Probably.

246
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,585
I'm not gonna fucking die here.

247
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:46,129
We just need to get the weapons.

248
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,634
You know where they are?

249
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,721
In an unmarked grave out back.

250
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,766
We'll wait till they're drunk,

251
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,434
make a run for it.

252
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,186
Sound like a plan?

253
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:05,732
Yeah.

254
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,442
You know exactly
where they are.

255
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,863
What the fuck are you doing?

256
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:12,948
You.

257
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,244
Let's make a deal.

258
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,252
The weapons are in an unmarked grave
behind the church.

259
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,463
For a man who wants to deal,
you ain't very proficient at it.

260
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,967
Supposed to set the terms
before you give up what you got.

261
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,593
That's not what I'm offering.

262
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:34,761
Hmm.

263
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,513
I know something you don't.

264
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,099
I know where you're going.

265
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,186
You've been telling your men you know,

266
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,605
but you don't.

267
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:49,734
Just some place you think
your dreams are coming true.

268
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,196
You call it Glory,

269
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,865
but it's got a lot of names.

270
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:00,078
And I know the way.

271
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,419
Go check the graveyard.

272
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,223
<i>There's a new sensation</i>

273
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,518
<i>A fabulous creation</i>

274
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:27,105
<i>A danceable solution</i>

275
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,442
<i>To teenage revolution</i>

276
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,779
<i>Do the Strand love</i>

277
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,658
<i>When you feel love</i>

278
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,870
<i>It's the new way</i>

279
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,206
<i>And that's why we say</i>

280
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,501
<i>Do the Strand</i>

281
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,963
<i>Do the Strand</i>

282
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,076
<i>You have a visitor, sir.</i>

283
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,621
About time.

284
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,598
William, my boy.

285
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,184
Where the hell have you been?

286
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,186
It's good to see you again, Jim.

287
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,404
A little early for me.

288
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,697
Little fucking late, you mean.

289
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,451
Besides, if you aim to cheat the devil,

290
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:05,495
you owe him an offering.

291
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,295
What is the purpose
of these questions?

292
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:17,424
Like I said, they're just
trying to establish a baseline.

293
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,217
For what?

294
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:21,219
Fidelity.

295
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:26,349
So what's the idea?

296
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,438
That afterwards,
we'd have the exact same conversation?

297
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:35,859
Seems a little far‒fetched,
doesn't it, William?

298
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,278
It did, at first.

299
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:25,992
And here I thought

300
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:29,412
you were just pissing away my money.

301
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,377
You little fucking chancer.

302
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,215
I take it I didn't recover.

303
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,509
I'm afraid not.

304
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,222
How long has it been?

305
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:50,391
Seven years, give or take.

306
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,738
I'm not in California anymore, am I?

307
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,783
If you can't tell, does it matter?

308
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:19,796
So let's get me the fuck out of here.

309
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:28,388
I am ready to smoke my cigars,
sail my boat, fuck my wife.

310
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:38,523
I take it that last part
isn't an option.

311
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,191
I'm afraid not.

312
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,654
What did her in?

313
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,698
It was a stroke.

314
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,327
Juliet had her buried
in the family plot.

315
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:56,624
Juliet...

316
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,127
Looking after...

317
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,880
And my granddaughter, she...

318
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,257
She's whip‒smart,

319
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,801
capable.

320
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,739
I assume my house is ready for me.

321
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:33,286
I'm afraid it's not that simple, Jim.
We...

322
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:37,624
We're gonna need to keep you here
just a little bit longer,

323
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,208
okay, for some observation.

324
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:43,921
These fuckers have poked
and prodded me ad infinitum.

325
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,632
Yeah, but we don't wanna rush it.

326
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,133
We don't wanna wear you out.

327
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:48,676
Wear me out?

328
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,928
I feel fucking brand‒new.

329
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:55,350
I am ready to get out there
and see the sun.

330
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,269
Get some fresh aid...

331
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:02,523
Air.

332
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,402
Get some...

333
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:09,822
Get back to...

334
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,122
I'll come back tomorrow.

335
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:26,255
‒You go...
‒Yeah.

336
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,257
In the...

337
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,259
It's good to have you back, Jim.

338
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:56,077
Same problems as before.

339
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,831
Made it to day seven this time,
so that's progress.

340
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,917
Would you like to go ahead
and terminate, sir?

341
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,296
Go ahead.

342
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,618
Great looking piece.

343
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,746
It got stolen at the border.

344
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,914
Ain't that right, <i>amigo?</i>

345
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,675
Nitro.

346
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:58,765
Oh, boy.

347
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:02,643
We are going to blast
our way clear to Glory.

348
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,274
What the...

349
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,359
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

350
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,154
I'm sorry.

351
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,158
Hi.

352
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:20,369
You need to steady your hands
in your occupation.

353
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,038
Let me teach you.

354
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:41,933
Now,

355
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,977
how about you try and measure
a dozen paces?

356
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,353
Well done, my friend.

357
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,772
Oh God! It's too late.

358
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:56,359
You and your stupid fucking fantasy.
You've gotten us killed.

359
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:24,553
You live only as long
as the last person who remembers you.

360
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,210
Elsie.

361
00:38:56,794 --> 00:38:58,295
Pint or so of the good stuff.

362
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,382
You should be feeling
a bit more like yourself.

363
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:02,800
Thank you.

364
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:04,927
I still don't trust you.

365
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:08,097
But I also figure
I might need your help.

366
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:12,893
Whoever did this really didn't want us
accessing whatever's on this processor.

367
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:15,688
It's an entirely different OS
than our systems,

368
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,398
in a language I've never seen.

369
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:21,152
I've seen this kind
of encryption scheme before.

370
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:23,154
Where?

371
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,990
In Peter Abernathy's head.

372
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:29,869
In reference to database much larger
than anything I know of in the park.

373
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,376
I think I've been here before.

374
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,671
‒Can you remember?
‒I think Ford sent me here.

375
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,465
I'm not sure.

376
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,719
The damage's repaired,
but my memories, I...

377
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,471
I get lost in them.

378
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:51,807
I can't tell if this is now or then.

379
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,267
Yeah.

380
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,103
I saw that when I was
digging around in your code.

381
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,105
Your memories aren't addressed.

382
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:00,066
They're just kind
of drifting around in there.

383
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,692
So when you're experiencing one,

384
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:04,737
you have no idea whether it comes
before or after the others.

385
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,358
I've been here.

386
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,276
Recently.

387
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,528
Why?

388
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,029
What were you doing?

389
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:48,572
I don't know.

390
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:52,118
But I think I know
what they were doing here.

391
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,162
They weren't building hosts.

392
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,331
Not exactly.

393
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,172
What were they building here
if not hosts?

394
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:08,634
The same hardware,
but the code is different.

395
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:12,138
The language not code at all.
Not really.

396
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:19,228
Elsie.

397
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:21,522
Don't.

398
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:26,277
Whatever they're making here,
it's behind this door.

399
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:30,531
Maybe we don't want to know.

400
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:35,786
We have to see what's inside.

401
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,497
Elsie.

402
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,916
Elsie.

403
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:44,712
I'm not here with you, am I?

404
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,179
I'm trying to remember.

405
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:57,683
I'm trying to remember
what we found here.

406
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,729
It wasn't hosts they were making.

407
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:05,399
It was something else.

408
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,168
Elsie, don't!

409
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:32,760
If you wanted this nitro,
you didn't have to steal it.

410
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,511
Open up!

411
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:36,180
No?

412
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,402
Keep fucking playing.

413
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:54,323
There you go.

414
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,417
You look restless.

415
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:09,296
Are you upset with the way
we're treating your friend?

416
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:10,881
He's not my friend.

417
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,425
And we're wasting time.

418
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:21,934
I've known men like you.

419
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:24,228
All the death

420
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:26,689
makes you agitated.

421
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:30,734
Don't worry.

422
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,653
Me and death,

423
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:37,074
we go way back.

424
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:48,961
Come over here,

425
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,130
<i>mamacita.</i>

426
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:05,102
Death

427
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,649
is an old <i>amigo</i> of mine.

428
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:14,820
I died just recently, in fact.

429
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:18,866
But death can't bear to lay claim on me,

430
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:21,035
so it sent me back here

431
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:23,746
to do its bidding

432
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:30,794
because I...
I do it with such goddamn style.

433
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,302
Your husband looks parched, huh?

434
00:44:39,345 --> 00:44:41,221
Let's get him a drink. What do you say?

435
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:48,896
Mmm...

436
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:52,649
Nice and slow, do you hear?

437
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,096
I've served death well.

438
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:27,518
And in turn, it'll be watching over us
as we cross these lands.

439
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,920
You think death favors you,

440
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:39,506
that it brought you back,

441
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:45,637
but death's decisions are final.

442
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:54,480
It's only the living
that are inconstant.

443
00:46:55,564 --> 00:46:56,565
They waver.

444
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,775
They don't know
who they are or what they want.

445
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,948
Death is always true.

446
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,747
You haven't known
a true thing in all your life.

447
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,084
You think you know death,

448
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:19,922
but you don't.

449
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:25,677
Is that so?

450
00:47:27,763 --> 00:47:31,350
You didn't recognize him
sitting across from you this whole time.

451
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:37,291
Open up.

452
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:52,806
Don't worry, <i>amigo.</i>

453
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:55,183
I'm here now,

454
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,436
watching over you.

455
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,793
I believe you said this was yours.

456
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:12,469
<i>You have a visitor, sir.
Shall I send him in?</i>

457
00:50:15,347 --> 00:50:16,515
About time.

458
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:41,498
Who the fuck are you?

459
00:50:42,124 --> 00:50:43,500
Been a long time, Jim.

460
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:46,837
Good to see you again.

461
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:52,384
William?

462
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,221
William, my boy.

463
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:02,185
Well, fuck me.

464
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,902
I take it I didn't recover.

465
00:51:12,404 --> 00:51:13,613
I'm afraid not.

466
00:51:15,282 --> 00:51:16,450
How are you feeling?

467
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:19,995
Better than you look.

468
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:25,876
Speaking of things that age well...

469
00:51:28,128 --> 00:51:29,463
Well, thank fuck for that.

470
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:34,134
Most potent thing these cretins

471
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:36,219
will give me
is grapefruit juice.

472
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:49,900
Little early for me.

473
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,194
Little too fucking late, you mean.

474
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:56,031
Besides, you cheat the devil,

475
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:57,282
you owe him an offering.

476
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:10,504
So,

477
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:13,965
how long has it been?

478
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:16,510
Longer than we'd thought.

479
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:20,305
So then let's get me
the fuck out of here.

480
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:22,933
No, I don't think so.

481
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:26,186
Why?

482
00:52:28,939 --> 00:52:30,190
I'm as fit as a...

483
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:33,652
I'm as...

484
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:40,951
You're feeling it more, aren't you?

485
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,831
The engineers call it
a cognitive plateau.

486
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:49,084
You mind is stable
for a few hours, a few days,

487
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,545
and then it starts to fall apart.

488
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,840
Every time.

489
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:59,678
You know, at first, we thought it was
your mind rejecting the new body,

490
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,931
like an organ
that's not a perfect match,

491
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:07,143
but it's more like
your mind rejects reality,

492
00:53:08,854 --> 00:53:10,230
rejects itself.

493
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:12,941
I don't

494
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:17,904
remember any prior...

495
00:53:24,578 --> 00:53:25,662
Attempt.

496
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,378
No, Jim. This is the 149th time
we've brought you back.

497
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:38,675
We're getting closer to working out
the kinks, slowly but surely.

498
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,722
You're on day 35.
You're only now starting to degrade.

499
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:46,516
I feel fucking fine.

500
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:51,479
Ticker, steady as a...

501
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:55,775
Rock.

502
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:58,278
Another year or two,
they might crack it.

503
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:04,200
Get a version of you
that's viable long‒term.

504
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:08,288
But the thing is,

505
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:17,714
we're not so sure anymore.

506
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:32,187
I'm beginning to think that
this whole enterprise was a mistake.

507
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,610
People aren't meant to live forever.

508
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:43,990
Take you, for example.

509
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:50,455
Ruthless philanderer with no ethics
in your business or family dealings,

510
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:52,999
a veritable shithead.

511
00:54:56,503 --> 00:55:01,800
In truth, everyone prefers
the memory of you to the man himself.

512
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:07,889
Want me to stay here forever, do you?

513
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,851
Enjoying

514
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:15,397
running my company, Bill?

515
00:55:17,607 --> 00:55:19,067
Living in my house

516
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:23,446
and fucking my daughter?

517
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:24,864
Hmm?

518
00:55:25,448 --> 00:55:26,950
Juliet's dead.

519
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:30,286
She killed herself.

520
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:37,836
Why would she...

521
00:55:40,213 --> 00:55:41,840
Why would she do that?

522
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:48,430
What did you... What did you do to her?

523
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:50,849
What did you do to her?

524
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:53,309
World is better off without you, Jim.

525
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,604
Possibly without me.

526
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:05,030
Logan!

527
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:08,825
Logan!

528
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:11,202
Logan!

529
00:56:12,746 --> 00:56:16,541
Logan overdosed years ago.
Couldn't face reality either.

530
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,754
Your wife's gone. Juliet's gone.

531
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:24,132
No one's coming to help you.

532
00:56:28,011 --> 00:56:29,012
Now,

533
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:32,182
took me a long time to learn this,

534
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:35,268
but some men are better off dead.

535
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,399
Good night, Jim.

536
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:57,582
I don't understand. He was stable.

537
00:56:58,374 --> 00:56:59,793
We should terminate, sir.

538
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,545
‒Sir!
‒Leave him.

539
00:57:05,548 --> 00:57:09,385
Might be useful to observe
his degradation over the next few days.

540
00:57:47,841 --> 00:57:49,801
‒Elsie.
‒Someone's in there.

541
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:02,999
Hello?

542
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:34,864
I'm all the way down now.

543
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:39,827
I can see all the way to the bottom.

544
00:59:46,918 --> 00:59:48,670
You'd like to see what I see?

545
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,134
Stay away.

546
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:36,050
They said there were two fathers.

547
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:40,930
One above, one below.

548
01:00:42,307 --> 01:00:43,766
They lied.

549
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:47,770
There was only ever the devil

550
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:51,566
who made you look up from the bottom.

551
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:55,486
It was just his reflection,

552
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,282
laughing back down at you.

553
01:01:44,369 --> 01:01:46,037
You aim to cheat the devil,

554
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:51,209
you owe him at least an offering.

555
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:56,339
Save your bullets.

556
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,511
I'll put him out of his misery.

557
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:15,900
Tell me that was a host and not a human.

558
01:02:18,528 --> 01:02:20,696
I think it was both.

559
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:27,537
That person was James Delos.

560
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:29,747
I thought he died years ago.

561
01:02:30,498 --> 01:02:31,624
He did.

562
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,377
So they printed his body.

563
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:38,548
And they copied his developed mind
onto a control unit like our hosts.

564
01:02:38,965 --> 01:02:41,551
By the looks of it, unsuccessfully.

565
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:44,762
But I think they intend to keep trying.

566
01:02:44,846 --> 01:02:46,013
Fuck that.

567
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:50,101
They're going to get us all killed
so some asshole can live forever?

568
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:51,769
No.

569
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:56,357
I've got to get to the Mesa.

570
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:58,818
I'm gonna contact the mainland.

571
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:01,195
Fuck Ford and his game.

572
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,783
Fuck these assholes and their project.

573
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,326
Wait.

574
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,539
I think I know why Ford sent me here.

575
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:15,835
He had me print a control unit
for someone else.

576
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:17,920
Another human.

577
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:21,591
Who?

578
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:24,719
I don't know.

579
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:27,472
But I need to find out.

580
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:29,974
We'll go together. I can help you.

581
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,435
Elsie,

582
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,729
the things I did before,

583
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,356
I wasn't in control,

584
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:41,277
but since Ford died, that's all changed.

585
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:46,282
For the first time,
I get to decide who I want to be.

586
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:49,035
Please.

587
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,788
Give me that chance.

588
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:01,881
Fuck it.

589
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:06,093
I always trusted code
more than people anyway.

590
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:10,097
But you've got to promise me one thing.

591
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,684
No more lies, okay?

592
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:17,563
And you'll never hurt me again.

593
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,107
Of course.

594
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:25,863
Okay.

595
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:34,408
Everything okay?

596
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:37,787
Everything's fine.

597
01:06:52,093 --> 01:06:53,552
<i>Gracias.</i>

598
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:04,563
You said we need some men.

599
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:10,444
My cousins wanna help us
on our journey west.

600
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:14,238
Figure they'd follow you
anywhere out of gratitude.

601
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:17,493
Well, let's not get
carried away, Lawrence.

602
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:19,745
Most of them won't be coming back.

603
01:07:31,632 --> 01:07:33,092
They might not remember,

604
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:35,553
but I know who you are, William.

605
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:38,431
One good deed doesn't change that.

606
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:42,476
Who said anything about a good deed.

607
01:07:43,436 --> 01:07:48,149
You wanted me to play your game.
I'm gonna play it to the bone.

608
01:07:54,572 --> 01:07:57,700
Then you still don't understand
the real game we're playing here.

609
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,246
If you're looking forward,
you're looking in the wrong direction.

610
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:09,336
Papa!

611
01:09:18,948 --> 01:09:20,199
Hi, Dad.
