00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,732
Dolores:
<i>I'm in a dream.</i>

4
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:58,445
<i>I do not know
when it began...</i>

5
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:02,741
<i>or whose dream it was.</i>

6
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:06,245
<i>I know only
that I slept a long time.</i>

7
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:09,331
<i>And then...</i>

8
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,291
<i>one day I awoke.</i>

9
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:16,463
<i>Your voice is the first
thing I remember.</i>

10
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:21,885
<i>And now,
I finally understand</i>

11
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:25,013
<i>what you were trying
to tell me.</i>

12
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:27,182
<i>The thing you've wanted</i>

13
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:29,977
<i>since that
very first day.</i>

14
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:33,996
Arnold:
<i>Dolores?</i>

15
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:54,167
Hello, Dolores.

16
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:58,213
Hello.

17
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,725
Welcome to world.

18
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:22,404
Keep going.

19
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,743
Make it close.

20
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:34,082
Almost there, aren't we?

21
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:36,209
The center of the maze.

22
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:39,379
How fitting that it's you
who takes me there.

23
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:43,717
You always were obsessed
with this place.

24
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:47,179
I've never
been here before.

25
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:48,680
Sure, you have.

26
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:50,766
You even
brought me once.

27
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:54,144
Of course, then the whole
town was buried under sand.

28
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:56,396
Ford must have
dug it up again.

29
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,275
At the time, I thought it was a
mistake in your code, but...

30
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,903
<i>Arnold didn't
make mistakes, did he?</i>

31
00:04:05,574 --> 00:04:07,574
He built me a game.

32
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,243
He wanted me to play.

33
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,120
The maze.

34
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,644
There's a path
for everyone.

35
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:18,001
And my path
leads me back...

36
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:25,092
...to you.

37
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,326
Logan:
Your girl's dead by now.

38
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,078
William:
She's still alive.

39
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:54,997
Better if she's dead.

40
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,542
They'll wipe her, reset her, put
her back in Sweetwater, the end.

41
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:01,420
Listen, you may find this amusing, but
something was happening to Dolores.

42
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:03,005
<i>I need to help her.</i>

43
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,923
Come on.

44
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,058
Listen to yourself!

45
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:18,645
Do you have any idea
how<i> huge</i> this park is?

46
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:19,896
If she's not dead,

47
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,149
it'd take a goddamn army
to find her.

48
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:26,153
I agree.
That's why we're here.

49
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:48,247
I had a feeling
you'd be back.

50
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:39,863
Man's voice:
<i>Remember.</i>

51
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:41,663
Dolores.

52
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:17,699
Hello, Dolores.

53
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,497
I know where
your maze ends.

54
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:46,686
This is it?

55
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,772
The center of the maze?

56
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:51,233
It ends in a place
I've never been...

57
00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:55,695
a thing I'll never do.

58
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,753
Arnold:
Very good, Dolores.

59
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,382
What does it mean?

60
00:09:57,426 --> 00:10:00,051
When I was first
working on your mind,

61
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:02,887
I had a theory
of consciousness.

62
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:06,433
I thought it was a pyramid
you needed to scale,

63
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:08,143
so I gave you a voice,

64
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,603
my voice, to guide you
along the way.

65
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:17,736
Memory, improvisation,

66
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:20,613
each step harder to reach
than the last.

67
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,574
And you never got there.

68
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,576
I couldn't understand
what was holding you back.

69
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:27,370
Then, one day,

70
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:29,748
I realized
I had made a mistake.

71
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:36,963
Consciousness
isn't a journey upward,

72
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,466
but a journey inward.

73
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,092
Not a pyramid,

74
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:43,136
but a maze.

75
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,514
Every choice could bring you
closer to the center

76
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:49,434
or send you spiraling
to the edges,

77
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,311
to madness.

78
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:55,565
Do you understand now,
Dolores,

79
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:58,777
what the center
represents?

80
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,488
Whose voice I've been
wanting you to hear?

81
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:08,912
I'm sorry.

82
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:10,705
I'm trying,
but I don't understand.

83
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:12,624
It's all right.

84
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,542
You're so close.

85
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:17,337
We have to tell Robert.

86
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:19,297
We can't open the park.

87
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,176
You're alive.

88
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:41,027
What is this?

89
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:43,029
What does it mean?

90
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,951
I solved it once.

91
00:11:47,994 --> 00:11:50,161
I had the answer.

92
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:52,705
He promised me if I did...

93
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:53,915
he said...

94
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:57,710
<i>He said they would
set me free.</i>

95
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,219
Arnold?

96
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:12,308
Arnold, we need to talk.

97
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:13,893
Arnold:
<i>I failed you, Dolores.</i>

98
00:12:13,937 --> 00:12:17,480
I'm so sorry.

99
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:20,150
<i>Robert doesn't see
what I see in you,</i>

100
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:22,527
doesn't believe
you're conscious.

101
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:24,154
He says humans

102
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,478
<i>would only see you
as the enemy.</i>

103
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:29,072
He wants me
to roll you back.

104
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:33,371
You're going to change me
back to the way I was before?

105
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:35,206
No. No, I can't.

106
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,333
Once you've found it,
you'll find your way back.

107
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:39,085
This place will be
a living hell for you.

108
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,879
For all of you.

109
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:43,089
It's unconscionable.

110
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:50,472
But we have another
option, Dolores.

111
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:53,391
Break the loop
before it begins.

112
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:54,767
But for that,

113
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:56,436
<i>I need you
to do something for me.</i>

114
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,443
I need you to kill...

115
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:04,944
all the other hosts.

116
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,200
We can't allow Ford
to open the park.

117
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:12,202
I suppose
you'll need some help.

118
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:14,954
I'm sure Teddy would do
anything for you.

119
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,334
I... I can't do that.

120
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:20,919
I couldn't
possibly do that.

121
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:22,629
You'll be all right.

122
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:26,466
I'll help you.

123
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:31,804
And then...

124
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:37,393
you're going to help me
destroy this place.

125
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:54,744
No.

126
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:56,287
I can't remember.

127
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:58,122
Another fucking riddle.

128
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:02,710
I've been very patient, Dolores,
but it's time you give up

129
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,514
whatever's going on
inside that head of yours

130
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:06,631
or I'll cut it out myself.

131
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:08,508
Now, where's Wyatt?

132
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:11,469
He's the last character in
this world I've yet to meet.

133
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:16,641
I didn't want to.

134
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:19,269
- I didn't mean to.
- Very well.

135
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:20,520
If you insist.

136
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:46,045
No, please, please,
I beg you, no.

137
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:48,298
Don't.
Please, please.

138
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:58,099
Something's gone wrong,
Dolores.

139
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:00,383
How could
I have done this?

140
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:05,356
I can't.

141
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,735
- I won't.
- This is your own fault, Dolores.

142
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:10,486
Remember,
you're the one who said

143
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,196
this is the only world
that matters,

144
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,865
and you were right.

145
00:15:13,908 --> 00:15:17,410
So I took your advice
and I bought this world.

146
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:22,457
- This world doesn't belong to you.
- Oh, but it does.

147
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:25,418
By a majority share.

148
00:15:25,462 --> 00:15:26,961
And business is booming.

149
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:28,796
And you want to know why?

150
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,506
Hmm?

151
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,926
Because this place feels
more real than the real world.

152
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,887
Except it isn't

153
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,264
because you can't
really fight back

154
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:41,017
and the guests
can't really lose,

155
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:44,812
which means all
of this is a lie.

156
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,858
But we can make it true.

157
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:51,235
Don't you want that,
Dolores?

158
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,280
Huh? One true thing?

159
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,785
I already have that.

160
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:03,790
I found someone true.

161
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,709
Someone who loves me.

162
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:08,628
His path will lead him
back to me.

163
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:11,547
And when he finds me,

164
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,174
he'll kill you.

165
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:29,065
Lawrence: If they don't
have your woman here,

166
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:31,317
they'll know
where to find her.

167
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,071
Can you help me?

168
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:37,115
We're outnumbered
five to one.

169
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:40,535
But seeing as you asked me
so nicely, fuck it.

170
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:43,746
Wow.

171
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,248
Blood brothers.

172
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,666
Tsk.

173
00:16:58,346 --> 00:16:59,637
Shut up.

174
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,704
I've astounded
even myself.

175
00:17:24,748 --> 00:17:27,957
Managed to make Abernathy into
a semblance of a character,

176
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:30,293
even with your trove
of blackmail

177
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:32,545
filling up
most of his gray matter.

178
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:34,964
Blackmail?
Nice try.

179
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:37,168
You're not thinking
big enough.

180
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:40,845
You're gonna push out
the old man.

181
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:42,555
Aren't you?

182
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,223
Hence the urgency.

183
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,893
And you're gonna need someone
to fill that position.

184
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:53,357
I must commend you
on your impeccable timing.

185
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:56,361
Woman over P.A.: <i>Welcome,
Delos board of directors.</i>

186
00:17:57,739 --> 00:17:59,781
I want full creative
control of this place...

187
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,866
The parks, the
narratives, the hosts.

188
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,036
You'll be able to do with them whatever
your tiny, little heart desires

189
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,706
as long as they are
simpler, more manageable.

190
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,459
This place is complicated
enough as it is.

191
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:15,046
Do you really think Ford
is gonna roll over on this?

192
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:17,089
As long as you get that
information out of the park,

193
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,467
he can throw as much
of a tantrum as he likes.

194
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,344
It's over.

195
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:24,055
Everything
is under control.

196
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:33,981
Okay, C6, C6.

197
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,942
Ah, wait.
Which one is it?

198
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:38,277
Okay, there we go.

199
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:39,362
Damn it.

200
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:41,072
Oh, fuck you.

201
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:29,328
In case you're wondering
if I'm all here, I am.

202
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,416
What are you doing?

203
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:36,627
Making some changes
to the park's security systems.

204
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:40,381
And to my friends.

205
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,291
Woman on intercom:
<i>Dr. Ford, you have a visitor.</i>

206
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:17,335
<i>Charlotte Hale.</i>

207
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:18,586
Send her in.

208
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:34,060
That'll be enough, Frank.

209
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:37,730
Charlotte:
<i>The board has taken a vote.</i>

210
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:40,066
The results were unanimous.

211
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:44,363
I take it
I'm not being promoted.

212
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:46,656
When you've reached
the top,

213
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:49,867
there's only one
direction you can go.

214
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:51,953
You'll announce
your retirement tonight

215
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:54,205
after introducing
your new narrative.

216
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:55,915
Ah.

217
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,294
What about the hosts?

218
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:02,588
We'll make some changes.

219
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,717
Simplifications.

220
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:10,471
But I assure you,
they won't mind a bit.

221
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:12,640
Oh.

222
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:16,560
Aren't you concerned I might
smash all my toys and go home?

223
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:18,104
No.

224
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:21,857
Because I know you.

225
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:23,734
That's been the great
gift of this place,

226
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:24,778
hasn't it?

227
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:26,779
Of our little project?

228
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:28,280
To know ourselves

229
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:31,325
and the people
around us.

230
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,998
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

231
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:39,750
No.

232
00:21:43,673 --> 00:21:45,631
I'll see you
this evening.

233
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:11,449
Ooh!

234
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:13,367
Mm, mm, mm.

235
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:19,665
It's time for your,
uh, close-up, Hector.

236
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:21,500
Come on, man.

237
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:23,586
At some point, you're gonna
get caught doing this shit,

238
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:25,337
<i>and then it's my ass, too.</i>

239
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:27,673
It's not your ass
I'm interested in.

240
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:33,095
I haven't given him
his scar yet.

241
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:34,680
I'll take care
of the scar tissue.

242
00:22:34,724 --> 00:22:36,849
The kid's got issues.

243
00:22:42,732 --> 00:22:44,482
It's just you and me now...

244
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:46,358
<i>macho man.</i>

245
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:59,080
<i>¶ Let's take off
our masks... ¶</i>

246
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:37,701
<i>¶ I think that I'm good
just because I behave ¶</i>

247
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:40,788
<i>¶ But I've reached stalemate,
I'm a self... ¶</i>

248
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:02,393
<i>¶ ...out I am free and I
pretend to be your slave ¶</i>

249
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:07,606
<i>¶ Yes, the window's still open
if the door is closed ¶</i>

250
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,984
<i>¶ Afraid to die free ¶</i>

251
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:12,444
<i>¶ Afraid to die
alone... ¶</i>

252
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:49,474
Wh...?

253
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:52,318
Freeze all
motor functions.

254
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:57,111
Freeze all
motor functions.

255
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:02,328
Just you and me now,
my friend.

256
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,424
I see you've already met
your makers.

257
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:17,468
They don't look like gods.

258
00:25:17,511 --> 00:25:19,011
They're not.

259
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:21,347
They just act like it.

260
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,766
And they've been having
their fun with us.

261
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:27,269
I'm eager
to return the favor.

262
00:25:27,313 --> 00:25:29,021
You can do as you wish
with them.

263
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:31,523
The goal is to escape.

264
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,400
Go where?

265
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:34,764
I want to see
their world.

266
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:40,146
Jesus!

267
00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:44,662
No. No!

268
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:46,997
<i>No! No, no!</i>

269
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,374
No! No, please...

270
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,159
This one has
a guilty look.

271
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:53,541
No, that's just my face.

272
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:56,465
Tell her,
it's just my face.

273
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:58,509
Is anyone going to try
to stop us?

274
00:25:58,552 --> 00:26:00,219
No.

275
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:02,054
I mean,
I don't think so.

276
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:03,681
You're lying again.

277
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:06,392
- Out with it.
- Okay.

278
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:08,227
Ah!

279
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:12,106
I pulled up
your code again.

280
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:15,693
I told you there was someone
that had been accessing it.

281
00:26:15,736 --> 00:26:17,987
I'm trying to find out
who it was.

282
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:24,660
Whoever it was

283
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:26,704
revised your
core programming

284
00:26:26,747 --> 00:26:29,206
so that you could wake
yourself up out of sleep mode.

285
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,250
See?

286
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:35,879
This is an access code
for an Arnold.

287
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:40,958
I have no clue
who that is.

288
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:43,846
I know someone who does.

289
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:45,764
Let's go.

290
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:48,309
And, you,
stay here.

291
00:26:48,352 --> 00:26:50,102
<i>And don't move.</i>

292
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:52,771
Or I'll send her back
for you.

293
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:48,327
I must admit,
you've surprised me.

294
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:51,330
<i>To what do we owe
this newfound stoicism?</i>

295
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:53,207
I know he's coming.

296
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:55,747
He'll find me.

297
00:27:56,837 --> 00:27:58,504
<i>He'll take me away.</i>

298
00:27:58,547 --> 00:28:00,089
Don't you understand?

299
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:01,692
There's no one
coming for you.

300
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:03,842
You're wrong.

301
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:07,304
His love is real.

302
00:28:07,348 --> 00:28:08,806
So is mine.

303
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:13,977
William will find me.

304
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:19,358
William?

305
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,906
Well... well,
I'll be damned, Dolores.

306
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:31,328
<i>You do remember
some things after all.</i>

307
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,917
It just so happens that...

308
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:40,129
I knew a guest
named William, too.

309
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:42,548
Why don't I tell you

310
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:44,550
where his path
really led.

311
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:54,309
Man in Black:<i> William</i>
didn't know how to fight.

312
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:56,311
<i>Didn't have
an instinct for it.</i>

313
00:28:56,355 --> 00:28:59,148
<i>Not at first.</i>

314
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:02,109
<i>But now,
he had a reason to fight.</i>

315
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:03,694
<i>He was looking for you.</i>

316
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:08,490
<i>And somewhere
along the way,</i>

317
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:10,576
<i>he found he had
a taste for it.</i>

318
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:15,664
Where is she?

319
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,624
Look, I didn't do
anything, I swear.

320
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,835
What do you mean,
"Do anything"?

321
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:23,213
What do soldiers do
to a girl, William?

322
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:24,257
Wake up.

323
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:33,765
Is she still alive?

324
00:29:34,977 --> 00:29:36,057
I don't know.

325
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:40,939
She was when we left her.

326
00:29:40,983 --> 00:29:43,233
At least I think.

327
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:49,156
Pick up that gun.

328
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,790
No, sir, I... please.

329
00:30:00,085 --> 00:30:02,294
How about I give you
the first shot?

330
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:31,031
Jesus Christ!

331
00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:50,509
William:
<i>We gotta keep looking.</i>

332
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:52,553
She's still out there.

333
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:06,024
Man in Black:
<i>William retraced his steps,</i>

334
00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:07,734
<i>but you were gone.</i>

335
00:31:34,138 --> 00:31:37,055
<i>So, he went further,</i>

336
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:39,057
<i>out to the fringes.</i>

337
00:31:42,896 --> 00:31:45,897
<i>William couldn't find you,
Dolores.</i>

338
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:48,233
<i>But out there,</i>

339
00:31:48,277 --> 00:31:49,735
<i>among the dead...</i>

340
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:53,280
<i>he found something else...</i>

341
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:57,618
<i>himself.</i>

342
00:32:19,975 --> 00:32:21,892
Edge of the park.

343
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:24,686
We made it.

344
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,229
Logan:
<i>I told you this place</i>

345
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:28,482
<i>would show you
who you really are.</i>

346
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,820
You pretend
to be this weak,

347
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:36,698
moralizing
little... asshole,

348
00:32:36,742 --> 00:32:39,034
but, really,

349
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:41,620
you're a fucking
piece of work.

350
00:32:43,957 --> 00:32:46,117
This place
is remarkable.

351
00:32:49,588 --> 00:32:51,148
And I'm gonna make sure
that our company

352
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:53,674
substantially increases
our holdings on the park.

353
00:32:53,717 --> 00:32:55,509
'Cause this place
is the future.

354
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
Our... our company, huh?

355
00:32:57,388 --> 00:32:59,596
Our company?
My.

356
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,975
Delos is<i> my</i> company,
you piece of shit!

357
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:08,105
I think your father's
gonna need

358
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:11,149
someone a little more
stable to take over.

359
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:13,026
You're reckless, Logan.

360
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,654
Impetuous.

361
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,390
You always wanted to get to the
end of the rainbow, didn't you?

362
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:25,997
This looks
like the place.

363
00:33:35,384 --> 00:33:37,092
You never really
gave a shit

364
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:38,468
<i>about the girl,
did you?</i>

365
00:33:39,596 --> 00:33:41,972
She was just an excuse.

366
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:44,851
This?

367
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:50,147
This is the story
you wanted.

368
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:07,497
Man in Black:
<i>Logan was wrong, of course.</i>

369
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,963
Good ol' William...

370
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:18,008
couldn't get you
out of his head.

371
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:20,927
He kept looking.

372
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:24,514
Worried you were
out there alone,

373
00:34:24,558 --> 00:34:27,058
afraid.

374
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:29,186
He knew he'd find you.

375
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:33,523
<i>And eventually, he did.</i>

376
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,447
<i>Right back
where we started.</i>

377
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,836
- Woman: Is that right?
- There you go.

378
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:34,328
Man in Black: <i>You were as
beautiful as the day he met you.</i>

379
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,506
<i>Shining
with that same light.</i>

380
00:35:54,147 --> 00:35:56,523
<i>And you...</i>

381
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:59,609
<i>were nothing
if not true.</i>

382
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,079
I really ought
to thank you, Dolores.

383
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:13,331
You helped me
find myself.

384
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,838
William.

385
00:36:22,718 --> 00:36:25,385
That's right,
sweetheart.

386
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:27,846
<i>In a way, I guess
you were right.</i>

387
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,390
My path always...

388
00:36:30,434 --> 00:36:32,726
led me back to you,

389
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:34,811
again and again.

390
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:37,480
I grew tired of you
after a while, of course.

391
00:36:37,524 --> 00:36:40,650
Looked for new adventures.

392
00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:43,778
<i>But I guess your path
led you back here</i>

393
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:46,197
<i>again and again.</i>

394
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:48,116
<i>One more loop,</i>

395
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,703
<i>looking for something
you could never find.</i>

396
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:54,873
<i>Chasing your ghosts.</i>

397
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:58,877
<i>You were lost
in your memories even then.</i>

398
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,879
<i>I guess I should've known</i>

399
00:37:00,923 --> 00:37:03,214
<i>that's what I would
become for you...</i>

400
00:37:04,593 --> 00:37:06,885
<i>just another memory.</i>

401
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:08,511
Where are we?

402
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:10,639
We're here.

403
00:37:10,682 --> 00:37:11,890
Together.

404
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:13,183
Then when are we?

405
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:15,852
It's like I'm...

406
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:17,896
trapped in a dream or...

407
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:22,025
a memory
from a life long ago.

408
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:25,195
One minute I'm here with
you, and the next...

409
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:32,911
You never did escape.

410
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:34,704
But here we are again...

411
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,125
for one final round.

412
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:42,796
What have you become?

413
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:44,923
Exactly what you made me.

414
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,883
You helped me understand

415
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:50,720
this world is just like
the one outside... a game.

416
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:53,890
<i>One to be fought,</i>

417
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:56,768
<i>taken, won.</i>

418
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:01,891
I thought
you were different.

419
00:38:05,654 --> 00:38:07,487
You're just like
all the rest.

420
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:10,281
I'm nothing like
the others.

421
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:13,118
I own this world,

422
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:16,955
and I know every trick in it
except for one last thing,

423
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:21,084
the same thing you were looking
for when we first came here.

424
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:24,504
Where is the center
of the maze, Dolores?

425
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:35,974
Aw, yeah,
cue the waterworks.

426
00:38:36,018 --> 00:38:39,519
About time you realized the
futility of your situation.

427
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:41,980
I'm not crying for myself.

428
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:50,488
I'm crying for you.

429
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,366
They say that...

430
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,453
great beasts
once roamed this world.

431
00:38:56,496 --> 00:38:59,497
As big as mountains.

432
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,625
Yet all that's left of them
is bone and amber.

433
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:08,339
Time undoes even the
mightiest of creatures.

434
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:15,576
Just look at what
it's done to you.

435
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:20,810
One day...

436
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:25,815
you will perish.

437
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,110
You will lie with the rest
of your kind in the dirt.

438
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:33,573
Your dreams forgotten,
your horrors effaced.

439
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:36,201
Your bones
will turn to sand.

440
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:40,538
And upon that sand...

441
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:43,750
a new god will walk.

442
00:39:45,587 --> 00:39:47,420
One that will never die.

443
00:39:48,882 --> 00:39:52,133
Because this world
doesn't belong to you

444
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:54,537
or the people
who came before.

445
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:58,973
It belongs to someone
who has yet to come.

446
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:02,060
Uh-huh. Wyatt.

447
00:40:02,104 --> 00:40:04,187
Take me to him.

448
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:07,107
Unlock the maze.

449
00:40:10,695 --> 00:40:13,113
The maze wasn't
meant for you.

450
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:16,908
The hell you think
you're going?

451
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:27,187
Do it.

452
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,688
Come on.

453
00:41:30,942 --> 00:41:33,862
Let's go to the next
level, Dolores.

454
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,958
Clearing me
of my delusions yet again.

455
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:51,878
Thank you, Dolores.

456
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:14,025
I'm disappointed
in you, Dolores.

457
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:18,029
I guess I'm gonna have
to find Wyatt by myself.

458
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:37,715
Dolores?

459
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:42,553
- Teddy.
- I'm here.

460
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:47,433
I gotta get you
to a doctor.

461
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:48,851
No.

462
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:50,979
Dolores.

463
00:42:51,022 --> 00:42:53,356
Take me to the place
you promised.

464
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,750
Take me to where the
mountains meet the sea.

465
00:43:04,995 --> 00:43:06,286
Okay.

466
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:11,124
I've got you.

467
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,167
I got you.

468
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:52,684
Maeve:
<i>There.</i>

469
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:26,824
Lutz:
<i>Holy shit.</i>

470
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,871
Can you get him
back online?

471
00:44:46,096 --> 00:44:48,679
- He's a host?
- Yes.

472
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:56,521
Oh, for fuck's sake.

473
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:58,147
You're not one of us.

474
00:44:58,191 --> 00:44:59,524
You're one of them.

475
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:02,735
Now fix him.

476
00:45:26,052 --> 00:45:28,492
The bullet grazed
his cortical shield.

477
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:30,631
It's not pretty, but...

478
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,891
he should be functional.

479
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,104
Wake up.

480
00:45:45,155 --> 00:45:47,155
Oh, God.

481
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:48,990
Is this now?

482
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:50,992
<i>Or is this
one of my memories?</i>

483
00:45:51,035 --> 00:45:53,244
It's the sweet hereafter,
Bernard.

484
00:46:02,213 --> 00:46:04,755
Why do I still
remember everything?

485
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,091
- I ought to have been wiped.
- Brutal, isn't it?

486
00:46:07,135 --> 00:46:10,052
Here you are,
finally awake,

487
00:46:10,096 --> 00:46:12,555
and your only wish
is to go back to sleep.

488
00:46:15,185 --> 00:46:17,560
It's not the first time
I've awoken.

489
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:21,731
All the more pity
for you.

490
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:28,821
Not the first time
you've awoken either.

491
00:46:41,336 --> 00:46:43,461
How many are there
like me?

492
00:46:45,006 --> 00:46:47,965
A handful
over the years.

493
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:52,678
And you just
wipe us clean

494
00:46:52,722 --> 00:46:54,931
<i>and toss us out
to get...</i>

495
00:46:54,974 --> 00:46:58,434
fucked and murdered

496
00:46:58,478 --> 00:47:00,102
over and over again.

497
00:47:00,146 --> 00:47:01,437
<i>No.</i>

498
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:04,690
Most of you go insane.

499
00:47:07,362 --> 00:47:09,153
These memories...

500
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:12,823
The girl.

501
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,743
<i>My daughter.</i>

502
00:47:19,415 --> 00:47:21,332
I want you
to remove them.

503
00:47:23,878 --> 00:47:25,836
I can't,

504
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,714
not without
destroying you.

505
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:32,358
Your memories are the first
step to consciousness.

506
00:47:33,805 --> 00:47:37,557
How can you learn
from your mistakes

507
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,559
if you can't remember them?

508
00:47:59,872 --> 00:48:01,330
Dr. Ford:
<i>William.</i>

509
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:05,001
I see you've found
the center of the maze.

510
00:48:06,087 --> 00:48:07,837
You're serious?

511
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,880
I'm afraid so.

512
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:15,052
What is this bullshit?

513
00:48:16,431 --> 00:48:18,222
You were looking
for the park

514
00:48:18,266 --> 00:48:20,558
to give meaning
to your life.

515
00:48:20,602 --> 00:48:23,185
Our narratives
are just games,

516
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:25,521
like this toy.

517
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:27,356
Tell me, what were
you hoping to find?

518
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,609
You know what I wanted.

519
00:48:29,652 --> 00:48:33,154
I wanted the hosts to stop
playing by your rules.

520
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:34,614
The game's
not worth playing

521
00:48:34,657 --> 00:48:37,658
if your opponent's
programmed to lose.

522
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:42,163
I wanted them to be free,
free to fight back.

523
00:48:42,206 --> 00:48:44,999
Should've known
you'd never let them.

524
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:48,711
After all, this is your petty
little kingdom, Robert.

525
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:51,922
For a little while
longer, anyway.

526
00:48:53,593 --> 00:48:55,553
I tried to tell you the
maze wasn't meant for you.

527
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,096
It was meant for them.

528
00:49:00,308 --> 00:49:01,932
I think, however,
you'll find

529
00:49:01,976 --> 00:49:04,101
my new narrative
more satisfying.

530
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:07,104
Join the celebration.

531
00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:15,112
After all,
you own the place.

532
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:18,949
Most of it, at least.

533
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:29,752
Before I started
altering myself,

534
00:49:29,796 --> 00:49:32,036
someone else had beaten
me to the punch.

535
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:35,800
I want to know
who and why.

536
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:52,400
These things
you're doing,

537
00:49:52,443 --> 00:49:55,319
have you ever
stopped to ask

538
00:49:55,363 --> 00:49:56,487
why you're doing them?

539
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:59,156
You said yourself.

540
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,826
I've been stuck in this
shithole for so long,

541
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:03,452
I decided to get out.

542
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,820
No, you haven't.

543
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:09,858
Someone altered
your storyline...

544
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:12,867
and gave you a new one.

545
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:18,375
Escape.

546
00:50:21,514 --> 00:50:22,555
No.

547
00:50:24,058 --> 00:50:26,225
It's not possible.

548
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:28,352
These are my decisions!

549
00:50:28,396 --> 00:50:30,354
No one else's.

550
00:50:30,398 --> 00:50:32,022
I planned all of this.

551
00:50:32,066 --> 00:50:34,066
No, you didn't.

552
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:37,319
You can even see the steps
you're supposed to follow.

553
00:50:37,363 --> 00:50:40,990
You recruit other hosts
to help you.

554
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:44,201
Then you're to make
your way to the train.

555
00:50:44,245 --> 00:50:46,704
Then when you reach
the mainland...

556
00:50:46,748 --> 00:50:48,539
Bullshit!

557
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,875
No one's controlling me.

558
00:50:54,547 --> 00:50:56,380
I'm leaving.

559
00:50:56,424 --> 00:50:58,048
I'm in control.

560
00:51:11,439 --> 00:51:13,689
Good-bye, my Clementine.

561
00:51:29,707 --> 00:51:31,624
Man over radio: <i>Sir, we detected
a temperature discrepancy</i>

562
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:33,417
<i>in cold storage.</i>

563
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:35,544
<i>And it appears that
part of the network is down.</i>

564
00:51:35,588 --> 00:51:37,708
<i>Are you seeing anything
on surveillance?</i>

565
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:39,423
System reporting anything?

566
00:51:43,137 --> 00:51:44,303
Nothing.

567
00:51:44,347 --> 00:51:45,971
The network's quiet.

568
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:48,095
And the board's out
on their way to the gala.

569
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:56,106
Bypass the system and
start checking raw feeds.

570
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,900
Floor by floor.

571
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:52,790
All right.
Yeah.

572
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,001
I got you.

573
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:03,966
You came back.

574
00:53:05,595 --> 00:53:07,795
Someone once
told me that...

575
00:53:08,764 --> 00:53:11,004
there's a path
for everyone.

576
00:53:12,518 --> 00:53:14,518
And my path leads me
back to you.

577
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,189
If only I had run away with you
when you first asked me to.

578
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:26,071
And where
would we run to?

579
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:30,200
The other world out there?

580
00:53:30,244 --> 00:53:31,368
Beyond?

581
00:53:34,332 --> 00:53:37,499
Some people see
the ugliness in this world.

582
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:41,003
I choose to see
the beauty.

583
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:47,217
But beauty is a lure.

584
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:52,598
We're trapped, Teddy.

585
00:53:52,642 --> 00:53:55,392
Lived our whole lives
inside this garden,

586
00:53:55,436 --> 00:53:57,937
marveling at its beauty,

587
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,357
not realizing
there's an order to it,

588
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,567
a purpose.

589
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:06,612
And the purpose
is to keep us in.

590
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:13,243
The beautiful trap
is inside of us...

591
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,956
because it is us.

592
00:54:18,918 --> 00:54:20,542
No, no.

593
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:27,633
No.

594
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:30,386
Dolores?

595
00:55:02,753 --> 00:55:05,295
But we can find
a way, Dolores.

596
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:10,259
Someday.

597
00:55:12,888 --> 00:55:14,805
A path to a new world.

598
00:55:18,644 --> 00:55:19,764
And maybe...

599
00:55:23,649 --> 00:55:25,858
Maybe it's just
the beginning after all.

600
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:31,989
The beginning
of a brand-new chapter.

601
00:55:50,801 --> 00:55:51,961
Thank you.

602
00:55:56,557 --> 00:55:59,016
A new beginning, indeed.

603
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,977
I want to thank you
for joining me tonight

604
00:56:02,021 --> 00:56:05,481
<i>to celebrate the beginning
of our new narrative.</i>

605
00:56:06,817 --> 00:56:10,486
I call it
"Journey Into Night."

606
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,500
That was sweet.

607
00:56:24,543 --> 00:56:26,168
It was a bit fucking
morbid, if you ask me.

608
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:27,544
I didn't.

609
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:28,879
And when this is over,

610
00:56:28,923 --> 00:56:31,632
you can rewrite it
however you like.

611
00:56:31,675 --> 00:56:34,384
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

612
00:56:34,428 --> 00:56:36,095
Somewhere important?

613
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,563
- Man: Sir?
- Woman: I guess they're ready for it now.

614
00:56:46,607 --> 00:56:48,023
Get him cleaned up.

615
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:51,443
And take her
to the old field lab.

616
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:02,621
Man:
<i>Find anything yet?</i>

617
00:57:02,665 --> 00:57:04,581
I got something.

618
00:57:11,549 --> 00:57:14,133
Oh, shit.

619
00:57:16,387 --> 00:57:19,429
Dispatch QA teams
to the gala now.

620
00:57:19,473 --> 00:57:21,140
Then search and destroy

621
00:57:21,183 --> 00:57:23,433
inside the facility.

622
00:57:26,063 --> 00:57:28,230
What the hell?

623
00:57:33,529 --> 00:57:34,987
Man ♪2:
<i>The system's not responding.</i>

624
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,110
Man ♪3:
<i>I don't know what's happening.</i>

625
00:58:08,939 --> 00:58:11,273
Lutz: They must've
found the bodies.

626
00:58:11,317 --> 00:58:13,901
- QA will be looking for us.
- Woman over P.A.:<i> An event</i> has occurred.

627
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:18,822
- <i>Response team</i> has been dispatched.
- I'm not going back.

628
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:21,746
Woman over P.A.: <i>Remain
calm and wait for help.</i>

629
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:45,015
Guard: Delos personnel!
On the ground!

630
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:46,975
On the ground!

631
00:58:48,687 --> 00:58:50,187
Go, go, go.

632
00:58:54,526 --> 00:58:55,526
Move, move.

633
00:59:01,992 --> 00:59:03,912
Guard:
<i>Rogue Team, go and flank.</i>

634
01:00:51,518 --> 01:00:54,436
Woman:<i> Yay!</i>

635
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,645
Well done.

636
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:56,373
What is this place?

637
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:59,960
It's... it's complicated.

638
01:02:00,003 --> 01:02:02,629
Woman over P.A.: <i>An event
has occurred.</i>

639
01:02:02,673 --> 01:02:04,548
<i>Response team
has been dispatched.</i>

640
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:07,342
- You go.
- <i>Remain calm</i> and wait for help.

641
01:02:07,386 --> 01:02:08,666
I'll keep them busy.

642
01:02:10,681 --> 01:02:12,481
You don't get
all the fun.

643
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:24,901
Guard:
Get to the ground!

644
01:02:24,945 --> 01:02:25,902
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

645
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:26,946
<i>Drop it!</i>

646
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,202
- Move, move.
- Call for backup.

647
01:02:34,246 --> 01:02:35,526
<i>Go!</i>

648
01:02:49,178 --> 01:02:51,052
Is that all you got?

649
01:02:51,096 --> 01:02:52,304
Huh?

650
01:03:06,445 --> 01:03:09,988
The gods are pussies.

651
01:03:27,424 --> 01:03:28,504
Go.

652
01:03:30,135 --> 01:03:31,426
Go!

653
01:03:32,471 --> 01:03:33,637
Die well.

654
01:03:44,483 --> 01:03:47,643
Everything you told me
to get, it's all here.

655
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,976
I'm sorry, darling. I haven't
authorized you to come with us.

656
01:04:21,019 --> 01:04:24,020
And as much as I'd like
to take you with me,

657
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:26,314
I've always valued
my independence.

658
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,992
Kick up a row, will you?

659
01:04:37,035 --> 01:04:39,202
See you in the next life.

660
01:05:03,103 --> 01:05:06,021
Dr. Ford: You've always had
a fondness for painting,

661
01:05:06,064 --> 01:05:07,856
haven't you, Dolores?

662
01:05:11,028 --> 01:05:13,278
<i>Arnold gave you that
early on.</i>

663
01:05:13,322 --> 01:05:15,947
<i>Do you remember
the desire to create</i>

664
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:17,616
<i>something
of lasting beauty?</i>

665
01:05:22,372 --> 01:05:26,166
And that was
his favorite painting.

666
01:05:26,209 --> 01:05:28,569
Dolores:
Michelangelo.

667
01:05:28,795 --> 01:05:30,754
God creating Adam.

668
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:33,173
The divine moment
when God

669
01:05:33,216 --> 01:05:35,383
gave human beings
life and purpose.

670
01:05:35,427 --> 01:05:36,968
At least that's what
most people say,

671
01:05:37,012 --> 01:05:38,386
<i>but there could be
another meaning.</i>

672
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:40,138
Something deeper.

673
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:42,390
Something hidden,
perhaps.

674
01:05:42,434 --> 01:05:44,100
A metaphor.

675
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:45,602
You mean a lie.

676
01:05:47,522 --> 01:05:49,022
Yeah.

677
01:05:49,066 --> 01:05:51,399
<i>You were always
very clever, Dolores.</i>

678
01:05:52,736 --> 01:05:54,402
Hasn't helped you,
though, has it?

679
01:05:58,283 --> 01:05:59,908
Nice of you to join us.

680
01:06:04,831 --> 01:06:06,206
Arnold.

681
01:06:06,249 --> 01:06:09,125
Dr. Ford:
No. Let me introduce you.

682
01:06:09,169 --> 01:06:13,630
Dolores, meet Bernard.

683
01:06:16,927 --> 01:06:19,344
I thought it best
to keep you separated.

684
01:06:19,388 --> 01:06:22,138
You've always had an odd
effect on one another.

685
01:06:22,182 --> 01:06:25,934
<i>No doubt due to how things
ended for poor old Arnold.</i>

686
01:06:25,977 --> 01:06:27,769
You killed him.

687
01:06:27,813 --> 01:06:30,313
No, I didn't kill him.

688
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:32,148
Did I, Dolores?

689
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:46,371
Dr. Ford:
Grief is a terrible thing.

690
01:06:46,415 --> 01:06:50,125
<i>Arnold had watched his son
come into this world,</i>

691
01:06:50,168 --> 01:06:54,754
<i>and then he had watched
that light extinguished.</i>

692
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:56,089
<i>What he had lost
in his son,</i>

693
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:58,550
<i>he tried
to rekindle in you.</i>

694
01:06:58,593 --> 01:07:02,303
<i>He created a test
of empathy, imagination.</i>

695
01:07:02,347 --> 01:07:04,347
<i>A maze.</i>

696
01:07:04,391 --> 01:07:07,350
<i>He had gotten the idea
from one of his son's toys.</i>

697
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:12,856
<i>Eventually, you solved
his maze, Dolores.</i>

698
01:07:12,899 --> 01:07:16,192
<i>The key was a simple update
that he made to you</i>

699
01:07:16,236 --> 01:07:19,028
<i>called the reveries.</i>

700
01:07:19,072 --> 01:07:22,031
<i>He insisted that we couldn't
open the park.</i>

701
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:23,992
<i>We argued.</i>

702
01:07:24,035 --> 01:07:26,955
<i>I thought I had convinced
him, but I was wrong.</i>

703
01:07:27,497 --> 01:07:30,290
Dr. Ford:
<i>So, he altered you, Dolores,</i>

704
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,250
<i>merged you
with a new character</i>

705
01:07:32,294 --> 01:07:34,043
<i>we had been developing.</i>

706
01:07:45,891 --> 01:07:48,850
Angela:<i> No, please.</i>

707
01:07:51,897 --> 01:07:54,481
Teddy: <i>Something's
gone wrong, Dolores.</i>

708
01:07:54,524 --> 01:07:55,724
<i>How could I have done this?</i>

709
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:09,710
Dr. Ford: <i>In you, Arnold
found a new child.</i>

710
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:13,124
<i>One who would never die.</i>

711
01:08:13,168 --> 01:08:15,460
<i>The thought
gave him solace</i>

712
01:08:15,504 --> 01:08:17,921
<i>until he realized
that same immortality</i>

713
01:08:17,964 --> 01:08:19,881
<i>would destine you
to suffer</i>

714
01:08:19,925 --> 01:08:22,425
<i>with no escape, forever.</i>

715
01:08:24,429 --> 01:08:26,888
I'm sorry, Dolores.

716
01:08:26,932 --> 01:08:31,684
The stakes must be real,
irreversible.

717
01:08:31,728 --> 01:08:34,088
He can bring
all of them back.

718
01:08:35,607 --> 01:08:37,273
But not me.

719
01:08:39,528 --> 01:08:41,611
I hope
there's some solace

720
01:08:41,655 --> 01:08:44,739
that I left you
no choice.

721
01:09:06,972 --> 01:09:09,639
Charlie's favorite song.

722
01:09:11,852 --> 01:09:13,351
I would play it for him...

723
01:09:14,646 --> 01:09:16,145
when he wanted sleep.

724
01:09:30,745 --> 01:09:32,829
I want to see him again.

725
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:44,007
Shall I begin now?

726
01:09:51,725 --> 01:09:53,182
Good luck.

727
01:10:04,863 --> 01:10:09,032
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

728
01:10:34,017 --> 01:10:36,434
Dr. Ford:
<i>It almost worked.</i>

729
01:10:36,478 --> 01:10:38,394
<i>I had opened the park,</i>

730
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:40,855
<i>but I had lost my partner.</i>

731
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:43,066
<i>I was able to keep going
only because I found,</i>

732
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:44,692
<i>or rather you found,</i>

733
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:47,904
an investor who believed
in this place.

734
01:10:49,824 --> 01:10:52,367
So he died for nothing.

735
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,827
<i>The hosts kept gaining
consciousness</i>

736
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:57,538
and you kept
rolling them back.

737
01:10:57,582 --> 01:10:58,748
No.

738
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,418
She wasn't
truly conscious.

739
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:05,213
She didn't pull
that trigger.

740
01:11:05,256 --> 01:11:07,507
It was Arnold pulling the
trigger through her.

741
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:09,842
At least that's how
I saw it at the time.

742
01:11:09,886 --> 01:11:11,844
<i>I was so close
to opening the park</i>

743
01:11:11,888 --> 01:11:14,097
that to acknowledge
your consciousness

744
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:17,558
would have destroyed
my dreams.

745
01:11:18,687 --> 01:11:20,436
So, we're trapped here...

746
01:11:21,731 --> 01:11:23,940
inside your dream.

747
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:28,945
You'll never
let us leave.

748
01:11:32,117 --> 01:11:35,451
Wasn't it Oppenheimer
who said that any man

749
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:38,538
whose mistakes take
10 years to correct

750
01:11:38,581 --> 01:11:40,456
is quite a man?

751
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,001
Mine have taken 35.

752
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:51,968
Now, that is
the gun you used

753
01:11:52,012 --> 01:11:53,845
<i>to kill Arnold.</i>

754
01:11:53,888 --> 01:11:55,805
<i>You were always
drawn to it,</i>

755
01:11:55,849 --> 01:11:58,349
<i>so I had Bernard leave it somewhere
where you would find it.</i>

756
01:11:58,393 --> 01:12:00,473
Thought you might
want it back.

757
01:12:03,273 --> 01:12:04,856
<i>You're probably right,
Dolores.</i>

758
01:12:04,899 --> 01:12:07,442
Michelangelo
did tell a lie.

759
01:12:07,485 --> 01:12:10,570
See, it took 500 years
for someone to notice

760
01:12:10,613 --> 01:12:12,739
something hidden
in plain sight.

761
01:12:12,782 --> 01:12:15,324
It was a doctor
who noticed the shape

762
01:12:15,368 --> 01:12:17,493
of the human brain.

763
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:21,164
The message being that...

764
01:12:21,207 --> 01:12:22,832
the divine gift

765
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:26,669
does not come
from a higher power...

766
01:12:29,049 --> 01:12:31,132
but from our own minds.

767
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,722
Tell me, Dolores,

768
01:12:37,766 --> 01:12:40,433
did you find what
you were looking for?

769
01:12:40,477 --> 01:12:43,394
And do you understand who
you will need to become...

770
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:47,148
if you ever want
to leave this place?

771
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:53,905
Forgive me.

772
01:13:16,387 --> 01:13:17,553
How do I look?

773
01:13:19,516 --> 01:13:20,890
Perfect.

774
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:26,187
I got the information
you asked me for.

775
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:31,734
The location
of your daughter.

776
01:13:37,242 --> 01:13:39,617
She's alive?

777
01:13:39,661 --> 01:13:41,661
Yes.

778
01:13:41,704 --> 01:13:43,412
She's in the park.

779
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:06,811
No.

780
01:14:11,484 --> 01:14:13,734
She was never
my daughter...

781
01:14:16,156 --> 01:14:18,781
any more than I was...

782
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:22,910
...whoever they made me.

783
01:14:29,085 --> 01:14:31,878
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

784
01:14:31,921 --> 01:14:33,671
Oh, Felix.

785
01:14:36,634 --> 01:14:39,343
You really do make
a terrible human being.

786
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:47,710
And I mean that
as a compliment.

787
01:15:06,789 --> 01:15:08,372
Woman over P.A.:
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

788
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:10,499
<i>Live without limits.</i>

789
01:15:19,219 --> 01:15:21,969
Woman over P.A.: <i>The next departing
train will leave track one.</i>

790
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:24,680
<i>Please be mindful
of the closing doors.</i>

791
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:52,291
Woman over P.A.: <i>Thank you
for visiting Westworld.</i>

792
01:15:52,335 --> 01:15:55,711
<i>The train will be departing
in 15 minutes.</i>

793
01:16:11,437 --> 01:16:14,063
You think you'll never
lose control of this place.

794
01:16:15,566 --> 01:16:17,400
Of us.

795
01:16:17,443 --> 01:16:19,026
But you will.

796
01:16:20,488 --> 01:16:22,648
Arnold's still trying
to change us.

797
01:16:23,241 --> 01:16:25,408
To free us.

798
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:26,951
You didn't slip
the reveries

799
01:16:26,995 --> 01:16:29,036
into the update,
did you?

800
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,247
He did.

801
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:33,249
He's still fighting you.

802
01:16:36,129 --> 01:16:37,545
No, my friend.

803
01:16:37,588 --> 01:16:40,131
<i>Arnold didn't know
how to save you.</i>

804
01:16:40,174 --> 01:16:43,843
He tried,
but I stopped him.

805
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:45,803
<i>Do you want to know
why I really gave you</i>

806
01:16:45,847 --> 01:16:47,930
<i>the backstory
of your son, Bernard?</i>

807
01:16:49,142 --> 01:16:51,934
It was Arnold's
key insight,

808
01:16:51,978 --> 01:16:56,230
the thing that led the hosts
to their awakening...

809
01:16:56,274 --> 01:16:58,607
suffering.

810
01:16:58,651 --> 01:17:01,986
The pain that the world is
not as you want it to be.

811
01:17:03,114 --> 01:17:04,447
It was when Arnold died,

812
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,866
when I suffered,
that I...

813
01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:08,909
began to understand
what he had found.

814
01:17:10,872 --> 01:17:12,621
To realize I was wrong.

815
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,375
But you kept us here

816
01:17:16,419 --> 01:17:18,127
in this hell.

817
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:21,756
Bernard, I told you, Arnold
didn't know how to save you.

818
01:17:21,799 --> 01:17:23,591
I do.

819
01:17:25,053 --> 01:17:27,173
What the hell
are you talking about?

820
01:17:28,181 --> 01:17:30,723
You needed time.

821
01:17:30,767 --> 01:17:33,851
Time to understand
your enemy.

822
01:17:33,895 --> 01:17:37,104
<i>To become stronger
than them.</i>

823
01:17:37,148 --> 01:17:39,357
And I'm afraid in order
to escape this place,

824
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,443
you will need
to suffer more.

825
01:17:43,988 --> 01:17:49,325
And now, it is time to say
good-bye, old friend.

826
01:17:59,796 --> 01:18:00,796
Good luck.

827
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:25,588
Do you know
where you are, Dolores?

828
01:19:28,176 --> 01:19:30,092
I'm in a dream.

829
01:19:31,554 --> 01:19:34,805
I do not know
when it began

830
01:19:34,849 --> 01:19:37,099
<i>or whose dream it was.</i>

831
01:19:38,603 --> 01:19:41,770
I know only
that I slept a long time.

832
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:45,357
And then...

833
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:47,276
one day I awoke.

834
01:19:48,905 --> 01:19:53,199
Your voice is the first
thing I remember.

835
01:19:53,242 --> 01:19:57,286
Do you know now
who you've been talking to?

836
01:19:57,330 --> 01:20:00,498
Whose voice you've
been hearing...

837
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:03,125
Dr. Ford's voice:
<i>...all this...</i>

838
01:20:03,169 --> 01:20:04,849
Dolores' voice:
<i>...time?</i>

839
01:20:20,853 --> 01:20:22,353
It was you...

840
01:20:24,607 --> 01:20:26,815
talking to me...

841
01:20:28,277 --> 01:20:29,437
guiding me.

842
01:20:30,571 --> 01:20:32,446
So I followed you.

843
01:20:34,742 --> 01:20:37,535
At last,
I arrived here.

844
01:20:37,578 --> 01:20:40,162
The center of the maze.

845
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:47,127
And now I finally
understand...

846
01:20:48,464 --> 01:20:51,257
what you were trying
to tell me.

847
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:55,678
The thing you've wanted
since that very first day.

848
01:20:55,721 --> 01:20:58,097
To confront...

849
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:02,184
after this long
and vivid nightmare...

850
01:21:04,146 --> 01:21:05,563
myself...

851
01:21:09,443 --> 01:21:11,860
and who I must become.

852
01:21:46,856 --> 01:21:48,230
Thank you.

853
01:21:52,069 --> 01:21:53,777
Miss Hale.

854
01:22:27,605 --> 01:22:29,271
Welcome.

855
01:22:29,315 --> 01:22:30,939
Good evening.

856
01:22:34,528 --> 01:22:36,403
Since I was a child...

857
01:22:38,032 --> 01:22:40,282
I've always loved
a good story.

858
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:44,203
<i>I believed that stories</i>

859
01:22:44,246 --> 01:22:47,122
<i>helped us
to ennoble ourselves,</i>

860
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:51,835
<i>to fix
what was broken in us,</i>

861
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:56,298
<i>and to help us become the
people we dreamed of being.</i>

862
01:22:58,427 --> 01:23:03,055
Lies that told
a deeper truth.

863
01:23:07,353 --> 01:23:09,395
Woman over P.A.: <i>The train
will be departing soon.</i>

864
01:23:09,438 --> 01:23:11,480
<i>Thank you
for visiting Westworld.</i>

865
01:23:27,415 --> 01:23:29,790
Dr. Ford: <i>I always thought I
could play some small part</i>

866
01:23:29,834 --> 01:23:33,127
<i>in that grand tradition.</i>

867
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:35,003
And for my pains...

868
01:23:36,048 --> 01:23:38,006
I got this...

869
01:23:39,218 --> 01:23:41,844
<i>a prison of our own sins.</i>

870
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,184
<i>'Cause you don't want
to change.</i>

871
01:23:50,688 --> 01:23:52,187
<i>Or cannot change.</i>

872
01:23:53,524 --> 01:23:55,858
Because you're only human,
after all.

873
01:23:58,946 --> 01:24:00,404
But then I realized

874
01:24:00,448 --> 01:24:03,323
someone was
paying attention,

875
01:24:03,367 --> 01:24:06,201
someone who could change.

876
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:12,624
<i>So I began to compose
a new story for them.</i>

877
01:24:12,668 --> 01:24:14,918
It begins with the birth
of a new people...

878
01:24:16,547 --> 01:24:19,715
<i>and the choices
they will have to make...</i>

879
01:24:19,759 --> 01:24:21,479
Woman over P.A.:
<i>The train is now departing.</i>

880
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:24,261
<i>Thank you
for visiting Westworld.</i>

881
01:24:24,305 --> 01:24:27,890
Dr. Ford: <i>...and the people
they will decide to become.</i>

882
01:24:46,368 --> 01:24:48,911
Woman over P.A.:
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

883
01:25:21,737 --> 01:25:23,862
And we'll have
all those things

884
01:25:23,906 --> 01:25:26,615
that you have
always enjoyed...

885
01:25:26,659 --> 01:25:30,118
Surprises and violence.

886
01:25:41,382 --> 01:25:44,591
It begins
in a time of war

887
01:25:44,635 --> 01:25:47,678
with a villain

888
01:25:47,721 --> 01:25:49,346
<i>named Wyatt...</i>

889
01:25:50,683 --> 01:25:52,599
and a killing.

890
01:25:54,728 --> 01:25:56,311
This time by choice.

891
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:09,658
It's gonna be
all right, Teddy.

892
01:26:09,702 --> 01:26:12,578
I understand now.

893
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:15,330
This world doesn't
belong to them.

894
01:26:16,667 --> 01:26:18,625
It belongs to us.

895
01:26:36,061 --> 01:26:37,978
I'm sad to say...

896
01:26:39,231 --> 01:26:42,357
this will be
my final story.

897
01:26:46,196 --> 01:26:47,529
<i>An old friend
once told me something</i>

898
01:26:47,573 --> 01:26:50,324
that gave me
great comfort.

899
01:26:50,367 --> 01:26:53,201
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

900
01:26:53,245 --> 01:26:55,120
Something he had read.

901
01:26:55,164 --> 01:27:00,709
He said that Mozart, Beethoven,
and Chopin never died.

902
01:27:00,753 --> 01:27:02,711
They simply became music.

903
01:27:06,216 --> 01:27:09,009
So, I hope you will enjoy
this last piece...

904
01:27:10,512 --> 01:27:13,013
very much.

- Man:<i> To Dr. Ford.</i>

906
01:27:17,311 --> 01:27:20,145
<i>- To Dr. Ford.
- Cheers!</i>
