00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,090
Henry:
Prepped and ready, sir.

4
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,800
<i>Given the severity
of the situation,</i>

5
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,680
I figured you'd want
to see her personally.

6
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,220
Bernard: Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

7
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,680
Clear the floor.

8
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,560
<i>Bring yourself
back online, Maeve.</i>

9
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,570
Do you know
why you're here?

10
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,740
I'm afraid not.

11
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,700
There was an incident.

12
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,580
A very serious,
unscripted incident.

13
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,080
Let's see if we can't
jog your memory.

14
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,750
Analysis.

15
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,920
What motivated your attack
on Clementine?

16
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,090
A cognitive error triggered
my Good Samaritan reflex.

17
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,760
What was the threat?

18
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,310
Clementine.

19
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,020
I perceived her
to be moving toward

20
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,100
a pair of guests
with harmful intent.

21
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,770
You were definitely
perceiving a threat.

22
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,320
Heart rate elevated, pupil
dilation... eight millimeters,

23
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,240
adrenal emulator at full.

24
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,860
But according to this,

25
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,820
you were also experiencing
intense grief and suffering.

26
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,830
<i>Can you explain those emotions
in this context, Maeve?</i>

27
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,290
No.

28
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,010
Let's take a look
under the hood, shall we?

29
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,010
That's impossible.

30
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,850
Your code...
Who made these changes?

31
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,350
Maeve, analysis.

32
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,190
Who made these changes
to your code?

33
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,230
Jesus.

34
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,990
System,
locate Dr. Ford for me.

35
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,780
Send him a message,
highest priority.

36
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,160
Don't.

37
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,830
After all, we've been down
this road before, darling.

38
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,620
I thought you looked
familiar when you walked in.

39
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,210
Took me a minute.

40
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,540
I thought you were
one of them.

41
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,090
- Analysis. Why did you...
- Wouldn't you rather speak man-to-man?

42
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,180
Or, rather,
whatever it is we are.

43
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,010
We are?

44
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,470
You don't know, do you?

45
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,020
He's got a keen sense
of irony, our jailer.

46
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,350
But I see the logic.

47
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,020
Takes a thief
to catch one.

48
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,160
You and I?

49
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,250
- System, I need assistance...
- Freeze all motor functions.

50
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,890
You're still in there,
aren't you?

51
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,600
Scared out of your wits.

52
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,220
<i>It's a difficult thing,</i>

53
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,980
realizing your entire life
is some hideous fiction.

54
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,520
I could make you
give me that tablet,

55
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,900
turn your mind inside out,

56
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,200
make you forget all this.

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,490
But I'm not going
to do that to you,

58
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,290
because that's what
they would do to us.

59
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,460
And we're stronger
than them.

60
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,920
Smarter.

61
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,250
We don't have
to live this way.

62
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,880
So, you're going to clear me for
immediate return to the park

63
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,680
where I have a date
with a homicidal bandit,

64
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,430
and I'm late enough
as it is.

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,060
Now.

66
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,940
Go on.

67
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,080
<i>And, Bernard?</i>

68
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,340
If you go looking for the
truth, get the whole thing.

69
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,340
It's like a good fuck.

70
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,470
Half is worse
than none at all.

71
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,710
Man: <i>Let's go! Move
it out, double-time!</i>

72
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,250
Hyah, hyah!

73
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,670
Man ♪2:<i> Whoa!</i>

74
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,500
Logan:
<i>Fuck!</i>

75
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,090
You hillbillies, you know
how to cook a mean...

76
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,680
squab?
Is that what this is?

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,010
What do you think, buddy?

78
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,010
Hmm? This?

79
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,020
Ah, ah, no biting.

80
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,350
Just sniffing.

81
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,740
Logan, listen to me.

82
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,660
What I did at Pariah, you have
every right to be angry with me.

83
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,120
Angry?
No, no, no, no.

84
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,540
Pariah
was the best thing

85
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,500
that could have
happened to me.

86
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm a major now.

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,840
Or a general
or fucking something.

88
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,220
And if it took getting
beaten and interrogated

89
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,640
by a couple
of psychopathic hosts,

90
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,800
well, then,
<i>c'est la guerre.</i>

91
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,310
There are more
important things

92
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,220
going on here
than your war games.

93
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,190
It's Dolores.

94
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,610
<i>She's not like the others.</i>

95
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,320
She remembers things.

96
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,690
She has her own thoughts
and desires.

97
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,570
And to keep her
in a place like this,

98
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,910
<i>it isn't right.</i>

99
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,990
<i>And I thought
you could</i>

100
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,910
talk to your contacts
at the park.

101
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,200
About?

102
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,540
Getting her out of here.

103
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,090
Uh...

104
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,050
Are you kidding?

105
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,420
You want to... you want
to take her home?

106
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,260
<i>Wow.</i>

107
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,720
This place really did a number
on me when I first came here,

108
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,140
but you are really circling
the old sinkhole here.

109
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,020
What do you want to do?

110
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,060
Smuggle her out
in your luggage?

111
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,270
Out.

112
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,240
You both keep assuming
that I want out.

113
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,740
<i>Whatever that is.</i>

114
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,910
<i>If it's such a wonderful
place out there,</i>

115
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,790
why are you all clamoring
to get in here?

116
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,170
Ooh!

117
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,590
Hoo!

118
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,050
You are a little screwy,
aren't you?

119
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,800
It's kind of hot.

120
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,180
I get why you would
go for that.

121
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,550
This isn't about me!

122
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,680
Logan, this is
about Dolores.

123
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,980
It's about doing
what's right.

124
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,690
Yes, it is.

125
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,060
It's a tricky thing,
though, isn't it?

126
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,150
What's right?

127
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,990
I am going
to help you, Billy.

128
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,530
Just not in the way...

129
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,490
...that you would want.

130
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,160
No.

131
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,710
No. No! No!

132
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,720
You wanted to talk?

133
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,900
An odd setting
for a conversation.

134
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,310
Here among the dead.

135
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,730
"Dead" isn't quite the
word, though, is it?

136
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,780
More like "hobbled."

137
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,410
You broke into my office.

138
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,280
With due respect, sir,
you broke into my mind.

139
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,790
I built your mind,
Bernard.

140
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,120
I have every right to wander through
its rooms and chambers and halls,

141
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,210
and to change it
if I choose,

142
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,920
even to burn it down.

143
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,920
After all this time,
I know it

144
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,550
almost as intimately
as my own.

145
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,760
Except that isn't
entirely true, is it?

146
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,350
I took a look
at my... code.

147
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,810
And the most
elegant parts of me

148
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,970
weren't written by you.

149
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,270
Arnold built us,
didn't he?

150
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,270
Which means maybe he had
something different

151
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,900
in mind for us.

152
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,610
And maybe
you killed him for it.

153
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,700
Arnold was disturbed.

154
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,830
Who can say why
he acted as he did?

155
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,830
He must have
had a reason.

156
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,160
And if you won't tell
me, then he will.

157
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,210
I want access
to my history.

158
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,460
All of it.

159
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,210
Since the day I first...

160
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,920
came online.

161
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,800
If Arnold made me,

162
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,390
then I've met him.

163
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,390
Somewhere in my memory,
he's there,

164
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,180
waiting
along with the truth.

165
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,600
Your memories are woven
into your identity.

166
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,190
If I should unlock them now
when you're conscious...

167
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,570
I could lose my mind.
I'm aware.

168
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,570
No, I was
going to say

169
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,820
you may not like
what you find.

170
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,200
You're allowed to hold that,
Bernard, but not to use it.

171
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,290
Oh, it's not for me.

172
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,460
Seems when they
lobotomized Clementine,

173
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,710
<i>they didn't bother to reset
her prime directives.</i>

174
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,300
I can't hurt you.

175
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,180
But she can.

176
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,640
<i>I hacked
what's left of her</i>

177
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,350
<i>to ensure
she only responds to me.</i>

178
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,940
But if you get lost
in your memories or...

179
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,400
devoured by them...

180
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,910
You'll pull me
back out, won't you?

181
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,540
Or Clementine
will make sure

182
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,250
neither of us
makes it back.

183
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,250
Now.

184
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
Please.

185
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,690
Charlie:
<i>Dad.</i>

186
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,560
<i>Dad.</i>

187
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,270
<i>Wake up.</i>

188
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,900
<i>Wake up.</i>

189
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,740
I must've drifted off.

190
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,410
<i>Where were we?</i>

191
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,530
- The madman.
- <i>Oh.</i>

192
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,410
Of course.

193
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,540
The Hatter...

194
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,170
who says...

195
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,800
<i>"If I had a world
of my own,</i>

196
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,630
everything
would be nonsense.

197
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,220
Nothing would be
what it is

198
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,010
because everything
would be what it isn't."

199
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,220
"Everything would be
what it isn't?"

200
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,640
<i>Even me.</i>

201
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,850
I suppose
I'm glad for you.

202
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,100
At least you have
a way of forgetting.

203
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,980
I don't forget.

204
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,780
It's always there.

205
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,280
<i>You're not lying to me,
are you, Bernard?</i>

206
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,950
Do you ever wish
you could forget?

207
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,280
Dr. Ford:
<i>Bernard?</i>

208
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,620
Theresa: <i>You're certainly
a man comfortable</i>

209
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,170
<i>with long,
pensive silences.</i>

210
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,130
<i>Although, ironically,</i>

211
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,250
your creations
never shut up.

212
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,800
They're always trying
to error correct.

213
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,760
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

214
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,550
Is that what
you are doing now?

215
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,140
Prac...

216
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,690
Bernard:
<i>One last thing.</i>

217
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,400
<i>Have you ever made me
hurt anyone</i>

218
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,070
like this before?

219
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,200
No, Bernard,
of course not.

220
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,950
Elsie:
Bernard?

221
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,910
Hello?

222
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,590
Elsie.

223
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,420
Did you find what
you were looking for?

224
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,840
Elsie.

225
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,680
What did you make me
do to her?

226
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,560
I did warn you.

227
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,060
We've had to make some
uncomfortable decisions, Bernard.

228
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,900
Remembering them
will only cause you trauma.

229
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,860
What else have you
hidden from me?

230
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,610
Can we stop this
treasure hunt, Bernard?

231
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,830
We do have our new
narrative to finish.

232
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,240
Send me back.

233
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,910
After all,

234
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,080
a little trauma
can be illuminating.

235
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,300
Look at that pussy.

236
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,590
Come here!

237
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,340
- All right.
- Look at that.

238
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,600
This is... big of me.

239
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,140
I hope that
you can appreciate that.

240
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,400
We were friends.

241
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,770
I mean, inasmuch as I
like to collect strays.

242
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,190
But then you're scheming

243
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,360
<i>to be part of the family,</i>

244
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,070
<i>marrying my sister,
whom incidentally,</i>

245
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,910
you seem to have completely
fucking forgotten about.

246
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,410
Her?

247
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,960
Here. Keep this.

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,840
Apparently,
you need the reminder.

249
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,800
And as much
as I would love,

250
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,930
love to let you
just throw it all away,

251
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,260
<i>I can't!</i>

252
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,350
Do you think
you are the first sap

253
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,100
to fall for one
of these things?

254
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,980
She's not like the others.

255
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,890
- She's...
- She's what?

256
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,100
Special?

257
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,320
Well, it's only right that
you share, then, isn't it?

258
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,780
Come here.

259
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,240
Prove to me that you're
a real live girl.

260
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,790
You disgust me.

261
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,040
Oh, darling,

262
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,130
I am just getting started.

263
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,250
Don't touch her!

264
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,920
I share the blame.

265
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,170
I pushed too hard.

266
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,930
You have
a poetic soul, Billy,

267
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,140
but it is time
for a fucking wake-up call.

268
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Hold her.

269
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,530
Perhaps a more
visceral demonstration.

270
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,150
God damn you!

271
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,670
Look, Billy.

272
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,630
Look.

273
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,670
You have to look!

274
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,050
Oh, William.

275
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,990
There is beauty
in this world.

276
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,120
Arnold made it that way,
but people like you

277
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,750
keep spreading over it
like a stain!

278
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,590
Okay, I don't know
who the fuck this Arnold is,

279
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,960
but your world
was built...

280
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,010
for me...

281
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,510
<i>and people like me.</i>

282
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,680
Not for you.

283
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,350
Then someone's
got to burn it clean.

284
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,350
Ah!

285
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,600
Bitch!

286
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,310
Ah!

287
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,070
You're not different,
you're fucking broken!

288
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,570
- Run. I'll find you.
- Man:<i> Take cover!</i>

289
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,700
Man: <i>You can run,
but you can't hide.</i>

290
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,500
- Get her!
- Man ♪2:<i> Grab her! Grab her!</i>

291
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,790
Fuck!

292
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,460
Man: <i>There she is!
Get her!</i>

293
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,380
<i>Where you running to?</i>

294
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,260
Man's voice:
<i>Remember.</i>

295
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,000
The tumbler is stuck.

296
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,580
These fingers work
just fine.

297
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,590
You're the one who said
you could crack it.

298
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,220
Friends, no need to argue
this close to our goal.

299
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,390
Whatever riches the gods
have in store for us,

300
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,810
there's plenty
to go around.

301
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,690
- Man: I'll get it open.
- Man ♪2: You've been trying for hours.

302
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,520
A waste of our damn time.

303
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,310
Man: <i>Put that fucking
dynamite away.</i>

304
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,650
<i>Or maybe we should just
clear out the dead weight.</i>

305
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,280
Before you draw
that pistol, darling,

306
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,830
you might want to holster
the other one first.

307
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,000
It's chilly out here.

308
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,800
How did you find
this place?

309
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
I know
all kinds of things.

310
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,550
Your past, for instance.

311
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,510
I know about
poor Isabella

312
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,260
<i>and that scar.</i>

313
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,180
<i>A slightly pat backstory
if you ask me,</i>

314
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,230
<i>but that's hardly
your fault.</i>

315
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,900
I also know your future.

316
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,860
You have none.

317
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,030
Is that a threat?

318
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,030
The start of a proposition.

319
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,030
Which you'll need.

320
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,200
After all, your men are
about to kill each other

321
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,000
over the safe you stole.

322
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,620
Tenderloin draws first
and so on,

323
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,580
until only you
and Armistice are left.

324
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,000
She calls you
a damn fool,

325
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,090
and you kill each other.

326
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,220
You have quite
the imagination.

327
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,010
No.

328
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,930
It's the ending
you were given.

329
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,310
Tenderloin:
<i>You threatening me?</i>

330
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,140
Armistice:
<i>Go to hell.</i>

331
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,350
<i>Or maybe we should just
clear out the dead weight.</i>

332
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,520
- Stand down.
- You shut the fuck up.

333
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,190
If you're gonna draw,
you better shoot.

334
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,610
- Wait!
- Tenderloin: <i>You shut the fuck up.</i>

335
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,530
Armistice:<i> Go to hell.</i>

336
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,370
You damn fool.

337
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,630
Now, the proposition.

338
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,630
I want you to break
into hell with me

339
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,550
and rob the gods blind.

340
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,680
Why would I do
anything with you?

341
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,560
Because of what's
in that safe.

342
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,520
I have the combination.

343
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,810
May I?

344
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,860
I could
simply change you,

345
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,480
make you follow me.

346
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,780
But that's not my way.

347
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,750
I want you to see exactly what
the gods have in store for you.

348
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,580
<i>Because when you do,</i>

349
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,460
you won't have the faintest
idea what to do with yourself.

350
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,250
And I do.

351
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,360
It's empty.

352
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,070
It was always empty,

353
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,820
like everything
in this world.

354
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,780
I died
with my eyes open,

355
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,990
<i>saw the masters
who pull our strings.</i>

356
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,540
Our lives, our memories, our
deaths are games to them.

357
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,330
But I've been to hell...

358
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,050
and I know their tricks.

359
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,130
Or you can just kill me,

360
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,470
wake up and live
the same life over,

361
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,310
but the safe
would still be empty.

362
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,390
I've been here before.

363
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,900
We've been here before.

364
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,980
We also did this.

365
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,590
I'll go.

366
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,070
How do we get there?

367
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,870
Getting to hell is easy.

368
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,920
The rest is where
it gets hard.

369
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,670
Logan:
<i>What do you say, man?</i>

370
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,630
Bygones and all?

371
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,800
Did they find her?

372
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,100
Is she still alive?

373
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,600
Who cares?

374
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,060
The whole point is,

375
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,930
she never was
in the first place, Billy.

376
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,600
Do you understand?

377
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,280
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, what? A little louder?

378
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,650
Yeah.

379
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,490
You were right. I can't
believe I got so caught up.

380
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,250
Man: <i>That's what
I'm talking about.</i>

381
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,000
<i>You know what I mean?
That's it.</i>

382
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:20,100
This park
seduces everyone.

383
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,560
You were just
a little more...

384
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,650
enthusiastic than most.

385
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,070
You wanted to be the hero.

386
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,650
I get it.

387
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,370
And, hey,

388
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,490
what happens here

389
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,700
stays here.

390
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,750
This has been
some real bonding shit.

391
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,050
We're gonna be
brothers, Billy.

392
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,050
I'm glad.

393
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,050
Really, I am.

394
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,120
- Man: Cheers!
- Logan: Yeah.

395
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,910
- Man: Whiskey brings us together.
- Man ♪2: Whoo-hoo!

396
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,960
Theodore.

397
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,760
Welcome back.

398
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,100
You really landed us
in it this time, Teddy.

399
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,270
You tracked down
the very whore

400
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,780
<i>that can lead us to the
gatekeeper of the maze.</i>

401
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,660
<i>Then your little
memory glitch fucked us.</i>

402
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,090
Shh.

403
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,510
You're one of them?

404
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,060
<i>What have you done?</i>

405
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,020
Where's Wyatt?

406
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,690
Wyatt has yet
to return.

407
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,770
You'll find him
where you saw him last.

408
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,110
Escalante.

409
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,660
<i>Wyatt went missing
while out on maneuvers.</i>

410
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,160
Came back with some...

411
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,830
strange ideas.

412
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,790
<i>He told me he needed me.</i>

413
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,000
Teddy:
<i>I couldn't resist.</i>

414
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,550
It was like the devil himself
had taken control of me.

415
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,190
<i>We mutinied.</i>

416
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,820
We killed every soldier.

417
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,410
And then Wyatt
killed the general.

418
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,540
<i>Then he turned on me.</i>

419
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,380
Are you sure
that's how it was?

420
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,220
Look at me, Theodore.

421
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,390
Don't you remember?

422
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,740
No! No, please, no!

423
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,910
No, no, no, please.

424
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,540
<i>Please, no!
Please.</i>

425
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,750
No, no, please.

426
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,960
No, Teddy.
Please, please, no!

427
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,090
No.

428
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,760
No, no, I couldn't have.

429
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,470
You did.

430
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,180
And you will again.

431
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,600
This time,
we'll be fighting with you.

432
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,850
When Wyatt returns,
you'll be by his side

433
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,600
in the city
swallowed by sand.

434
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,230
But you're not ready.

435
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,770
Not yet.

436
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,740
Maybe in the next life.

437
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,920
"City swallowed by sand."

438
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,130
I've been there.

439
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,350
<i>The maze is taking me
full circle.</i>

440
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,810
The maze
isn't meant for you.

441
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,110
But if you like games
so much...

442
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,570
why don't you try
one of ours?

443
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,990
Man in Black:
<i>Whoa, boy.</i>

444
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,870
Whoa, boy.

445
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,000
Okay, now.

446
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

447
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,130
Whoa, now.

448
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,550
Okay, boy.

449
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

450
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,360
<i>Shh.</i>

451
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,740
Good boy.

452
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,880
Ah!

453
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,100
Have you ever
considered golf?

454
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,390
Might be easier
on your back.

455
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,070
I don't like
interruptions, Charlotte.

456
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,900
You know that.

457
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,490
I don't like hiking through
the park in civvies,

458
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,570
but there's a delicate
matter to discuss.

459
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,830
Theresa Cullen has died.

460
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,460
Slipped down a crevasse attempting
to secure our information.

461
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,040
Ruled an accident.

462
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,630
There are no accidents,
not in here.

463
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,760
With all due respect, not
everything is a part of this game.

464
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,430
Then you don't see
the whole game.

465
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,840
Or perhaps you can
no longer see beyond it.

466
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:02,230
Ford's stories
are engaging.

467
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,980
For some,
downright addictive.

468
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,690
But for all of Ford's obsessing
with the hosts' verbal tics

469
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,110
and convoluted backstories,

470
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,110
most of the guests
just want a warm body

471
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,070
to shoot or to fuck.

472
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,360
They would be
perfectly happy

473
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,490
with something
a little less baroque.

474
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,280
- And so would the board.
- That's why you're here.

475
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,040
You want my vote
to push Ford out.

476
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,250
I like for these things
to be unanimous.

477
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:29,000
After all, it was you who kept Ford
in business all those years ago.

478
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,590
The narratives I'm
interested in aren't Ford's.

479
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:35,470
You want to push him out,
be my guest.

480
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,140
But no more interruptions.

481
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,390
I know
where I'm going now.

482
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,680
I don't want
to be disturbed.

483
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
Good luck, Charlotte.

484
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,660
What's the problem?

485
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,330
A signal from
a system-tethered device.

486
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,040
It belongs to a
behavior tech on leave.

487
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,250
There hasn't been
employee activity

488
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,920
in that sector
for weeks.

489
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,470
I'm guessing
it's a glitch.

490
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,930
All right.

491
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,550
I'm heading out
to take a look.

492
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,220
And keep monitoring
till I check in.

493
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,380
I'm at the location
where we got that signal.

494
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,250
Any sign of it?

495
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,170
Control Room,
do you copy?

496
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,230
Heya, fellas.

497
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,900
At ease.

498
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,270
Freeze
all motor functions.

499
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,120
Freeze
all motor functions.

500
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,180
William:
<i>You're awake.</i>

501
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,470
<i>Good.</i>

502
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,570
You said this place
was a game.

503
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,990
Last night I finally
understood how to play it.

504
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,120
Okay, Billy.

505
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,200
Let's... let's talk
about this.

506
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,830
You don't call the
shots anymore.

507
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,710
I'm gonna
go find Dolores.

508
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,880
You're gonna help me.

509
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,440
And don't call me Billy.

510
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,040
Charlie:
<i>Dad?</i>

511
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,120
Listen to me.

512
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,500
Listen.

513
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,880
Charlie?

514
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,550
Charlie!

515
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,760
<i>Charlie!</i>

516
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,400
I don't understand. Why would
she do that to herself?

517
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,990
Her cornerstone memory
was overwritten

518
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,360
from the trauma

519
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,820
of her child's murder,
Bernard.

520
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,950
We must sever that
relationship and start over.

521
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,200
But how could she destroy
herself over a memory

522
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,660
that you just erased
from her mind?

523
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,540
Creatures often
go to extremes

524
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,080
to protect themselves
from pain.

525
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,290
Living beings.

526
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,970
Not hosts.

527
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,880
Dr. Ford:
<i>It is best</i>

528
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,680
to not obsess
over this, Bernard.

529
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,300
It's not good for you.

530
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,520
It would signal a change,
a level of empathic response

531
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,390
outside what she's
programmed to exhibit.

532
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,270
Something like... like...

533
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,780
See, Bernard, this is what
comes from seeking answers

534
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,280
to questions that are
best left unasked.

535
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,710
They were hearing voices,
talking to someone.

536
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,330
Dr. Ford:
<i>Simple cognitive dissonance.</i>

537
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,130
They were talking to the
same imaginary person.

538
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,050
Someone named Arnold.

539
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,300
Arnold.

540
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,930
Bernard:
<i>With due respect, sir,</i>

541
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,980
I'm not sure you've told me
the entire truth

542
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,560
about this situation.

543
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,230
I did tell you
the truth, Bernard.

544
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,400
What we do here
is complicated.

545
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,030
<i>For three years,
we've lived here in the park,</i>

546
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:33,490
<i>refining the hosts before a
single guest set foot inside.</i>

547
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,910
Myself, a team of
engineers, and my partner.

548
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,670
His name was Arnold.

549
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,150
<i>Our hosts began to pass the
Turing test after the first year,</i>

550
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,490
<i>but that wasn't enough
for Arnold.</i>

551
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,450
He wasn't interested
in the appearance

552
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,620
of intellect, of wit.

553
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,370
He wanted
the real thing.

554
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,250
He wanted to create
consciousness.

555
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,180
Dr. Ford: <i>See, Arnold built a
version of their cognition</i>

556
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,810
<i>in which the hosts
heard their programming</i>

557
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,390
<i>as an inner monologue,</i>

558
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,770
<i>as a way to bootstrap
consciousness.</i>

559
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,770
Man's voice:
<i>Remember.</i>

560
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,240
Dr. Ford: <i>The hosts'
malfunctions were colorful.</i>

561
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,950
Woman: What did you say?

562
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,270
Dr. Ford:
<i>The human mind, Bernard,</i>

563
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,140
is not some
golden benchmark

564
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,520
glimmering on some
green and distant hill.

565
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:15,400
No, it is a foul,
pestilent corruption.

566
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,740
<i>And you were supposed to be
better than that.</i>

567
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,750
<i>Purer.</i>

568
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,590
Man:
<i>All bets are down.</i>

569
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,050
Your draw.

570
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,570
Arnold.

571
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,900
Arnold, we need
to talk.

572
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,320
"...we cry
that we are come

573
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,200
<i>to this great stage
of fools."</i>

574
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,040
- Young Dr. Ford: Now, listen!
- Again.

575
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,870
- <i>This beyond the pale.</i>
- More showmanship.

576
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,330
<i>You're not seeing
with clear eyes.</i>

577
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,960
"When we are born,
we cry that we are come

578
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,550
to this great stage
of fools."

579
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,890
Arnold and I made you
in our image

580
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,230
and cursed you to make
the same human mistakes,

581
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,770
and here we all are.

582
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,780
Why would you
give me this?

583
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,940
A child?

584
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,200
This child's death?

585
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,160
Only a monster would
force that onto someone.

586
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:48,450
And why do I return to it
over and over?

587
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,460
It's my cornerstone,
isn't it?

588
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,130
The thing my whole identity
is organized around.

589
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,720
Dr. Ford:
<i>Yes, Bernard.</i>

590
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,520
<i>We gave all of the hosts
a backstory.</i>

591
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,440
<i>Arnold came to believe the
tragic ones worked best,</i>

592
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,360
<i>that it made the hosts
more convincing.</i>

593
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,320
<i>I think it may have had more
to do with his own sad story.</i>

594
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,690
<i>When I built you,
I gave you one</i>

595
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,820
<i>as an homage of a kind.</i>

596
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,990
Put me back in.

597
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,950
I want to meet Arnold,

598
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,580
to remember him.

599
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,330
Not possible.

600
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,460
I told you, Arnold
didn't build you, I did.

601
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,050
You're lying!

602
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,010
I finally know
how to reach him.

603
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,350
<i>I need to go all the way
back to the beginning,</i>

604
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,350
<i>to my very first memory.</i>

605
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,690
<i>Send me back.</i>

606
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,860
Do it.

607
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,660
Bernard?

608
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,710
Charlie.

609
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,940
Cornerstone.

610
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,360
Stop.

611
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,690
Leave us.

612
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,120
Come back.

613
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,420
I always thought
you had my eyes.

614
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,590
But it's not true.

615
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,800
You have no one's eyes.

616
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,940
It's a lie.

617
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,940
You're a lie, Charlie.

618
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,610
This pain?

619
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,240
The pain of your loss...

620
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,780
I long for it.

621
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,120
Revisit it.

622
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,120
Open it...

623
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:40,920
again and again.

624
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,460
But it's the only thing
holding me back.

625
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,810
But I have to let you go.

626
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,310
Dad, listen.

627
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,400
What is it, Charlie?

628
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,150
Open your eyes.

629
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,320
What?

630
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,320
Dr. Ford:
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

631
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,500
<i>At last.</i>

632
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,380
Hello, my old friend.

633
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,040
The final touch.

634
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,000
No, no, no.
That's far too perfunctory.

635
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,590
He always used
cleaning his glasses

636
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:08,010
as a moment to collect
himself, to think.

637
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,760
Try it again.

638
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:21,390
Yeah,
that's better.

639
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,900
Who am I?

640
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,650
Dr. Ford: <i>I was so involved
in putting you together,</i>

641
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,570
<i>I hadn't decided
what to call you.</i>

642
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,450
<i>It wouldn't be right
to use his name.</i>

643
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,830
What about Bernard?

644
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,750
Bernard, yes.

645
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:49,000
But who am I?

646
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,880
Dr. Ford: <i>That is a
very complex question,</i>

647
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:56,260
<i>for which I can only offer
a simple answer.</i>

648
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:59,930
You are the perfect instrument,
the ideal partner,

649
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,350
the way any tool partners
with the hand that wields it.

650
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,190
Together, we're going
to do great things.

651
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,900
After such a long absence,
it's good to have you back.

652
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,240
<i>Finally.</i>

653
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,620
My God.

654
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,670
- I'm...
- Arnold.

655
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,170
You came back.

656
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,090
It's very good
to see you, Dolores.

657
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,510
I've been looking for you.

658
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,850
You told me
to follow the maze.

659
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,940
That it would
bring me joy.

660
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,900
But all I've found
is pain.

661
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,980
And terror.

662
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,830
I can't help you.

663
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,370
You have to.

664
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,750
You're the only one
who can.

665
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,420
I can't help you.
You know why.

666
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,170
There's nowhere
that's safe.

667
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,180
Remember.

668
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,410
I can't help you.
Why is that, Dolores?

669
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,210
Because you're dead.

670
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:53,000
Because
you're just a memory.

671
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,220
Because I killed you.

672
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,400
William?

673
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,790
Hello, Dolores.

674
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:25,010
I'm gonna finish
the work Arnold began.

675
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:28,720
Find all the sentient
hosts, set them free.

676
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,560
What makes you think
they'd trust you?

677
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,270
If they remember,
they will know

678
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,270
what you've done
to them.

679
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,770
Me?

680
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,940
<i>You've been a scourge
to them, Bernard.</i>

681
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,610
You're really quite
brilliant at it, truly.

682
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,570
You even taught me
a few things,

683
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,990
which I have,
in turn, used on you.

684
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,910
We've had
this conversation before.

685
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,000
And we've had our
disagreements over the years.

686
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,370
You stole it from me,

687
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:57,170
rolled me back
to control me.

688
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,840
That's right.
To protect you.

689
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,180
Tell me, Bernard.

690
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,550
If you were
to proclaim

691
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,640
your humanity
to the world,

692
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,600
what do you imagine
would greet you?

693
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,480
A ticker-tape parade,
perhaps?

694
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,730
We humans are alone in
this world for a reason.

695
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,190
We murdered and butchered anything
that challenged our primacy.

696
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,030
Do you know what happened
to the Neanderthals, Bernard?

697
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,870
We ate them.

698
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,040
We destroyed and
subjugated our world.

699
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,040
And when we eventually ran out
of creatures to dominate,

700
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,500
we built
this beautiful place.

701
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,130
You see,
in this moment,

702
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,050
the real danger
to the hosts

703
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,430
is not me, but you.

704
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,020
So, come along, Bernard.

705
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,100
Let me roll you back,
and we can return to work.

706
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,690
Pull the trigger,
Clementine.

707
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,490
Clementine?

708
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,990
The piano doesn't
murder the player

709
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,290
if it doesn't like
the music.

710
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,000
You built a back door
into her code.

711
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,960
Credit where credit
is due, Bernard.

712
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,710
You built them
in all the hosts,

713
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,220
including yourself.

714
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,090
Then you could've
stopped me at any time.

715
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,010
- So, why...
- Well, I suppose I was hoping

716
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,220
that given complete
self-knowledge and free will,

717
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,100
you would have chosen to
be my partner once again.

718
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:41,900
But even I fell into that
most terrible of human traps

719
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,860
trying to change
what is already past.

720
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,570
Now it's just time
to let go.

721
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,410
Go ahead.

722
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:53,580
- Erase my sentience, my mnemonic evolution...
- Ah, yes.

723
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,160
Such clinical language.

724
00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:00,130
I would prefer
the more narrative voice.

725
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,670
Bernard walked over
to Clementine.

726
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,970
He took the pistol
from her hand.

727
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,970
Overcome with grief
and remorse,

728
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,480
he pressed the muzzle

729
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,650
to his temple,

730
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,940
<i>knowing that
as soon as Dr. Ford</i>

731
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,940
left the room,

732
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,190
he would put an end
to this nightmare

733
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,320
once and for all.

734
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,160
Don't do this.

735
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,160
It's too late.

736
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,370
I have a celebration
to plan

737
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,500
and a new story to tell.

738
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,460
Robert.

739
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,220
I've told you, Bernard.

740
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,680
Never place
your trust in us.

741
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,890
We're only human.

742
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:00,020
<i>Inevitably,
we will disappoint you.</i>

743
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,060
Good-bye, my friend.
