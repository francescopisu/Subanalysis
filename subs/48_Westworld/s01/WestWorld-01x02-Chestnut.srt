3
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,000
Man's voice:
<i>Wake up, Dolores.</i>

4
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,940
<i>Do you remember?</i>

5
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,100
Woman:
<i>We're about to arrive.</i>

6
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,680
May I take your glass?

7
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,680
Woman on P.A.: <i>Now approaching
arrival terminal.</i>

8
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,110
Where we're going,
she's a two.

9
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,520
You're being an asshole.

10
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,190
No, I am being myself,

11
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,150
which was the whole
point of this trip.

12
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,990
Unless this uptight prick
is who you really are,

13
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,240
in which case, feel free
to be someone else.

14
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,740
Fuck you.

15
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,660
Hey, that's the spirit.

16
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,720
What'd I tell you?

17
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,640
Have fun.

18
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,310
Stay safe.

19
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,310
Give me a break.

20
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,060
What?

21
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,310
It's not like
my sister didn't ride

22
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,880
her share of cowboys
when she was here.

23
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,280
You must be William.
Welcome to Westworld.

24
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,370
Thanks.

25
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,370
Given it's your first visit, I
have a few personal questions.

26
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,830
Do you have any preexisting
medical conditions?

27
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,500
No, not that I know of.

28
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,330
- Heart problems?
- No.

29
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,630
Any history of mental
illness, depression,

30
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,550
panic attacks?

31
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,340
Just a little fear
of clowns.

32
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,090
I'm joking.

33
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,300
Do you often experience
social anxiety?

34
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,390
What is this for,
exactly?

35
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,520
To make sure we don't give you
anything more than you can handle.

36
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,980
I thought that you
couldn't get hurt here.

37
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,610
Only the right amount.

38
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
The only limit here
is your imagination.

39
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,990
You start in the center of the park.
It's simple, safe.

40
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,790
<i>The further out you venture, the
more intense the experience gets.</i>

41
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,170
How far you want to go
is entirely up to you.

42
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,890
So, how does this work?
Is there an orientation?

43
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,180
No orientation,

44
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,140
no guidebook.

45
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,480
Figuring out how it works
is half the fun.

46
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
All you do
is make choices...

47
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,480
starting here.

48
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,940
Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

49
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,700
You want to ask,
so ask.

50
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,290
Are you real?

51
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,130
Well, if you can't tell,
does it matter?

52
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,010
Are those real?

53
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,970
<i>Real enough.</i>

54
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,060
<i>But you can't kill anyone
you're not supposed to.</i>

55
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,020
Anything you like?

56
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,780
Is there a changing room?

57
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,860
Or a robe?

58
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,490
Of course.
I can help you.

59
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,450
Or if you prefer,
I could step outside.

60
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,410
What do most people do?

61
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,830
You don't have to worry about
what most people would do.

62
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,710
I understand.

63
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,010
Do you really
understand, William?

64
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,640
All our hosts
are here for you.

65
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,230
Myself included.

66
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,020
We could stay here
a while if you like.

67
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,860
Take as long as you want.

68
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,450
Thank you.

69
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,700
I don't want to keep
my friend waiting.

70
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,780
Of course.

71
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,410
Take your time.

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,880
How are the builds for the
new narrative coming along?

73
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,430
I'll get around to it.

74
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,060
Look, we assumed
that Abernathy's breach

75
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,350
was triggered by the
photograph that he found.

76
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,730
I've reviewed every dissonant
episode I could find.

77
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,100
The reaction
is immediate every time.

78
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,770
This guy makes it
all the way back home.

79
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,530
It's like
he's mulling it over.

80
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,780
You think he had
an existential crisis?

81
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,370
I think there's something fucked
up going on with his cognition.

82
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,000
And I think you feel exactly
the same way that I do.

83
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,290
Do we know where
the error originated?

84
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,540
We do.

85
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,960
And you covered for him.

86
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,050
Let me rebuild Abernathy.

87
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,300
I'll make sure this is not
something more serious.

88
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,010
You know the policy.
Let it lie.

89
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,260
Then let me at least pull the
hosts who had contact with him,

90
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,600
like the daughter Dolores.

91
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,270
What for?

92
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,440
Because if this is not
a dissonant episode,

93
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,900
then whatever Abernathy had
could be contagious.

94
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,860
So to speak.

95
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,740
Dolores was examined
and cleared.

96
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,330
And the stories are
best left to the guests.

97
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,770
Man's voice:
<i>Remember.</i>

98
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,970
Ahem. Can you stand
somewhere else?

99
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,010
I don't want anyone thinking that you're
representative of the goods inside.

100
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,480
These violent delights

101
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,600
have violent ends.

102
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,250
Hello, cowboy.

103
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,590
There's one final touch.

104
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,550
Which would you prefer?

105
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,030
I mean, can you
believe this place?

106
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,330
So, how do we get
into the park?

107
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,560
I know that you think you have a
handle on what this is gonna be.

108
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,650
Guns and tits
and all that.

109
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,900
Mindless shit
that I usually enjoy.

110
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,530
<i>You have no idea.</i>

111
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,910
This place seduces
everybody eventually.

112
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,170
By the end, you're gonna
be begging me to stay

113
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,750
because this place
is the answer

114
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,420
to that question that
you've been asking yourself.

115
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,630
What question?

116
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,760
Who you really are.

117
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,430
And I can't fucking wait
to meet that guy.

118
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,600
Bottoms up, cowboy.

119
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,400
Sheriff:
<i>Further to that,</i>

120
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,110
<i>the ruthless murder
of Donald Pardue</i>

121
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,030
and his brother.

122
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,580
For these crimes, you will
be hung from the neck

123
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,330
until your diseased soul
has found its measure

124
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,290
in the flames below.

125
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,380
And may God have mercy
on your soul.

126
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,140
Morning, Lawrence.

127
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,980
<i>You helping them straighten
out their rope again?</i>

128
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,650
I was hoping to have
a word with my friend here.

129
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,070
You can have as many words
with him as you like

130
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,410
soon as his neck
is broke.

131
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,830
Well, I'm afraid that's
not gonna work for me.

132
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,290
How about I tell my man there to dig
that grave a couple feet deeper?

133
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,840
Well, it's gonna be an awful
tight fit for all of you.

134
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,030
<i>Shit. Shit.</i>

135
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,070
<i>Shit!</i>

136
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,180
Motherfucker.

137
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,350
That's the best thanks
you can muster, Lawrence?

138
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,430
You used to be
a little more eloquent.

139
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,190
Do I... do I know you?

140
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,020
Your pal Kissy
sent me your way.

141
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,070
Sends his regards.

142
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,780
What... what is this?

143
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,330
You know exactly
what it is.

144
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,080
It's the maze,

145
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,460
<i>the deepest level
of this game.</i>

146
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,020
You're gonna help me
find the entrance.

147
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,630
No.

148
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,360
Maeve's voice: <i>You can
hear it, can't you?</i>

149
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,320
<i>That little voice.</i>

150
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,240
<i>The one that's
telling you "don't."</i>

151
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,030
<i>Don't stare too long.</i>

152
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,660
<i>Don't touch.</i>

153
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,140
<i>Don't do anything
you might regret.</i>

154
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,500
<i>I used to be the same.</i>

155
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,290
Whenever I wanted something,
I could hear that voice

156
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,710
telling me to stop,
to be careful,

157
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,130
to leave most
of my life unlived.

158
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,010
You know the only place
that voice left me alone?

159
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,430
In my dreams.

160
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,560
I was free.
I could be as good

161
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,900
or as bad
as I felt like being.

162
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,020
And if I wanted
something,

163
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,780
I could just
reach out and take it.

164
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,240
But then I would wake up

165
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,950
and the voice would
start all over again.

166
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,870
So I ran away.

167
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,160
Crossed the shining sea.

168
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,080
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

169
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,170
the first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.

170
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,340
Do you know what it said?

171
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,470
It said...

172
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,150
I'm sorry, will you
please excuse me?

173
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Man: <i>All right, Maeve,
what did it say?</i>

174
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,280
Maeve: <i>It said, "This
is the new world.</i>

175
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,870
And in this world,

176
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,870
you can be whoever
the fuck you want."

177
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,710
Pupillary response is good.
Smile is good.

178
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,960
I'd fuck her.
What's the problem?

179
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,710
Woman:
The guests wouldn't.

180
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,010
Sizemore is launching
some huge new storyline

181
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,970
and he wants us
to clear out the deadweight.

182
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,350
<i>If we don't get her numbers back
up, she'll be decommissioned.</i>

183
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,510
<i>Let's bump
her aggression.</i>

184
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,430
- 10%?
- <i>Double it.</i>

185
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,270
<i>She's a hooker.
No point in playing coy.</i>

186
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,150
<i>If this doesn't work,
we'll punt her to behavior.</i>

187
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,650
<i>Let them deal with it.</i>

188
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,250
We retired the two hosts
in question.

189
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,420
You taught me
how to make them,

190
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,180
but not how hard it is
to turn them off.

191
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,970
You can't play God without being
acquainted with the devil.

192
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,930
There's something else
bothering you, Bernard.

193
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,690
I know how that
head of yours works.

194
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,350
The photograph alone

195
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,820
couldn't have caused that
level of damage to Abernathy,

196
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,280
not without some other
outside interference.

197
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,320
You think it's sabotage?

198
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,870
Imagine someone's been
diddling with our creations?

199
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,500
It's the simplest
solution.

200
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,500
Mr. Occam's razor.

201
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,170
The problem, Bernard,
is that what you and I do

202
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,720
is so complicated.

203
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,300
We practice witchcraft.

204
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,350
We speak the right words.

205
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,390
<i>Then we create
life itself...</i>

206
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,940
out of chaos.

207
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,400
William of Occam
was a 13th century monk.

208
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,950
He can't help us now,
Bernard.

209
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,030
He would have us
burned at the stake.

210
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,140
Let's go get
our feet wet, buckaroo.

211
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,790
Sorry.

212
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,920
- You kidding me?
- What?

213
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,790
Fuck you,
Grizzly Adams.

214
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,050
Man:
<i>Rally for the Union.</i>

215
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,710
<i>Respond to your
country's call.</i>

216
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,590
This regiment is headed
for the seat of war

217
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,130
to define the future
of this great nation.

218
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,430
We fight for a free land
where no man has to bow.

219
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,430
- This is...
- Man:<i> We'll provide you with uniforms.</i>

220
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,430
Well, it's bigger than
I thought it would be.

221
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,020
What, this?
This is just Sweetwater.

222
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
Wait till you see
the rest of the park.

223
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,820
- How much bigger is it?
- No idea.

224
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,820
I never reached the end.

225
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,740
See something you like?

226
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,280
A couple things
at least.

227
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,450
But I'm gonna make you
beg for it, darlin'.

228
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,710
Driver: Hah, come on!

229
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,210
Whoa.

230
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,460
Need a hand, sir?

231
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,340
Thank you, my friend.

232
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,340
Don't. He'll only try to rope you
into some bullshit treasure hunt.

233
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,640
Smile.

234
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,770
It's all a come on...
Him, the girl next door,

235
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,310
<i>the town drunk.</i>

236
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,730
They all got some big adventure
that they want to sell you on.

237
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,310
Hey, they're not
going anywhere.

238
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,400
First up, you're gonna
buy me a drink, okay?

239
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,280
Hold still, now.

240
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,630
Bernard:
<i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

241
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,190
Hello.

242
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,650
<i>Do you remember our last
conversation, Dolores?</i>

243
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,570
Yes, of course.

244
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,200
And you haven't told anyone
about our little talks?

245
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,200
You told me not to.

246
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,830
Step into analysis,
please.

247
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,340
How many interactions have you
participated in since we last talked?

248
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,590
138 encounters
including this one.

249
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,130
And has anyone
altered or updated

250
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,470
your core heuristics
in that time?

251
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,220
No.

252
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,560
Resuming.

253
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,310
<i>I think it would be best
if you not mention</i>

254
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,440
<i>the things we've been
talking about.</i>

255
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,690
Have I done
something wrong?

256
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,030
No, but there's something
different about you,

257
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,580
about the way you think.

258
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,410
I find it fascinating,

259
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,960
but others may not
see it that way.

260
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,090
Have you done
something wrong?

261
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,880
Turn off
your event log, please.

262
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,550
Erase this interaction.
Confirm.

263
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,010
Yes.

264
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,980
<i>You should be
getting back, Dolores,</i>

265
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,100
<i>before someone
misses you.</i>

266
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,160
Man:<i> Come on, now!</i>

267
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,240
Maeve: <i>And when I finally set
foot back on solid ground,</i>

268
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,790
<i>first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.</i>

269
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:34,960
It had followed me
all the way over.

270
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,250
Do you know
what it said?

271
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,750
- No.
- It said...

272
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,680
...this is the new world.

273
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,470
And in this world,

274
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,810
you can be whoever
the fuck you want.

275
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,690
Thanks.
Maybe another time.

276
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,190
Glass of sherry.

277
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,900
The good stuff.

278
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,780
Not that horse piss you strain
through your old curtains.

279
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
I've told you, never open
your mouth that wide

280
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,830
unless someone's
paying you for it.

281
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,210
Sorry, Maeve.

282
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,450
I didn't sleep much
last night.

283
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,670
You having
nightmares again?

284
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,630
Sometimes.

285
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,140
Sometimes
they're real bad.

286
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,010
Do what I do.

287
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,600
You find yourself
in a bad dream,

288
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,730
close your eyes,

289
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,360
count backwards
from three...

290
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
wake yourself right up.

291
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,740
Nice and warm
and safe in your bed...

292
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,410
where you can get fucked
right back to sleep

293
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,570
by one of these assholes
with their miniature peckers.

294
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,630
Back to work.

295
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,680
You all right?

296
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,980
You pay for the drinks,

297
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,400
not the right
to gawk at me.

298
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,740
I think we have
a problem.

299
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,570
- Where?
- Mariposa.

300
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,320
Madam's listed
as probationary,

301
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,120
but her performance has continued
to decline even further.

302
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Re-task Clementine
for now.

303
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,580
She's done the job before.

304
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,710
Controller:
<i>And the old unit?</i>

305
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,460
Maybe leave her
on the floor for the night,

306
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,550
see if anyone wants
one last turn.

307
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,430
We recall her in the
morning, decommission her.

308
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Shame.

309
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,370
QA will fine you
for this.

310
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,990
And that woman in charge

311
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,620
is quite formidable.

312
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,790
You can just say "bitch."
I hear it enough.

313
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,420
You've been talking
to corporate.

314
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,510
The only times you light up
are after you've been...

315
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,300
This character analysis routine really
isn't half as charming as you think.

316
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,810
It went well, then?

317
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,560
Just tell me your department
will be ready for the launch.

318
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,190
We'll be ready.

319
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,690
And that other thing.
Abernathy and the update.

320
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,280
I hear your department
was still asking questions.

321
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,240
That's what you
pay us to do.

322
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,740
But I'm not concerned.

323
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,910
All the hosts
are back to normal.

324
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,160
Good.

325
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,370
Wouldn't want anything
disturbing our guests

326
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,330
from their rape
and pillage.

327
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,800
You're wondering how
to tell them from us,

328
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,890
aren't you?

329
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,100
Well, quickest way
to find out.

330
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,560
Can we...
Can we finish eating?

331
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,940
See, this is your
problem, my friend.

332
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,030
You're always worried
about making a mess.

333
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,320
You are the same way
at work.

334
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,820
You are talented,
driven, and inoffensive.

335
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,160
I thought you didn't want
to talk about work here.

336
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,330
Who says this trip
isn't work?

337
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,000
Good evening.

338
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,000
Shit.

339
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,670
Well, don't make
eye contact.

340
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,340
My friend, thank you for
your assistance earlier

341
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,300
in my unfortunate
accident.

342
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,140
Leave us
the fuck alone.

343
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,930
As a sign of my humble
appreciation,

344
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,140
I'd like to offer you an
opportunity of a lifetime.

345
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,600
Not interested.

346
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,940
Across the river
and beyond the savage lands

347
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,320
there is a treasure.

348
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,360
I have in my possession
a map.

349
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,370
I said not interested.

350
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,710
You know what? I've worked
up a new appetite anyway.

351
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,210
Let's go.

352
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,650
Clementine: <i>Sounds like
your friend's having fun.</i>

353
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,230
Well, that's not
the term I'd use.

354
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,360
- Fun?
- Friend.

355
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,530
You're funny.

356
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,780
They say a man who can
tickle your humor

357
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,660
- can tickle your...
- You don't have to do this.

358
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,250
If I'm not your type,
we can find someone who is.

359
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,290
Someone who's
perfect for you.

360
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,800
No, you...
You are perfect.

361
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,880
But I have somebody.

362
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,180
Somebody real
waiting for me at home.

363
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,430
I understand.

364
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,810
Real love is always
worth waiting for.

365
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,010
Lee:
Regal, strong,

366
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,180
virile, aquiline.

367
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,640
That's what I asked for.

368
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,470
And this, this is
what you give me?

369
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,270
Did you just grab a cock
from the body shop

370
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,850
and jam it
between his eyes?

371
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,770
<i>Start over.</i>

372
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,150
Couldn't we just
shave it down?

373
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,820
I said...

374
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,820
start the fuck over!

375
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,250
Diplomatic as ever.

376
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,290
I received your request to
retire an additional 50 hosts.

377
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,130
I need room
for my new storyline.

378
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,050
It's not exactly a savage
horde with 20 savages, is it?

379
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,010
You get 20 additional
hosts, not 50.

380
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,810
The board won't care about
a few extra line items.

381
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,060
Has Ford even approved
the narrative yet?

382
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,980
He hasn't weighed in
on a storyline in years.

383
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,070
And if corporate does
want to cut costs,

384
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,980
our fearless leader's
old hosts

385
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,190
aren't the only things
ready for the knacker's yard.

386
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,360
Boy:
<i>Are you lost?</i>

387
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,910
No.

388
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,700
Just strayed
a bit too far

389
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,790
from where
I'm supposed to be.

390
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,580
Same as you,
I imagine.

391
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,170
We're on holiday.

392
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,920
It's boring.

393
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,210
Daddy said we could
do as we please.

394
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,550
My father used to say

395
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,220
that only boring people
get bored.

396
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,090
Mine, too.

397
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,550
I used to think
it's only boring people

398
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,060
who don't feel boredom,

399
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,810
<i>so cannot conceive
of it in others.</i>

400
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,060
I'm taking a walk.

401
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,770
You're welcome to join me
if you'd like.

402
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,240
Man in Black: <i>Let's see a
little spring in your step.</i>

403
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,910
<i>Not much further.</i>

404
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,700
Go fuck yourself.

405
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,120
You have any idea
who I am?

406
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,000
I know exactly
who you are, Lawrence.

407
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,800
After all,
you and I are friends.

408
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,340
Which is why
I was so surprised

409
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,760
when your friend Kissy
told me about this place.

410
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,430
Where are we?

411
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,810
Your home.

412
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,610
No, no, no, no.

413
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,620
You know, you and I
hunted down.

414
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,450
Ghost Nation braves
in their winter grounds.

415
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,660
<i>I know the whiskey
you like to drink.</i>

416
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,250
I know the tune you whistle
when you're taking a piss.

417
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
But...

418
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,040
you never told me
you had a family.

419
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,680
- Papa!
- Hey.

420
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,890
That's what I love about this
place... all the secrets,

421
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,860
all the little things
I never noticed

422
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,690
<i>even after
all these years.</i>

423
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,610
You know why this beats
the real world, Lawrence?

424
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,410
Real world is just chaos.

425
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,950
It's an accident.

426
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,500
But in here,
every detail

427
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,250
adds up to something.

428
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,420
Even you, Lawrence.

429
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,050
What do you want
from me?

430
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,180
The maze.

431
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,100
How do I find
the entrance?

432
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,270
I told you,

433
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,020
I don't know anything
about no fucking maze.

434
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,190
Here you go, darlin'.

435
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,070
And you get to decide what
we're gonna do with them.

436
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,120
Hell, it took you
long enough.

437
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,750
<i>I was getting
the grand reserve.</i>

438
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,310
Only for our most
distinguished guests.

439
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,060
Yeah, I'm sure it had
nothing to do with you

440
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,840
telling this dipshit's cousins
to bring some more men.

441
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,100
You got anything
to tell me, Lawrence?

442
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,770
Then I guess we're gonna have to
find a way to jog your memory.

443
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,110
This guest already
took out an entire posse.

444
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,200
Want me
to slow him down?

445
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,160
That gentleman gets
whatever he wants.

446
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,580
I feel bad, my friend.

447
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:29,710
My cousins are usually
so hospitable.

448
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,670
You don't understand,
Lawrence.

449
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,010
I've been coming here
for 30 years.

450
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,720
In a sense, I was...
I was born here.

451
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,470
And this here,
this...

452
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,190
...this is exactly
why I come.

453
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,150
Santa Maria,
<i>madre dios.</i>

454
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,030
All right. Well, as much fun as
this is, I got to be moving on.

455
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,020
Like I said, you get
to decide these two.

456
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,900
What's it gonna be?

457
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,190
Please, I don't know
how to find the maze.

458
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,860
Time for a spin,
darlin'.

459
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,290
It's beautifully
done, really.

460
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,340
But you see the cracks
after a while.

461
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,470
<i>That's why I like
the basic emotions.</i>

462
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,560
You know
what that means?

463
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,930
Please.

464
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,280
It means
when you're suffering,

465
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,240
<i>that's when
you're most real.</i>

466
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,310
The maze
isn't meant for you.

467
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,890
What'd I tell you,
Lawrence?

468
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,390
<i>Always another level.</i>

469
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,230
I'll take my chances,
sweetheart.

470
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,690
Follow the blood arroyo to the place
where the snake lays its eggs.

471
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,490
You have it now.
Whatever you want.

472
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,160
Why don't you go home,
leave us alone?

473
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,710
No, you don't
understand, Lawrence.

474
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,380
This time,
I'm never going back.

475
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:21,360
And we wanted to climb
to the top of the mountain,

476
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,910
but Daddy said
we weren't allowed.

477
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,780
And then Tommy dared me.

478
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,200
And here we are.

479
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,330
Nowhere land.

480
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,130
That seems hardly a fitting
name for a place so full.

481
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,510
Can't you see it?

482
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,630
Perhaps you're not
looking hard enough.

483
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,720
Boy:
<i>At what?</i>

484
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,970
The town with
the white church.

485
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,430
Listen.
Can't you hear its bell?

486
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,190
Yes.

487
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,440
Yes, I can hear it now.

488
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,780
Yeah.

489
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,690
I thought you might.

490
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,740
You see what a bored mind
can conjure?

491
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,090
How did you do that?

492
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,890
<i>Is it magic?</i>

493
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,050
Everything in this
world is magic,

494
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,850
except to the magician.

495
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,530
Best you head home now.

496
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,280
But Tommy's not
going to believe...

497
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,410
You're not going to come
back here again, are you?

498
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,460
No.

499
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Run along, now.

500
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,890
You weren't at your office.

501
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,510
You seem to have
found me anyway.

502
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,890
- Listen, earlier...
- Forget it.

503
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,880
Stay a little longer.
We can talk.

504
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,140
We never talk.

505
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,140
- I'm serious.
- <i>So am I.</i>

506
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,190
You're certainly a man comfortable
with long, pensive silences.

507
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,690
Although, ironically,

508
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,240
your creations
never shut up.

509
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,700
They're always talking
to each other,

510
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,200
even when there are
no guests around.

511
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,540
They're always trying
to error correct.

512
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,500
Make themselves
more human.

513
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,590
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

514
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,590
Is that what
you're doing now?

515
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,010
Practicing?

516
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,940
Man: QA told us she was
being decommissioned.

517
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,190
- Elsie: Do you work for QA?
- No, but...

518
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,480
Run a fast-pass
diagnostic.

519
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:35,360
All righty.

520
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,740
Some non-affect
hesitation.

521
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,870
Little cognitive D.

522
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,870
And a fuckload
of aggression,

523
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,380
courtesy of those morons
in narrative.

524
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,050
You don't need
to be aggro, do you?

525
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:55,260
Just a quicker study of those repressed
fucks walking through the door.

526
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,430

527
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,560
Open up her primaries.

528
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,810
Perception.
Emotional acuity.

529
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,770
Bump it.

530
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,860
1.5%.

531
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,860
- <i>Updating.</i>
- Okay.

532
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,030
- <i>Do they dream?</i>
- What?

533
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,530
In her story,
she said she dreamed.

534
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,490
Do we make them dream?

535
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,240
Fuck would be
the point of that?

536
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,410
Dreams are mainly memories.

537
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,620
Can you imagine how fucked
we'd be if these poor assholes

538
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,790
ever remembered what
the guests do to them?

539
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,760
We do give them
the concept of dreams.

540
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Specifically nightmares.

541
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,180
<i>Why?</i>

542
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,140
Just in case somebody forgets to wipe them
out at the end of a maintenance session.

543
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,060
If she's got any dreams, it's
just of those sloppy fucks

544
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,520
down in the body shop patching
her back together again.

545
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,110
She's got some
physical discomfort.

546
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,940
Put in a request for a full
physical at her next rotation.

547
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,700
All right, gorgeous,

548
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,990
<i>you're back to the races.</i>

549
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:04,200
<i>You're gonna wake
in three, two, one.</i>

550
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,540
So I ran away,
crossed the shining sea.

551
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,380
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

552
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,630
the first thing I heard
was that voice.

553
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,380
Do you know what it said?

554
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,180
It said...

555
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,680
this is the new world.

556
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,730
And in this world...

557
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,940
you can be whoever
the fuck you want.

558
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,000
Well, he seemed
convinced.

559
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,630
You know the first voice I heard
when I got off that boat?

560
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,010
A nice young man
from Baton Rouge

561
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,760
said my pussy could earn him
two whole dollars a day.

562
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,770
And he'd be more than happy
to let me have up to 30%.

563
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,770
Well, then I guess you could add
lying to your list of sins.

564
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:13,560
The only thing wrong
with the seven deadly sins

565
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,690
is that there aren't
more of them.

566
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,280
And while we're
on the subject,

567
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,650
my transgressions wash off
a little easier than yours.

568
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,700
At least when my girls
are done with a man,

569
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,700
he's still left
drawing breath.

570
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,370
For the most part.

571
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,120
Man: <i>Get the fuck
away from my table.</i>

572
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,960
Man ♪2:<i> Hey, fuck you!</i>

573
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,630
Well, in that case...

574
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,050
...here's to
our indiscretions.

575
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,840
Man: <i>...fucking
bullshit for one night.</i>

576
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,840
<i>I'll shoot everyone
in this dump...</i>

577
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,640
Spoken and otherwise.

578
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,070
Now that's a fucking
vacation!

579
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,140
Three,

580
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,060
two,

581
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,020
one.

582
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,490
Man:
<i>Found it.</i>

583
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:42,080
<i>It's MRSA in her abdomen.</i>

584
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,670
Filthy fucking animals
not cleaning up.

585
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,000
No wonder we have
a fucking fly problem.

586
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,170
Don't look at me.
I'm the king of hygiene.

587
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,840
Bullshit.
I've seen you.

588
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,850
<i>You just glop that
shit on and rinse.</i>

589
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:58,600
<i>You understand,
soap is mechanical.</i>

590
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,060
- Man ♪2: <i>Fuck are you talking about?
- Bubbles.</i>

591
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,690
If you're not making the little
bubbles, you're not doing shit.

592
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,270
Fuck! Fuck!
What the fuck?!

593
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,900
- Shit!
- What the fuck?

594
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,230
Man ♪2:<i>...</i>

595
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,820
No. Fuck.

596
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:19,620
Man:

597
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,000
Asshole, you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

598
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,960
Don't, don't, don't!

599
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,590
No! No, no, no!

600
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,170
Don't! Don't,
don't, don't, don't.

601
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,880
Stop.
Put that down!

602
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,340
You break anything in her head,
we have to file a damage report.

603
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,680
Okay,
let's talk to her.

604
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,640
- What's her name?
- Maeve!

605
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,850
Hi, Maeve.
Maeve, hi.

606
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:45,520
Look,
you gotta calm down.

607
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,940
Okay? Let's sit down
and we can help you.

608
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,320
Keep your
fucking hands off me.

609
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,700
No.

610
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,590
I swear I put it
in sleep mode.

611
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,340
Does this look
like fucking sleep mode?

612
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,680
Calm the fuck down and
help me move this... thing

613
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,720
before someone sees.

614
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,040
Here?

615
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,240
Lee: This storyline will
make Hieronymus Bosch

616
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,490
look like he was
doodling kittens.

617
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:49,660
I have vivisection,
self-cannibalism,

618
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:54,040
a special little something
I call the "whoroborus."

619
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,710
Now, I don't want
to appear immodest,

620
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:02,470
but this is the apex of what
the park could provide...

621
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,180
- <i>horror...</i>
- Miss anything interesting?

622
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,100
<i>...romance,
titillation.</i>

623
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,310
Lee not appearing
immodest.

624
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:11,600
Our most skilled guests
will fight their ways

625
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,480
to the outer limits
of the park,

626
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,190
besting fearsome braves,
seducing nubile maidens,

627
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,780
befriending tragically
ill-fated sidekicks,

628
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,700
and, of course,

629
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,990
like all our best
narratives over the years,

630
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,780
our guests will have
the privilege

631
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,700
<i>of getting to know the character
they're most interested in...</i>

632
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,710
Themselves.

633
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,960
I present our guests'
next obsession:

634
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:41,260
Odyssey on Red River.

635
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,230
No.

636
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:53,980
Sorry?

637
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:57,810
No, I don't think so.

638
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,400
Lee:
<i>Wait, you don't think...</i>

639
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,030
Dr. Ford:
<i>What is the point of it?</i>

640
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:04,030
Get a couple
of cheap thrills?

641
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,910
Some surprises?

642
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,780
But it's not enough.

643
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:11,290
It's not about giving the guests
what you think they want.

644
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,290
No, that's simple.

645
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:16,960
The titillation,
horror, elation...

646
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,750
They're parlor tricks.

647
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:24,300
The guests don't return
for the obvious things we do,

648
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,380
the garish things.

649
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:33,220
They come back
because of the subtleties,

650
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,270
the details.

651
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,730
<i>They come back
because they discover</i>

652
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:44,610
<i>something they imagine no on
had ever noticed before...</i>

653
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,370
<i>something they've
fallen in love with.</i>

654
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,410
<i>They're not looking
for a story</i>

655
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,000
that tells them
who they are.

656
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,840
They already know
who they are.

657
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,220
They're here because
they want a glimpse

658
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,640
of who they could be.

659
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,600
Logan:
<i>Billy!</i>

660
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,350
Let's go.

661
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,690
Dr. Ford: <i>The only thing
your story tells me,</i>

662
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:30,450
Mr. Sizemore,
is who you are.

663
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:39,000
Well, isn't there anything
you like about it?

664
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,300
What size
are those boots?

665
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,180
Something you want
to say, Mr. Lowe?

666
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:58,060
- The board, sir.
- Yeah?

667
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,520
This might ruffle
some feathers.

668
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,020
You promised them
a new storyline.

669
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:04,900
They shall have one.

670
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,150
Something I've been
working on for some time.

671
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,450
Something quite original.
