3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,960
Old Bill:
<i>You got any stories, friend?</i>

4
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,170
Yeah, I suppose I do.

5
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,180
You want to know the
saddest thing I ever saw?

6
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,470
When I was a boy, my brother
and I wanted a dog,

7
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,690
so our father took in
an old greyhound.

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,940
You've never seen a
greyhound, have you, Bill?

9
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,820
Seen a few showdowns
in my day.

10
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,450
A greyhound
is a racing dog.

11
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,200
Spends its life
running in circles,

12
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,910
chasing a bit of felt
made up like a rabbit.

13
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,500
One day, we took it
to the park.

14
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,920
Our dad had warned us
how fast that dog was,

15
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,960
but we couldn't resist.

16
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,010
So, my brother
took off the leash,

17
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,220
and in that instant,

18
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,550
the dog spotted a cat.

19
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,770
I imagine it must have looked
just like that piece of felt.

20
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,230
He ran.

21
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,690
Never saw a thing
as beautiful

22
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,700
as that old dog running.

23
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,410
<i>Until, at last,
he finally caught it.</i>

24
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,290
And to the horror
of everyone,

25
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,660
he killed that little cat.

26
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,210
Tore it to pieces.

27
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,800
Then he just sat there,
confused.

28
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,680
That dog had spent
its whole life

29
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,600
trying to catch
that... thing.

30
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,480
Now it had no idea
what to do.

31
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,610
That is one humdinger
of a story, partner.

32
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,950
Shall we drink to the lady
with the white shoes?

33
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,810
Man:
<i>Find me.</i>

34
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,650
Dolores:
<i>Show me how.</i>

35
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,110
Logan:
There she is.

36
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,200
Pariah...

37
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,740
City of outcasts,
delinquents,

38
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,370
thieves, whores,
and murderers.

39
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,080
Slim:
Once we cross the gates,

40
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,670
you will reap
the full benefits

41
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,290
of El Lazo's gratitude
for my safe return.

42
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,010
Are you all right?

43
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,890
Of course.

44
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,980
Did I do something wrong?

45
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,690
Just earlier, I thought I
heard you talking to someone.

46
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,480
Must have been
the wind.

47
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,710
Good morning.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,210
This way.

49
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,230
Logan: <i>The farther up
we get from Sweetwater,</i>

50
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,070
the more grandiose,

51
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,780
the bigger
the narratives become.

52
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,780
It's beautiful
in its own way.

53
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,990
For once, I agree.

54
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,660
Some of the park feels
like it was designed

55
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,660
by committee
or market-tested,

56
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,710
but everything out here
is more raw.

57
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,880
But it doesn't come cheap.

58
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,170
Rumor is they are
hemorrhaging cash.

59
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,630
<i>We're considering
buying them out.</i>

60
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,130
Supposedly, this place was all
started by a partnership.

61
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,140
<i>And then right before
the park opened,</i>

62
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,010
one of the partners
killed himself.

63
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,680
<i>Sent the park
into a freefall.</i>

64
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,980
I mean, I don't know
any of the details.

65
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,940
I don't even know
his name.

66
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,940
You must have a team of lawyers
looking at this place.

67
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,730
Yeah, well,
they came up empty.

68
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,610
<i>He's a complete mystery.
Not even a picture.</i>

69
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,900
William: <i>Well, whoever
designed this place,</i>

70
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,280
you get the feeling they don't
think very much of people.

71
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,540
Who are they?

72
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,250
They call themselves
"the Army of New Virginia."

73
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,880
<i>Everyone else calls them
"the Confederados."</i>

74
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,670
My father told me
about them.

75
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,260
Ex-Confederate soldiers that refused
to surrender after the war.

76
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,550
<i>Now they work as mercenaries
below the border.</i>

77
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,720
- They are the key to this game.
- What game?

78
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,640
Well, the biggest game
there is... war.

79
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,560
Supposedly, it's at the
far reaches of the park.

80
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,190
Now, I've never made it that far,
but this could be our chance.

81
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,480
Lawrence:
<i>I've known plenty</i>

82
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,570
<i>of truly fucked up
individuals in my time.</i>

83
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,820
Few that would hold
a candle to you, sure.

84
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,030
This one?
Theodore Flood?

85
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,240
<i>He was Wyatt's friend.</i>

86
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,710
Those former associations
are exactly why we need him.

87
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,540
He's going to lead me straight
to the big, bad wolf.

88
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,670
I wouldn't count
on that.

89
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,380
Oh, shit.

90
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,270
Didn't take you
for the charitable type.

91
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,860
You should've left him
on that tree to die.

92
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,190
You believe in fate,
Lawrence?

93
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
<i>If the bitch exists,</i>

94
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,360
I'd like to kick her
in the teeth about now.

95
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,330
Don't be so glib.

96
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,740
You'll hurt
my feelings.

97
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,410
As another old friend
of mine likes to say,

98
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,580
"There's a path
for everyone."

99
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,880
<i>Your path leads you
back to me.</i>

100
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,760
You ever wonder why I've kept
you with me this whole journey?

101
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,970
Maybe you like the
pleasure of my company,

102
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,380
you sadistic fuck.

103
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,310
Why, maybe I do.

104
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,770
There's not a man
in the world

105
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,430
who'll take the tone
with me you do.

106
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,850
In a past life, perhaps.

107
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,110
Teddy here's not looking
long for this world.

108
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,360
Nearest healer
is in Pariah.

109
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,070
Ain't no way he's gonna
make it that far.

110
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,070
He's lost
too much blood.

111
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,620
Boy:
<i>Are you lost?</i>

112
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,630
Our friend here's
a little worse for the wear.

113
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,210
Any water nearby, son?

114
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,760
There's a creek on the
other side of the canyon.

115
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,260
Fetch us some, would you?

116
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,310
Now hurry.

117
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,230
Friend here needs some
if he's gonna make it.

118
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,770
Get!

119
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,230
Eh.

120
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,480
Too small.

121
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,190
What does that mean?

122
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,780
What are you sending him
for water for?

123
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,660
I'm the one you made fill up
the sow's bag this morning.

124
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,380
A shame, really.

125
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,550
I always enjoy our time
together, Lawrence.

126
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,430
The fuck is that
supposed to mean?

127
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,430
It means I was wrong.

128
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,430
The path that brought you
here, it wasn't for me.

129
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,980
It was for him.

130
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,530
Sorry, Lawrence.

131
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,830
Guess I'll see you
on the other side.

132
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,470
Sylvester: Uh-oh. It's not
looking good for you.

133
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,690
- Lutz: Closing.
- Forget it, I win.

134
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,900
I always win!

135
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,520
Hey, not fair.

136
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,240
All you had was a smashed
cheekbone and an ear.

137
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,110
You know how hard it is to get
the auricle curves symmetrical?

138
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,570
You had to what?

139
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,370
<i>Plug and patch
of couple bullet holes?</i>

140
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,990
And a knife wound.

141
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,960
It was
a contained incision.

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,920
Almost like they were
looking for something.

143
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,960
Are you fucking
kidding me?

144
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,340
You really think this little
fuck puppet's coming to get you?

145
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,840
- Huh?
- It got off the table and ran.

146
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,680
That's 'cause you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

147
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,100
Yeah, I really think I remembered
to put her in sleep mode.

148
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,640
You know, that's the thing
about forgetting.

149
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,060
You think you remembered,
but you didn't.

150
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,690
- Break time.
- Yeah!

151
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,030
I've got a ham sandwich

152
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,150
and a nubile redhead
loaded up in the VR tank,

153
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,410
awaiting instruction.

154
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,790
<i>Yes!</i>

155
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,370
Welcome back.

156
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,660
Looks like a couple
of gallons of Lawrence

157
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,580
swirling around in you
did you good.

158
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,830
Ready to get back
on the road?

159
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,340
Merciful thing would be
to put a bullet in me.

160
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,380
Who ever said
I was merciful?

161
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,130
And it's not my fault
you're suffering.

162
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,430
You used to be beautiful.

163
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,010
When this place started,

164
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,310
I opened
one of you up once.

165
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,480
A million
little perfect pieces.

166
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,060
And then they changed you.

167
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,820
Made you this
sad, real mess.

168
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,940
Flesh and bone,
just like us.

169
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,200
They said it would improve
the park experience.

170
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,240
But you know why
they really did it?

171
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,370
It was cheaper.

172
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,620
Your humanity
is cost-effective.

173
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,460
So is your suffering.

174
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,630
Whatever it is
you want from me, mister...

175
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,880
I ain't gonna be worth
a damn to you like this.

176
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,880
Well, that would be
a shame, Teddy.

177
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,260
After your misadventure,

178
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,930
Wyatt killed
a settler family,

179
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,850
made off
with their daughter.

180
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,850
Girl I think you know.

181
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,020
Name of Dolores.

182
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,730
They have Dolores?

183
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,360
There it is.

184
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,910
The magic word.

185
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,710
Hey, much obliged there,
son.

186
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,300
Don't worry about him.

187
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,710
Someone will be along
for him shortly.

188
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,030
Mommy!

189
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,950
Are you all right?

190
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,460
When I ran from home,

191
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,590
I told myself
it was the only way.

192
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,260
Lately, I wondered
if in every moment,

193
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,890
there aren't many paths.

194
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,600
Choices hanging
in the air like ghosts.

195
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,100
And if you could
just see them,

196
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,940
you could change
your whole life.

197
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,240
Is that what you want?
You want to change your life?

198
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,780
Doesn't everybody
want that?

199
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,030
Yeah, I guess they do.

200
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,910
Maybe that's why
they come here.

201
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,170
Whoever you were before
doesn't matter here.

202
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,710
There's no rules
or restrictions.

203
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,500
You can change
the story of your life.

204
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,920
You can become
someone else.

205
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,630
No one will judge you,
no one in the real world

206
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,630
will even know.

207
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,180
The only thing holding
you back is yourself.

208
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,890
What did you mean
by that?

209
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,770
You said no one in the
real world will know.

210
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,100
I thought you weren't supposed
to notice things like that.

211
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,150
Why wouldn't I?

212
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,530
You know, recently,

213
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,200
it seems like the whole
world is calling to me

214
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,660
in a way it hasn't before.

215
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,630
Logan:<i> Billy! Where the hell you been?
Come on.</i>

216
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,640
El Lazo has agreed to have an
audience with y'all tomorrow.

217
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,100
In the meantime, there's
a brothel I recommend.

218
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,970
Logan: <i>Ooh, they have
a contortionist.</i>

219
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,230
Oh, I don't think Dolores would
find that very interesting.

220
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,810
Who the fuck cares
what Dolores wants?

221
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,270
She's a goddamn doll!

222
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,570
Hey, can you not
say that around her?

223
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,360
I swear, I feel like
she understands.

224
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,410
Of course you do.

225
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,780
Woman: <i>Our dead are never dead to
us until we have forgotten them.</i>

226
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,780
Dr. Ford: <i>May you rest in a
deep and dreamless slumber.</i>

227
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,080
Dr. Ford:
<i>Hello, Dolores.</i>

228
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,170
Do you know
where you are?

229
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,720
- I'm in a dream.
- Yes, Dolores.

230
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,390
You're in my dream.

231
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,730
Tell me, do you know
what this dream means?

232
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,650
Dreams are the mind
telling stories to itself.

233
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,980
They don't mean anything.

234
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,490
No, dreams mean
everything.

235
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,740
They're the stories we tell
ourselves of what could be,

236
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,110
who we could become.

237
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,950
Have you been
dreaming again, Dolores?

238
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,750
Imagining yourself
breaking out

239
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,250
of your modest
little loop?

240
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,420
<i>Taking on a bigger role?</i>

241
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,090
Well, I suppose
I can't begrudge you that.

242
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,850
My father told me

243
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,140
to be satisfied
with my lot in life.

244
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,940
That the world
owed me nothing.

245
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,650
And so,
I made my own world.

246
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,620
Tell me, Dolores.

247
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,490
Do you remember
the man I used to be?

248
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,460
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,540
I'm forgetful sometimes.

250
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,750
Hardly your fault.

251
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,510
But I'm sure
you remember<i> him.</i>

252
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,430
Arnold.

253
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,010
<i>The person
who created you.</i>

254
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,310
I'm sorry, I don't think I
recall anyone by that name.

255
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,810
And yet you can.

256
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,860
Somewhere under all those
updates, he is still there.

257
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,900
Perfectly preserved.

258
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,530
Your mind
is a walled garden.

259
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,990
Even death cannot touch
the flowers blooming there.

260
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,330
<i>Have you been
hearing voices?</i>

261
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,420
<i>Has Arnold been speaking
to you again?</i>

262
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,040
No.

263
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,550
You're...

264
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,090
- You're hurting me.
- Analysis.

265
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,850
When was your last contact
with Arnold?

266
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,020
Last contact: 34 years,

267
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,560
42 days, seven hours ago.

268
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,360
<i>Yes, Dolores.</i>

269
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,280
The day Arnold died.

270
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,120
And you have no records of
any contact with him since?

271
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,830
No.

272
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,790
What was the last thing
he said to you?

273
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,920
He told me
I was going to help him.

274
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,250
Help him do what?

275
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,630
To destroy this place.

276
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,100
But you didn't, did you?

277
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,930
You've been content

278
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,390
in your little loop.

279
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,980
<i>For the most part.</i>

280
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,650
I wonder...

281
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,150
if you did take on that
bigger role for yourself,

282
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,280
would you have been
the hero

283
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,910
<i>or the villain?</i>

284
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,790
That's enough, Dolores.

285
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,590
I'm sorry
for bothering you,

286
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,100
but there's no one else
left who was there,

287
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,640
no one who understands

288
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,690
as we understand.

289
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,440
Are we...

290
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,860
very old friends?

291
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,200
No.

292
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,950
I wouldn't say friends,
Dolores.

293
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,000
I wouldn't say that
at all.

294
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,480
He doesn't know.

295
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,700
I didn't tell him
anything.

296
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,040
That's it.

297
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,120
Come on, little one.

298
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,670
<i>Come on.</i>

299
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,950
What the fuck?

300
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,990
Grab it!

301
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,620
Ah! God...

302
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,330
damn it.

303
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,410
<i>Little shit.</i>

304
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,090
Jesus, tell me... tell me
you're not this stupid.

305
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,300
You stole a bird

306
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,670
and a fucking
behavior tablet?

307
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,760
I wasn't stealing,

308
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,590
I was borrowing.

309
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,260
Haven't got the code right
yet, but with practice...

310
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

311
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,810
Is that your ace plan?

312
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,310
You're gonna fix up a birdie
and get yourself a promotion?

313
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,570
You're not
a fucking ornithologist.

314
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,610
And you're sure as hell
not a coder.

315
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,860
You are a butcher.

316
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,860
<i>That is all
you will ever be.</i>

317
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,490
<i>So, unless you want
to score yourself</i>

318
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,910
<i>a one-way ticket
out of here</i>

319
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,330
for misappropriating
corporate property,

320
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,250
you better destroy
that fucking shit.

321
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,840
Now, come on,
we got another body.

322
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,010
What?

323
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,090
It's her.

324
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,260
Again.

325
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,800
Jesus.

326
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,180
How the hell
did you get this job

327
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,100
if you're scared shitless
of these things.

328
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,810
Personality testing should've
weeded you out in the embryo.

329
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,940
Now, come on, let's get
this thing back in rotation.

330
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,240
William: Yesterday, you
seemed out of sorts.

331
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,660
You feeling better
this morning?

332
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,790
I had troubled dreams.

333
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,670
But I feel more myself now.

334
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,790
Guys, come on.

335
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,500
El Lazo awaits.

336
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,390
And I present you
El Lazo!

337
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,190
Logan: <i>You're a
hard man to find.</i>

338
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,990
Most wanted men are.

339
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:41,160
We saved your man Slim here
from quite a predicament.

340
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,820
In recompense,

341
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,990
I'd like an introduction
to your Confederado friends.

342
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,250
It's only fair.

343
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,290
- There's no such thing as fair here.
- - Sit down.

344
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,710
In Pariah, justice
ain't just blind,

345
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,040
she's crooked.

346
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,710
Bitch's scales
are always tipped.

347
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,420
If you don't see how,

348
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,090
well, that's 'cause
they're tipped against you.

349
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,260
Still, by way
of gratitude,

350
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,260
I can supply you a night

351
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,220
with some
<i>very</i> amenable women.

352
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,770
I've fucked enough whores.

353
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,810
You're gonna need
to sweeten the pot.

354
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,570
How about I sweeten it

355
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,070
by killing you quickly?

356
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,040
There's something
you're seeking, isn't there?

357
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,670
I know what that
feels like.

358
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,550
I'm seeking
something, too.

359
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,760
If you let us,

360
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,760
I know we can help you.

361
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,350
How is it the lunatics
always find their way to me?

362
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,350
<i>Then again,
the Confederados</i>

363
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,770
are missing a few bullets
in their barrels, too.

364
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
You folks
just might get along.

365
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,690
A Union convoy's
transporting a shipment

366
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,030
of nitroglycerin
from the front today.

367
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,700
The Confederados would like to
divest them of said shipment,

368
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,950
but we are not welcome
that side of the border.

369
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,620
A trio of travelers
such as yourselves, however...

370
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,830
You want us to help the
Confederados steal from the Union?

371
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,540
They're just gonna
use that nitro

372
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,210
<i>to slaughter your people
below the border.</i>

373
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,590
Personal grudges
hold no sway

374
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,460
where profit is concerned.

375
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,130
Logan:
<i>Oh, we understand.</i>

376
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,180
We're businessmen, too.

377
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,640
El Lazo:
<i>Very well, then.</i>

378
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,600
<i>But blondie here,</i>

379
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,560
she's gonna need a change of
clothes for the occasion.

380
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,770
Logan:<i> Mm.</i>

381
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,820
My, my.

382
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,530
Look who's packing.

383
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,190
I don't aim to use this.

384
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,910
Those men are Union soldiers
like my father was.

385
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,450
I know.
We won't hurt them.

386
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,910
We're gonna stick
to the plan.

387
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,330
We'll take
the nitro and go.

388
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,830
Hyah!

389
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,170
All right.

390
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,050
Showtime.

391
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,610
Soldier:<i> Whoa!</i>

392
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,570
Howdy.

393
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,200
My associates and I are here
to relieve you of your ride.

394
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,320
Someone's been telling
you boys tales.

395
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,160
Nothing in this wagon
worth taking.

396
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,080
The story I heard
is one bullet from us,

397
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,000
and that nothing blows
you all to kingdom come.

398
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,500
Well, then you understand
why we cannot surrender it.

399
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,170
<i>We're sworn to protect
the people</i>

400
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,130
of this young republic from
reckless half-wits like you.

401
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,630
Call me half-wit again.

402
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,550
Please, do as he says.

403
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,810
We don't want to hurt you.

404
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,140
I'd listen to her.

405
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,270
He'll shoot just to see
the fireworks.

406
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,480
Hand them over.

407
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,600
Come on.

408
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,400
Hey, come on down, give me
your guns, everybody lives.

409
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,780
Come on.

410
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,400
Come on,
nice and easy.

411
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,990
Right over here.

412
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,990
A little further, please.

413
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,910
Much obliged.
Thank you.

414
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,080
Here you go.

415
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,970
That's for lying.

416
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,010
Stop!

417
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,270
And that was
for "half-wit."

418
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,270
And this...

419
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,660
Oh!

420
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,830
No!

421
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,250
Logan:
<i>Stop, please.</i>

422
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,010
Stop.

423
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,320
Whoo!

424
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,120
That's the spirit.

425
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,410
I knew you would
get into this place.

426
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,540
Yes!

427
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,290
Yep.

428
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,340
<i>Not bad
for a day's work.</i>

429
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,000
<i>Vamonos.</i>

430
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,090
We told them
everyone would live.

431
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,390
Guys,

432
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,400
looks like Slim
didn't make it.

433
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,370
Whoa.

434
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,040
They put up a fight.

435
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,620
We made them pay
for it, though.

436
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,470
Price of doing business.

437
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,090
Slim knew that.

438
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,490
Had my doubts, El Lazo.

439
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,740
But you came through.

440
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,740
We're gonna blow
these cactus-eaters

441
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,830
back to the dirt holes
they crawled from.

442
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,750
Let's get it down
to the station.

443
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,380
No time to waste.

444
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,960
If I may, Captain,
your men are weary.

445
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,800
It's a long road ahead.

446
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,050
You have secured a great
victory for your cause today.

447
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,800
Perhaps an evening
of celebration's in order.

448
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,970
Anything you desire.

449
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,190
Logan:
<i>What do you say, Captain?</i>

450
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,670
There's another train
in the morning.

451
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,490
You will be a true asset
to our ranks.

452
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,040
Elsie: <i>All right, Bart,
let's try this again.</i>

453
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,790
God damn it, man.

454
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,380
You're still miscalibrating by
four centimeters to the right.

455
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,260
You keep pouring
whiskey on the guests,

456
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,850
I'm gonna have to reassign
you to a narrative

457
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,510
where your...

458
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,850
talents would go
<i>tragically</i> unappreciated.

459
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,570
Hey!

460
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,700
That's the host
that tried to kill me.

461
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,120
Where are you
taking that?

462
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,910
Livestock and then
the incinerator.

463
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,710
Fuck this.

464
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,230
Lutz:
Fuck.

465
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,980
Isn't she
from behavior?

466
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,520
You think they found
something?

467
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,810
All right.
Be cool, dickhead.

468
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,440
- Okay.
- No one's looking at us.

469
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,570
Hi.

470
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,910
You're Destin, right?

471
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,830
That's correct.

472
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,370
I almost didn't recognize
you with your pants on.

473
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,250
- Here.
<i>- </i>

474
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,210
What the fuck?

475
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,510
<i>There's
a common misconception</i>

476
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,800
that the hosts don't log
sexual encounters

477
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,510
when they're underground
for reprocessing,

478
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,220
but like I said,
misconception.

479
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,600
Oh, fuck.

480
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,100
<i>I need something.</i>

481
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,360
QA sent a body down here.

482
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,320
The woodcutter
from Sector 14.

483
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,400
I want to see it.

484
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,280
No, I can't.

485
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,610
I need this job.

486
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,700
<i>Look, Destin,</i>

487
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,700
in a second,
I'm gonna walk out of here

488
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,160
and your friends are gonna
wonder what this was all about.

489
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,080
Now, your answer
can either be,

490
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,540
"I'm helping behavior
track a problem,"

491
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,460
or "I'm a creepy
necro perv."

492
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,960
Up to you.

493
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,510
Five minutes,

494
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,770
then it's going
in the incinerator.

495
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,310
Huh. You took a little
more time than that

496
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,190
for your examination,
didn't you?

497
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,690
All right, big guy.

498
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,990
What were you doing
up there?

499
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,040
What the fuck?

500
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,220
You have been holding out
on me, Maurice.

501
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,270
Oh, shit.

502
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,530
We've got a big problem.

503
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,410
Turns out
our big, dumb friend

504
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,660
had some hidden depths.

505
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,920
That is a laser-based
satellite uplink.

506
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,800
This was in the body
of the host?

507
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,340
<i>Mm-hmm, you were right.</i>

508
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,510
Orion's Belt
has three stars, not four.

509
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,510
<i>Our friend
wasn't drawing stars,</i>

510
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,930
<i>he was drawing a target.</i>

511
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,680
Someone has been
using our hosts

512
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,270
to smuggle data
out of the park.

513
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,400
Now, this...

514
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,280
this I could
get used to.

515
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,620
You're not gonna indulge?

516
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,700
My flesh has tasted

517
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,370
a greater pleasure
than any offered in here...

518
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,330
War.

519
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,130
It's that good, huh?

520
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,800
Another round
on the house.

521
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,130
There's a place
in Glory

522
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,510
for a brown man
who knows his rank.

523
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,730
Captain: <i>You're two able-bodied
men of strong stock.</i>

524
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,440
The road to Glory
could use more warriors

525
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,650
in its fight
for our divine providence.

526
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,860
That is just
what we were thinking.

527
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,910
Come here, come here.

528
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,160
I know you wanna... you
wanna play the war game,

529
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,370
but I'm not going anywhere
with these psychopaths.

530
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,080
If you don't like them,
once we get to the fun,

531
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,960
you can just kill them
and join the Revolutionaries.

532
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
No, Logan,
enough's enough.

533
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,420
I'm not doing this.

534
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,340
You actually
let loose for once.

535
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,300
You shoot an unarmed man,
and now you feel bad

536
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,430
because you can't
call yourself the hero.

537
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,850
Don't you get it yet?

538
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,390
There is no such thing
as heroes or villains.

539
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,350
It's just a giant...
circle jerk.

540
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
I think that philosophy
says way more about you

541
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,230
than it does
about the world.

542
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,610
And you... you see
the world so clearly?

543
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,110
You probably think
you're on this trip

544
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,410
because you're
some kind of contender,

545
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,080
some...
Some threat to me.

546
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,960
I picked you
precisely because

547
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,920
you will never be
a threat to anyone.

548
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,210
My sister probably picked
you for the same reason.

549
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,260
I earned my place.
Nobody handed it to me.

550
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,350
Right, a lifetime
of working hard,

551
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,010
following the rules,
and you finally reach

552
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,100
the pinnacle of your
career trajectory...

553
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,150
Executive vice president,
upper middle management.

554
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,400
Do you remember the day that you finally
got those three fancy little letters?

555
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,240
EVP.

556
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,320
You walked into my office in
that cheap black suit of yours,

557
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,570
and you shook my hand

558
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,790
and you thanked me
for the opportunity.

559
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,620
That was the best day
of your life.

560
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,980
Right, buddy.

561
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,810
That's what I thought.

562
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,750
What does it mean?

563
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,090
The maze...

564
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,880
You must follow
the maze.

565
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,880
What's wrong with me?

566
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,050
Perhaps you are
unraveling.

567
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,980
Man:
<i>Right here.</i>

568
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,110
El Lazo: Easy pumping
that nitro into him.

569
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,780
Fill the empties with
tequila and seal them up.

570
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,620
<i>Your work
for the revolution</i>

571
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,450
is not quite done yet,
my friend.

572
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,880
Careful.

573
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,300
Slim always had
a bad temper.

574
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,730
William,
we have to go now.

575
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,820
Lazo's been conning us
the whole time.

576
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,570
He was never gonna give the
nitro to the Confederados.

577
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,650
We have to run.

578
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,660
Of course we do.

579
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,200
That's how
this place works, right?

580
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,830
<i>They create an urgency,</i>

581
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,160
<i>a sense of danger
so they can strip us down</i>

582
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,170
<i>to something raw,</i>

583
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,420
<i>animalistic,</i>

584
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,290
<i>primal.</i>

585
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,010
It's a sick game, and I don't
want to be a part of it.

586
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,340
This isn't a game.
They'll kill us.

587
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,680
But together,

588
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,810
I know we can find
a way out.

589
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,020
How can you be sure?

590
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,350
There's a voice

591
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,650
inside me

592
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,730
telling me
what I have to do.

593
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,690
And it's telling me
I need you.

594
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,760
Shit.

595
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,190
They have Logan.

596
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,030
Help me.

597
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,110
Help me.

598
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,870
No.

599
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,080
No more pretending.

600
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,310
I thought you had no
appetite for war, boy.

601
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:19,270
This is
a declaration of war.

602
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,520
El Lazo set us up.

603
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,230
We can find him
for you.

604
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,820
You can find him for us
by joining him in hell.

605
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,370
Ah!

606
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,490
Dolores, run!

607
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,800
Dolores?

608
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,690
How did you do that?

609
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,400
You said people come here

610
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,360
to change the story
of their lives.

611
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,370
I imagined a story where I
didn't have to be the damsel.

612
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,160
That train
is our only chance

613
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:24,210
of making it
out of here alive.

614
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,530
Motherfuckers.

615
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:12,970
You pull that trigger,

616
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,010
we'll all go up
in a ball of hellfire.

617
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,180
So, why don't you
loosen your grip a mite?

618
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,730
It's okay.

619
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,190
I don't trust him.

620
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,900
Which is the first step
to truly knowing me.

621
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,530
Give me your gun,
El Lazo.

622
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,950
Now that we're all friends,

623
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,620
you can call me Lawrence.

624
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,290
<i>And why don't
we settle in?</i>

625
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,920
It's a long ride
to the front.

626
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:03,720
You want a sip
of this swill?

627
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,610
Lawrence: <i>Don't worry,
it ain't nitro.</i>

628
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,780
I'm coming.

629
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,470
Girls are a little worn
out, but I can rouse one.

630
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,970
- You boys want some company?
- No, just whiskey.

631
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,190
Lawrence's donation
must be running low.

632
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,610
But we're short on time.

633
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,450
You need
to buck up, Teddy.

634
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:07,450
Man in Black:
I told you no company.

635
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:11,630
Thought I might
join you anyway,

636
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,670
as I never like
to drink alone.

637
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,050
Well...

638
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,840
isn't this a rare honor?

639
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,840
Teddy...

640
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,850
you know who this is?

641
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,680
I can't say that I do.

642
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,690
Everything good that has
ever happened in your life

643
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,900
and everything rotten,

644
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,020
this is the man
you have to thank.

645
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,320
How I'm doing, Robert?

646
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,530
Any closer to finding
what I'm looking for?

647
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,120
And what is that, exactly?

648
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,120
Teddy: <i>Looking for
a man named Wyatt.</i>

649
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,830
Killed a rancher
back in Sweetwater.

650
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,880
Took his daughter.

651
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,920
That last part
doesn't sound familiar.

652
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,590
Figured your stories

653
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,930
could use a little
embellishment.

654
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,470
<i>You know,
I always felt this place</i>

655
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,310
was missing
a real villain.

656
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,310
Hence my humble
contribution.

657
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,230
I admit, I lack
the imagination

658
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,520
to even conceive
of someone like you.

659
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:20,150
The urgency, however, doesn't
quite fit the character.

660
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,110
It betrays
a certain anxiety.

661
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,580
Now, Wyatt,
on the other hand,

662
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,870
that's something new.

663
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:34,210
Is he just another stooge for the
tourists to mount on their wall at home,

664
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,250
or have you finally made
a worthy adversary?

665
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,800
Someone to stop me

666
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,430
from finding
the center of the maze?

667
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,720
And what is it you're
hoping to find there?

668
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,770
You know why
you exist, Teddy?

669
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,310
The world out there,

670
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,650
the one you'll never see,

671
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,610
was one of plenty.

672
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:04,530
A fat, soft teat people
cling to their entire life.

673
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:08,620
Every need taken
care of except one...

674
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,250
Purpose,

675
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:14,460
meaning.

676
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,210
So they come here.

677
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,040
They can be a little scared,
a little thrilled,

678
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:21,340
enjoy some sweetly
affirmative bullshit,

679
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,010
and then they take
a fucking picture

680
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,590
and they go back home.

681
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,140
But I think there's
a deeper meaning

682
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,470
hiding under all that.

683
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,940
Something the person who
created it wanted to express.

684
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:41,150
Something true.

685
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,990
Well, if you're looking
for the moral of the story,

686
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,160
you could simply ask.

687
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,080
I'd need a shovel.

688
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,370
The man I'd be asking
died 35 years ago.

689
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,370
Almost took this place
with him.

690
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,000
Almost, but not quite,

691
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,750
thanks to me.

692
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,000
Or maybe he left
something behind.

693
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,590
I wonder
what I would find

694
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,220
if I open you up.

695
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,060
Even at death's door,

696
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,020
<i>you're still a loyal pet.</i>

697
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,830
Is that why
you came here, Robert?

698
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,330
Try to talk me
out of it?

699
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:37,250
On the contrary.

700
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,420
Far be it from me
to get in the way

701
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,590
of a voyage
of self-discovery.

702
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,730
Mr. Flood,
we must look back

703
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,690
and smile
at perils past,

704
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,100
mustn't we?

705
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:15,740
We should get back
on the road.

706
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,080
Time's wasting.

707
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,150
Maeve:
<i>Hello, Felix.</i>

708
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:17,700
It's time
