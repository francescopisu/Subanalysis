1
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,967
You must be hungry.

2
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,803
You're not gonna cook, are you?

3
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,058
Just saying, don't trouble yourself.

4
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,274
How about some
Egg Beaters and Tabasco?

5
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,109
That's fine.

6
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,779
Didn't I tell you I hate this
shouting-between-rooms shit?

7
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,449
So? You even gonna look
at the brochure?

8
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,915
- What is it, Sneakers or something?
- Sandals.

9
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,169
It's the jewel of Antigua.

10
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,963
Three sun-filled days on white sand.

11
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,174
I got A.J. on weekends.

12
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,011
So we'll go on Monday.
Get a great rate on an ocean view.

13
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,681
The air is the same temperature
as your body...

14
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,435
...so you don't need to wear clothes.
I gotta watch my skin in the sun.

15
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,439
You know, you're getting a divorce,
and I see you less than before.

16
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,566
I didn't say no.

17
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,110
I just want your undivided attention
for once.

18
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,405
Is it so much to fucking ask
for a little bit of atten...?

19
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,035
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

20
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,707
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

21
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,792
- Oh, my God!
- I got you. All right. Okay.

22
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,794
I got it. It's out. It's out.

23
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,715
I got it. You're okay. You're okay.

24
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,345
There he is.

25
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:46,141
- Hey, kid, it's good to see you.
- You finally made the trip out here, huh?

26
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,395
- Tony, this is my oldest, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you.

27
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,652
Walk with me.

28
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,332
- Well?
- You in that suit.

29
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,126
Long way, huh?

30
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,129
He lucked out. Got his mother's looks.

31
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,423
Takes after her, too.

32
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,551
He's in architectural salvage.

33
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,221
Old fixtures, windows, toilets.

34
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,722
Like Sanford and Son?

35
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,349
Didn't I tell you he's quick?

36
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,726
Good for you, Charlie.

37
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,358
And this is some more
for the Joey Peeps thing.

38
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,527
Not all of it.

39
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,488
He's okay.

40
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,908
- Jesus, I did a clean job.
- Fuck it. It's embarrassing.

41
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:50,163
That's the way Little Carmine and Rusty
are doing things there now. I'm sorry.

42
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,916
But Rusty, I think he bangs
his wife in installments.

43
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,924
This guy was my old man,
my rabbi and my priest rolled into one.

44
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,926
Even though I don't miss a day of it...

45
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,095
...the parts with this fireplug
were the best.

46
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,889
Get the fuck out of here.

47
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,768
Oh, I almost forgot.

48
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,194
Spoke to me on account
of your sense of humor.

49
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,325
I'm putting this in a position
of prominence.

50
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,436
Hey. How you doing?

51
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,858
Are you gonna operate on me?

52
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,403
No, it's me, Tony.

53
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,447
They gotta fight infection, that's all.

54
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:10,243
- My hair.
- Well, the good news is it'll grow back.

55
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,163
The burns are second-degree,
so you don't need a skin graft...

56
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,332
...or that hyperbolic chamber.

57
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,293
You're gonna look the same
as you always did.

58
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,420
Fuck you.

59
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,757
All right, one second.

60
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,467
- All right.
- It hurts.

61
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,427
Okay, sit tight. Rest.

62
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,264
They gotta keep you in here a couple
days so it don't get no bacteria in it.

63
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,351
Are you gonna operate on me?

64
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,562
I'm gonna take care of everything.

65
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,276
The doctor bills, a wig, whatever.

66
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,654
Don't worry about nothing.

67
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,740
- Okay? Okay.
- Okay.

68
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,284
I gotta go.

69
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,423
Just put it in there.

70
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,972
I'm gonna get some twine.

71
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,558
- Forget it, I'm not going that far.
- All right.

72
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,903
I know, I know, you fucking...
Come on.

73
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,531
Let's go, move on.

74
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,252
Fucking great.

75
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,552
Listen, I don't know what the fuck
you were looking at...

76
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,346
- Fuck is this?
- Ange.

77
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,806
Sorry about that.

78
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,809
We were on our way to your place,
and Billy sees you drive by.

79
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,811
I tried to get your attention for blocks.

80
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,481
Why didn't you use the fucking phone?
I'm an old man.

81
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,399
I don't see so good in the dark.

82
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,444
Jesus, relax.
Johnny wants to see you.

83
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,738
This late?
Tell him I'll see him tomorrow.

84
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,658
Apparently it's gotta be now.
You know, he's in one of his moods.

85
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,666
- Fine. I'll follow you over.
- Whatever. Let's go.

86
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,765
Don't!

87
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,941
Hey! Jesus, don't!

88
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,277
Phil, please.
Philly, Philly, you know me.

89
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,112
- Philly.
- You couldn't fucking retire?

90
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,906
Philly, for God's sake, you know me!

91
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,206
Look at this shit.

92
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,375
You know the work I just had?

93
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,752
Give me the fucking keys.

94
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,806
Mirsa, you seen today's paper?

95
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,601
Everything in the kitchen, Mr. Tony.

96
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,826
God-fucking-damn it.

97
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,373
- You know this is today's paper?
- Oh, no.

98
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,750
This is today's paper, Mirsa.

99
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,336
That's I'm thinking.

100
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,131
- Why'd you throw it away?
- Oh, no.

101
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,509
Jesus Christ, forget it.

102
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,679
I bake you some enchiladas you like.

103
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,348
Thank you. That's nice of you.

104
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:24,372
- These are for you. Enchiladas.
- Okay.

105
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,084
I came for my money.

106
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,505
Don't worry, I'll talk to Carlo
and tell him why...

107
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,674
...you're kicking up
directly to me this week.

108
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,303
I gotta be careful getting in my cash
on account of the Carmela situation.

109
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,138
She's all over that.

110
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:44,434
- You buying that WaveRunner?
- No, I'm moving to the Plaza.

111
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,562
My fucking house is falling down
around my ears.

112
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,731
Well, we did good at the casino
last night.

113
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,859
I seriously dread going home.
That fucking Guatemalan.

114
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,362
She forgets her English
when it suits her purposes...

115
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,948
...and then she shows up whenever she
feels like with the fucking enchiladas.

116
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,618
So fire her ass. Get a new one.

117
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,287
This is the new one.

118
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,923
I've been in the burn ward
a couple of nights with Valentina.

119
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,759
Poor thing caught herself on fire.

120
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,388
No shit?

121
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:25,934
She's laying there like a rag doll,
the poor kid.

122
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,270
That smell. Fuck, that burning-hair smell.

123
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,940
Can still smell it.

124
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:38,405
Jesus, you know that's the last thing
Carmine said before he had his stroke?

125
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,073
He smelled burning hair.

126
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,913
You got a Coke or something?

127
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,919
- Ma, can you get Tony a Coke?
- I'm upstairs!

128
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,256
Jason, Justin, get up here.

129
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,095
- You all right?
- Just got the kids up my ass, that's all.

130
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,895
So you come across any burn victims
at that hospital in the can?

131
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,108
Sure, Aryan guys are always setting
each other on fire.

132
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,362
So, what's she in for?
You know, the future, I mean.

133
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,824
They said she don't need no skin grafts.

134
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,619
Seriously, what the fuck is with you?

135
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,204
I just told you.

136
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:37,630
You know, the tough part is
this girl is a constant pain in my ass.

137
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,133
I was gonna end it right there,
that night.

138
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,761
And now how the fuck is it gonna look?

139
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,722
That is a tough one.

140
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,309
Why the fuck does this shit
always happen to me?

141
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,066
You know who
I been thinking about lately?

142
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,360
Charmaine Bucco.

143
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,862
Nice set on her.

144
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,490
No, not like that.

145
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,160
Well, maybe like that.

146
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,538
But also, she's a fantastic cook.

147
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,710
She's better than Artie in some ways.
Plus, she's a licensed notary public.

148
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,756
I mean, I'm thinking that
this is the kind of woman I need.

149
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,593
And it almost worked between
me and her, right?

150
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,308
Comic books, juice boxes,
robot crap all over the place.

151
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,310
Get your uncle a Coke
and then your stuff.

152
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,604
I'm taking you back
to your mom's early.

153
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,067
I should take off.

154
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,653
Yeah, you know,
I really gotta run them over there now.

155
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,946
All right. Yeah.

156
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,323
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

157
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,911
- I'll come over to the hotel.
- Yeah.

158
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,429
- Lawrence wedding?
- No.

159
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,266
- Long-term or short-term?
- Can't you just park it?

160
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,531
Here. Keep it out of the horse shit
over there, will you?

161
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,123
Oh, yeah. Beautiful, ladies.

162
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,924
Although you'll be paying cash,
we'll need a credit card...

163
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,886
...to secure incidental charges:
minibar, parking, et cetera.

164
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,304
Right.

165
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,225
- Here.
- Thank you.

166
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,397
Oh, Jill, that's so funny.

167
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,816
Very good, Mr. Petraglia.

168
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,695
We have you in a deluxe suite
with a park view.

169
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,363
My name is Sharice...

170
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,741
...and along with our
24-hour concierge service...

171
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,785
...I'm here to see that
you enjoy your stay with us.

172
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,413
- Great.
- The bellman will show you to your room.

173
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,582
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Petraglia.

174
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,760
Anything else I can do,
press nine, ask for Jesús.

175
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,680
- For you.
- Thank you, sir.

176
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,724
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thanks.

177
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,364
Hello?

178
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,950
Hello?

179
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,285
Hello?

180
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,998
Whoever you are,
I'd like you to stop this.

181
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,896
Hmmm

182
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:12,321
Whether it's the Vanderbilt Suite
or an elegant deluxe standard room...

183
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,867
...the Plaza is equipped with
a state-of-the-art safety system...

184
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,535
...and a well-trained staff.

185
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,164
The gentle pleasures and
mysterious ways of the East...

186
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:25,084
...more than the ladies of Jade Escorts.

187
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:30,465
New York's most exotic and erotic girls
are waiting to please you.

188
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:36,304
Call 1-900-555-JADE...

189
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:41,142
...and let them satisfy your every need.

190
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,395
All major credit cards are accepted.

191
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,981
What are you waiting for?

192
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,351
Been trying to reach you.

193
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,269
Angelo got it.

194
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,397
Last night. Probably Phil.

195
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,963
I'm not available right now.

196
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,383
- Don't leave messages on this phone.
- Fuck.

197
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,640
- Hello?
- Who's this?

198
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,351
- It's Dot, who's this?
- It's Tony, looking for Ton.

199
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,521
Oh, he's not here.
He didn't come in tonight at all.

200
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,774
He might be in later, though.
You wanna try his portable phone?

201
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,401
I did.

202
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,654
You see him,
you have him call me immediately.

203
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,823
Okay, will do.

204
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,216
- Hello?
- Yeah, Aunt Quin...

205
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,594
...it's Tony, looking for Ton.

206
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,431
- Madonna, I hoped he was with you.
- You heard from him?

207
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,601
Not since he took the kids back
this morning.

208
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,853
- Call me if you hear, you understand?
- Yeah.

209
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,189
- You got my cell?
- Yeah.

210
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,316
What's wrong?

211
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,073
- Yeah.
- You seen my cousin?

212
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,452
No. But I heard about that thing
last night.

213
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,621
The old-timer was a standup guy.

214
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,207
Yeah, well, that's the least of it.

215
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,043
Hold on. Hold on.

216
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,343
- Hey, you call for a date?
- Yeah, yeah.

217
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,221
- Got company?
- Yeah.

218
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,223
- Hold on a second.
- Can I get a drink?

219
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,099
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,397
- I wanna know the minute he surfaces.
- You got it.

221
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,900
I saw him this morning.
He must have known something.

222
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,070
- He was acting all squirrelly.
- He's got a right to be upset.

223
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,322
After what him and Ange
been through together.

224
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,992
- They were cellmates at Allenwood.
- I don't know, I got a bad feeling.

225
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,955
Don't worry about it.
He ain't that stupid.

226
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,082
Yeah, you're probably right.

227
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,334
We'll let you know if we see him.

228
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,723
You want me to suck your dick now,
baby?

229
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,935
Is that what you want, baby?

230
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,698
What the fuck!

231
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,494
Tony, I'm so lonely.

232
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,747
I miss my Violet.

233
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,334
- What violin?
- Violet, my wife.

234
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,837
She was everything to me.

235
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,508
I'm all alone on the other side.

236
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,719
It ain't right.

237
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,603
Answer the fucking thing.

238
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,320
If it's him, tell him you ain't seen me.

239
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,074
- Tell who?
- The man upstairs.

240
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,877
- Hello.
- We need you to do something.

241
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,718
Like what?

242
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,347
Our friend. He's gotta go.

243
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,725
No problem.

244
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,896
- Don't fuck it up, it's important.
- I know it's important.

245
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,656
He was staring straight at me.

246
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,617
But he didn't look dead.

247
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,995
Any deader than he ever did, anyways.

248
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:01,879
And he says, "I miss my wife."

249
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,341
Then the phone rings...

250
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,552
...and there was this voice.

251
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,349
- They wanted me to do something.
- What?

252
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,270
They wanted me to kill a guy.

253
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,357
It was just a dream, all right?

254
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,779
He must be in heaven.
He said "the other side."

255
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,782
But it was so fucking sad.

256
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,910
Doesn't sound like heaven to me.

257
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,538
Well, you would know more
about it than I do.

258
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,044
What'd you see in me, anyways?

259
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,465
The object is to learn what
you saw in me, not what I saw in you.

260
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,844
One of these days, Alice.
One of these days.

261
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,138
Pow, right in the kisser?

262
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,889
To the moon, Alice!

263
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,768
I remember when you hit me,
it was like, pow, to the moon.

264
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,520
Don't get me steamed, Alice.

265
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,772
And then you choked
the shit out of me!

266
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,151
Yeah, but that's after you were trying
to put a fork in my eye.

267
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,278
No, that was your mother!

268
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,081
Sometimes what happens here
is like taking a shit.

269
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,001
I prefer to think of it as
more like childbirth.

270
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,504
Maybe it is more like childbirth.

271
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,590
You tell me.

272
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,093
I don't have any children.

273
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,890
I died too young.

274
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,732
My cousin does a mean Gleason.

275
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,869
Are you ready
for what you have to do?

276
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,831
No sweat. I did my homework.

277
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,609
- You wanna ride up front?
- No, Dad, I'm fine.

278
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,280
Kid gets sick in the back seat.

279
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,915
You know, douche bag,
I realize I'm dreaming.

280
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,835
I got no opinion one way or the other.

281
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,047
Anybody mind?

282
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,135
What?

283
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,058
Where we going?

284
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,646
Driving you to the job.

285
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,547
Oh, Jesus, you scared me.

286
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,384
And you're not even ready.
We gotta meet Finn's parents.

287
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,219
Why didn't you wake me up?

288
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,804
Is that how you're gonna dress?

289
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,015
My stuff isn't here.

290
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,142
Well, you left your brown suit.

291
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,935
I did?

292
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,939
And we're late.

293
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,358
I had the worst fucking dream.

294
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,986
Tony, we're late.
And we should take separate cars.

295
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,155
Oh, yeah.

296
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,616
Howdy.

297
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,661
You were riding out here the other day,
weren't you?

298
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,206
You speak English?

299
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,671
- Tony.
- What? Give me a minute.

300
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,465
Can you pull yourself away for once?

301
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,300
Your head is filled with this stuff.

302
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,969
It's just that it's...

303
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,096
...so much more interesting.

304
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,598
Than what?

305
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,558
Than life.

306
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,102
What, are you kidding me?
It is your life.

307
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,316
Good morning, señor.

308
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,278
Tell me, what day is it?

309
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,281
What day?
Why, it's Christmas Day, of course, sir.

310
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:43,744
Christmas Day? Christmas...?
Then I haven't missed it.

311
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,622
The spirits must have
done everything in one night.

312
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,792
- Of course.
- Will you please get dressed?

313
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,044
Of course they can.

314
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,309
Look at you.

315
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,063
All right, let's go.

316
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,902
I'll wait in the car.

317
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,533
I'll wait in the car.

318
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,870
Now what's the matter?

319
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,455
Nothing.

320
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,506
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

321
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,887
Hi. How are you both?

322
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,741
There you are.
I was getting so nervous.

323
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,492
Hey, babe.

324
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,661
We were about to start
calling the hospitals.

325
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,747
Somebody forgot.

326
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:13,542
I'd like you to meet Finn's parents,
Mr. DeTrolio, Mrs. DeTrolio.

327
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,544
- How do you do?
- Hi, how are you?

328
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,046
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

329
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,136
We've been enjoying getting to know
your daughter while we were waiting.

330
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,892
So how's the food here?

331
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,393
It's pretty good.

332
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,396
We went to high school
with the owner and his wife.

333
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,899
You two were
high school sweethearts?

334
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,282
So how long can you stay?

335
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,284
Something I have to take care of.

336
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,619
Ohhh

337
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,913
Show them what you have
in your pocket.

338
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,508
With a husband in dental school,
he'll be able to fix your mouth, honey.

339
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,760
Then, for the capper...

340
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,934
Son of a bitch.

341
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,814
We know all about you,
and I think it's great.

342
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,816
Well, that's a relief, huh, Tony?

343
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,275
Speaking of dental school...

344
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,153
...people always told us Finn
would never amount to much.

345
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,823
He won't. I think the die is cast.

346
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,034
Yeah, if it wasn't for his tooth-fairy
money, he'd have nothing.

347
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,328
Let's not get into it in front
of other people.

348
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,747
- Well, you're the one that said...
- Never mind.

349
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,916
Please, just drop it.

350
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:43,131
- Meadow, do you play an instrument?
- I was in chamber singers.

351
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,759
I used to sing in the Navy Glee Club.

352
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,294
You're Annette Bening.

353
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,087
I thought so.

354
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,247
What?

355
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,710
Something bad is gonna happen.

356
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,563
Well...

357
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,151
After I sing,
I can usually use a nice tinkle.

358
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,611
I'll go with you.

359
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,656
I don't want my husband coming out
with just his cock in his hand.

360
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,741
Mine either, believe me.

361
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,764
Oh, that feels good.

362
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,976
You don't do this no more, huh?

363
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,811
No.

364
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,775
Got a good boy out there.

365
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,152
You gonna be able
to come through on the thing?

366
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,781
I did my homework.

367
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,202
Yeah?

368
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,123
Well, the piece wasn't behind the toilet.

369
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,542
- Well, this is real life.
- No, it's not.

370
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,795
This is it.

371
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,093
No! Stop!

372
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,561
I knew this was gonna happen.

373
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,063
Why didn't you stop him?

374
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,333
Please.

375
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,341
You have any idea what you just did?

376
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,677
Tell them what happened 20 years ago.

377
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,929
I can't go into that right now.

378
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,228
What do I gotta count to
before I can get up?

379
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,773
- Tony?
- You're really dead.

380
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,941
But I got kids.

381
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,359
They got kids.

382
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,867
Yo, wasn't that Tony there...

383
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,995
...the guy you were supposed to cap
to prevent this from happening?

384
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,247
I don't know.

385
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,167
I guess not.

386
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,003
I don't have a piece.

387
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,299
Annette Bening?

388
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,718
There's something Bugsy about him.

389
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,032
Get him!

390
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,549
Over here.

391
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,938
I'm wiped out.

392
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,699
The fuck you doing to yourself?

393
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,413
What's that noise?

394
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,541
It's those micks outside the hotel
with those carriage rides.

395
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,419
- Tell them to go away.
- Oh, God, Tony.

396
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,546
It's so much better
than when we were kids.

397
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,965
- See, what'd I tell you? The best, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

398
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,759
She likes it when you rub her muzzle.

399
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,729
Think I wanna come home.

400
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,023
There are some
nonnegotiable conditions.

401
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,734
- Like what?
- You can't have your horse in here.

402
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,611
- Why not?
- Are you kidding me?

403
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,155
The smell, and shit all over the place.

404
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,740
I'll clean up after her.

405
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,158
You always say that.

406
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,121
I'll have to think about it.

407
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,123
You're the one brought it up.

408
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,793
I should go.

409
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,755
You didn't take care of that?

410
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,050
What?

411
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,594
Check this out.

412
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,473
Be careful.

413
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,669
I know you're there, Soprano.

414
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,261
Well, come on.
You're gonna do it, do it.

415
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,442
- Well, look at you.
- How you doing, Coach Molinaro?

416
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,736
Me, I'm fine.

417
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,279
What's that you got there?

418
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,740
A bigger dingus
than the one God gave you?

419
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,869
You dumb-ass.

420
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,914
You know, you ought to show
some respect.

421
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,085
- Why?
- Because I'm not some kid anymore.

422
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,628
No.

423
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,342
What did I tell you?

424
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,178
"Cleave yourself away from them bums
you hang with," I said.

425
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,514
Well, I'm in therapy now.

426
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,934
That's a damn shame.

427
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,813
You all listened
to that pismire Arthur Bucco.

428
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,273
He was the worst of the bunch.
I told you that.

429
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,650
Artie owns a restaurant.

430
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,111
- He's doing great.
- Bucco?

431
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,445
Yeah.

432
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,364
The exception that proves the rule.

433
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,199
Oh, you know everything, don't you?

434
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:15,453
I suppose you blame your father when
you're crying to that shrink of yours.

435
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,747
No, more my mother.

436
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,959
Of course. Even better.

437
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,129
Well, my family was different
than other kids' families.

438
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,590
You know, I'll bet you got that
psychologist wrapped around your finger.

439
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,218
That's what you always told me
I was good at, right?

440
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,346
I also told you, most likely...

441
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,849
...you'd take the easy way out.

442
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,103
It hasn't been easy.

443
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,730
I see you on TV.

444
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,524
Oh, yeah?

445
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,109
Some show you put on.

446
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,653
The 5:00 news.

447
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,489
Then you realize I got nothing
to apologize to you for.

448
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,158
Eighteen, 20, 22...

449
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,285
I am a leader.

450
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,620
Got a house worth a million two.

451
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,664
Two kids, wife.

452
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,083
- Twenty-eight... Do you?
- Do I what?

453
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,751
- Have a wife?
- Yeah.

454
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,754
She's got the big house
because I'm successful.

455
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,632
You and I know your little secret.

456
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,844
I only told you I wanted to be a coach
because I liked playing ball.

457
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,513
But I was just shining you on,
because that's what I do.

458
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:19,350
I told you many times, Anthony,
you were special.

459
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,854
You had smarts, personality,
leadership potential.

460
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,024
All the prerequisites to lead young men
onto the field of sport.

461
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,109
And now look at the stress you live with.

462
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,746
You're not prepared!

463
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,632
You'll never shut me up.

464
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,469
Yeah?

465
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,138
We're sorry to disturb you
at this hour, Mr. Petraglia...

466
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,140
...but there's a Mr. Mantovani
to see you.

467
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,102
- He says it's urgent.
- Send him up.

468
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,726
Hey.

469
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,399
Sorry to get you up, but I knew
you'd wanna know right away.

470
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,193
Know what?

471
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,487
Tony B. took out Billy Leotardo.

472
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,616
Yeah.

473
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,994
- Wait a minute, you mean Philly.
- Billy. Phil got winged.

474
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,079
He's in the hospital.

475
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,123
T.B. went ape over Angelo.

476
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,001
Phil's holding his brother
as the kid's dying in his arms.

477
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,545
There's blood all over Phil.

478
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,547
Jesus.

479
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,343
So he knew.

480
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,554
Goddamn him.

481
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,265
He knew what he was gonna do...

482
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,268
...and he sat there, right in his
mother's house, and pretended.

483
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,021
Lied right to my face.

484
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,066
I don't know what to say.

485
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,069
Guess T.B.'s fucked, the poor guy.

486
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,238
Poor guy?

487
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,866
We're all fucked.

488
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:26,037
I'm here for you, whatever.

489
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,539
I know that.

490
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,796
Nice suite, T.

491
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:40,259
Anyway, thought you needed to know
right away.

492
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,056
You gonna eat that?

493
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,686
- No, take it.
- Thanks.

494
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:53,064
Right. See you later.

495
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,003
Hello?

496
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,339
Yeah, don't get alarmed.
I'm sorry to call you so early...

497
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,717
...but I gotta cancel the fishing trip.

498
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,469
Tell A.J.

499
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:07,555
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

500
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,563
I had one of my Coach Molinaro dreams.

501
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,319
Oh, yeah?
Were you unprepared, as usual?

502
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,239
Yeah. As usual.

503
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,200
Yeah, Mr. Mol.

504
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,076
I wonder where he is now.

505
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,953
He wasn't such a bad guy.

506
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,998
A bad guy? No.
He actually took an interest in you.

507
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,500
A lot of that was bullshit.

508
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,669
It was just his way of keeping me
from causing trouble.

509
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,671
Make his life easier.

510
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,757
I don't know about that.

511
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,722
I told him in the dream,
I am sort of a coach now.

512
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,143
Yeah, that's a way
of looking at it, I guess.

513
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,901
Is it daylight where you are?

514
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,988
No. Where are you?

515
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,825
Looking out at Central Park.

516
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,746
All the lights are on.

517
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,752
You were in the dream too.

518
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,838
Oh, yeah?

519
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,173
I was on this horse.

520
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,763
Anyway, is Artie all right?

521
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,641
Because in the dream,
he was the only alive guy...

522
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,518
...in this car full of dead guys.

523
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,937
I had dinner over there last night.

524
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,648
Who'd you eat with?

525
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,943
Gab and Ro.

526
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,653
That's nice.

527
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,240
Yeah, it was all right.
The veal was very dry.

528
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,204
Is that Esterhaz next door barking?

529
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,708
- Can you hear him?
- Absolutely.

530
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,502
Five-thirty in the morning.

531
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:06,257
Someone ought to serve
him some veal. À la strychnine.

532
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,553
- Stop it.
- I'm serious.

533
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,556
Is it light where you are yet?
