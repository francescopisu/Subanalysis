1
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,235
Here he is, Mr. Clean.

2
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,240
Want some coffee?

3
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,243
- Where's your dirties?
- I'll get them.

4
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:15,008
- What?
- I don't know, it's...

5
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,679
- It's hard seeing you like this.
- What, working? With a real job?

6
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,351
Like I been telling Feech,
it's been a long, strange trip.

7
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,021
Feech.

8
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,361
Anyway, it's the luck of the draw,
that shit.

9
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,948
Could have just as easily been me
that went away.

10
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,869
Come on, I was gonna be there
that night of the hijack.

11
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,496
Well, it ain't like you came away
totally unscathed.

12
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,542
No, a couple of goons jumped me
and cut my head open.

13
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,295
I couldn't go. Still...

14
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,756
They could have killed you.
You ended up in the ER.

15
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,051
Got 16 stitches. You got 15 years.

16
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,053
You always were a lucky fuck.

17
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,390
Well, that's not completely true.
I got other sorrows in my life.

18
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,393
Like him, for example.

19
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,368
Thanks for lunch.

20
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,080
Stick with me, kid, I'll have you
eating lunch like that every day.

21
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,042
I'm serious about this massage therapy.

22
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,587
Well, you should keep a square job
like that for appearances.

23
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,923
Look at me, with the bakery.

24
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,092
I told my cousin I wanna stay a civilian.

25
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,221
Yes, the boy king.

26
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,599
Can I trust you if I talk to you
frankly about him?

27
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,948
What are you doing?

28
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,533
I gotta make a stop.

29
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,301
The fuck you doing?

30
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,929
- Excuse me?
- What the fuck are you doing?

31
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,764
I'm trimming a lawn.

32
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,308
My nephew does the lawns in
this neighborhood.

33
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,644
I been working this neighborhood
for 26 years.

34
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,229
Are you fucking deaf?

35
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,148
I said, my nephew has this area.
Gary La Manna.

36
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,651
Fuck off. I'm busy here.

37
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,659
You want me to fuck off?

38
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,496
How about I fuck off
all over your stupid fucking face?

39
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,957
You fucking mutt.

40
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,506
Fuck!

41
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,592
You don't work this neighborhood!

42
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:09,308
Jesus Christ, we're on parole.
The fuck you doing?

43
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,442
Anthony said the cable box
has to be on.

44
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,152
It's on, I'm doing it.

45
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,946
Let me tell you,
our glass-house couples...

46
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,865
...could probably
decorate in 24 hours.

47
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,868
They have to. Each week.

48
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,041
Tony's whole life was horses...

49
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,834
- No, it's not her.
- That's Judy!

50
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,210
No, it's not Judy.

51
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,088
- The fuck.
- Yes, it is. Of course it is.

52
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,132
- Why am I on there?
- Holy shit.

53
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,384
- What?
- I've seen Judy, that's Judy!

54
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,886
- No, no, no...
- That's not you.

55
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,680
- Judy has brown eyes.
- What's that? My trial?

56
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,849
- You don't know the eyes.
- I know the eyes...

57
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,851
Come on!
I see my daughter call her Judy!

58
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,729
- Sweet Judy brown eyes...
- That's Bobby.

59
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,939
The fuck is this?

60
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:02,736
Junior, it's not you.
It's a TV program. A movie.

61
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,656
- Judy.
- What?

62
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,915
Ton. He's here.

63
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,259
Tony, hey, thanks for seeing me.

64
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,720
All right?

65
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,726
So you want something?
Coffee? Bialy?

66
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,645
No, I'm good, thanks.

67
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,943
What's on your mind?

68
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,573
Well, honestly,
I'll get right to the point.

69
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,452
As regards your uncle,
because of the promotion and all...

70
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,913
...I kind of thought I'd be
out on the street more.

71
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,125
Staying off the street nowadays
is a good thing, no?

72
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,710
It's a joke.

73
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,879
I know. I mean, I'm not complaining.

74
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,091
It's just, it's over a year and
I'm still picking up prescriptions.

75
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,553
- Well, what do you need, money?
- All I want is a chance to earn.

76
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,515
I mean, I'm happy to do it, it's just 40
minutes I spent at Rite Aid's yesterday...

77
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,309
...getting him some
stool softener that was on sale.

78
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,895
With Jan and the kids to feed now...

79
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,982
How's she doing, anyways?
My sister.

80
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,734
She sleeps a lot. It's hard.

81
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,570
Still with the Epstein-Barr, huh?

82
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,447
It's tough on her. I don't know.

83
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,657
Two kids, a ready-made family.

84
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,453
She's prone to depression, frankly.

85
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,123
I mean, not that I have any regrets.

86
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,251
No, no, of course not. She's a good kid.

87
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,005
Look, Bobby, marriage...

88
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,134
...or any partnership, for that matter,
is a give and a take.

89
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:57,184
All right, look,
I hear what you're saying.

90
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,394
But the truth is I depend on you.

91
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,190
Beppy, Tommy, come on.

92
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,609
You're the only one
I can trust over there.

93
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,528
Believe it or not,
it's important to me that he's cared for.

94
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,870
All right, let me figure out
how to take care of you.

95
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,123
Maybe you could make more
collections or something.

96
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,711
- Thanks, Ton. I appreciate it.
- Yeah, all right.

97
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,423
All right.

98
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:39,309
And Friday, we have fish
if you're Catholic, so that's nice.

99
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,810
Sounds like the Ritz.

100
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,689
You gotta see her, Aunt Mary.
She's the belle of the ball over there.

101
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,943
Here, Ma. Rest those dogs.

102
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,661
Hey, what's going on?
Nobody cutting the lawn?

103
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,081
Oh, Madonna.
Mr. Vitro, the gardener?

104
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,166
Somebody beat him up, broke his arm.

105
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,212
- God forbid.
- Sal Vitro? Who beat him up?

106
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,675
Some men in a Cadillac. He was
mowing a lawn on Kimball Street.

107
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,010
Man said he didn't want him in
the neighborhood.

108
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,638
Poor Sal, what a nice man he is.

109
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,100
He put my garbage cans out
every time he cut my grass.

110
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,770
- What's his name, Aunt Mary?
- Salvatore Vitro.

111
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,772
Ma, the guy that beat him up.

112
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,026
Man came by and said
he was gonna cut the lawns.

113
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,904
I said, no. I want Mr. Vitro.

114
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,782
"E. Gary La Manna Landscaping."

115
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,701
Do you know him?

116
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,704
Eat your scones. I'll straighten it out.

117
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,210
...95.5, WPLJ in Brooklyn.

118
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,591
- Sorry, we're not open.
- What "not open"?

119
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,802
A man in your position turning
away fucking business now?

120
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,971
I didn't know it was you, Lorraine.

121
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,890
Here you go. That's most of it.

122
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,647
Let me ask you a question, Dan.

123
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,400
Say I'm some big nigger
standing here instead of a woman.

124
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,485
You still gonna tell me
you got most of it?

125
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,613
Let's go, chop-chop, pay the woman.

126
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,626
Phil, hey. I was just thinking about you.

127
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,296
- Those Islander tickets, right?
- How about this humidity?

128
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,345
- Hey, guys, please, whatever this is...
- Shut up.

129
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,724
Two times you were told to
kick up to fucking Johnny Sack.

130
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,685
And what do you do?
You kick up to Little Carmine?

131
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,063
- Tape her.
- No! No.

132
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,774
Little Carmine,
he was my father's friend!

133
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,777
Philly! Joey, look. Okay, okay, okay.

134
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,905
You're right, I'm sorry, I'll pay you.
I'll do anything you want.

135
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,991
I'll suck your cock, okay?
All of you guys.

136
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,370
- You'll suck our cocks?
- Yeah.

137
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,706
She any good?

138
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,125
Why am I asking you,
you probably showed her how.

139
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,919
- Shut up.
- Please, guys.

140
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,005
Relax. This will muffle the shot.

141
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,176
Adiós, you fucking skank.

142
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:29,312
Hey, look at this, Joey.
Today's her lucky day.

143
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,231
Only made it to the R's.

144
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,902
Next time, there'll be no next time.

145
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,154
Come on.

146
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,077
Take as long as you like. No rush.

147
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,620
I've got my Times crossword...

148
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,248
...and Agnes here will get you
anything you need.

149
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,083
Thanks, Mel.

150
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,920
So how's it being home, Angelo?
Enjoying living with your daughter?

151
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,427
It's like paradise. I eat like a Pharaoh
and got my own room, cable TV.

152
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,762
- I have cable.
- My grandson.

153
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,765
He asked me, he says, how come
he never met his grandpa before?

154
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,852
I said, "Because Grandpa's been
in Special Forces."

155
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,395
At first, he was afraid of me.

156
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,314
But I said, "Come on, we'll get
ice cream, go to the park...

157
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,150
...it'll be..."
Well, anyway...

158
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,235
...here we all are.
Right.

159
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,071
I called you boys because
Lorraine calls me...

160
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,616
...she said there's a situation in
our family that's gotten out of hand...

161
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,452
...with John and Little Carmine.

162
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,830
This fucking Johnny. He wouldn't even
let the maggots get on Carmine...

163
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,082
...before telling me to
kick up direct to him.

164
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,460
Problem is Carmine never
named a successor.

165
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,295
And we all assumed it'd be Johnny...

166
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,715
...because the son's down in Miami
with the discos and the whatnot.

167
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,635
He's grabbing with both hands, John.
This could get ugly.

168
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,389
There's a lot of potential for bloodshed.

169
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,058
Potential? They almost killed us.

170
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,186
Jason, men are talking here.

171
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,900
Now, you're close to John.
You have any ideas?

172
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,318
Why you asking him for?

173
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,279
He never even had the makings
of a varsity athlete.

174
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,658
Your point being what, Junior?

175
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,995
Oh, no, forget it,
he's just breaking balls.

176
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,627
All right, one thought I had,
in the interest of harmony...

177
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,254
...maybe there could be
a power-sharing situation.

178
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,131
The Sopranos have two bosses.

179
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,966
That's not all it's cracked up to be.

180
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,762
- Believe you me.
- Let's not get into that right now. Okay?

181
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,852
What I was thinking was three bosses,
a "triumvir" thing, like Caesar.

182
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,314
- Little Carmine, Johnny and you.
- I'm retired.

183
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,691
You were Carmine's consigliere
for over 30 years.

184
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,737
If it wasn't for that construction beef
in Yonkers, you'd be running that family.

185
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,950
- Things happen how they happen.
- Think about it.

186
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,662
Doesn't have to be 9 to 5, you could still
take your grandson to the park.

187
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,041
Things get heavy,
you're just another voice to weigh in.

188
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,879
And John still does better financially
than he ever did under Carmine.

189
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,554
There he is. Salvatore, my dolly.

190
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,566
- My aunt told me about it.
- I mean, what did I ever do to this guy?

191
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:24,946
They released these fucks from the can.
Obviously, he wasn't rehabilitated.

192
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,948
It was my livelihood.

193
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,118
I don't have a yard no more, Sally.
I'm in a condo.

194
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,413
Otherwise, you know, I'd have you
out there with your snippers...

195
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,331
...even with your bum wing.

196
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,750
My wife, at this point...

197
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,962
...she's got me thinking about
going to the cops.

198
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,548
What are you talking about?
Where you from?

199
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,386
- I don't know what to do.
- You got friends, don't you?

200
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,555
You know I always
steered clear of stuff.

201
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:55,435
What stuff? I go, I talk to the guy
for you. Get you back your stops.

202
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,228
I know him.

203
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,523
- Yeah?
- So you give me a token.

204
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,859
I don't know, couple percent.

205
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,450
Thanks, Paulie.

206
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,664
This one and the next one.

207
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,176
LA MANNA
BAKERY

208
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,263
There he is, the king of breadsticks.

209
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,475
I'll give you a breadstick up your ass.
Come here, you.

210
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,647
Hey. Come on, sit down.

211
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:49,447
- So how's the kid? Tony.
- He's good, you know.

212
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,533
But ask me,
he should have stood with Carmela.

213
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,079
Some men need wives. Tell you when
to shit and when to scratch your ass.

214
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,873
Who needs them, huh?

215
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,833
What can I do for you, Paul?

216
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,003
I got a guy.
I think you may have run into him.

217
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:08,007
Gardener, name of Sal Vitro.
Does my aunt's grass.

218
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,468
He says your nephew's moving
into his neighborhood.

219
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,887
- Franklin Parkway.
- His neighborhood.

220
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,348
He's been working there since
when I lived there.

221
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,809
Anyway, I'm putting in
a word for the kid.

222
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,854
So do me a favor, huh?
You and your nephew over there, lay off.

223
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,820
- Hey, biscotti?
- No.

224
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,908
You know Mr. Jerry, the fruit,
owns those hair salons?

225
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,368
He came to me the other day.

226
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,996
He asked me to take his action
on the Knicks.

227
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,375
Jerry's my fucking customer.
For years now.

228
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,460
Which is why I told him no.

229
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,089
This fucking gardener, Paulie.
He cut the hair on your balls too?

230
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,342
- He's a friend of my aunt's.
- Which is why he don't belong to nobody.

231
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,761
Oh, what do you know about
who belongs to what?

232
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,889
- You been away 20 fucking years.
- Which entitles me to earn!

233
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,725
Which entitles you to shit.

234
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,477
In my book, you get points
for staying out of the can.

235
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:05,565
Good thing for me, then, that
your book don't mean oogatz to me!

236
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,444
What's yours is yours, Paulie.
But what ain't is anybody else's!

237
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:14,198
Now, do yourself a fucking favor
and get the fuck out of my store!

238
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,628
We're picking Bobby up or
he's gonna meet us at Uncle Jun's?

239
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,922
He took the kids to the 12:00 Mass.

240
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,385
I didn't know he was religious.

241
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,096
At this point, he'll try anything, I guess.

242
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,184
Bobby Jr. started wetting his bed again.
Practically every night.

243
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,937
Bobby came by to see me the other day.

244
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,856
Really?

245
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,403
So we discuss his career. I'm his wife.

246
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,280
Sometimes he needs a push.

247
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,699
Junior's your uncle too.
In case you wanna play...

248
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,411
...a little more of an active role...
I try. Believe me.

249
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,915
Despite all the work I have
with my own family.

250
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,962
You know, Tony, I cook
for Bobby and the kids every night.

251
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,881
I did Sunday dinner at my house...

252
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,968
...and now I gotta prepare the starters
and schlep them to Uncle Jun's.

253
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,306
- Barb's helping out from Brewster.
- Barbara's kids are normal.

254
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,729
This family stuff, these Sunday dinners.
They're important, Janice.

255
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,650
Hey, Jan.

256
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,529
- Julio, help me get this order?
- Okay.

257
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,287
You know, every day, I understand more
and more what Ma went through.

258
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,581
I mean, we bitch about her,
but I tell you...

259
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:49,001
...it is less and less a mystery
why she was the way she was.

260
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,628
She chose to be that way.

261
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,630
You don't choose that, Tony.

262
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,425
An ungrateful husband. Selfish kids.

263
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,762
How's all that food
that Janice prepared?

264
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,181
Two minutes.
Artie's re-sautéing the mushrooms.

265
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,934
Could I get you guys a glass of wine?
Something to drink?

266
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,354
- No, I'm good.
- I'll have a Pinot Grigio.

267
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,695
Twenty minutes, start the shells.

268
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,038
Just redoing the mushrooms.
Two minutes, tops.

269
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:31,169
Well, relax, I just came in to say hello.

270
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,552
- So how you doing?
- Hanging in.

271
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,347
Heard you were over there
at the Motel 6.

272
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,516
My aunt took the house back.

273
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,603
I'm moving in with my cousin
at the end of the month.

274
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,401
Look, you know, if you want...

275
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,820
...I'm staying at my mother's.
The place is empty.

276
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,655
You can bunk with me for a while.

277
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,950
No. Thank you.

278
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,827
I was talking to my cousin, Tony B.

279
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,413
He said it's fucking stupid
that we're on the outs.

280
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,709
I'm telling you, the place is just
sitting there. Two extra bedrooms.

281
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,045
I don't know.

282
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,798
Why not? Artie, we're like brothers.

283
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,426
How long are we gonna hold a grudge?

284
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,723
- Thanks, Ton. Thank you, very much.
- Yeah, all right.

285
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,935
All right.

286
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,653
Listen, I gotta talk to you
about your linens...

287
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,489
...you know, the napkins and
tablecloths, all that shit?

288
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,618
I got something going.
I think I can save you, like, 70 percent.

289
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,501
There's been a lot of progress to
the façade.

290
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,753
In some instances,
all of the paint comes off.

291
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,713
Now, tell me, what product is used?

292
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,217
I don't get these old antique houses.
They're grimy-looking.

293
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,764
We gonna eat today, or what?

294
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,934
Barbara and Tom aren't here yet
with the entrées, Uncle Jun.

295
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,061
When were they supposed to come?

296
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,230
Two o'clock. I told you five minutes ago.

297
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,857
Here. Why don't we start on
the macaroni?

298
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,235
Everybody, come on!

299
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,698
Bolognese has meat, obviously,
the marinara doesn't.

300
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:28,035
And Barb will be here with the
chicken parm and the veal pizzaiola.

301
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,581
So, Anthony, how did you guys do
against Delbarton last season?

302
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,418
Not so good. We lost both times.

303
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,503
- It's that line coach.
- Star-Ledger says...

304
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,964
...Delbarton's gonna be tougher
this coming year...

305
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,424
...with that Chinese kid.

306
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,093
Your father never had the
makings of a varsity athlete.

307
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,304
Oh, what the...

308
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,224
What the hell's with you?

309
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,518
- What?
- It's not true.

310
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,145
I lettered in football.

311
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,898
- You never played college ball.
- College?

312
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,819
Those guys from Seton Hall were
7 feet tall, some of them.

313
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,571
Took an academic leave, anyway.

314
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,241
Small hands, that was your problem.

315
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,952
Oh, yeah. Daddy always said that.

316
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,330
That's not the point.

317
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,834
What is it with you and this
obsession with this varsity crap?

318
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,711
The other day, you said it.

319
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,130
When I was a kid,
you told it to the girl cousins.

320
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,050
- It was very hurtful.
- Tony, relax, it's not a big deal.

321
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,468
It's undermining.

322
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,596
And it's the kind of stuff
I'm teaching my kids not to do.

323
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,515
So I don't wanna hear it again.
End of subject!

324
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,438
Honey, pass me the ricotta, please.

325
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,232
- Hello?
- In here!

326
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,943
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, sorry we're late.

327
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,613
- The Tappan Zee was a nightmare.
- Checking trucks again.

328
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,367
Well, sit down and dig into this medley
of pastas that Janice whipped up.

329
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,953
- How you doing, Uncle Jun?
- I don't like tardiness.

330
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,914
Let me unwrap these.

331
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,333
- This looks great.
- Thank you.

332
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,751
I heard on the radio...

333
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,254
...looks like the Jets are gonna grab
that kid from Tulsa, that tight end.

334
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,548
We still get those season tickets,
big brother?

335
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,884
He never had the makings of
a varsity athlete.

336
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,011
- Son of a bitch!
- What?

337
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,679
Did I tell you not to say that?

338
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,515
- Say what?
- Don't like the way I talk?

339
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,225
- Get out of my house.
- Here we go.

340
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,893
- Tony...
- No, "Tony" shit.

341
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,436
Get your coat, we're leaving.

342
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,064
- I don't have a coat.
- Then get moving, goddamn it.

343
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,233
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

344
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,903
It's my last Sunday dinner here,
that's what's going on.

345
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,077
Uncle Jun, was that really necessary?

346
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,164
He's a goddamn hothouse flower.
That's his problem.

347
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,341
Thank you for getting
my TV fixed, Paulie.

348
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,184
Vitro

349
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:01,647
It's such a sin.
He fired his Spanish helper.

350
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,483
Took his boy out of college.
He couldn't afford it anymore.

351
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,528
He said it's his last time coming here.

352
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,623
- You speak to the man?
- I'll see you later.

353
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,564
So, what's up?

354
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,484
Nothing, thought we'd be
first in line for opening day.

355
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,777
Peanuts are on me.

356
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,198
Angelo Garepe came to see me.

357
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:56,452
- Lorraine Calluzzo reached out.
- Fucking twat.

358
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,746
Didn't you fuck her once?

359
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, a million years ago.
What, is nothing a secret?

360
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,711
Obviously you wanna maintain stability...

361
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,881
...but having Phil Leotardo
smack your shys around, is that smart?

362
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,967
I gotta nip this Little Carmine
shit in the bud.

363
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,845
Otherwise, I could see
a lot of people start fucking around.

364
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,097
Power vacuum,
the capos bide their time...

365
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,434
...nobody's sure who to pay,
so nobody gets paid.

366
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,061
All right, I hear you.

367
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,771
No one likes that cunt anyway.

368
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,273
Any problem, she's "whack this one,
whack that one."

369
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,317
Never enough body count for Lorraine.

370
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,279
- Fuck her, let her taste her own medicine.
- All right, whatever.

371
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,075
Tell you something.
In large measure, I blame you...

372
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,036
...for this shit with Little Carmine.
The fuck did I do?

373
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,872
You legitimized him.
Man of your stature goes to Florida...

374
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,041
...to see that schmuck.
All right, come on.

375
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,378
We both agree that Little Carmine's
a fucking asshole.

376
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,796
But he's got a following...

377
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,423
...loyal to his old man.
So?

378
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,427
So Angelo had an idea.

379
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:01,934
What if...? And he's just floating this
to keep the peace.

380
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,563
What if there was
a power-sharing situation?

381
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,024
- Power-sharing.
- You're all in charge equally...

382
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,111
...but no major decisions can be made
without a majority of two.

383
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,737
- What the fuck?
- Hey, this way...

384
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,031
...you're not such
a big target for the feds.

385
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,118
Three of the other families have
this kind of arrangement.

386
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,621
What's this, the fucking UN now?

387
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,749
- All right, forget it. Forget I said it!
- Fuck that!

388
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,340
People deserve to choose
how they feel.

389
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,927
To experience love, joy,
happiness, passion...

390
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,014
- Where's Junior?
- Upstairs taking a nap.

391
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,308
The garage is open, his car is gone.

392
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,518
Call now...

393
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,855
Where is he?

394
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,399
I'm telling you, I don't know.

395
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,152
You don't think somebody put
the snatch on him, do you?

396
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,613
When did you see him last?

397
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,616
An hour ago? Two?

398
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,577
I fell asleep.

399
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,079
Maybe he drove to the store?

400
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,998
His wallet's here, his watch.

401
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,501
With his bail, he's not allowed
to leave the house anyway.

402
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,337
Junior.

403
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,690
So when they say
they're not interested, you say:

404
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,694
"You're not interested
in keeping kids off drugs?"

405
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,112
What, Shabazz?

406
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,239
Nobody want them Turkish taffies.

407
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,367
You push harder.

408
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,827
What did I tell you about profit margin?

409
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,205
- Where's Johnny?
- We closed now.

410
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,166
- Let me talk to Damiano.
- We rented the hall today.

411
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,045
- I'm looking for Johnny Soprano, damn it.
- Hey! This here's a church.

412
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,797
You can't talk like that in here.

413
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,716
Get out. Go on. We're working here.

414
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,552
- I wanna see Johnny Soprano.
- Ain't no Johnny here.

415
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,514
- I'm his brother, he owns this place.
- Hold up, now.

416
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,142
Back in the day,
this was Italian neighborhood...

417
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,353
...some fellas had this place here.

418
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,813
Kept those vending machines.

419
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,524
There ain't no vending machines
here no more.

420
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,693
Come on, fool. Go on.

421
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,754
All right, Roberta, thanks.

422
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,048
I'm sorry to bother you.

423
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,926
Bobbi San Fillipo?

424
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,096
Junior hasn't kept time with her in years.

425
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,849
Yeah, I realize that.

426
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,892
You know, now that I think about it...

427
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,604
...Junior was acting a little peculiar
when I got here today.

428
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,273
Said he wanted to see Johnny.

429
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,817
What Johnny?

430
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,944
- His brother?
- I don't know.

431
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,573
Also, there, the other day,
we were watching the TV...

432
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,783
...he thought he saw himself
on the program.

433
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,454
...in my home.

434
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,247
We have got the dishwashing liquid...

435
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,708
Concentrated dishwashing liquid
to do your dishes.

436
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,043
No gloves, it's all-natural,
no chemicals...

437
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,837
- Hello?
- It's me.

438
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,590
- Did you drop off the dry cleaning?
- Your uncle's missing.

439
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,717
He took his car.
He didn't call you, did he?

440
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,261
- No.
- Where the hell is he?

441
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,765
He's like an old woman. He's probably
gossiping with one of the neighbors.

442
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,975
Did you check the Ramirez's next door?

443
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,646
I'm afraid he might have wandered.
My grandfather did this.

444
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,983
Maybe you better call Tony.

445
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,319
I can't just dump this on Tony.

446
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,820
I gotta find him.

447
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,072
I need you to come here
in case he comes back.

448
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,534
- Bobby, I just can't...
- I need your help here. Jesus Christ.

449
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,995
Sometimes I think I love Junior
more than you do.

450
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,634
We may know
that there are five essentials for victory.

451
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:08,847
One. He will win who knows
when to fight and when not to fight.

452
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,891
Two. He will win
who knows how...

453
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,365
You Gary?

454
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,826
I'm Jimmy. Gary's up there.

455
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,703
Hey! Come down here!

456
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,373
- What?
- I said, get down here!

457
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,834
I wanna talk to you.

458
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,797
- What do you want?
- I'm a friend of Sal Vitro's.

459
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,758
- My aunt lives on this street.
- So?

460
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,386
So I'm guessing Sal Vitro
used to do this yard.

461
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,971
A lot of things used to be.

462
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,430
Maybe so.

463
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,641
But you're gonna make good
on his busted arm.

464
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,560
Oh, yeah? Why am I gonna do that?

465
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,728
Because I said so, that's why.

466
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:00,732
- Eat shit, pal.
- Why don't you take a walk, huh?

467
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,170
Give me your wallet, you prick.

468
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,848
This and the mower's a down payment.

469
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,935
By next Tuesday, I want Sal Vitro's
whole orthopedist bill paid.

470
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,438
Let's call it 1200.

471
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,900
From now on, I get 10 percent of
whatever you make in this neighborhood.

472
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,736
- You motherfucker!
- Shut up, I give you a crack.

473
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:18,560
- Time is it?
- Don't worry, we'll take the tunnel.

474
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,939
This meeting, we're trying to nail down
a new contractor...

475
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,776
...now with Massarone gone.
That office park by Troy Hills.

476
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,946
And listen, and this is very important:

477
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,491
If any of this shit between Little Carmine
and Johnny comes up, you clam up.

478
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,992
You got it, Ton.

479
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,370
Say nothing.
Because you say the wrong thing...

480
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,795
- What?
- Tony, it's me.

481
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,298
Listen, it's your uncle. He's gone.

482
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,385
You mean he's dead?

483
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,346
No, no, no.
We think he might have wandered off.

484
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,266
You know, I didn't wanna call you,
but it's been a couple hours now.

485
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:01,353
- Fuck him.
- He said he was going to see Johnny.

486
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,730
- Think he might have meant your dad?
- What?

487
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,357
He's wandering, Ton.

488
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,027
He can wander off the Palisades
for all I care, he's fucking dead to me.

489
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,218
I called you almost an hour ago.
Where the hell have you been?

490
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,471
Hello? I was picking up your daughter.

491
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,181
Stay here. I'm going out.

492
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,058
Where the hell is Tommy?

493
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,643
I sent him home.

494
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,855
Oh, wonderful. He gets the day off
and I get to wait by the phone.

495
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,899
It's because of him
Junior escaped, Janice.

496
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,152
- Dad, can I go with you?
- No.

497
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,321
- Can Janice go and we stay?
- What did I say about being impolite?

498
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,742
If anyone cares,
I'll be upstairs lying down.

499
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,374
One hour of television.
Then you both finish your homework.

500
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,544
And you, lay off the Snapple.

501
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:16,094
What galls me is before Little Carmine
went to Florida, I was close with him.

502
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,430
I was in his wedding party, for chrissake.

503
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,265
Organized his whole bachelor party.

504
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,602
Lesbian show, whores,
fucking disgusting.

505
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,564
Then when they had that kid with the
lung problem, who got him that doctor?

506
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,441
Water over the dam, huh?

507
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,318
I had no idea you guys were that close.

508
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,945
Close? We were like brothers.

509
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:37,324
It's a shame, then, you can't
find a way to work things out.

510
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,951
Give me a piece of bread, huh?

511
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,120
Have you thought about this?

512
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,081
Maybe you let him keep Lorraine...

513
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,875
...and take a bigger piece
of his Florida shit, the clubs.

514
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,129
If I wanted to worry about Florida,
I would move to fucking Miami.

515
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,299
It wasn't long ago
you used to wait in the car.

516
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,636
And as far as I'm concerned,
you should still be there!

517
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,305
- John. He was just...
- Fuck "He was just"!

518
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,140
Everybody's got a goddamned opinion?

519
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,901
I didn't say nothing, Ton.

520
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,695
What the fuck did I say?

521
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,197
I'm sorry, T, I just thought...

522
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,741
Now I gotta unfuck
what you just fucked up.

523
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,910
Gotta do something nice for Johnny.
Like what?

524
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,496
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

525
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,590
You gotta understand, this shit between
Johnny and Little Carmine is bad.

526
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:40,178
The instability. But worse comes to
worse, it could work to our advantage.

527
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,847
How?

528
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,308
They fight, we pick up
any crumbs from the fallout.

529
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,522
The odds are that Johnny
will end up on top, but who knows.

530
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,194
So keep your ears open
and your mouth shut!

531
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,241
Apparently there's a new president
at the electrician's union.

532
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,536
Tony sent Chrissy over there
to talk to them.

533
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,664
Something I've been meaning
to get straight.

534
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,875
Tony calls Christopher his nephew...

535
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:14,880
...yet sometimes
you refer to them as cousins.

536
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,799
Yeah. Right, see,
Chrissy's not Tony's nephew.

537
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,718
Chrissy's Carmela's cousin.

538
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,721
She was first cousin
to Dickie Moltisanti, Chrissy's dad.

539
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,059
But he was always kind of like
a big brother to Tony, Dickie.

540
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,147
So Tony calls Chrissy his nephew.

541
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,317
- It's an Italian thing.
- Okay.

542
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,569
Technically, Tony and Chrissy
are cousins.

543
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,822
Joanne Blundetto, Chrissy's mom...

544
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,075
...is Tony's cousin on his mother's side.

545
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,828
But, like, way back.

546
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,623
Like, from the old country or something.

547
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,251
Robyn?

548
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,170
What?

549
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,589
How much longer
am I gonna have to keep doing this?

550
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,177
Major RICO against Tony Soprano?

551
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,095
Those things take years to build.

552
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,431
This recent case against
Joe Massino in New York?

553
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,767
Seven years before indictments
were handed down.

554
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,622
Hello, handsome.

555
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,459
Where you living now? Around here?

556
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,588
- Do you know me?
- Do I know you?

557
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,553
Jupiter Club? On Sixth Street?

558
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,308
Caught fire, that place.

559
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,394
Lot of people died.

560
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,896
Do you know my brother Johnny?

561
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,567
You got all the looks, I'll tell you that.

562
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,486
What are you saying?

563
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,071
You and I had relations?

564
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:13,957
Son of a bitch in a taxicab
run me right over my foot.

565
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,338
- I have a car.
- Want a date?

566
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,008
I'll give you half and half
in the backseat.

567
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,469
- I wanna go home.
- Let me get a ride by the shelter.

568
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,805
I have to find my car.

569
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,256
How you doing?

570
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,093
I don't gotta tell you shit.

571
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,678
See some ID, sir?

572
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,764
Fuck you, copper, I know my rights.

573
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,766
Hey, take it easy, now.

574
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,268
My car was stolen. I want my lawyer.

575
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,728
What's his name?

576
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,940
Mel.

577
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,442
Okay. Mel what?

578
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,363
See you went out and forgot your shoes.
Where do you live?

579
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,865
- Belleville.
- You don't wanna tell me your name?

580
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:14,119
- You're not in any trouble or anything.
- Corrado Soprano.

581
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,582
I'll tell you what, sir.

582
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,960
Why don't you get in the car
where it's warm?

583
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,921
We'll try to get in touch
with your lawyer, all right?

584
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,448
Jesus, Uncle Jun, thank God.

585
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,159
This gentleman reside here, ma'am?

586
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,577
He's my uncle.

587
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,037
Where have you been?
We were worried sick.

588
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,206
I'll need to see
some identification, ma'am.

589
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh, okay, I'll get my bag.

590
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,294
His, actually.

591
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:08,089
Bobby, get Uncle Jun's wallet,
it's upstairs on his dresser.

592
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,597
Uncle Jun, you're freezing.

593
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,682
We found him on the Clay Street Bridge.

594
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,434
Newark?

595
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,935
Where's your car?

596
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,729
- They stole it.
- Who stoled it?

597
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,106
You know who.

598
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,743
It's him.

599
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,370
Junior Soprano.

600
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,540
- Here you go, sir.
- Go shit in your hat.

601
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,125
Uncle Jun, stop.

602
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,629
Thank you, officers. Thank you.

603
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,509
Did you tell Tommy
you were going to see my father?

604
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,137
Of course not.

605
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,265
What are you doing? Sit!

606
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,726
- I have to use the facilities.
- Bobby, go with him.

607
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,895
Goddamn it, I can piss by myself!

608
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,190
Okay. Okay.

609
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,235
I'll open some soup.

610
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:14,405
You go out for some exercise, people
give you the goddamn third degree.

611
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,202
Hi, Hildy.

612
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,913
Oh, hello, Louis,
how's the big slot-machine king?

613
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,415
Oh, I ain't doing that no more,
I'm retired.

614
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,792
Know what I mean?

615
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,502
Tony, it's me.

616
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,089
- Get going, I'm busy.
- The governor didn't sign that reprieve.

617
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,676
And tomorrow morning, Earl Williams
dies and makes a sucker out of us.

618
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,929
What's the matter?

619
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,806
It's Uncle Jun.

620
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,434
They found him in Newark in his slippers.

621
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,229
He was looking for Daddy, Ton.

622
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,606
He may have Alzheimer's. I don't know.

623
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,441
Maybe he'll forget my phone number.

624
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,026
Jesus Christ.

625
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,448
Mozzarella en carrozza, still warm.

626
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,576
We're in the middle of a family meeting.

627
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,952
I'm not even here.

628
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,288
To get the reprieve...

629
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:07,125
He's our uncle, Tony. There may
be something seriously wrong with him.

630
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,128
Listen, Janice, like I told your husband...

631
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,672
...he's fucking dead to me.
Are you that fragile?

632
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,841
You don't know half of it
when it comes to us.

633
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,968
If you're concerned,
take him to the doctor.

634
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,344
Because I've had it.

635
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,597
You're the only one he relates to, Tony.

636
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,473
We won't be able to get him in the car.

637
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:26,603
- Fuck him. You reap what you sow.
- You sure did.

638
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,565
You think maybe there's a reason
you're living all alone here, Tony...

639
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,483
...without your family?

640
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,819
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

641
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,572
You're gonna give me advice
on marriage?

642
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,783
Tony, there's a lot I can say right now
that I am not gonna say.

643
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,745
Fuck it! Say it. Say it, who gives a fuck?

644
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,997
Think I don't know
what you're doing here?

645
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,999
Trying to pawn this shit off on me?

646
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,501
Your whole life, whenever
there's a family problem...

647
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,504
...you shirk your duties or run away.
Ran away?

648
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,215
- Tibet or fucking Berkeley.
- I was 18 years old!

649
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,052
I was 16 when you left me
with our head case of a mother...

650
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,512
...who you all of a sudden
relate to so fucking well.

651
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,140
- I was merely saying I understand...
- Free-spirit Janice.

652
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,642
Rebel without a cause.

653
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,728
While I sit here mired in her bullshit,
trying to be a good son...

654
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,314
...while you're off dropping acid
and blowing roadies.

655
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,691
- Roadies?
- Oh, you don't wanna know.

656
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:18,488
That... That is not true, Tony, now, you...
You tell him that that's not true.

657
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,782
Poor fucking Janice,
she's so fucking depressed.

658
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,408
She can't get up off the couch...

659
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,702
...because she's so tired
from her Epstein-Barr.

660
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,122
- Poor fucking Janice, va fangool.
- Why don't we just calm down?

661
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,042
Maybe you were the smart one.
You got out of here for a while.

662
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,543
Your hippie string ran out.

663
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,380
You're gonna do to this man
what you do to every one of them.

664
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,340
Fucking piece of shit!

665
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,551
You stupid cunt. You think you...
Oh, just like your mother, huh?

666
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,679
Now you can do to him
what she did to Daddy.

667
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,222
Enough!

668
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,307
Cocksucker!

669
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,393
Cock...

670
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,189
I wanna get out now.

671
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,066
You want more responsibility?

672
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,026
Start with controlling your wife.

673
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,417
And then from nowhere, he cracks
the one kid's head with the shovel...

674
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,712
...the other one, he knocks out of a tree.
He jumped out the tree...

675
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,923
...and come at me with a chainsaw.
I got a right to defend myself.

676
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,592
All right, take it easy. Relax.

677
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,430
Sal Vitro's been working the area since
my ma was still working at Kresge's.

678
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,433
I should be able to help out a kid
from my own neighborhood.

679
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,229
All right, how about this:
Vitro and your nephew split the area.

680
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,774
East of Dyer is yours.
West of Dyer goes to him.

681
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,570
For the broken arm... I don't know,
give him 500 bucks.

682
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,447
I already told the guy 12, T.

683
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,451
Well, there's fucking compromises
in life, Paulie.

684
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,456
Make it a grand,
for the pain and suffering.

685
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,543
Naturally, I want my taste, retroactive.
Because this is the first time...

686
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,295
...I been hearing about any of this.

687
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,549
It's a new venture.
My nephew's barely on his feet.

688
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:05,136
I didn't wanna start kicking up
and pull it back if it don't work out.

689
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,975
And of course,
Vitro will do your grass too, Ton.

690
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,060
No charge.

691
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,646
Remind me to talk to you
about that later.

692
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,489
There he is. Salvatore, my boy,
how's that pitching arm?

693
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:28,785
Getting there.
Paul, say hello to Mr. Gualtieri.

694
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,829
That's my middle name. Paul.

695
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,253
So I talked to that guy. Good news.

696
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,088
I got you 500 for your arm...

697
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,299
...and you keep half your area.

698
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,593
- Half?
- It could have been nothing.

699
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,178
Lucky you know me.

700
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,847
West of Dyer's yours,
east belongs to him.

701
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,307
Paulie, my wife's gonna sh...

702
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,686
All right, thank you, Paulie.

703
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,857
Oh, one more thing.

704
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,194
You're gonna have to cut
a couple of lawns on the comp.

705
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,695
Some friends of ours.

706
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,001
Some shot, huh, the way it hooked?

707
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,879
Yeah, you got a fucking horseshoe
up your ass, you.

708
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,548
Mr. Soprano.

709
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,054
Harry Winer. I was
your mother's neurologist.

710
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,848
I did her workup from Green Grove.

711
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,808
Yeah, how you doing?

712
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,727
I assume your sister told you
I'm treating your uncle.

713
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,773
- Oh, yeah, yeah, she mentioned it.
- Catch you in there, T.

714
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,441
Yeah.

715
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,862
I think with the right meds,
we can control these things.

716
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:50,408
- What things?
- The infarcts. They're akin to ministrokes.

717
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,869
He suffered significant brain trauma
the other day.

718
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,080
You probably noticed him acting
differently over the past six months.

719
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,082
Oh, well, to tell you the truth...

720
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,543
...me and my uncle,
we don't talk much anymore.

721
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,421
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't be, he's a hostile prick.

722
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,550
Well, unfortunately, obstinacy
is consistent with his condition.

723
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,511
Impatience, forgetfulness,
particularly with short-term memory.

724
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,931
Find he'll ask the same question
every three minutes? What time it is?

725
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,770
I don't know. Maybe, yeah.

726
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,147
It's frustrating, I know.

727
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,567
The last thing I wanted to do was
get in the middle of a family squabble.

728
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,486
- I just wanted to say hello.
- Well, nice seeing you.

729
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:30,323
- Okay.
- All right. Thanks.

730
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,567
Members of the squirrel family...

731
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,820
...the prairie dog makes its home mainly
throughout the Western...

732
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,238
Tommy?

733
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,286
Brought you some fish.

734
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,080
Trying to clean out my refrigerator.

735
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:23,000
Make sure you form a seal
when you shut that freezer door.

736
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,840
Of the two main species...

737
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:33,177
...the black-tailed prairie dog
is much more widespread...

738
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,348
...inhabiting much of the Great Plains
and the Great Basin.

739
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,863
So how you feeling?

740
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,324
Heard you had a little problem.

741
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,243
What problem?

742
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,955
All right.

743
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,001
But your doctor said something different.

744
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,420
Who, Kennedy?

745
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,339
Kennedy's your cancer doctor.

746
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,341
I knew that.

747
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,052
You said doctor.

748
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,640
The white-tailed prairie dog
lives at higher elevations...

749
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,184
...hibernating throughout the winter.

750
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,854
Just take your medicine, Uncle Jun.

751
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,732
Make you feel better.

752
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,152
Help with your memory.

753
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,573
Believe me, there's plenty
I'd like to forget.

754
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,742
Yeah, you and me both.

755
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,502
Feech was here?

756
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,005
Yeah, he came to pay his respects.

757
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,675
So, what's this I hear?

758
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,218
You ruled against Feech?

759
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,346
- He's an important man.
- Why is he bitching to you about shit?

760
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,933
I'm still the boss of this family.
Despite any arrangements.

761
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,942
Yellow in color, they often have dark...

762
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,779
These prairie dogs,
they'll sleep during the day.

763
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,655
Oh, yeah?

764
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:26,540
Look, the doctor said you may not
have known what you were saying.

765
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,542
What are you talking about?

766
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,711
The varsity shit.

767
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,559
So, what else did Feech have to say?

768
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,355
Getting a new top on his convertible.

769
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,653
All right, let's assume that you
didn't know what you were saying...

770
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,281
...that you forget
when you say shit over and over.

771
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,283
Yeah?

772
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,287
Why does it gotta be something mean?

773
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,832
Why can't you repeat something good?

774
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,841
There's the coyote.

775
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,473
I mean, don't you love me?
