1
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,895
Don't tell me we're fighting all the time,
I try to get along.

2
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,189
You can't just say
whatever comes to mind, Tony.

3
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,607
You were fucking horrible.

4
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,067
That shit about the roadies?

5
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,862
You hit below the belt yourself, Jan.
Not to mention, you started it.

6
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,156
No cheese for Sophia.

7
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,618
Those kids seem to like you, sort of.

8
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,788
I leave them completely free
to do whatever they want.

9
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,165
How else are they gonna learn
from their mistakes?

10
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,627
Anyway, thank you for having us over.

11
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,970
What's this you're watching?

12
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,305
Beethoven.

13
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,274
- Can we get a dog?
- Please?

14
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,651
I'll walk him
and I'll pick up the poo and pee.

15
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,321
Pee? Right. Start with your underwear.

16
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,116
We had a dog.

17
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,493
Remember? Tippy?

18
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,664
He got worms,
had to move to the country.

19
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,585
Tippy was gassed, Tony.
Daddy took him to the pound.

20
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,839
He used to drag his ass on the carpet
just to scratch himself.

21
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,299
My mother went crazy.

22
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,342
Gassed?

23
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,012
And he's so cynical
about everything else.

24
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,598
Father told me he took him
to live on a farm.

25
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,183
That's what they always say.

26
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,436
That same farm must have
17 billion dogs on it.

27
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,188
Dog shit up to the rafters.

28
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,441
Beethoven!

29
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,193
Hello.

30
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,696
What?

31
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,366
- Oh no, that's terrible.
- What? What's the matter?

32
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,703
It's cousin Josephine,
Aunt Concetta died.

33
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,457
- What happened?
- They think it was a heart attack.

34
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:33,545
Uncle Zio found her on the couch
after Meet the Press.

35
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,298
We hereby commend
Concetta to the Lord...

36
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,593
...embraced in his divine
goodness.

37
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,055
Let us go in peace. Amen.

38
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,224
- Amen.
- Amen.

39
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,901
Listen, as long as we're here...

40
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,655
...I was gonna go visit my father,
if you'd like to join me.

41
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,907
Five hours they let me out
for these funerals.

42
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,867
I gotta spend it being maudlin?

43
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,661
It's a beautiful day.

44
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:09,331
Excuse me, I thought you might wanna
go pay your respects to your brother.

45
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,625
By crying to a chunk of marble?

46
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,753
I can pay my respects
from the after-party.

47
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,130
After-party?

48
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,051
It's those uptake inhibitors.

49
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,427
We were skeptical at first.

50
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,348
Then his mood really improved.
His memory too.

51
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,122
Excuse me.

52
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,962
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Oh, hello.

53
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,797
You knew my mother?

54
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,176
You're Anthony.

55
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,429
Oh, my God.

56
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,097
Do I know you?

57
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,891
Oh, no.
No, no, you're not annoying me.

58
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,979
- No, no... Do we know each other?
- Oh, we met once.

59
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,816
I was a friend of your father's.

60
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,990
You're the lady from Bamberger's.

61
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,783
From the fur department.

62
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,285
Fran Felstein.

63
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,954
Tony. How you doing?

64
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,002
So, what, you...? You come visit?

65
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,631
Yeah, I miss your father
sometimes. It's...

66
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,592
It's foolish.

67
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,427
No, don't say that.

68
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,180
No, I was sorry to hear
about your mother.

69
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,141
At least she didn't suffer.

70
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,353
She made all of us suffer, instead.

71
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,025
Oh, it was a joke.
She made all of us suffer.

72
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,694
Believe me, I heard the stories
from your dad.

73
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,321
Yeah.

74
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,327
You'll have to forgive me, my hearing...
The last few years.

75
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,622
How about a hearing aid?
They got the little ones now...

76
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,874
...you can't even see.
I'm too vain. Anyway.

77
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,543
Johnny was very proud of you.

78
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,880
You were very special to him.

79
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,051
I'm sure you were too.

80
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,804
You know, Johnny told me
if I ever needed anything...

81
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,890
...I should always call his son.

82
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,894
What do you need?

83
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,897
Not a thing.

84
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,570
Fran Felstein?

85
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,155
That was class.

86
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,241
She's got great legs for an old broad.

87
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,201
I was in love with that woman.

88
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,286
She was the reason I never married.

89
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,913
I wanted to propose.

90
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,332
I had the ring all picked out.

91
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,917
So, what? She turned you down?

92
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,377
I hesitated.

93
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,755
How could I bring this life we live
on a woman?

94
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,925
Anyway, she took it as a sign
I wasn't interested.

95
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,555
And then one night we were all
at the 500 Club to see Enzo Stuarti.

96
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,390
Your father shows up.

97
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,434
Sy Devore suit.

98
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,769
Two-inch lapel. That was that.

99
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,399
She never knew my feelings,
what could I do?

100
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,735
For years, I suffered in silence.

101
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,871
- Mario. Did you bring your guitar?
- Not to this.

102
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,793
- Angie, come on, sing us a song.
- You sing, Junior.

103
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,712
Nobody wants to hear me.

104
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,130
Mario, remember?

105
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,974
Thank you.

106
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,145
Thanks, my name's J.T.
I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

107
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,771
Hi, J.T.

108
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:06,151
I'm also a TV writer, which by default,
makes me a douche bag...

109
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,321
...but you would have figured that out
for yourselves in a minute.

110
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,701
About 15 years ago,
I moved from Jersey to Hollywood.

111
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,663
Broke into the biz.
It was a dream come true.

112
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,792
I was making money, I had the Beemer,
the actress girlfriend.

113
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,378
I had all the flake I needed
to keep me churning out...

114
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,756
...that snappy dialogue
for Corbin Bernsen.

115
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,634
Drugs. Alcohol.

116
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,261
That shit practically comes
with the Writers Guild card.

117
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,722
Anyway...

118
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,644
...before too long, I discovered heroin.

119
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,398
And things really started to fall apart.

120
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:50,153
It got so bad that
I blew a deadline on a Nash Bridges.

121
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,990
I got my ass fired,
I didn't work for 18 months.

122
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,870
By the grace of God, I got myself
into a rehab program in Pennsylvania...

123
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,958
...and with the help of some
good friends that I made there...

124
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,751
...I got through it.

125
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,711
Chris, where are you?

126
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,964
There's my man Chris, everybody.

127
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,180
Anyway, I wanna talk a little bit
about taking a moral inventory.

128
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,558
So we talked for like an hour.

129
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,185
Well, it turns out that they had a thing.

130
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,021
Her and my old man.
Right up till he died.

131
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,899
He got from this woman
what he couldn't get at home.

132
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,196
Support. You know, love.

133
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,240
A smile when you walk in
the fucking door.

134
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,243
Do you think that justifies
his infidelity?

135
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,413
She drove him into that
woman's arms, my mother.

136
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,665
To all his women.

137
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,714
I'll tell you one thing, all the years
he was rotting in that grave...

138
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,051
...I can't remember once
my mother going to visit him.

139
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,263
But this lady, Fran...

140
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,100
It's possible your mother
found it very painful.

141
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,643
Oh, poor her.

142
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,771
What was it like sitting there with Fran?

143
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,942
It was a little weird at first, you know.

144
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,695
There I am comforting
my father's mistress...

145
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,655
...my mother's lying there dead.

146
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,115
Are you attracted to her?

147
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,117
Come on, she's old enough
to be my mother.

148
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,872
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's an expression.

149
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,166
Don't cream yourself.

150
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,792
I did not wanna fuck my mother!

151
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,505
You should have seen her
in her housedress with that hairnet.

152
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,924
This conversation would be over
in two seconds.

153
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,802
So I figured, why not
move back to Jersey?

154
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,096
Clean slate. It's better.

155
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,725
My new agent, next week he's got me
set up to meet Dick Wolf's guy.

156
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,103
I seen Dick Wolf at Rao's one night.
Guy's got his own limo.

157
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,981
That Law & Order money?

158
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,484
Guy could have his own battleship.

159
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,321
But enough of my shit,
how are you doing?

160
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,324
Good, you know.

161
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,036
- Working the program.
- Oh, yeah?

162
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,709
I had some fucking wine, all right?

163
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,127
Is that what you wanna hear?

164
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,674
- Christopher, when was this?
- I don't know.

165
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,718
My fiancée was in a car crash.

166
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,680
I didn't even like it.
I went to a meeting the next day.

167
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,348
But no slip since then?

168
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,309
I've been sober and I've been high.
Sober's better.

169
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,855
You know you can call me, right?

170
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,110
- What, do you got a date?
- I gotta meet somebody, a friend.

171
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,364
- Go ahead, I'll get this.
- Thanks, bro.

172
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,117
Listen, call me, I'm serious.

173
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,142
- Harold Melvoin.
- Mel? It's me.

174
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,146
- Corrado, what's up?
- There's a funeral I need to attend.

175
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,606
I want you to call the feds.

176
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,567
Vincent Patronella.

177
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,570
Is he a relative? You know the rules.

178
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,196
He's my niece's godfather.

179
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,074
I think I met him at a barbecue once
for the bicentennial.

180
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,701
All they can say is no.

181
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,210
Your father used to bring me
flowers all the time.

182
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,088
Flowers and lingerie.

183
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,923
I'm making chicken.

184
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,426
Cuban style with black beans.

185
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,054
What's this?

186
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,724
Ketchup, sure. If you want.

187
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,187
No, the kid and the dog.

188
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,939
Oh, my son, Bruce.

189
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,275
He married an Israeli girl.

190
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,111
He's a food service director with El Al.

191
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,280
No, no, the dog.

192
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,865
Oh, Freckles.

193
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,703
- He was a gift from your dad.
- What?

194
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,456
When?

195
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,584
Oh, this is my fucking dog!

196
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,256
Excuse me, I'm sorry. This was my dog.

197
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,300
His name was Tippy!

198
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,220
Your dad never said.

199
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,473
I don't fucking believe this.

200
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,642
My mother made him
give the dog away.

201
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,686
Well, Bruce loved him.

202
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,982
I mean, he had him for almost 10 years
till he moved to Tel Aviv.

203
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,651
Then I had to put him to sleep.

204
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:47,116
Oh, those are the pictures,
on the coffee table.

205
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,953
The slippers were your dad's too.

206
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,258
Look at this. The two of you.

207
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:09,097
- He used to remind me of Victor Mature.
- Thanks.

208
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,519
Outside the Latin Quarter.

209
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,439
Holy shit, look at Hesh.
George Gershwin.

210
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,484
He was a whoremaster. And cheap.

211
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,280
You know he screwed me
out of my retirement money.

212
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,825
Against your dad's wishes,
by the way.

213
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,745
- What are you talking about?
- Don't get me started.

214
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,999
No, come on, what happened?

215
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,711
Your dad owned a racetrack,
with the midget auto racing.

216
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,965
Yeah, the Chickamauga Raceway
over in New Egypt.

217
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,720
And him, Herman, some other guy...

218
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,723
Phil something, with the hair,
from New York.

219
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,766
- Yeah, Leotardo.
- Yeah.

220
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,769
My father cut him in
to pay off a poker debt.

221
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:01,274
Johnny always told me
his piece would go to me.

222
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,693
Couldn't put me in his will, obviously.

223
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,197
When he passed, your dad...

224
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,742
...I called Hesh.

225
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,747
- He sent me 500 bucks.
- That's it?

226
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,918
- I'm sorry.
- No.

227
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,921
Jesus Christ, I wish you'd called me.

228
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,674
Bruce sends me money, occasionally.

229
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,218
Well, that's not the point.
It's my father's wishes.

230
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,013
Look, forget it.

231
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,141
Seriously, I'm sorry I...

232
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,101
I shouldn't have even brought it up.

233
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,731
Listen, after we eat,
you wanna take a ride?

234
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,447
So I saw my Uncle Jun.

235
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,533
- He says to say hello.
- Junior?

236
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,703
Jesus. And how's he doing?

237
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,914
I don't know if you know it...

238
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,958
...but he was always
a little hot for you.

239
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,584
He was practically a stalker.

240
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,129
- He said he suffered in silence.
- Suffered in silence?

241
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,383
He used to skulk outside my building.
All hours.

242
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,842
Weird phone calls.

243
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,887
I always had a hunch he told
Livia about me and Johnny.

244
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,390
Jesus Christ.

245
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,560
She was a handsome woman,
your mother.

246
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,731
Not sexy, exactly, but, statuesque.

247
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,485
Little nip?

248
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,698
- What is it?
- It's one for the road, honey.

249
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,992
And this looks like road to me.

250
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,869
Rémy Martin, VSOP.

251
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,679
They can't be making much,
but if I know Hesh...

252
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,307
...him and Phil got something
going on out of here.

253
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,688
So tell me about your women.

254
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,898
Your wife, what's she like?

255
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,693
I don't know.

256
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,737
What's to tell?

257
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,782
Good woman. Good mother.

258
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,370
Marriage hit the rocks, that's all.
What are you gonna do?

259
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,041
How about your girlfriend?

260
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,045
She's an art dealer. Very sophisticated.

261
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,922
Dark hair, dark eyes.

262
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,217
Latin. But, you know, from Spain.

263
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,687
That's it. That's it.

264
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,608
Oh, man, I am so glad you called.

265
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,234
I really needed this.

266
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,784
- So?
- So, what?

267
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,578
What, there's nothing
you wanna talk about?

268
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,580
I was honest with you the other night.

269
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,503
- What, you telling me you're not using?
- What?

270
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,757
You ran out of IHOP like you were on fire.
You were jonesing like a motherfucker.

271
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,718
I was meeting a girl.
We were going to the track.

272
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,596
The Meadowlands.
I didn't wanna miss the last race.

273
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,724
I am totally clean and sober.

274
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,936
Jesus Christ.
I was positive you fucking slipped.

275
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,772
Thank you, man.
I appreciate your concern.

276
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,779
I could have saved you a trip.

277
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,156
I'll take your action.

278
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,784
You'd take a dime each
on the Yankees and St. Louis?

279
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,078
High roller.

280
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,123
I just got a 3 grand residual
on a That's Life episode.

281
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,544
What, that fake guinea-fest
with Paul Sorvino?

282
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,213
That was totally unrealistic.

283
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,885
- It's so dusty here.
- Yeah.

284
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,890
- Is that silk?
- It ain't Kleenex.

285
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,934
It's linen.

286
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,813
You know, you're very...

287
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,483
I don't know, you got a lot of class.

288
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,153
Just like your girlfriend.

289
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,324
Last Race
Saturday!

290
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,330
He told me to look out,
so I sent her money.

291
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,374
Which is a lot more
than anybody else did.

292
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,501
So you decide
to keep his end for yourself.

293
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,921
Oh, I should give it to some trollop, huh?
I thought I had it coming.

294
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,842
With Phil in the can for 20 years, who do
you think has been running that place?

295
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,636
Collecting the rent. Filing the taxes.
All that bullshit.

296
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,182
Well, what about my share?
All those years I never saw a dime.

297
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,021
You're my father's friend, Hesh.
My friend.

298
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,190
I'm such a friend,
how come I never see you?

299
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,569
What? I see you.
I'm fucking busy.

300
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,864
Never too busy to call me at 2 a.m.
to hear your problems though.

301
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,866
One time that happened.

302
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,202
My therapist was on vacation!

303
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,872
Listen, you want his end, kid, you got it.
It's 25 percent.

304
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,791
The closing is not for two weeks.
And I would appreciate it...

305
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,253
...if you call Phil and tell him
he should assume part of that burden.

306
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:18,674
Well, despite how you feel,
my father loved this woman.

307
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,345
She's not such a bad person.
But I don't know...

308
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,348
Something about her always
rubbed me the wrong way.

309
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,308
Because she was rubbing him
and not you.

310
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,810
How long you known me, bub, huh?

311
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,396
She's a little pale for my taste.

312
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,404
Mr. Patronella was last week.

313
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,573
This is a different one.

314
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,619
Yes, I'm aware he's been to
two funerals in a month.

315
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,581
Well, people die, counselor.

316
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,752
The deceased in question now,
Mrs. Crilley...

317
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,172
...was the sister
of Mr. Soprano's cousin.

318
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,049
By marriage.

319
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,303
So she's not a blood relative per se,
are we quibbling now?

320
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,265
For God's sake, the man
wants to pay his respects.

321
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,020
Well, perhaps my next call should be
to Judge Runions, get him involved.

322
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,320
Five hours. It's not a Hawaiian vacation.

323
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,030
He'll attend the church service...

324
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,700
...then pay his respects
to the family afterwards.

325
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,789
Thank you, counselor. We appreciate it.

326
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,543
You're worth every fucking cent.

327
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,969
They're gonna have Scottish bagpipes
at the funeral.

328
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,513
It should be interesting.

329
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,988
Don Provolone, see that fucking game?

330
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,365
Diet Coke and whatever he's having.

331
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,326
Ginger ale?

332
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,497
- Remind me to send Jeter a dozen roses.
- You wanna parlay it?

333
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,001
I was thinking I'd go check out
that Indian casino, play some poker.

334
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,879
You want in a real game,
I'll hook you up.

335
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,507
High stakes, exclusive clientele.

336
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,302
- David Lee Roth.
- I'll tell you, man.

337
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,013
Playing cards, games of chance...

338
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,806
...I never really dug it before.

339
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,060
I was never that good at math,
but there's something about...

340
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:38,147
...that excitement that's so...
I don't know.

341
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,193
What is wrong? I win one bet...

342
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,154
...you look like you're gonna cry?
I fucked up again.

343
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,657
My super came by this morning...

344
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,787
The fucking caulk around the toilet.
he had some weed.

345
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,956
You have gotta call someone
before you use.

346
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,292
- Not after.
- I know, I know.

347
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,212
I just wanted to see if I could
get high like a normal person.

348
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,465
You're not normal. Neither of us are.

349
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,635
And on top of that
you ask me to meet you at a bar?

350
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,557
Come here, you maniac.

351
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,560
Six hundred and twenty-five K
for the track...

352
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,188
...plus all that land? That's it?

353
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,358
Problem was the zoning restrictions.
We're lucky we got a buyer.

354
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,068
Here's what I propose.

355
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,988
Tony gets 150.

356
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,907
Twenty-five percent comes from you.

357
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,159
The other 75 percent of that
comes from Hesh.

358
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,913
Jesus Christ, that's like 40 grand.
You gotta be fucking kidding me, John.

359
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,581
Am I smiling?

360
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,504
You got some balls, kid.
I'll give you that much.

361
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,923
- You'll give me what I tell you to give me.
- Tony.

362
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,134
- Take it easy, take it easy.
- Fuck that.

363
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,011
This ain't the '70s. And I'm not a kid.

364
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,888
Relax, it's an expression.

365
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,473
Well here's another expression:

366
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,017
You got five days to give me my money.

367
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,520
Come on.

368
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,280
- That was out of line.
- Philly, he's a boss.

369
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,700
Jersey? Come on, huh?

370
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,915
Well, I talked to Phil and Hesh
about the racetrack.

371
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,418
How bad did they bullshit you?

372
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,503
Well, actually, we straightened it all out.

373
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,048
So when the sale goes through,
you're looking at a nice piece of change.

374
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,217
- You're kidding?
- No.

375
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,888
- Hey, that's wonderful.
- Yeah.

376
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,726
I wanted to show you something.

377
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,146
You were admiring my handkerchief.

378
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,660
Check out the initials.

379
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,622
JFK, holy shit! This was his?

380
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,542
You know, I have a hat of his...

381
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,337
...a captain's hat I bought at an auction.

382
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,089
A lot of the friends don't like him,
you know, Ruby...

383
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,885
...and all that shit, but fuck,
I was in grammar school.

384
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,345
That's my lipstick.

385
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,932
We had a little thing.

386
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,851
- When he was president?
- March '61.

387
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,521
Right before the Bay of Pigs.

388
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,315
I was at the Copa with a girlfriend.

389
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,443
I'm wearing a new sable
and we meet Lem Billings.

390
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:34,198
Lem is a school friend of Jack's from
Choate, but of course we have no idea.

391
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:39,620
He insists that we join him for
some affair at the Pierre Hotel.

392
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,580
He won't take no.

393
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:46,210
He has a limo, we figure
what the hell, you know.

394
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,046
And we go over. And he tells us...

395
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,382
...he's taking us to the
presidential suite.

396
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,885
So we get up, out of the elevator.

397
00:25:55,053 --> 00:26:00,224
We go in the suite.
It is crawling with models, celebrities.

398
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,893
Peter Lawford, Sinatra.

399
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,229
- Jackie Gleason.
- No shit.

400
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,356
Yeah. I'm looking around...

401
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:11,485
...and I glance across the room
and suddenly...

402
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:16,865
...I am locking eyes
with John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

403
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,412
Yeah, I mean he comes over,
he is a perfect gentleman.

404
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,039
He takes my coat,
he brings me a cocktail...

405
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,749
...introduces me around.

406
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,085
And finally at the end of the night,
now get this:

407
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:33,257
"In the interests of national security,"
he says, he needs me to stay.

408
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,802
Since I'm wearing a sable,
he needs to personally interview me.

409
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,597
Make sure I'm not working
for the Russians.

410
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,601
- He said that?
- Some line, huh?

411
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,355
- Well, what was he...? What was he like?
- Wonderful.

412
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,857
So were you two an item or...

413
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,318
No, he called, but after all...

414
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,904
...this man was the leader
of the free world, I mean, you know.

415
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,199
I remember one weekend I was
supposed to go down to D.C.

416
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,871
Stay at the Ritz-Carlton.
Last-minute emergency meeting.

417
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,914
Steel workers are going on strike.

418
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,916
So, what, it was just that one time or?

419
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,089
Except for, you know, after the Bay
of Pigs, he was probably pretty busy.

420
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,969
I knew there were others. I mean,
Judy Campbell and Marilyn, of course.

421
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:23,140
We had something special, though.
Crazy passion.

422
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,143
That was something
your mother never understood.

423
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,396
When you're married
to a powerful man...

424
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,233
...you damn well
better make him feel powerful.

425
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,654
My mother?

426
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,489
Please.

427
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,200
I saw a picture of Livia
on New Years Eve.

428
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,912
She was dressed like a refugee.

429
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:53,087
Listen, I think I'm gonna skip the coffee.
I got a meeting in the city.

430
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,589
Are you...? You sure?

431
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,385
Look...

432
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,888
...consider this an advance.

433
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,849
Get your phone turned on
and pay your rent.

434
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,019
Your dad would be so proud.

435
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,356
He raised a real gentleman.

436
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,784
You trying to buy this pot?

437
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,329
Eight hundred and you'll know.

438
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,581
Fuck.

439
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,170
Cowboys and three little Indians.

440
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,132
Fuck me.

441
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,887
I got a lot of big people
coming next week.

442
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,350
So when you write on TV...

443
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,895
...what do they have, like, one guy
writes the words for Dylan McDermott...

444
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,107
...and one guy writes for Nicholson's
girlfriend, that the way it is?

445
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,110
You write it all yourself.

446
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,196
Interesting.

447
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,741
So how you doing? You wanna take off?

448
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,410
I'm getting killed here.

449
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,746
I'm gonna go, I'm fucking shot.

450
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,247
I'll call you tomorrow.

451
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,083
- You wanna work out?
- Sure. Yeah, whatever.

452
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,210
Four clubs to Joe Hollywood.

453
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,963
Jack for the car-wash king.

454
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,090
Ten for Mr. Vito.

455
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,222
Show Valentina you love her.

456
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,362
Come on.

457
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,712
They were out of the Citrucel.

458
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,050
Where you going?

459
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,177
Gotta order some flowers.

460
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,805
Sal from the dry cleaners, his kid died.

461
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,099
Drowned in a Jacuzzi.
Seven years old, you believe it?

462
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,644
Fucking tragedy.

463
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,949
- Harold Melvoin.
- It's me.

464
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,576
I got another funeral. A kid.

465
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,411
His father does my shirts.

466
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,497
Corrado, it has to be a relative.

467
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,666
It is a relative, goddamn it.

468
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,627
My old man came over
with this kid's great, great grandfather.

469
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,755
- The guy had a clubfoot.
- That's rather tenuous, don't you think?

470
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,258
The whole village of Avellino
settled in this area.

471
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,009
We gotta be related somewhere.

472
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,011
- Corrado.
- Corrado, my balls.

473
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,306
I gotta get out of this house.
I'm going fucking stir-crazy.

474
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,351
Seventh street, coming out.

475
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,526
Holy shit. You're still here?

476
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,154
- Called you all day yesterday.
- We're in a hand here.

477
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,534
- What do you wanna do?
- Fold.

478
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,874
Here, fuck it. I'm all in.

479
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,420
- Call.
- Pair of tens.

480
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,673
Flush. Caught it on the river.

481
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:29,303
Motherfucking fuck.

482
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,474
How bad?

483
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,268
He owes the house 57.

484
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,395
Thousand?

485
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,405
What, are you fucking crazy?

486
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,574
Define crazy.

487
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,535
I'm good for it.
I'm up for this Dick Wolf thing.

488
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:58,707
- If I get on staff it's like a month's salary.
- Well, how about this fucking month?

489
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,878
Hey, you think you could
spot me for a while?

490
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,131
I got some child support too.

491
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,887
I'll cover this,
I'll give you 3 grand for incidentals.

492
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,931
That's 60,000 altogether.

493
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,059
- I only been up two days, I can still add.
- Good.

494
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,729
Then add two points every week
till I'm paid in fucking full.

495
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,148
- You're charging me vig?
- On top of the principle.

496
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:27,527
It's compounded if you're late.
That's 1200 one week from today.

497
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,614
Don't give me that look.
This is your problem.

498
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,367
I will not fucking enable you.

499
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,299
There he is. Philly.

500
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,972
Phil?

501
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,310
- Phil, where you going?
- I gotta meet John down the restaurant.

502
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,270
You fucking cocksucker.

503
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,349
Where you gonna go, huh?

504
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,268
Where you gonna go, huh?

505
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,145
You motherfucker.

506
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,951
- Jesus Christ. Mister, you okay in there?
- Oh, my neck.

507
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,955
You all right? You run from me,
you fucking cocksucker?

508
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,207
Where's my fucking money?

509
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,418
I'll get it, I'll get it. My neck, Tony.

510
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,920
- What, do you think I'm an asshole, huh?
- No, no, no.

511
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,464
- No, Tony.
- I can't hear you.

512
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,799
No, please. Tony.

513
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,511
You got 24 hours.

514
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,350
Called 911, they're on their way.
He's all right.

515
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,482
Oh, my God.

516
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,529
- Oh, my baby.
- Take her upstairs, Andy.

517
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,575
She should probably take one of those
tranquilizers her mother gave her.

518
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,504
- We should go, Junior.
- Relax. We just got here.

519
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,423
Chicken's nice and spicy, huh?

520
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,738
I know you're in there, you're casting
a shadow over the peephole.

521
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,992
Hey.

522
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,746
- What, are you ducking me?
- No. What are you...?

523
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,625
I thought you were this girl.
She's a pain in the ass.

524
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,962
So, what the fuck? Where you been?

525
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,507
Working, man. I got those TV
pitch meetings. I was gonna call you.

526
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,425
Yeah, so why didn't you?

527
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,100
All right, look, you want the truth?

528
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,978
- I was away. I went to A.C.
- Where's my money?

529
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,939
- I don't have it yet.
- But you went to A.C?

530
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,317
I have a meeting next week
with Rene Balcer.

531
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,321
Dick Wolf's right-hand guy.

532
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,491
He likes my stuff, he told my agent.
I'm gonna be on staff.

533
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,452
I got out of that business
because people fuck you over.

534
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,996
Jon Favreau?

535
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,248
Faggot cocksucker
tried to steal my ideas.

536
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,834
Bro, listen. I swear on all that's holy...

537
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,545
...I'll have your money next week.
That wasn't the deal.

538
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,173
I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't make me a jerk off.

539
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,096
Damn, I'm happy. Get a load of these.

540
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:29,352
My new kicks. Bottega Veneta,
marked down to only 600.

541
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,147
Thought you were paying your phone bill.

542
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,192
I should have, I know...

543
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,111
...but it's been so long
since I've been able to...

544
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,529
...treat myself.

545
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,910
Oh, thanks.

546
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,788
So...

547
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,458
...turns out my Uncle Zio's
going downhill.

548
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:55,295
The day we met, I told you, we were
there at the cemetery to bury his wife.

549
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,880
My Aunt Concetta.

550
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,383
Seventy years they were together.

551
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,136
Poor guy's taking it very hard.

552
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,649
My knight in shining armor.

553
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,741
So?

554
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,578
- Yeah, good morning to you too.
- You got it?

555
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,249
Jesus. You are a fucking trip.

556
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,585
I'm J.T. by the way.

557
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,171
What is this, Pulp Fiction?
Am I supposed to be afraid?

558
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,258
- I don't know, I didn't see it.
- You're really being a prick, huh?

559
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,760
I told you, I need more time,
I don't have the money.

560
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,471
- Then fucking get it.
- Chris, you know me.

561
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,724
What could you possibly do to me
that I haven't already been through?

562
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,435
I'm positive we'll think of something.

563
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,730
My God.

564
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,287
And 66 years
after taking those sacred vows:

565
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,539
"Till death do us part"...

566
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,458
...Concetta left him
and went home to God.

567
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,297
In the two weeks that followed,
Nicolo struggled without her...

568
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,342
...finally succumbing
to irredeemable loss.

569
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,639
The enormity of his grief
can hardly be imagined.

570
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,102
How much they went through together.

571
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,022
Seeing their children grow.

572
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:42,235
And looking joyfully on,
as their grandchildren had children.

573
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,196
Sickness and health.

574
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,990
Good times and bad.

575
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,410
But through it all,
one thing remained constant:

576
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,912
They had each other.

577
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,417
It was Nicolo's love for Concetta
that made him leave this earth...

578
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,754
...a mere 15 days after she left him.

579
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,923
We take comfort knowing
they're together again...

580
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,176
...seated at the foot of our Lord.

581
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,638
Let us join together in prayer.

582
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,515
- Hail Mary...
- Full of grace...

583
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,809
...the Lord is with thee.

584
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,354
Blessed art thou among women...

585
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,523
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

586
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,276
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

587
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,405
...pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of our death.

588
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,032
Amen.

589
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,659
- What's the matter?
- Our Father...

590
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,536
- This fucking shit.
- Who art in heaven...

591
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,538
- Hallowed be Thy Name.
- What's the point?

592
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,998
- Thy Kingdom come.
- Uncle Jun.

593
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,000
- Thy Will be done...
- I can't take it.

594
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,377
On earth as it is in Heaven.

595
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,878
You need to lower your voice.

596
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,547
Give us this day our daily bread.

597
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,883
And forgive us our trespasses...

598
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:51,012
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

599
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,390
It's a fucking Emmy.

600
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,475
And it's gold-plated.

601
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,603
Then melt it down, man.

602
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:03,191
- Look, I told you $15.
- Oh, fuck, man, come on.

603
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,902
This is, like, huge, this shit.

604
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,406
If you had an Oscar, maybe I could
give you a little something.

605
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,825
An Academy Award. But TV?

606
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,912
- What else you got?
- I don't know.

607
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:22,752
- I got a laptop in my car.
- Yeah, okay. Cool. I'll check that out.

608
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,186
From your friend. All 1200.

609
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,689
He give you a hard time?

610
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,608
Hardest thing was keeping him awake.

611
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:50,405
- He's hitting the vein, nodding out.
- Son of a fucking bitch.

612
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,119
Cheers.

613
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,667
I'm grilling us some filet mignon.

614
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,712
And you take a load off.

615
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,638
Here, this is the money from the closing.

616
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,934
- The racetrack. It's 150 grand.
- That's great.

617
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,769
How's your pal, Hesh?

618
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,023
- Good.
- I remember once...

619
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,734
...your dad and I drove down the shore.

620
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:32,030
Hesh had rented a place at Point
Pleasant. It was right before Labor Day.

621
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,573
Actually...

622
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,658
...it was a couple of months
before he died.

623
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,287
We stopped at a liquor store,
he had to pee, I needed some cigarettes.

624
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,499
And anyway, the man behind
the counter was blind.

625
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,336
- Your dad looks at him...
- Oh, wait a minute.

626
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,632
- This is after my dad got sick?
- Yeah.

627
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,592
Dad caught emphysema,
you kept smoking?

628
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,138
- He didn't mind.
- He could barely breathe.

629
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,432
We had the oxygen tent
set up right in the house.

630
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,518
I mean, Jesus Christ,
even my mother quit.

631
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,146
I offered to stop. I mean...
And he didn't want me to.

632
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,857
He was fine with it, really.

633
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,277
All right, whatever. Finish your story.

634
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,695
It was dumb.

635
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,866
Your dad got the guy
to give us some champagne.

636
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:30,880
Water chestnuts wrapped in bacon...

637
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,217
...and dip them in the duck sauce.

638
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,553
All right.

639
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,644
Delicious.

640
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,022
So, what's in the bag?

641
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,612
Yeah, I wanted to show you this.

642
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,616
It's the hat I told you about.

643
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,076
JFK's.

644
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,246
Oh, my goodness.

645
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,582
Look at this.

646
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,542
- May I?
- Yeah.

647
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,472
Happy birthday

648
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,976
To you

649
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,937
Happy birthday

650
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,108
To you

651
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,613
Happy birthday

652
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,992
Mr. President

653
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:47,457
Happy birthday

654
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:54,130
To you

655
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,224
I met with the Dick Wolf guy.

656
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,144
They hired some kid from Yale.

657
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:12,523
Plus, now the money I owe you.

658
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,068
My ex-fucking-wife.

659
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,612
How many times have you shot up?

660
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,323
Five, six.

661
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,327
I thought I had it under control.
I lost it.

662
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,162
You stupid fuck.

663
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,206
You were doing so good,
now you fucked it all up.

664
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,458
Where do you get the right?

665
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:34,462
We're in the program. You're gonna use,
why didn't you call your sponsor?

666
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,423
- I couldn't get him.
- So why the fuck didn't you call me?

667
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:48,059
Yeah, but I don't fucking
live with my mistress.

668
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,770
I mean, his fucking slippers?

669
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,023
Go on.

670
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,402
Well, when I left there...

671
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,321
...I started thinking about it.

672
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:07,745
When I was, I don't know,
16 years old...

673
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,456
...my son's age.

674
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:15,670
I came home from school and there
was this note from my Aunt Quin.

675
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:22,677
My mother had been pregnant
with another kid after my sister Barbara.

676
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,680
"Change of life baby" they called it and...

677
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,100
Well, she started bleeding.

678
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,896
I was supposed to find my father
and get him over there ASAP.

679
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,525
I called every number I had.
I left messages all over town.

680
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:46,701
And finally that night, about 10:00,
he called me back.

681
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,334
- Hello?
- Anthony, what's the matter?

682
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,794
Ma's in the hospital.

683
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:00,840
I think she was... She was bleeding.
The baby.

684
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,010
Jesus Christ.

685
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:08,055
Oh, shit.

686
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,726
Okay, pal.

687
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,645
The lamb chops
are gonna be overcooked.

688
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,815
I'm tied up.

689
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,234
But I'm gonna get over
to the hospital right away.

690
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,112
He came and got me the next morning.

691
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,034
We went over to the hospital.

692
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,952
Walked into her room.

693
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,372
- You're okay, baby, you're okay.
- No, you're okay!

694
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,417
Your life is just so wonderful and okay.

695
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,294
Li.

696
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,382
Where were you last night?

697
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,553
I was at the Yankee game.

698
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,680
You were with that whore.

699
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:54,268
- What do you take me for, an idiot?
- No, Li, that's not true.

700
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,396
I picked up Anthony from school,
we went to the game.

701
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,981
Nicky gave us the tickets.

702
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:03,611
- You're a goddamn liar.
- I swear to God, Li, the car broke down.

703
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:08,157
The timing belt.
We had to stay at cousin Jimmy's.

704
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,285
Madonna, when we got home
and saw that note...

705
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,329
I was worried sick.

706
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,499
Ask Anthony, you don't believe me.

707
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,965
Where were you last night, Anthony?

708
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,595
We were at cousin Jimmy's, Ma.

709
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,227
She could have fucking died.

710
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,437
You know, from her miscarriage.

711
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,872
- Fuck her.
- Was there any blame on his part?

712
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,623
This man you emulate?

713
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,837
The lies?
The betrayals with other women?

714
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,385
Listen to me.

715
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,597
This is very important:
Your mother had her faults.

716
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:16,434
But after all this time,
what should we do with the old woman?

717
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,853
Have an auto-da-fé?

718
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,105
Burn her at the stake?

719
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,903
You need to forgive her and move on.

720
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,746
She made my father give my dog away.

721
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,081
I thought your father
was a big tough guy.

722
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,876
He probably didn't wanna hear
her bullshit anymore.

723
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,672
He gave my dog away to his
girlfriend's kid. Big fucking deal.

724
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,758
If it was up to her...

725
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,552
...she would have had it killed.

726
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,025
All right, thanks.

727
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:11,781
Book value's 17 grand.
I'll knock that off the principle.

728
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,827
I fucking love this car.

729
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,538
So you'll get another one.

730
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,130
Is that your sponsor?

731
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,637
I'll see you when you get out of rehab.
We'll figure out the rest of the payments.

732
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,725
You can do this, man.
I have faith in you.

733
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,063
There's no chemical solution
to a spiritual problem.

734
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,004
It could have been another TIA,
it's hard to tell.

735
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,631
Was any of this accompanied
by a lapse in memory?

736
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,678
I don't know.

737
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,431
Had you brought him in right away,
I might have answers.

738
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:23,769
That medicine stopped working.
I took more and it didn't do shit.

739
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,354
I'm like the walking dead.

740
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:29,150
Medication's like cooking, sometimes
we just need to adjust the ingredients.

741
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,611
Who gives a shit? I'm so fucking blue.

742
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:37,074
Well, what do you expect?
All you do is go to funerals all the time.

743
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:43,497
I'm trapped. What's the goddamn point?
Goddamn house arrest.

744
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,671
My life is only death.

745
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,382
I'm living in a grave.

746
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:57,219
I beat prison, and for what?

747
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,722
I have no children.

748
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,517
Would somebody
please explain this to me?

749
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,402
So Hesh tells me...

750
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,071
...you met your dad's goomar.

751
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,201
Yeah.

752
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,246
You had to see this woman in her prime.

753
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,167
- Nice, huh?
- Nice?

754
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,337
She was JFK's girlfriend
for, like, three years.

755
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,005
No shit?

756
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:37,218
- Right, I remember hearing about her.
- Fucking knockout. Beautiful. Classy.

757
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,970
JFK, huh?

758
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,472
How do you like that?

759
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,060
He'd have her up to the White House
on the weekends...

760
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,603
...when his wife was out of town.

761
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:56,112
This woman was like a...
Like a princess.

762
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,243
I'll tell you what:

763
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,829
For a while there...

764
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,956
...Jackie Kennedy
thought the marriage was over.
