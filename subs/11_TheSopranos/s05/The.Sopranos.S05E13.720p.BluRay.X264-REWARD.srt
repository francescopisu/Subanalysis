1
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,817
You were right.
Forensics has signed off on him.

2
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,860
The body can be released.

3
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,114
Phil, why don't you wait
until they fix him up over there?

4
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,784
I promised our mother
I'd see him like we knew him, Jimmy.

5
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,203
Before they put on
all that pancake and shit.

6
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,307
Oh, for Madonna santa.

7
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,270
Your funeral director's car is here.
I'll go down and meet them.

8
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,571
John, how long I gotta wait?

9
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,365
Tony Soprano left to his own device...

10
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,993
...is never gonna give up
that fucking animal Blundetto.

11
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,371
- Philly.
- An eye for an eye?

12
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,595
This is kind of fun.

13
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:04,516
But if I was you, I'd dump this job.

14
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,019
I'd go to Italy.

15
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,608
This is no way for a caretaker to live.

16
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,820
Well, a few things
have to settle down first.

17
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,198
My cousin will send me funds
to go through Canada.

18
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,117
Italy, wow. Nice cousin.

19
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:38,884
Oh, hey, thanks for that massage.
My toe doesn't hurt hardly at all now.

20
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,140
Watch the windows.

21
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,352
Ho!

22
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,396
Excuse me. How you doing?

23
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,815
- You're Joanne, right?
- Who are you?

24
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,651
Well, we're friends of your son's.

25
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,320
My son doesn't live with me.

26
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,531
We're from Alcoholics Anonymous.

27
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,409
- What's your name?
- Well, we're anonymous.

28
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,287
I see his car's out front.

29
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,539
He went to California or Vegas.
I don't know.

30
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,626
California or Vegas. When did he leave?

31
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,086
Sorry, I have to go to work.

32
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,046
- Where the fuck is he?
- Phil...

33
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,173
Leave me alone.

34
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,841
I had a brother your son's age.

35
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,010
Please, let go of my hand.

36
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,221
Where the fuck is he, you fucking cunt?

37
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,599
I'll take that Discman
and I'll ram it up your box.

38
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,019
Philly, Philly, please. Please.

39
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,648
It's the guy's mother, Phil.
It's the guy's mother.

40
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,949
Oh, man, those jocks are juicers.
They'll do it just for the free brew.

41
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,325
You're still here?

42
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,953
I'm driving to school.
I don't have to leave as early.

43
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,955
He'll bring some cool people.

44
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,541
- Hey, what are you doing up?
- Snow blower.

45
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,919
Seems to me you are not
sleeping that well, period.

46
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,256
- Look at you.
- Told A.J. to fix this leak...

47
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,967
...while I was still living at my mother's.

48
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,763
What's going on with him?

49
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,850
Every time I go by the room,
he's flopped on the bed, on the phone.

50
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,060
I am so sick of nagging him.

51
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,981
If he thinks he's gonna get into East
Stroudsburg State, he's sadly mistaken.

52
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,157
Now, look at this kid out there,
the gardener's son.

53
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,910
- Can't ask this one to take out the trash.
- Poverty is a great motivator.

54
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,669
- You think we gave A.J. too much?
- Then look at Meadow.

55
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,297
Same house, same everything.
She's doing great.

56
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,923
She takes after you, maybe.

57
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,925
Don't do that. He's my son too.

58
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,307
Well, I got that appointment with
his coach today. Maybe he's got a clue.

59
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,393
- Hello?
- In here, Dad.

60
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,857
Hey, there's my little amaretto cookie.

61
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,526
Clear a place
so we can take a look at these.

62
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,487
They're only preliminary drawings.

63
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,447
I've got scones if anybody wants.

64
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,241
Meadow! Take a look at the house
your mother's gonna build!

65
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,868
Well, and Grandpa, of course.

66
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:15,248
Tony, Ignatz is responsible for those
Normandy chateaus up on Tisch Drive.

67
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,544
Wow, look at that entry.
What is that, like three stories high?

68
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,860
- T?
- Christopher, hi. It's Carmela.

69
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,695
- Is Adriana there?
- No.

70
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,282
I was just wondering what was going on.
I stopped by Fortunoff.

71
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,994
She was supposed to get back to them
with a decision about her china pattern.

72
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,665
And she hasn't returned their calls.
Is everything all right?

73
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,752
We broke up.

74
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,547
What? Why? What happened?

75
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,425
Nothing. She left. Broke my heart.

76
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,677
Moved out a couple days ago.
Haven't seen her.

77
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,638
Oh, no. That's terrible.
Are you all right?

78
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,183
She stiffed me on the club, never showed
for work. The place is rudderless.

79
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:19,438
- Oh, my God. Is there anything I can do?
- No.

80
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,732
Well, look, I gotta go.
Somebody's waiting for me.

81
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,234
I am devastated.

82
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,445
I wish I could reach her.
Is there a number?

83
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,948
- Not that I know of.
- Chris, listen.

84
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,575
There's other fish in the sea.

85
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,370
I know. Thanks.

86
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,899
Tony Soprano and Vito Spatafore
talking about the bus-station project.

87
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,067
Adriana La Cerva.

88
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,862
Way we make it, she's either taken off
or gotten clipped.

89
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,572
- You hear anything?
- Clipped? Why?

90
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,703
- Stepping out on her boyfriend.
- I heard she took off.

91
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,915
- Any idea where?
- How should I know? He's a dope addict.

92
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,125
Did I already give you that?

93
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,422
- If you hear anything, let me know.
- Say hello to Ike and the guys.

94
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,389
T's held up.
He said to start without him.

95
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,892
- Right?
- Yeah.

96
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,978
What can we say about this guy?

97
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,939
The ancient Romans had a word for it.

98
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,484
Asshole.

99
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,696
In all candor, though,
we love you, Raymond.

100
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,164
Take that setup away. He ain't coming.

101
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,458
- Who, Chris?
- South with the geese.

102
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,919
Christopher is the logical sacrifice bunt.

103
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,505
- Make up for the dead brother.
- I'm his brother-in-law.

104
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,216
You think New York is really
gonna come after you, Bobby?

105
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,926
What the fuck do I know?

106
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,346
If you're them, he wants somebody
close to Tony as possible.

107
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,098
And who knows him better and longer?

108
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,726
Don't think Johnny's not gonna put
a financial squeeze on us.

109
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,313
Tell me about it. I'm already getting
fucked with by Johnny's people.

110
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,441
- It's not good.
- All due respect...

111
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,028
...I'm willing to die for a good cause.
This is bullshit.

112
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,447
- There he is!
- Hey, hey.

113
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,992
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down, sit down.

114
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,246
What's going on?

115
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,040
Vito misto, how are you?

116
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,961
- Happy birthday, Ray.
- Thanks for coming, Ton.

117
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,256
I brought these plus...
That's a good one.

118
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,966
"Acuto di Soprano."

119
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,760
I serve it at my house. It's from Avellino.

120
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,972
My grandfather said that some
of my ancestors were winemakers...

121
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,891
...but what the fuck do I know, huh?
Thanks, Ton.

122
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,021
- That's gonna be a treasure.
- Yeah, well, whatever.

123
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,400
Larry! What the fuck are you doing here?

124
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,861
- I thought you were under house arrest?
- Fuck them.

125
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,530
I ever see that prison doctor,
God forbid, I'm gonna say:

126
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,326
"Fuckstick, they ever show you these
in medical school? They're called balls."

127
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,870
Good for you!

128
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,999
Listen, I can't stay.

129
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,835
I got a meeting I gotta go to.

130
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,004
Got something I wanna say.

131
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,885
My cousin Anthony
went into business for himself...

132
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,553
We all know this.

133
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,222
In a way, for which there is no excuse.

134
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,768
He's got a problem with rage.

135
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,564
He disappointed me, Anthony, in
ways that I can't even begin to tell you.

136
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,318
And he put us all at risk.

137
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,196
Irregardless...

138
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,450
...it's been made clear to me
that if they put their hands on him...

139
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,577
...he will not be dealt with quick.

140
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,330
I'm talking torture.

141
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,960
For that reason, even if I knew
where my cousin was... And I do not.

142
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,296
I would not deliver him up to them.

143
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,009
I am offering him the same protection
that I would offer any of you...

144
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,137
...in similar circumstances.

145
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,224
I know what you're gonna say:
"I would never do what he did."

146
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,142
God bless, I hope not.

147
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,645
But we are a family.

148
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,606
And even in this fucked-up day and age,
that means something.

149
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,610
So we are gonna deal with this
as a family, together...

150
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,072
...no matter how it affects anybody
personal safety-wise...

151
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,574
...financially-wise, whatever.

152
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,126
I see that my nephew isn't here
and it's important he lam it now.

153
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,255
It's my desire that you circle
the wagons, you support him.

154
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,468
Until and as such.

155
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,356
Raymond, sorry I can't stay.

156
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,110
- Happy birthday, huh?
- Thanks.

157
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,905
- Gentlemen, enjoy your dinner.
- See you, T.

158
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,706
Thank you. That was great.

159
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,044
Thought you had Raymond's dinner.

160
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,005
I left early.

161
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,090
It's nice you're home.

162
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,343
There's chicken parm.

163
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,348
Was Christopher there?

164
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,935
No.

165
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,396
- You know him and Adriana broke up?
- No.

166
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:58,568
This kid. That's his trouble.
He keeps it all bottled up.

167
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,738
Then they wonder why
they get chemical dependencies.

168
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,001
Do you think there was somebody else?

169
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,755
Because there was this one night,
way back.

170
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,841
It was movie night with the girls.
Adriana was very upset.

171
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,386
She wanted to get something
off her chest. Then she ran out crying.

172
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,097
You know,
I'll bet she was seeing somebody.

173
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,935
You never know about people.

174
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,898
His plans were often
startling, instinctive, spontaneous...

175
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,026
...and not infrequently obscure.

176
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:44,989
His men idolized him
and had boundless faith in him.

177
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,245
After being promoted in 1916,
he joyfully returned home on leave...

178
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,165
...to marry his sweetheart,
Lucie Maria Mollin.

179
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,586
She would be
the love of his life to its end.

180
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,215
Rommel saw the huge assault
on France forming...

181
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,301
...and he saw that the new
armored weapon would be at the...

182
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,596
I still love this old house so much.

183
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,599
I should do half so good
with my stupid project.

184
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,937
Panzer Division, was almost
precisely what he had done as a lieutenant.

185
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,106
Yeah.

186
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,441
He was directing
the efforts of a single tank.

187
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,694
I'm sorry, did you want to be alone?

188
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,154
No. No.

189
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:29,784
It was blitzkrieg in its purest form.
It was Rommel.

190
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:57,020
He had what the
Germans call Fingerspitzengefühl...

191
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:03,401
...which is a sixth sense
of sizing up the situation.

192
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,007
- Hey.
- Claude Rains.

193
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,010
- Thanks for doing this.
- About 1500 there.

194
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,638
It should tide you over.

195
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,139
- Hey, Sil.
- Hey, kid.

196
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,183
You want something? Fries?

197
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,103
- Fucking something this situation, huh?
- Right.

198
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,398
I can't even get down to Milt's.
Fence some jewelry.

199
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,152
Everybody with eyes in the back
of their head. Shit, I was Tony's driver.

200
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,322
It's amazing. You want me to be honest?

201
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,283
The favoritism Tony still shows
for our fucking cousin...

202
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,035
...after what he's done?

203
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,245
What does Tony B. have on this guy?

204
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,373
I'm supposed to take a bullet
for this skive.

205
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:03,086
After all your uncle's done for you,
I need to get into specifics?

206
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,853
Said you went home.

207
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,401
Trisha. Just heard her old man died.

208
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,611
I'll give her a call.

209
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,707
Actually, I been hanging around
on purpose.

210
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,917
I gotta talk to you, Ton.

211
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,336
About what?

212
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,882
Ton, I've been the consigliere
for a lot of years...

213
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,052
Don't go into a fucking preamble.
Just tell me what's on your mind.

214
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,431
- You got some unhappy people out there.
- No shit.

215
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,433
Not just the young guys.

216
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,935
Guys that have been with you
since the beginning.

217
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,313
Since before the beginning.
Guys who worked for your father.

218
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,566
- Fucking Paulie, right?
- I'm not saying nothing.

219
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,277
- Yeah, well, goddamn him.
- These guys, Ton...

220
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,237
...will do whatever you order.

221
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,368
- Except in this case.
- Don't say it like that.

222
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,120
Forget that Blundetto's my cousin.

223
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,582
I give him up, we can give
the whole fucking thing up.

224
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,418
Here's where the conversation
gets difficult.

225
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,379
- Go.
- All due respect...

226
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,383
...you were ready to hand
him your cousin a week ago.

227
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:37,472
It's not about standing with the guys
or upholding some rules. Not really.

228
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,808
Then what's it all about?
Why don't you illuminate me?

229
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,102
It's about you don't wanna eat shit
from John.

230
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,272
You don't wanna bow down.

231
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,566
You told him to go fuck himself...

232
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:53,029
...which, to be honest,
wasn't exactly appropriate, considering.

233
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,323
- Oh, is that right?
- All due respect.

234
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,117
What the fuck do you know
what goes on in my head?

235
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,578
I known you since you were a kid, Ton.

236
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,373
Frankly, you got a problem
with authority.

237
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,088
This attitude of yours...

238
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,965
...it's a lot of what's made you
an effective leader.

239
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,551
But we all got flaws. Even you.

240
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,181
Seven deadly sins and yours is pride.

241
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,272
All due respect.

242
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,151
You got no fucking idea
what it's like to be number one.

243
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,989
Every decision you make affects every
facet of every other fucking thing.

244
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,658
It's too much to deal with almost.

245
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,578
And in the end,
you're completely alone with it all.

246
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,128
I'm sorry you feel that way.

247
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,879
This is the course I've chosen.

248
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,549
And those of you that are not
with me on it...

249
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,511
...well, that makes me sad
and it'll be dealt with in time.

250
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,865
You need me for anything else?

251
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,085
- Benny, right?
- How you doing, Mr. Leotardo?

252
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:17,089
I'm sitting listening to WFAN and I go,
"Isn't that the kid that drove for Tony?"

253
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,758
I'm on my way to the hospital.

254
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,301
Well, that's up to you.

255
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,345
No, no, I mean my mom, she...

256
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,223
- Where's your boss's friend?
- What friend?

257
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,725
Don't fuck with me, kid.
Don't fuck with me!

258
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,909
- Where's Blundetto?
- I don't know!

259
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,125
It's a start.

260
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,761
- Hey, Ton.
- Hey, Ton.

261
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,481
Jesus.

262
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,525
He has a fractured skull.

263
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:25,074
- Is he talking at all?
- A little.

264
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,545
Listen, Ben, I want you to know
that this is all gonna be taken care of...

265
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,923
...through the plumbers union
health plan. I'm gonna see to that.

266
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,680
You know what? We were talking here...

267
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,807
...and it's time you get
your own customers.

268
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,852
You're getting a little too old
to be beating people up.

269
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,319
- Where's Larry?
- He's staying home.

270
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,070
He's the boy's godfather.

271
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,323
He called me,
said he was gonna be down here.

272
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,241
House arrest.

273
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,040
All right.

274
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,548
This is fucked up.

275
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,135
- What do you wanna do about it?
- What do I wanna do about it?

276
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,095
I want that man
to do something about it.

277
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,765
I want him to give us the okay
to drive to Brooklyn...

278
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,850
...clean some fucking timepieces
over there.

279
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,312
Tony Blundetto
whacked the brother of a captain.

280
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,315
Tony tried to strike at them again?
We should take him out.

281
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:51,952
Look, just give me that first one,
the Oregonian, 39.95.

282
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,625
Oh, you're sending a fruit basket
to the kid. He'll appreciate it.

283
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,795
It's for Mel. The poor guy had
a stroke, you believe it?

284
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,838
- He's younger than me.
- Melvoin?

285
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,593
- Jesus Christ, that's terrible.
- That's why I asked you to come over.

286
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:12,973
His speech. He'll sound
a little stonato, probably forever.

287
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:17,269
But get this.
Nine months, maybe a year...

288
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,772
...till he can work a full schedule.

289
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,525
They'll have to postpone my retrial.

290
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,652
No shit.

291
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,737
The question is should I use the stall...

292
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,573
...but then get a lawyer
who's more with it?

293
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,329
So you heard about this thing
with Phil and John?

294
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,918
- Bobby said something about this.
- But you're losing money, probably.

295
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,338
- I am? How much?
- Oh, you gotta talk to him.

296
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,507
- John?
- Bobby!

297
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,134
Does John do your collections?

298
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,893
Look, Uncle Jun, what do you think?

299
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,646
John beat one of my guys
to within an inch of his life.

300
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,440
Next time he's gonna kill somebody.

301
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,651
But what can I do? It's my cousin.

302
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,366
Did I give them the office address
or the home?

303
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,121
- I'm talking.
- The man had a stroke.

304
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,374
You want it to go to the wrong place?
It's fruit. It'll rot.

305
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,086
Hey. I painted myself into a corner here.

306
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,671
And I don't see a way out.

307
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,923
But he wasn't made, right?

308
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,302
The kid. Phil's son.

309
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,268
It's okay, forget it.

310
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,105
I'm sorry, but I'm fucking
nonplussed with all this news.

311
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:47,568
Frankly, I don't know. You're going
a little squirrelly in this house.

312
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,821
- Tell Phil.
- Tell Phil what?

313
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,412
Where you going?

314
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,873
You wanted to confer with me?

315
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,002
It's not important.

316
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,965
Make sure you eat a lunch today.

317
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,902
Poor fucking Feech La Manna.
Tony sent the wrong ex-con back to jail.

318
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,573
You realize I had a container of imported
provolone coming into that port Saturday?

319
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,992
That fucking Phil
and them put it on a truck...

320
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,579
...took it to Westchester instead of
Rahway where we always split the loads.

321
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,749
Jesus. That shit is liquid gold.

322
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,459
Tony knows what has to be done.

323
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,295
Tell John where to find Tony Blundetto.
He just won't do it.

324
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,297
As if he even knows where Tony B. is.

325
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,175
Give me a fucking break.
Of course he knows.

326
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,387
- It's Christopher I feel for.
- Please. Let me tell you something.

327
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,808
Anthony Soprano is very adroit at keeping
his family out of the fucking frying pan.

328
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,935
Both cousins. The rest of us:

329
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,647
How is life now that you're back home?

330
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,322
Carmela?

331
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,450
I had a dream a couple weeks ago.

332
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,162
Before I moved back, recurring dream.

333
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,542
- See my old coach from high school.
- What happens?

334
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:36,093
Well, see he told me back then,
this guy, he said...

335
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,181
- Said that I was special.
- You never told me this.

336
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,558
Why now?

337
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,893
Does everything I drag here
gotta be a dead dog?

338
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,191
I went to see my son's football coach.

339
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,486
See, he was starting my boy...

340
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,907
...now coach is going to this other kid.
What's the reason?

341
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,745
Well, A.J.'s just devoting more energy
to academics.

342
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,872
He wants to get
into a good school.

343
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,797
How's things on other fronts?
Your cousin?

344
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:21,263
Well, you touched on something there
that's not so good.

345
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,391
- What's the problem?
- I really can't talk to you about it.

346
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,728
This is very difficult for me
treating you...

347
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,939
...when so much of your life
is closed off.

348
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,691
How many times can I say this?

349
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,402
Look, I'm not trying to be difficult here.

350
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,697
It affects me tremendously,
this trouble he's gotten himself into.

351
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,824
So I'm upset.

352
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,493
Well...

353
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,245
And I care about him so much.

354
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,414
You care about him so much?

355
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,501
We spent hours
getting to the realization...

356
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,880
...that your feelings for your cousin
stem from guilt and shame.

357
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,423
Do you remember that?

358
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:00,010
- Do you care?
- It's just that it doesn't matter now...

359
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,473
It's just that here we are as always,
back at square one.

360
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,018
With you going into
high sentimentality mode.

361
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,938
Sentimentality mode?
We were children together!

362
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,650
Look, it's a lot like with your son.

363
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,444
Here's what I bet the coach
didn't tell you.

364
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,947
What you wanted to hear most...

365
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:24,243
...is that your son is special too.

366
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,748
What I'm saying is,
whatever you wanna do...

367
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:35,087
...vis-à-vis your cousin,
your son, whoever, own your feelings.

368
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,509
I'm very confused.

369
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,096
But we can't talk about it.

370
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,307
It's my mess.

371
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,856
All my choices were wrong.

372
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,320
- How much?
- It's 5 bucks.

373
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,325
It's 5 bucks.

374
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,994
Your cup's your admission pass.

375
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,712
- Where they from?
- Montville.

376
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,922
- They gotta go.
- Totally.

377
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,301
- Hello?
- Chiara!

378
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,596
- Hi!
- You gotta come up Greenbrook Road.

379
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,392
Patrick said to tell you guys
some people have bogus cups.

380
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,145
They brought them with them
to get out of paying.

381
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,151
Hey, man. Let me see your cup.

382
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,321
- It's back in the Athletic Department.
- We're getting ripped off.

383
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:46,074
You think this is like downloading music?
That beer's ours unless you pay for it.

384
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,996
Fucking manners!

385
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,092
Yeah!

386
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,971
Oh, come on.

387
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,166
Speak.

388
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,128
Hello?

389
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:49,179
Hello? Hello.

390
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,198
- Who is it?
- Open this door.

391
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:16,290
Wanna talk to you.
I hear you got some beefs.

392
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,919
Do you wanna phone everybody?

393
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,845
What the fuck?

394
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,265
I know you said
you wanted it burnt, T...

395
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,684
...but the picture moved me.

396
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,687
It's because you knew it cost me
an arm and a leg.

397
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,398
It's museum-quality work, I admit that.

398
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,610
But I told the guys, the chance
to hang a picture of you on my wall.

399
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,445
I rescued it from the flames.

400
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,196
What's with the hat and shit?

401
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,158
Don't give me "huh."
You know what it does to me?

402
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,662
- To be reminded of that fucking horse?
- I'm sorry, T.

403
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,123
But you never come here no more.

404
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,875
I didn't figure it'd be a problem.

405
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:09,217
I never come here no more
because they're watching all our houses.

406
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,304
- It's no good for us to visit.
- I know.

407
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,062
What do you get a big laugh out of that?

408
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,356
- That's no joke, T.
- Then what the fuck is it?

409
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,901
That's no joke. That cost me a lot
of money to get the retouching done.

410
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,488
What the fuck you do it for?
Don't bullshit me, Paulie.

411
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,200
Part of it, all right, was to fix
some fire damage on the guy's feet.

412
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:37,913
But while I was at it I also thought
I don't have a modern look in here.

413
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,124
So go with something more traditional.

414
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,044
Something that catches
more of what you're about.

415
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,671
A goddamn lawn jockey?

416
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,591
That's not a lawn jockey.
That's a general.

417
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,261
What general? Who?

418
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:57,099
It's not a real general from history.
It's you.

419
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,115
What the fuck?

420
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,620
Speak.

421
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:11,418
He's at 146 Route 9A, Kinderhook.

422
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,716
- Skip.
- How's it going?

423
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,970
- Hey.
- Hey, Ton.

424
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,605
We got you your bialys and coffee.

425
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,654
Johnny Sack called for you.

426
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,824
Called a couple of times.
He seemed to be upset about something.

427
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,213
Good bialy.

428
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,382
Any time, boss.

429
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,072
Catch you later.

430
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,537
Take it easy, Ton.

431
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,761
- What?
- It didn't solve a thing.

432
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,930
- It's over, John.
- The fuck it is!

433
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,890
He's beside himself now.

434
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,352
The best thing for him,
for you, for all of us...

435
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,522
...is to put this thing behind us
and get back to business.

436
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,527
- How is that supposed to happen?
- Something we gotta talk about.

437
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,322
As a first step I'd consider giving Phil...

438
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,866
...quarter of my points
in the Bloomfield operation...

439
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,451
...which my cousin was running.

440
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,497
I'm at Columbia Pres all day.
My yearly physical.

441
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,833
An hour already
I'm waiting for this doctor.

442
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:01,087
Then I got bone density tests, lipids.
Come to the city tonight, we'll sit down.

443
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,841
No offense, John, but I got
an IQ of 136. It's been tested.

444
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,723
All right. Tomorrow morning then,
my house, 6:30.

445
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,725
- What?
- I'm on a 9 a.m. flight to Miami.

446
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,686
- I have to get things in line down there.
- John...

447
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,398
You think I'm gonna give you ammazz
with Ginny upstairs?

448
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:28,239
- If you don't hear from me, I'll be there.
- Tony. You and you alone.

449
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,950
I'm not having Phil. Nobody.

450
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,794
- Who is it?
- It's me.

451
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,899
Go up to the farm
and pick up your cousin.

452
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,364
I need you to go up there now,
this morning.

453
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,200
May be over. But watch your back.

454
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,538
Take him off the premises, obviously.

455
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,917
Should be buried.

456
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,922
- It should be you that does it.
- You got it.

457
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:37,183
We never got a chance to talk
in detail about Adriana.

458
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,352
I know.

459
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,826
If you let something slip...

460
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,163
...if she saw anything.

461
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,667
There was a couple of times I had her
with me picking up collections.

462
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,752
Esplanade.

463
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,924
The cigarettes, she was
always nosing around.

464
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,473
Did you ever say anything about Ralph?
Or the Bevilaqua kid?

465
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,224
- No.
- Would you remember?

466
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,934
I swear on my life.

467
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,286
You won't find any of that.

468
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,871
I'm reading, I'm lifting weights.

469
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,460
I know what you think, Ton,
but you'll see.

470
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,212
I'm gonna prove myself to you.

471
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,256
I only chipped that once,
on the day with her.

472
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:03,645
She was willing to rat me out because
she couldn't do five fucking years.

473
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,022
- I thought she loved me.
- She's a cunt.

474
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,817
Does no good to think about that now.

475
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,575
All right, so...

476
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,973
No, he does like her.

477
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,307
Because he told me.

478
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,147
- I've heard you talking in here all night.
- Could you knock?

479
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,984
You said you would be
finishing your Stroudsburg application.

480
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,362
You're gonna stroke out if
you can't find a way to control yourself.

481
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,031
- I know.
- Hang that phone up.

482
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,952
Call me back later?

483
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,206
I don't know what to say, you know.

484
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,126
Those applications are late,
you are cooked. It's that simple.

485
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,129
And I do know this because
I have raised you from day one...

486
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,214
...you won't like working at McDonald's.

487
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,383
Could you amp up the drama a little?

488
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,385
You know what?
I don't like the sarcasm.

489
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,430
And I don't want you around here
next year sponging off of us.

490
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,225
So fine. I am withholding all allowance
until those applications are done.

491
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,103
That's not even practical
and you know it.

492
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,523
- What's the matter?
- He hasn't done his applications...

493
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,067
...he isn't getting allowance.
No allowance.

494
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,820
- Well, I have $300 of my own money.
- How?

495
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,239
Me and Matt put on a party.

496
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,033
Five dollars a person.

497
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,201
We made 600 bucks after expenses.

498
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,120
- What expenses?
- The band.

499
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,247
Is that what you've been
on the phone about?

500
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,419
It may interest you to know,
people said it was the best party all year.

501
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,756
- There was drinking, I suppose?
- We just let people into Matt's house.

502
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,966
What they brought
was not under our control.

503
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,429
Do your applications. Now.

504
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,443
What?

505
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,320
You know, it's interesting.

506
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:21,240
- I was talking to his college adviser.
- Who, Wegman?

507
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,285
No, A.J. got switched around,
Miss Merrow.

508
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,914
She mentioned that
A.J. talked to her once...

509
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:32,877
...about what might be good schools
to study event planning.

510
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,630
Event planning?

511
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,678
What the hell is it?

512
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:45,431
I am not really sure.

513
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,854
- It's gay, isn't it?
- I don't know.

514
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,565
I know you're around
a lot of wealthy people.

515
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,569
And then he watches that DVD
over and over again.

516
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,780
The one with Mike Myers about...

517
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,616
What's his name? ...Steve Rubell,
the Studio 54 guy.

518
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,743
Oh, Jesus.

519
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,669
Yeah, but I mean, you know it...

520
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,635
Well, I guess, you know.

521
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,637
I don't know.

522
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:29,016
He's fired up about something at least.

523
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,929
So? Go ahead.

524
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,602
Phil has to know that punishment has
been meted out and that's all there is.

525
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,146
And that what we are here for
in the end...

526
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,858
...is to put food on the table
for our families...

527
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,069
...our sons, the future.

528
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,071
That's what's important.

529
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,366
He doesn't accept that.
His family's smaller by one.

530
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,661
Well then, my friend,
it's up to you to make him accept it.

531
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,288
- Me?
- Let's talk, John...

532
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,124
...about the 500-pound elephant
in the room.

533
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,710
Which is that you started
this cycle of bloodshed...

534
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,171
...when you whacked the girl
Carmine used to fuck.

535
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,590
Lorraine Calluzo was not a girl.

536
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,967
And what kind of a man
bangs his second cousin?

537
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,761
What are you, the frigging cardinal?

538
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,808
Look, you wanna shut down
our joint construction jobs?

539
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,768
Eat K rations? Fine.

540
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,770
You want Phil to put one
in one of my guys?

541
00:46:55,979 --> 00:47:00,024
That'll go a long way to making you
the rich prick you always wanted to be.

542
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,359
What do you suggest?

543
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,737
Well, whatever his legitimate sorrow,
he's got a price.

544
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,948
He wants to provide for his family.

545
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,992
- And?
- And what?

546
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,204
Meet his price. And that's it.
I don't wanna hear nothing else.

547
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:17,250
- Oh, you don't?
- I paid enough, John.

548
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,793
I paid a lot.

549
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,348
Maybe I could sell it.

550
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,269
Truth is we've had discussions.
I gave him the sports book.

551
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,771
Why didn't you say that right off?
You cheap fuck.

552
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,314
Because I don't like it.

553
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,442
- He'll want consigliere...
- All right, let's not go backwards now.

554
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,244
These people you run into
wanna be boss, huh?

555
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,621
- They should know.
- I told you.

556
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,039
You don't listen, you nut.

557
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,297
It's good seeing you again.

558
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,217
Still look forward to working
with you, John. I mean that.

559
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:12,096
- You want a coffee?
- Oh, I don't know...

560
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,978
Oh, my fucking Christ.

561
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,080
FBI! Open up!

562
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,709
FBI!

563
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,503
Oh, my God!

564
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,766
I'm the gardener! I'm the...

565
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:07,753
Absolutely, put him on.
Anthony?

566
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:11,966
The Feds just hit Johnny Sack.
You heard anything?

567
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,802
I had Gendler on my cell phone
all the way over here.

568
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,804
Jimmy Petrille was a cooperator.

569
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,099
Brooklyn AUSA took down
the whole Petrille crew, plus Johnny.

570
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,351
Would have reached
all the way to Carmine Sr...

571
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,397
...if he hadn't died.
Jimmy Petrille? He's a sweet old guy.

572
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,983
He gave them gambling,
homicides, trafficking.

573
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,778
Eighteen fucking years' worth.
It's a major kreplach, my friend.

574
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,656
- I was fucking there.
- What? Where?

575
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,200
Johnny's house.
My car's still in the driveway.

576
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,244
I'm walking three miles
towards my house.

577
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,956
No law against parking your car,
unless it's in front of a hydrant.

578
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,125
I'm not laughing, Neil.

579
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,045
No, of course not.

580
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,506
Anyway, you weren't named
in the indictment obviously.

581
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,384
It's Brooklyn.
They weren't coming for you.

582
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:59,847
So frankly, were I you,
I might actually consider laughing.

583
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,558
Or rub a hunchback's hump.
Or something.

584
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,606
- Yeah.
- Be of good cheer.

585
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,066
Call you when I hear more.

586
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:56,422
What happened to you?
Your shoes are soaking wet.
