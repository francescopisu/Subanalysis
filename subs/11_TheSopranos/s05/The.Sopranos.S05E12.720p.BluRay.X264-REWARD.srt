1
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,190
Walter? Hey, you looking for me?

2
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,651
Yeah, the Crazy Horse.
That's you, right?

3
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,655
- Yeah, you got something?
- Yeah, pole camera. Three days ago.

4
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,786
She locks up the club for the night.

5
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,374
She's throwing away the garbage.

6
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,292
Yeah?

7
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,759
But then she changes her mind.

8
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,648
- Funny.
- Interesting.

9
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,192
The good news is no polyps.

10
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,027
The bad news is, as you can see...

11
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,030
...you've got a fairly severe case
of ulcerative colitis.

12
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,408
- Jesus Christ.
- She was getting better.

13
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,451
Then last week, another flare-up.

14
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,456
How you doing with the Prozac?
Is it helping?

15
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,208
- She can't even sleep.
- Ma.

16
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,211
- Well, look at her.
- I'd like to start you on prednisone.

17
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,630
- It's a steroid.
- Like for weight lifters?

18
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,050
I've had a great deal of success with it
treating this type of condition.

19
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,095
I do need to warn you, however,
there are certain side effects.

20
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,638
Mind you, these are temporary.

21
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,225
There's a good chance of weight gain,
accompanied by Cushing's syndrome.

22
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,477
That's a swelling of the facial features.

23
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,771
- Sort of a moon face.
- What?

24
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,482
- Jerry Lewis in the last year or two.
- Oh, my God.

25
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,360
She's planning a wedding,
for Christ's sake.

26
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,781
It was fine one day,
then suddenly I get audio and no picture.

27
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,160
- Somebody been fooling around with it?
- A.J. had his friends over.

28
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,871
Oh, how'd he do
over there with your dad?

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,998
- Out raking the driveway?
- Fine.

30
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,252
Except my mother kept hounding him,
asking if we were getting back together.

31
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,006
You know, I had a dream
that I moved back in here.

32
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,764
You know, just for the record...

33
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,101
...I realize what I did was wrong.

34
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,813
My activities while I lived here.

35
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,316
Knowing you were wrong
isn't the half of it, Tony.

36
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,776
Oh, really?

37
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,402
What's the other half?

38
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,529
Well, suppose something did happen...

39
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,823
...where theoretically
we did get back together.

40
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,867
Any marriage would need fidelity.

41
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,787
Like Popeye says. "I am what I am."

42
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,539
Well, I didn't marry a cartoon.

43
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, it wouldn't be a cartoon.

44
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,046
You had your own indiscretions yourself.

45
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,052
- That thing with Furio?
- I did not sleep with him, Tony.

46
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,389
I'm just saying that, you know,
we're all human, that's all.

47
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,522
You know, the truth is,
I got myself where I am.

48
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,192
But your open indiscretion,
your total disregard...

49
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,361
Well, you're right, it was...
It was horrible.

50
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,447
To have a knot in your stomach
every time the phone rings.

51
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:47,286
Like you were saying, theoretically,
though, if we do reconcile...

52
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,621
...that stuff will never happen again.

53
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,889
Come on,
you gonna go or what?

54
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,808
I'm coming, I was finishing my drink.

55
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,642
Fuck!

56
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,289
You can't stay holed up here.
It's not healthy, Carmine.

57
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,624
How'd it get to this?

58
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,502
Retaliation, counterattacks.

59
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,005
We're at a fucking "stagmire."

60
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,009
We back down now, bunker down...

61
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,887
...what kind of a message
does that send?

62
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,014
Not just to Johnny's people, either.

63
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,933
Billy Leotardo. What the hell was that?

64
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,645
This Blundetto asshole
went off the reservation.

65
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,778
All due respect, Carmine,
that's why you need to get out there.

66
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,196
Put your ear to the street.

67
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,239
Let the guys see you take the reins.

68
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,576
That's not how I wanna handle it.

69
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,717
Hey, don't get me wrong.
I always liked your cousin.

70
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,888
But whacking Phil's brother
was a major poke in the ass.

71
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,684
You know my cousin almost cried
when I put him in charge of the casino?

72
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,812
All I did for that blue-eyed prick.

73
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,439
And he completely fucks me over.

74
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,236
Now I practically gotta get down
on my knees to Johnny Sack.

75
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,614
Where the fuck you been? You're late.

76
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,118
Highway was jammed with broken
heroes on a last-chance power drive.

77
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,913
Oh, you're gonna get fucking cute now?

78
00:06:56,457 --> 00:07:00,502
- Anything on Tony B?
- No, he's still on a milk carton.

79
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,588
There she is.

80
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,340
My smelly valentine.

81
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,175
Christopher, that's not funny.

82
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,433
The fuck are you doing?

83
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,768
I can handle a cocktail
once in a while, right?

84
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,440
You guys okay? You need anything else?

85
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,899
You still feeling sick, hon?

86
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:27,654
Please. They gotta replace her colon
with a semicolon.

87
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,115
Maybe you should be a vegan.

88
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,076
- Doctor says I gotta relax.
- From what?

89
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,831
She's got the world at her feet,
she walks around like impending doom.

90
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,833
Come on, we gotta go.

91
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,425
Take it easy, now.

92
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,056
Don't listen to him. People got
their health, they take it for granted.

93
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:59,227
- How's your thing, the...?
- Just gotta keep an eye on it, that's all.

94
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,024
So Carm and me,
getting back together, maybe.

95
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,650
That's great.

96
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,445
- The kids will be thrilled.
- Yeah.

97
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,364
When we get settled,
we'll have you guys over.

98
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,408
You know, family dinner.

99
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,827
Feel better, huh?

100
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,255
John.

101
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,976
First off...

102
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,648
...let me just say how sorry I am
for your loss. We all are.

103
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,567
Take your fucking "sorrys"
and stick them in your ass.

104
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,071
I could say nothing. Be a heartless prick.

105
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,199
He tried to talk.
He couldn't even say his last words.

106
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,453
Anybody ever die in your arms,
you cocksucker?

107
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,705
A family member? Somebody you love?

108
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,541
No.

109
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,167
Well, give it time.

110
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,211
See if I can't make that happen for you.

111
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,380
All right, that's enough.

112
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,800
- Philly, why don't you go have a drink.
- Don't tell me what to do, Jimmy.

113
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,427
Jimmy's right.

114
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,098
Fuck them, John. Fuck all of them.

115
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:30,026
Was that fucking necessary?
He shouldn't even have been here.

116
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,237
He's got a right to be here.

117
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,448
He's got a right
to a lot of things right now.

118
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,867
My cousin acted alone.
I did not sanction this.

119
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,911
The lone-gunman theory.

120
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,247
You know how close
he and Angelo were in the can.

121
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,707
He flipped the fuck out.

122
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,376
He whacked Joey Peeps,
what flipped him out that time?

123
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,837
What do you want, John?
What do you want me to say?

124
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,549
I want your cousin on a fucking spit.

125
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,136
I don't know where he is.

126
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,055
- Nobody does.
- Fine.

127
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,560
Maybe one of your other relatives, then.

128
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,979
What, I gotta stand here
being threatened now?

129
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,482
- All right, Chrissy.
- All right, nobody's making threats.

130
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,447
Look, Tony's in hiding, John.

131
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,074
You either deliver that prick
to my door...

132
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,994
...or I will rain a shit storm
down on you and your family...

133
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,413
...like you have never fucking seen.

134
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,835
We're done here.

135
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,941
There are over 200,000
species of mollusks.

136
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,528
And right there
is a good example of a conch...

137
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,615
...which is also known
as a knobbed whelk.

138
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,661
See, these raised spines on it
help keep it settled wherever it lands.

139
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,954
That's what I call my dick.

140
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,040
I heard that.

141
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,250
That's just nasty.

142
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,961
Oh, fuck! Check it.

143
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,298
- Oh, shit!
- Hurry up.

144
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,222
Don't touch it.

145
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,100
Apprentice Delaney, get back here!

146
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,152
Little Meadow in a bridal gown.

147
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,823
Madonna. Couple more years,
Grandma and Grandpa.

148
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,574
Bite your tongue.

149
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,459
So the other day,
what you said, I processed it.

150
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,002
Mm hm.

151
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,922
You know, your feelings.

152
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:01,052
It really hit home with me, finally.

153
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,977
You know, with you out of the house,
I had a chance to do a lot of thinking.

154
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,313
I mean, it's partly my fault...

155
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,275
...but I need something else in my life.

156
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,528
You know, with Meadow
getting engaged, A.J. almost...

157
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,572
You want another kid.

158
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,283
No.

159
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,591
It turns out there is a lot
for sale over on Crestview.

160
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,009
A little over an acre.

161
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,846
I was thinking,
I could build a spec house...

162
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,265
...and take my dad in as a partner.

163
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,102
I mean, my allowance
is what it is, but...

164
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,900
- How much is the lot?
- Six hundred thousand.

165
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,450
Anyway, he would oversee
the construction.

166
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,207
Well, I'll call Ginsberg...

167
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,584
...and have him free up a down payment.

168
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,419
And then?

169
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,255
I'll move back in.

170
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,513
Supposing that happened...

171
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,057
...what about the other issues
that were on the table?

172
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,229
I swear to you, on our children...

173
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:39,317
...that my midlife-crisis problems...

174
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,612
...will no longer intrude on you anymore.

175
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,495
Okay.

176
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,423
- Hey.
- Hey.

177
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,217
- Hi.
- What, are you having dinner?

178
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,804
Hey, you. Have you settled
on a caterer yet?

179
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,223
Can I talk to you?

180
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,485
What's up? You hear from Tony?

181
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,197
I talked to Kelvin or Calvin, whatever,
that redneck from North Carolina.

182
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,658
He got a call
from the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco.

183
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,911
Some bodega in Newark's been
selling cigarettes without tax stamps.

184
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,914
Stupid spics. They were supposed
to stamp them themselves.

185
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,250
The feds are all over it now.

186
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,003
I don't got enough on my fucking mind?

187
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,177
- Any idea how you're gonna handle that?
- Handle what?

188
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,929
Our cousin, you know.

189
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,431
Phil and John.

190
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,975
I don't know. I gotta think about it.

191
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,813
From now on, Paulie supervises
the entire cigarette run.

192
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,232
- Split everything down the middle.
- What?

193
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,444
- You fucking heard me.
- I got a fucking wedding to pay for.

194
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,779
Well, if I were you,
I'd cut out the open bar.

195
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,833
Fuck this piece of shit. I'm done.
You hear me?

196
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,171
Put my life on the line. My fucking life.

197
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,256
Baby, I hate seeing you like this.

198
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,841
Fuck family. Fuck loyalty.

199
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,385
You cost him a dime,
you're a fucking pariah.

200
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,097
I gave that fuck
pieces of my soul, Adriana.

201
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,350
You know what he said to me?

202
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,603
- He said I should have a fucking drink.
- When?

203
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,314
Up there, when we were up
at Uncle Pat's farm.

204
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,442
You don't need to listen to him.
Isn't that why you have a sponsor?

205
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,445
Him and Tony B., breaking my balls.

206
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,197
Teasing me, like when I was little.

207
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,201
I mean, what kind of fucked-up,
undermining shit is that...

208
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,703
...to tell someone
who's got the disease?

209
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,251
You know I could take him out
in a second, that fat fuck.

210
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,630
His kids wouldn't even give a shit.

211
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,799
Don't talk like that.

212
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,093
You're a better man than he is.
A better person.

213
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,346
Fuck all this shit with Paulie and all.
You know what hurts me worse?

214
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,556
Right to my heart?

215
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,393
Him and our ass-wipe cousin,
that two-faced cocksucker.

216
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,981
He could get us all killed
with New York, and him...

217
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,735
...Tony has to think about what to do
with him now, after all this shit.

218
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,904
Me, he don't need to fucking think.

219
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,951
Well, maybe I need to think!

220
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,954
Ever thought of that,
you fat fucking scumbag?

221
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,342
That's the guy, Adriana.

222
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,803
My Uncle Tony.

223
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,099
The guy I'm going to hell for.

224
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,940
- Long Branch cops.
- What do you think?

225
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,484
Not your average bulls. Detectives.

226
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,698
Call the Long Branch P.D.
Find out what's up.

227
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,375
So you all set?

228
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,920
- Don't look at me.
- Why? You look good.

229
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,132
And you're gonna look nice
with the short hair.

230
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,968
Like... What's-her-name.

231
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,762
That actress.

232
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,722
Just take me home.

233
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,974
I can drop you off,
but I really can't stay.

234
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,684
Why not?

235
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,653
All right, look, first off,
like I said before...

236
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,449
...as far as all the medical bills
and the prescriptions, that's covered.

237
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,950
Ad nauseam.

238
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,619
You motherfucker.

239
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,331
- Hey, take it easy.
- This is how you leave me?

240
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,958
When I'm almost burned to death
cooking you a snack?

241
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,378
You could have just as easily
been making yourself something to eat.

242
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:14,342
- Am I that fucking horrible now?
- No. You're not horrible at all.

243
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:20,223
- I'm going back to my wife.
- You selfish fuck.

244
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,352
I hate you.

245
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,607
There's no future with us.
I told you that right from the get-go.

246
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,819
That's why I didn't want you
hitching your wagon to my star.

247
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,489
You'll heal up.

248
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,783
- You'll meet somebody else.
- Fuck you!

249
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,290
You know, I didn't come here to fight.
I came here to pick you up...

250
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,917
...and end this like a gentleman.

251
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,338
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

252
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,590
I gotta take this.

253
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,596
Hello?

254
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,642
Is that you?

255
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:09,063
I know you're there. Just say something.
Where the fuck are...?

256
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,197
Your call cannot be...

257
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,875
- Bing.
- Yeah, it's me.

258
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,294
Your friend at the phone company.
Have him call me.

259
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,172
- Who, Gerard?
- Wanna put traps on all my lines.

260
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,805
Adriana.

261
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,182
Oh, Jesus. What?

262
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,809
- We need to talk.
- I was buying medicine.

263
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,227
- This way, please.
- Let's go.

264
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,812
But my car...

265
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,874
Hello?

266
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,501
- Hey.
- Hey.

267
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,087
Give me a hand, will you?

268
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,548
I got more stuff in the car, so...

269
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,550
Where should I put it?

270
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,969
The bedroom.

271
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,765
Oh, you made it. Hey.
I was just starting dinner.

272
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,142
Yeah. Smells good.

273
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,193
- What's this?
- I got you something, you know, small.

274
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,615
Oh, this is beautiful. Tony.

275
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,909
With my black coat.

276
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,413
It's a Hermès. Supposed to be the best.

277
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,515
There's the whipped butter too,
if you like.

278
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,642
Oh, no, this is all right.

279
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,191
This is fucking weird.

280
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,736
A.J.

281
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,446
No, he's right.

282
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,949
It is fucking weird.

283
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,952
You know what?

284
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,954
We should celebrate.

285
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,373
Oh!

286
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,210
Here, give me your glass.

287
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,799
Trick is you gotta hold the cork.
Don't let it fly out.

288
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,177
Gab's uncle got a detached retina
at his own retirement party.

289
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,971
He never saw out of that eye again.

290
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,056
That's festive.

291
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,978
I wanna make a toast.

292
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,525
To the people I love.

293
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,696
Nothing else matters.

294
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,532
Hear, hear.

295
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,665
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

296
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,960
Supposed to savor it.

297
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,628
It's important in life.

298
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,931
- Open the door for Mr. Muckle.
- What?

299
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,059
Open the door for Mr. Muckle,
the blind man.

300
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,644
- How about my kumquats?
- What'd you say?

301
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,356
- Kumquats!
- Wait!

302
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:48,449
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's all right. All right.

303
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,992
All right.

304
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,973
So?

305
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,185
I was throwing the garbage out.
So what?

306
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,022
Isn't it illegal, anyway?
To film people without telling them?

307
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,567
And the reason you didn't just
leave the garbage in the dumpster?

308
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,946
There were bills and stuff,
and our account numbers were on it.

309
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,824
Friend of yours?

310
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,035
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- His name is Gilbert Nieves.

311
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,955
There were partial traces
of an infrared stamp on his hand

312
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,082
- from the Crazy Horse.
- I don't know him.

313
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,043
You told the Long Branch Police
he was at the club that night.

314
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,254
Let me ask you a question,
Miss La Cerva.

315
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,964
Do you think we have you here...

316
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,383
...because we don't know
what's in that garbage bag?

317
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,137
He was stabbed in the club.
You tried to dispose of the evidence.

318
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,555
I didn't do nothing.

319
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:57,017
Miss La Cerva, I suggest
in the strongest possible terms...

320
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,645
...that you start telling us
what you know.

321
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,158
There's this guy, his name's Matush.

322
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,034
He's a drug dealer.

323
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,745
He did it. I swear, not me.

324
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,498
What's Matush's last name?

325
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,916
I don't know.

326
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,252
He's foreign, the Mideast or something.

327
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,212
Pakistan.

328
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,965
Anyway, Christopher
don't let him deal in the club.

329
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,970
But once in a while he'd sell me
some X or whatever.

330
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,513
Adriana.

331
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,182
- Hey.
- Hey.

332
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,267
This is my friend, Kamal.

333
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,812
Listen, I need a favor.
We're trying to get an apartment...

334
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,273
...but I gotta fax the guy
a copy of my passport.

335
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,609
- Can't go to Kinko's?
- The guy's waiting for it.

336
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,570
It will take two seconds. I swear.

337
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,200
It's in the office. But hurry.
Christopher sees you in there, he'll shit.

338
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,785
Thanks. That's for you.

339
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,803
This guy was
at the club, the dead guy.

340
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,180
But I never saw him before.

341
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,892
Matush said he sold him coke once,
but the guy said Matush ripped him off...

342
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,644
...like it was all laxative.

343
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,313
Oh, boy.

344
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,900
- What's the number, again?
- Oh, it's...

345
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,610
Hey, you can't be back here, man.

346
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,571
Cool out! What are you doing?

347
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,031
- Give me my money.
- What?

348
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,992
- Give it to me!
- Don't get stupid in here. I'm serious.

349
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,829
Fuck off, I got no beef with you.
You still sell that beat shit, huh?

350
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,165
- Fucking baby powder?
- Look, I don't know what...

351
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,542
Get him!

352
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,294
I'll kill you
motherfuckers! I'll kill you!

353
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,543
Oh, my God!

354
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,174
We had to wait till later
to get out the mops and stuff.

355
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,135
After we closed up.

356
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,971
- What if Christopher...?
- Nobody has to know anything.

357
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,683
- But you don't fucking understand.
- It's cool, okay?

358
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,102
We'll take him out
through the basement.

359
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,438
Dump him in the ocean.

360
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,078
Why'd you help this Matush?

361
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,081
I wasn't helping him.
I was afraid for myself.

362
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,500
Besides, he's nice. I don't know.

363
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,920
- I didn't wanna see him get into trouble.
- Sounds like a real sweetheart.

364
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,672
The guy was gonna stab him.

365
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,257
He's not a bad person.

366
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,969
- He's very religious.
- Religious?

367
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,763
He prays, like, all the time.

368
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,724
He went through this period
where he rediscovered his religion.

369
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,518
He don't even do drugs anymore,
he just deals.

370
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,104
Every month, he sends
all his money home to his family.

371
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,773
In Pakistan?

372
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,819
His brother runs a prep school
someplace for young boys.

373
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,989
I was very impressed with that.

374
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,579
He's buckled down, he's
gotten much more serious as a person.

375
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,333
- Does Christopher know what happened?
- No. You crazy?

376
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,419
Right now you're guilty
of obstructing an ongoing investigation...

377
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,296
...into a drug-related homicide.

378
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,632
You are looking down the barrel
at 25 years.

379
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,300
But I didn't do nothing.

380
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,220
Take your head out of your ass,
you knew what you were doing.

381
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,473
We can arrest you right now,
have you formally charged.

382
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,975
Send you over
to the Women's House of Detention.

383
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,354
Or in the alternative, you can cooperate.

384
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,731
But I've been fucking cooperating!

385
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,818
You've been giving us shit!
And I've had it!

386
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,403
I want you wired up!

387
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,655
I want Tony Soprano on tape.

388
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,367
- Your boyfriend, too.
- No, I'm not doing it.

389
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,202
Then you're all out of options!

390
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,333
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

391
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,378
Fine. Who's your lawyer?

392
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,839
I don't have an official one.

393
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,007
Maybe Christopher knows a good lawyer.

394
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,719
Oh, you fucking piece of shit.

395
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,930
I'll call the public defender.
They'll send someone down.

396
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,599
Might take a while, though.
This hour of the night.

397
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,864
Think I left some shoes over there.

398
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,285
I can iron these tomorrow.

399
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,456
- What for? Send them to the cleaners.
- I kind of miss it, actually.

400
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,542
My wrist is getting weak.

401
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,380
Oh, I can help you there.

402
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,966
Get out of here.

403
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,553
No, let's give it some exercise.

404
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,971
- Tony.
- What?

405
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,431
Stop.

406
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:44,281
Hi, it's Ade. Ma, if this is you, another
gift for the registry could be a decanter.

407
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,493
Yeah, it's me. Where are you?

408
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,754
Maybe doing it at our house.

409
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,340
We've only got the one leaf
for 16 people.

410
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,302
Could you do a buffet?
Maybe set a card table up for the kids?

411
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,181
It's our first holiday.
Ronnie wants us all together.

412
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,362
Ade? It's been 40 minutes.
How long you gonna stay in there?

413
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,572
How long you gonna let me go
without a lawyer?

414
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,157
I told you, they're backed up.

415
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,827
We left four messages.

416
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,579
Eight fucking hours
I've been here already.

417
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,638
Oh, Jesus Christ, look at me.

418
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,433
Want some coffee?

419
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,228
Can't, my stomach.

420
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,191
I wish you'd think about our offer,
it's not a bad deal.

421
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,861
I won't wear a wire, I told you.

422
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,363
It's bad enough
how I betrayed him already.

423
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,700
It's not too late to have a future, Ade.
There are other options.

424
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,911
Don't start
with the witness protection again.

425
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,497
You're young, you love each other.
You both have your health.

426
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,915
Yeah, right.

427
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,626
Living like this
is what's costing you your insides.

428
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,965
I really need a cigarette.

429
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,051
Okay. Come on.

430
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,717
There's no way she'll wear a wire...

431
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,094
...but thinks she might
get Moltisanti to flip.

432
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,388
- Why now?
- Problems with Tony.

433
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,849
- Christopher hates him.
- Confirmed by wiretaps.

434
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:20,771
And CI 12 mentioned it too. Something
with Tony Blundetto, the cousin.

435
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,649
- What would Moltisanti want?
- I'm not sure.

436
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,152
- He's got interest in screenwriting.
- I'll put in a call to Sam Goldwyn.

437
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,237
- You promise her anything?
- No guarantees...

438
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:34,076
...but depending on what he's offering,
maybe immunity and relocation for them.

439
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,084
She's got to understand
that if she won't wear a wire...

440
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,711
...we can't offer her protection
or keep her surveilled.

441
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,129
I explained all that.

442
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,423
She's got till 9 a.m. Monday
to bring him in...

443
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,718
...or we turn her over
to Long Branch P.D.

444
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,974
Ton, you got a call.

445
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,395
Jimmy Petrille, Brooklyn.

446
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,816
- Hello.
- It's me.

447
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,859
That tennis match with those guys?

448
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,736
- My guy won.
- Oh, yeah?

449
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,114
The other one, the son. He dropped out.

450
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,199
- What, he got hurt?
- Nothing like that.

451
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,367
Settled, that's all.

452
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,452
All right.

453
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,957
Little Carmine's out.

454
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,834
He's dead?

455
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,878
Seems like him and Johnny
worked out a deal.

456
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,048
I knew he'd cave.
He's a fucking pussy, that kid.

457
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,301
Johnny Sack. Boss of a family.

458
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,430
Time was it would have been great for
us to have John as the boss.

459
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,140
Smart as a fucking whip.

460
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,142
He used to be a pragmatist.

461
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,769
Some people are better
at being number twos.

462
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,814
You thought John had an ego before?
Forget it now.

463
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,361
Hey.

464
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,625
- Did you sleep?
- A little.

465
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,419
So where the fuck you been?

466
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:12,549
- Christopher, we need to talk.
- I asked you a question, Adriana.

467
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,342
I know.

468
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,471
- There's something I need to tell...
- It's fucking Bobby DeMarco?

469
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:21,391
No. Please, Christopher.

470
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,228
I gotta get through this.

471
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,196
About a year ago...
More, maybe, I don't know.

472
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,157
I was arrested.

473
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,451
For what? What are you talking about?

474
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,578
For drugs.

475
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,705
Where, at the club?

476
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,293
- Remember my friend Danielle?
- She set you up?

477
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,671
She was an FBI agent, Christopher.

478
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,521
She lied to me. They
wanted to arrest you too, Christopher.

479
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,398
I was just trying to protect you.

480
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,402
They said all they wanted was some
information and would leave us alone.

481
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,572
I didn't tell them nothing.
I swear to God.

482
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,159
Just license plates,
some other stupid shit.

483
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,329
They wanted me to wear a wire,
but I wouldn't do it.

484
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:30,585
But now there was a murder,
Christopher, and they know about it.

485
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,295
At the club.

486
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,132
Matush and some other guy.

487
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,843
I tried to cover it up.

488
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,345
But I had no choice.

489
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,931
They've been filming us
in the parking lot.

490
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,904
We're dead, you know that?

491
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,657
What did you do, huh?

492
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:05,078
How could you fucking do this to us?

493
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,626
I fucking loved you.

494
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,427
I'm sorry.

495
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,096
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

496
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,764
I'm sorry.

497
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:33,273
Oh, my God!

498
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,700
Oh, my God! What are we gonna do?

499
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,755
Careful of the ear, my son.

500
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,216
What I do for friendship.

501
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,814
- Hello?
- T, it's me. You awake?

502
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,110
Look I know you're mad, okay?

503
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,949
Ton, I'm sorry.
When I heard about Angelo, I just...

504
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,992
Don't fucking say it.
Not on the phone.

505
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,535
I know. I won't.

506
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,376
- What should I do, Ton?
- I'll tell you what not to do:

507
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,835
Come back around here.

508
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,464
I know. I know, but...

509
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,882
My kids. My boys.

510
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,884
Don't worry, I'll look after them.

511
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,971
Yeah, well, that's why I'm calling,
you know, to ask if you'd...

512
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,349
Sure. Why not?

513
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,892
Anything else I can do for you?

514
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,771
I don't know what to say, coz.

515
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,107
I'm leaving you
with a pile of shit in your lap.

516
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,199
Hello?

517
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,786
The night you went away,
you know, 17 years ago.

518
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,999
I told you that I got jumped
by a couple of shines.

519
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,794
That's why I didn't show.

520
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,713
Well, it was all bullshit.

521
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,510
- Fought with my mother and passed out.
- What do you mean?

522
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,887
I don't know, it...

523
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,140
A panic attack. I went
down like a house of cards...

524
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,891
...and I cracked my skull open.

525
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,811
Why are you telling me this?

526
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:39,607
Because I felt guilty all these years,
like it was my fault you went away.

527
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,613
Anyway, now we're even.

528
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:49,617
So the casino, all that shit
you did for me, is because of that?

529
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,584
You just take care of yourself,
all right?

530
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,170
You too.

531
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,063
Hello?

532
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,608
Gerard, it's me.

533
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,026
He just called.

534
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,029
Give me a sec. I'll dump the line.

535
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,784
- You got a pen?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

536
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,412
He's at Roy's. It's a business.
Kinderhook, New York.

537
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,331
That's upstate.

538
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,959
Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks.

539
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,268
- Hello?
- Uncle Pat.

540
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,229
So how's life at the old folks' home?

541
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,022
I don't like the people here.

542
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,649
Do you know what time it is?

543
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,901
Come on,
I thought you were a night owl.

544
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,613
Did I hear a rumor there was a problem
up there at the farm?

545
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,782
The goddamn developer.

546
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,200
Some environmental crap.

547
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:16,287
They can't start the demolition
without some special permit.

548
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,916
And the house
is sitting there empty, damn it.

549
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,171
Remember that time,
Lake George, how you loved it?

550
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,382
We could live someplace
like that, maybe.

551
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,467
You could start writing again.

552
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,346
I could do my memoirs, finally.

553
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,850
And we'd have a fireplace
like you like too.

554
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,353
We could never come back here,
Adriana.

555
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,439
I don't wanna come back.

556
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,901
- I just want you.
- You couldn't see your mother again.

557
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,367
You want some eggs?

558
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,370
I need to clear my head.

559
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:04,711
- You didn't even sleep.
- This is a lot to process, I gotta think.

560
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,964
- I'll be back in a little while.
- Stay, wait.

561
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,426
- I'm gonna get cigarettes. Be right back.
- Smoke mine.

562
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:15,346
- Don't smoke. You'll want a vodka.
- What?

563
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,765
Come on.

564
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,518
I love you, baby.

565
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,313
I love you.

566
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,495
NPR's Margot Adler reports.

567
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,291
Hello?

568
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,252
- He wants to do it.
- Great. When are you coming in?

569
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,838
A couple hours,
we're getting some things together.

570
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,798
That's not what we said, Ade.

571
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:54,135
Please. If I push him, he'll say no.
I know how he is.

572
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,431
I'm serious, Adriana.

573
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,017
You've got till 1:00.

574
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,251
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

575
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,879
Look, everything's okay.

576
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,135
Jesus, I don't even know
how to say this.

577
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,470
It's Christopher.

578
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,055
He tried to commit suicide.

579
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,766
- Oh, my God, is he all right?
- He's fine.

580
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,312
He was up by Ramapo,
apparently he took some pills.

581
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:31,941
This trooper found him in a bathroom of
a diner and brought him to the hospital.

582
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,319
His mom's on the way up there now.

583
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,654
Did he say anything to you?

584
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,657
- I mean, did he appear suicidal?
- No.

585
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,075
Are you sure?

586
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,579
Because his mom said
he's very upset about something.

587
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:51,085
I'm on my way up there now. I'm gonna
send Sil by to pick you up, okay?

588
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,795
Jesus Christ.

589
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,549
You know he's been drinking, so he's
probably fighting that heroin urge again.

590
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,594
- Anyway, Sil's on his way.
- Okay.

591
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,095
All right.

592
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,848
I'll see you up there.

593
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:56,109
I'd stop to eat, but I don't wanna get
to the hospital after Tony.

594
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,528
I'm not hungry.

595
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,628
They'll keep him a few days, maybe.

596
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,213
Observation.

597
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,756
Do some tests.

598
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,466
Who knows?

599
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:50,037
He's a strong kid, Chrissy.

600
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,331
He's tough.

601
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,584
Very resilient.

602
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,641
Why are you crying?
He's gonna be fine.

603
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,927
Oh, no.

604
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,304
No. No.

605
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,017
- Come on.
- No! No! Please!

606
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,019
- Where you fucking going?
- Please!

607
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,646
- Come on!
- No! No!

608
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,439
- Fucking cunt.
- Please!

609
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,193
No. No! No!

610
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,279
No! No!

611
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,470
This is long-term parking only.

612
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:16,851
Due to increased security, cars being
reclaimed in less than 14 days...

613
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,313
...must be left in lots L, M or N.

614
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,483
This is long-term parking only.

615
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:29,822
Due to increased security, cars being
reclaimed in less than 14 days...

616
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:34,702
...must be left in lots L, M or N.

617
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,413
This is long-term parking only.

618
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,797
The king of New York.

619
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,178
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Tony.

620
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,430
You deserve it.

621
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,768
I want you to know this is the last time
we'll meet like this.

622
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,228
It's undignified.

623
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,358
Okay.

624
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,027
So...

625
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,571
...what's the word on your cousin?

626
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,621
I think I know where he's holed up.

627
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:26,754
- And?
- I know this has to be done, John.

628
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,341
But I'm asking you now, as a friend...

629
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,510
...let me handle this myself.

630
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,804
I can't do that, Tony.

631
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,685
You can do whatever the fuck you want,
John, you're the fucking boss.

632
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,895
I choose not to, then.

633
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,155
I want your promise it'll be quick.

634
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,992
I'm not gonna lie to you,
Tony, I don't have to.

635
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,660
Phil's gonna do it.

636
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,245
And he'll do it his way.

637
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,206
John.

638
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,668
This is me, now.

639
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,462
Come on.

640
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,507
Anything else?

641
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,053
No.

642
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,369
You know what, John?
I'll give you undignified.

643
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,789
Go fuck yourself.

644
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,043
You and Phil and whoever.

645
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,628
He's my fucking cousin.

646
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,075
Hey.

647
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,918
You all right?

648
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,504
Some funny shit.

649
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,344
The fuck is wrong with you?

650
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,560
I snorted a little H.

651
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,023
I know...

652
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:54,944
...but I can't stand the pain.

653
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,238
I loved her.

654
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,371
Fucking pain!

655
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,000
You think you're alone in this?

656
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,044
It was a judgment call.
She sounded okay.

657
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,088
What's the status on Moltisanti?

658
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,674
Last seen yesterday.
He was leaving the Bing with Tony.

659
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,093
- Should we bring him in?
- That'll get us nothing.

660
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,720
She really could have fled.
She could be in China.

661
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,238
How should we handle the other thing?
The Nieves murder?

662
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,365
We have the terror possibility.

663
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,826
Take it over from the Long Branch P.D.

664
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,750
Well, what did I say?
Is it beautiful?

665
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,631
Yeah, it's a gorgeous piece of land.

666
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,925
And with this view...

667
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,844
...it's well worth 600,000.

668
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,430
The surveyor's coming on Tuesday.

669
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,701
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, me? Yeah.

670
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,162
Absolutely.
