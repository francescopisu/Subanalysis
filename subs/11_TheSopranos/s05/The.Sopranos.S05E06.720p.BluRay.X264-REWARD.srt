1
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,701
The fuck?

2
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,954
Oh.

3
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,839
Aah, shit!

4
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,692
So, "Blundino",

5
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,569
why you fuck me like this?

6
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,612
Fuck you talkin' about?

7
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,407
I got a whole leg
covered with Neosporin.

8
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,700
I just spent an hour with the cops

9
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,034
explainin' how it went down.

10
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,537
I no forget you
professional criminal.

11
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,038
Let me ask you somethin'.

12
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,207
If I really wanted to rob you,

13
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,209
you think I'd have to
put up with this bullshit?

14
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,753
Well, just so you know.

15
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,674
I didn't take your truck.

16
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,552
I lost my study guide,
my fuckin' flashcards.

17
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,681
I'm sick of this fuckin' prejudice
against ex-cons.

18
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,685
I never hire you if I
no need Tony Soprano for union.

19
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,313
Not for him,
I show you the fucking window.

20
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,738
Great.

21
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,489
Hey, I thought you
liked the other one,

22
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,908
the corn pops.

23
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,367
Here, take it.

24
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,162
What, no juice either?

25
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,832
I told ya, write it down, I'll have
the girl pick up whatever you want.

26
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,417
She doesn't know
the difference between

27
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,294
fruit roll-ups and pop-tarts.

28
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,171
I know,
everybody's an idiot to you.

29
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,758
You know they got these places
called supermarkets where you go,

30
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,551
and you buy the
things that you like.

31
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,970
I'll reimburse ya.

32
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,765
And when am I supposed to do that?

33
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,227
Well, as far as I can tell, you spend
most of your time on the phone.

34
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,938
Or sittin' on the couch perfectin'
That pissy look on your face.

35
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,565
Add comin' home drunk,
sounds like you.

36
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,028
What the fuck did you say to me?

37
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,988
- Let the fuck go of me.
- Or what?

38
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,116
- Or what?
- One of these days, you wait,

39
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,785
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.

40
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,119
What's wrong with right now, then?

41
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,788
Huh?
What's wrong with right now?

42
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,373
Come on!

43
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,339
Blah.

44
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,225
Now ya got nothin'.

45
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,539
- Thank you, Mary.
- You're welcome.

46
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,917
I hated to call you in
but I got this midterm report

47
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,087
from Mr. Fiske,
uh, Anthony's English teacher.

48
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,008
And, uh, well it... It doesn't
hit the mail for a few days

49
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,093
and I thought maybe
we could get a jump on it

50
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,262
and avert any real crisis.

51
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,930
Wonderful, another crisis.

52
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,640
Uh, he's still well
below the "c" average

53
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,684
he needs for the
colleges we discussed.

54
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:16,231
There is also an issue
with his five paragraph essay.

55
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,275
Animal farm?

56
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,445
Anthony submitted his
one-line topic... late.

57
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,280
Then two drafts.

58
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,241
The first was apparently sketchy.

59
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,161
The second, Fiske said, was, uh...

60
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,413
"Suspiciously cogent".

61
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,207
Plagiarism.

62
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,959
He thinks my son cheated?

63
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,838
He spent almost an entire
Saturday afternoon at the library.

64
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,923
I think it's obvious
what's going on here.

65
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,342
What do you mean?

66
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,219
Anyone else shows sudden
improvement, he gets a gold star.

67
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,306
My son gets his act together
and suddenly he's a cheater?

68
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,475
I know what people think, Bob.

69
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,060
Italian-American, father in the...

70
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,479
- ...carting industry...
- are you suggesting some sort of bias

71
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,898
because that's a
very serious charge.

72
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,441
I have met this Mr. Fiske.

73
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,360
He's a cold fish.

74
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,612
Couldn't you or one of
the other teachers talk to him?

75
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,655
Tell him how hard AJ's trying?

76
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,160
Nothing will make a better argument

77
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,204
than continued effort on AJ's part.

78
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,955
But hey,
there... there's still a shot.

79
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,833
This semester's grade
is heavily weighted on

80
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,293
their term paper
on "lord of the flies".

81
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,212
God, my stomach is in knots.

82
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,512
That's why I thought
it important that you come in.

83
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,102
Though it, uh...

84
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,271
Did take me about an
hour to decide what to wear.

85
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,774
Me, too.

86
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,819
Does that mean you've
thought about my dinner offer?

87
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,279
I probably shouldn't say this

88
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,740
but I have thought about
nothing else since you called.

89
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,619
Well, we can't do
justice to any discussion

90
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,454
of "Madame Bovary" over the phone.

91
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,957
That's the thing, though,
that book was way over my head.

92
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,836
Why would you even be
interested in someone like me?

93
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,254
Because of just that.

94
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,839
I mean who admits this stuff?

95
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,215
Not only are you very attractive...

96
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,426
...you're unpretentious,
you say what's on your mind.

97
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,718
So, I'm a big mouth.

98
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,929
I see how that would
attract a man like you.

99
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,057
So, should we grab a meal or not?

100
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,143
Well, there are other
things to think about.

101
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,310
My husband for one.

102
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,438
Well, your husband's gonna
have to get used to the idea

103
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,148
that your life is moving on.

104
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,525
I'm not worried about my life.

105
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,487
Oh, you know what?

106
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,698
Call me naive but
in this day and age

107
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,949
I don't really think your husband...

108
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:35,203
if he found out, is going to
break his son's teacher's legs.

109
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,790
Not to mention how that would play
in the admissions office at Arizona state.

110
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,756
I don't get it.
What's so funny about that?

111
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,720
Honey?

112
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,221
Aren't you gonna eat somethin'?

113
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,223
Janice made lasagna.

114
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,518
It's not so great but you
need somethin' on your stomach.

115
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,686
We're gonna go.

116
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,021
Gotta stop at my mother's.

117
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,772
Gwen just told us how you met.

118
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,733
They let you use the
Internet in the can?

119
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,444
They let you post an ad.

120
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,322
I gotta read some of that shit.
I bet it's hysterical.

121
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,910
He's, uh, trying to concentrate.

122
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,079
Vascular physiology.

123
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,082
Neurotomy.

124
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,751
Shit.

125
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,212
T made it out like
it was a big gym test.

126
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,423
Some people don't realize
what massage involves.

127
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,092
I'm practically doin' two years of
medical school on my own right now.

128
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,719
One thing I learned in recovery,

129
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,721
other people's definitions of you?

130
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,766
Sometimes they're more about
makin' themselves feel better.

131
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,267
You gotta define yourself.

132
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,353
Keep your eye on the tiger, man.

133
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,233
- See ya, ton'.
- Bye.

134
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,196
I suppose I could speak
with Monsignor Bava,

135
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,240
have him call his nephew at K-Mart.

136
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,867
That'll fix us in the
Huggies department.

137
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,787
Well, the diaper drive
covers clothe the naked.

138
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,372
What do you say we
work on feed the hungry?

139
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,998
Ah, this looks delicious.

140
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,792
Thanks for inviting me, Carm'.

141
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,335
Pleasant surprise, indeed.

142
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,214
So, how goes life these days?

143
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,759
Actually, I think I met somebody.

144
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,594
Really?

145
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,096
Just kinda happened.

146
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,765
We had been, uh,
working on this project together

147
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,768
and suddenly we both realized,

148
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,812
huh, that there
were certain feelings.

149
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,983
And I like him as a person, too,
of course. Don't get me wrong.

150
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,236
The funny thing is,
I was sure he was gay.

151
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,821
He sort of reminded me of you.

152
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,449
He's an intellectual.
You know what I mean.

153
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,244
Anyway we had been friends,
I guess,

154
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,706
and then he called to ask me out

155
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,917
and suddenly all the
formality dropped away.

156
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,336
When I saw him the other day,

157
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,131
he looked at me
with this intensity.

158
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,841
Now, I know it's wrong,

159
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,801
but the truth is, I feel it, too.

160
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,724
You know,
if you really want to discuss this,

161
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,727
I think we should include
Tony in the conversation as well.

162
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,523
Why... why are you sounding,
I don't know, kind of hostile?

163
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,609
I'm not.

164
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,486
Perhaps that's your sin talking.

165
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,030
This is none of Tony's business.

166
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,074
Who knows what he's been up to
and not just during the separation either.

167
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,243
That doesn't change the fact
that you made a commitment...

168
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,703
...to each other before God.

169
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,831
Well, maybe you should send the Papal
Nuncio to Tony and remind him of that.

170
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,584
Why am I the only one
held to any kind of standards?

171
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,753
And for that matter,
if this is wrong,

172
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,713
why did God put
this man in my life?

173
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,424
Is it God that put him there?

174
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,302
Or is there a particular
need you have right now?

175
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,220
See, I never understand this.

176
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,348
Didn't he put the need there?

177
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,731
Say when, Señor.

178
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,697
You!

179
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,491
Office!

180
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,410
5:15, I haven't punched in yet.

181
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,162
This is still my time.

182
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,839
Yeah?

183
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,677
I give you a hard time
about my truck the other day.

184
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,806
Cops find two kids...
feel free to apologize any time.

185
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,599
Anyway, they investigate.

186
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,017
Could be joy ride.

187
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:30,605
But I think maybe behind
it is my cousin at Northside.

188
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,815
You know if they found my books?

189
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,400
Who knows.

190
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,407
You study hard for
"massagie", yeah?

191
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,826
The licensing test is pretty hard.

192
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,202
Huge failure rate.

193
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,538
If you pass,
then what you do with this?

194
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,916
Be a professional masseur.

195
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,127
You no think of "massagie ghageh"?

196
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,754
You know, small sauna.

197
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,631
Yeah, I could see it.

198
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,175
Four or five tables,
soothing atmosphere.

199
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,844
Pipe in a little Keith Jarret.

200
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,055
First thing I get
stuck with you I think,

201
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,307
oh, shit goddamnit.

202
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,269
He lazy American and criminal.

203
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,854
No good for Kim.

204
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,524
But you work for Kim and future.

205
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,693
Like a Korean people.

206
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,153
I wouldn't say that.

207
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,988
I come from Korea.

208
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,867
Only new shoes
and Uncle's address.

209
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,327
Worser than prison.

210
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,039
But I become "jah-soo-suhng-gah" the boss.

211
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,292
That's why I try to help you.

212
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,086
Help me how?
What are you talkin' about?

213
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:39,007
I stake you the money
in the storefront.

214
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,970
I got a travel agency

215
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,515
in mini mall over at West Caldwell.

216
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,809
Shitty business

217
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,437
with a fucking three-year lease.

218
00:12:55,816 --> 00:13:01,112
You know, my daughter,
very interested in massage.

219
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,238
Physical therapy.

220
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,823
Top of two-thirds class.

221
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,909
Good for her.
It's a tough nut to crack.

222
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,745
She no like physical
therapy no more.

223
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,414
Cripple people make her sad.

224
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,210
Now, she watch TV,
live at home, do nothing.

225
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,005
You pass test then you,
me, my daughter,

226
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,299
we make the big success journey.

227
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,135
Okay?!

228
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,763
Jesus.

229
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,098
Yeah, alright.

230
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,311
I-I don't know what to say, Kim.

231
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,729
Thanks.

232
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,112
I laid it out for him.

233
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,616
He wants to move back here it's
gotta be with your full approval.

234
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,618
This was your idea?

235
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,371
It was mutual.

236
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,998
He's upset 'cause he don't
get the kinda cereal he likes.

237
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,375
He threw it in the sink.

238
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,710
How am I supposed to focus
at school with no breakfast?

239
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,920
I got dizzy.

240
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,508
I'm sorry. I don't see why the two of you
can't work this out between yourselves.

241
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,969
Well, maybe I don't
wanna live in a place

242
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,762
where people use violence
against children.

243
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,180
Violence?

244
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,807
You're lucky I didn't
put my shoe up your ass.

245
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,559
You see?
Now that's abuse.

246
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,768
I know what my rights are.

247
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,312
I can call social services
and they'll send a case worker.

248
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,189
Go ahead!
He'll get the other shoe!

249
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,359
This is demoralizin'.

250
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,111
- Well, now maybe you see...
- that a son of mine

251
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,238
would even consider
callin' in the authorities!

252
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,825
Go ahead, live where you want.

253
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,034
Fine.

254
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,327
Family meeting?

255
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,538
Try to stay awake, AJ.

256
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,331
Keep walkin'.

257
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,086
I-I just want my old room back.

258
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,255
You wanted to live
with your father, AJ.

259
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,548
Live with your decision.

260
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,716
I don't like it there.

261
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,175
Now that's funny,
I thought I was the problem.

262
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,719
I make you miserable, remember?

263
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,053
Well, I never said that.

264
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,264
- You did.
- Absolutely.

265
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,152
For me to even consider
having you back,

266
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,405
we're gonna have to establish
some non-negotiable ground rules.

267
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,656
Like what kind?

268
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,033
Let your mother talk.

269
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,829
First and foremost,
school comes first.

270
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,540
That means putting the
brakes on your social life,

271
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,168
parties and phone calls, Devin.

272
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,545
You are at a crisis
point grade-wise,

273
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,381
so you will make sure that your
work is done on time and correctly.

274
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,762
Alright.

275
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,556
- I will not tolerate cursing...
- after 16 years

276
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,808
of uninterrupted potty mouth from
you people, I get slammed?

277
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,186
This is my house.
You will treat me with respect.

278
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,063
Well, is that it?

279
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,029
I want you to involve
me in your life a little.

280
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,036
Fine.

281
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,874
Alright.

282
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,709
Go get your stuff from the car.

283
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,027
We played that just right.

284
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,033
Think his time over there with me
whipped him into shape a little.

285
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,411
Hmm.

286
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,955
Think you'll see a difference.

287
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,177
Which muscles attach
to the coracoid process?

288
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,263
'Kay, I fuckin' know this.

289
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,557
It's on the tip of my tongue.

290
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,809
Ho, fuckin' study hall again.

291
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,478
Vito, where the fuck
is my Tupperware?

292
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,730
Keep your shirt on.

293
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,565
My wife's bringin' it
down this afternoon.

294
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,860
Pectoralis minor and the
coracobrachalis, of course.

295
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,611
And...

296
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,114
Come on.

297
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,282
Even I know this.

298
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,491
Fuck, fine, what is it?

299
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,617
Biceps!

300
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,330
The fuck, I knew that.
My mind's all over the place.

301
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,915
Fear knocked at the door.

302
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,792
Faith answered.
It was no one there.

303
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,210
Why do you wanna do this shit?

304
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,879
So you can touch
a bunch a strangers?

305
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,881
You really skeeve the human body,
don't you?

306
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,258
You like this so much,
let me ask ya a question.

307
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,260
Why do pissin', shittin' and fuckin'

308
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,137
all happen within
a two inch radius?

309
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,973
Everybody asks that, Paulie.
There's no answer for it.

310
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,641
They're all sources
of pleasure, though.

311
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,351
Get the fuck outta here.

312
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,479
I know this shit and then
the next minute it's gone.

313
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,272
I don't know how you
do it workin' full time.

314
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,316
If your parole officer's a problem,

315
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,610
give our guy Jimmy Curran a call.
He's a supervisor.

316
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,238
It's not that. It's just all this
pressure now that I got this opportunity.

317
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,532
Sungyon Kim, my boss,

318
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,410
he's gonna back me on
a whole storefront operation.

319
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,745
The Korean?

320
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,081
You're lookin' for money,
why not come to me?

321
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,249
Well this is different.

322
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:10,046
This self-owned business shit's
like a religion to these people.

323
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,548
Plus, the guy sees somethin' in me.

324
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,179
You know, in some ways,

325
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,933
the whole prison thing is not that
different from bein' an immigrant.

326
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,980
Word to the wise,
remember Pearl Harbor.

327
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,858
We really were the
last people in there.

328
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,653
At least they were subtle about it.

329
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,114
Was it stacking of chairs
or the running the vacuum?

330
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,674
Relax.

331
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,050
Sorry.

332
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,680
"Madame Bovary".
It's a first edition.

333
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,307
Well, modern library's
first edition.

334
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,644
Thank you, that is so sweet.

335
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,315
Honestly, though, I don't know.
The story's very slow.

336
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,859
Nothing really happens.

337
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,404
I think he could've said what he
has to say with a lot less words.

338
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,780
Outside nothing happens.

339
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:22,243
But inside she has these extremes
of boredom and exhilaration.

340
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,911
You should try it again.

341
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,833
And what a wonderful thing
to have in a den.

342
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,461
You know, you look really
beautiful in this light.

343
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,136
I don't do this a lot.

344
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,138
Mm, do what?

345
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,058
Sitting in a car, with a man,

346
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,269
not really knowing what to do.

347
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,813
Or if I should at all.

348
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,316
And feeling like some teenager

349
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,193
which was believe it or not...

350
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,876
I have to tell you.

351
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,129
I haven't been with anyone.

352
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,923
You're a virgin?

353
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,050
This is my lucky night.

354
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,968
Stop with the jokes.

355
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,404
I'm so glad you're here.

356
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,960
So, how was it?

357
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,463
Oh, cut it out.

358
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,550
So, what is "Abelard and Heloise"?

359
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,052
It looks religious.

360
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,928
I just like to read in there.

361
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,096
Hmph.

362
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,559
It's the classic story.

363
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,355
A 12th century scholar falls
in love with his underage student.

364
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,190
Gets her pregnant.

365
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,108
God, in the 12th century.

366
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,693
Mm, and they're found out.

367
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,572
And her Uncle,
the Abbot, has him castrated.

368
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,201
It's timeless, really.

369
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,704
Even though he becomes
a monk and she a nun,

370
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,041
their passion burns on
through these incredible letters

371
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,584
through the rest of their lives.

372
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,795
You, with these books.

373
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,881
Mm, education should never stop.

374
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,258
It enriches all aspects of life.

375
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,761
Hmm, I know.

376
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,140
I wish someone could
convince AJ of that.

377
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,227
I keep thinking he
could start over in college

378
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,145
but who knows if he's
even gonna get the chance.

379
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,313
He will.

380
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,066
All our students matriculate.

381
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,706
You gotta
be fuckin' kiddin' me.

382
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,208
No way.

383
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,786
Why do they take so long?

384
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,830
All they have to do
is spit out the results.

385
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:06,170
5-6-2-4-7-3-7-30-2-11.

386
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,922
That's me.
Blundetto.

387
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,799
I'm only authorized to inform
you that your score meets

388
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,552
or exceeds the required minimum
for licensure,

389
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,930
as you're now board
certified in massage

390
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,390
and bodywork by the
state of New Jersey.

391
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,936
Honey, you passed.

392
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,229
You passed.

393
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,399
Oh, Jesus.

394
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,155
I couldn't have done it alone.

395
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,326
Oh, my God, look at you.

396
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,913
You did it baby.
You did it.

397
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,583
Bless me father, for I have sinned.

398
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,253
It's been a month
since my last confession.

399
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,879
Carmela?

400
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,549
I had sex with that man.

401
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,639
I know we talked about commitment,

402
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,226
the sacrament of marriage, but...

403
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,980
I don't know.

404
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,565
You sound remorseful.

405
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,817
I am.
I'm also confused, though.

406
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,278
The truth is I have been
walking around on a cloud,

407
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,613
like Maria in "West Side Story".

408
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,077
It's not right.

409
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,164
Have you heard of
"Abelard and Eloise"?

410
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,333
I think it's "Heloise",

411
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,460
and from what I
remember it ends badly.

412
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,920
I know, exactly.

413
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,591
But, something in
me has been reawakened.

414
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,678
And even if it never
happens again with this man,

415
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,598
just knowing that
feeling of passion again.

416
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,474
I don't know if it's
ever gonna go away.

417
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,934
I'll need it.

418
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,853
If it never happens again?

419
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,897
Carmela,
I can't absolve you of a sin

420
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,816
you're going to continue to commit.

421
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,860
You need to show resolve.

422
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,987
A firm purpose to change.

423
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,364
Yeah, I know, I know.

424
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,868
So, this man takes
you to restaurants.

425
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,287
Fulfills certain physical desires.

426
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,705
Tells jokes.

427
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,625
But will he be there
beyond the here and now?

428
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,085
When you're too old
to walk to the bathroom.

429
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,378
Will he be there to help you?

430
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,130
What, and you think Tony will?

431
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,216
Carmela, you took a vow.

432
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,385
You both did.

433
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:22,389
For your penance, I want you to do
something kind for Tony.

434
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,766
I don't think I can, father.

435
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,392
Then pray for him.

436
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,853
Not only that God
will touch his heart

437
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,688
but that he'll touch yours as well.

438
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,452
It's not much now, of course,
but it's a pretty flexible space.

439
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,579
Plus you got the dog
groomin' next door...

440
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,748
...in case your Korean friend
wants some lunch.

441
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,541
You know they really do eat dogs.

442
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,085
I mean not all of 'em
but I asked Kim.

443
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,586
Aw, Jesus Christ.

444
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,673
I'm thinkin' of buildin' a row of
rooms here with different themes.

445
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,301
Asian for shiatsu,
a little Danish thing for rolfing,

446
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,595
even though technically
it's Swedish.

447
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,723
Well, sounds like it's all
comin' together.

448
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,310
Look, Ton',
I know you're disappointed.

449
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,229
The fuck you talkin' about?

450
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,357
The way things turned out,
since I left the can.

451
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,942
Goin' civilian.

452
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,408
Over here I'm gonna put
an oasis with big plants,

453
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,452
like a waiting area
for the customers.

454
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,705
Could buy some 30 dollar hand cream

455
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,040
while they look at one of
those fountains with the koi in it.

456
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,500
I can get you the koi.

457
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,127
Really, giant carp?

458
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,795
How the fuck do you get that?

459
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,171
It's done.

460
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,339
Don't give it another thought.

461
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,049
Tony, you here?

462
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,426
- Yeah!
- Out front.

463
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,553
Hey.
I came by to get the keys.

464
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,096
I would have gone by the laundry
but my dad's

465
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,431
such a hard-on at work.

466
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,932
Tell me about it.

467
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,642
Amanda, this is my cousin, Tony.

468
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,394
- Hey.
- Hey, how are ya?

469
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,731
Hey, you believe there's
a dog groomer there?

470
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,816
In case somebody needs a snack?

471
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,027
Place is nice.

472
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,405
A little paint, maybe... Amanda,
this is my cousin Christopher.

473
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,740
Hey.

474
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,578
So, um, I met this guy at a club
on canal.

475
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,413
He says he can hook
us up with ginseng,

476
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,623
fake rhino, nerve tea,
all that herbal shit.

477
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,584
We could, uh, keep it
up front with the koi thing,

478
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,710
if we're still doin' that.

479
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,044
Koi's taken care of.

480
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,629
Well, I gotta book.

481
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,256
Nice meeting you guys.

482
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,013
What's she here for,
happy endings?

483
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,473
She's not gonna do massage at all.

484
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,807
She's Kim's daughter.

485
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,101
She's tryin' to find herself.
She'll do the books and shit.

486
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,645
Nice ass.

487
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,938
The ceiling tiles come right out

488
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,899
so I can install
the sound system myself.

489
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,692
Think you could put
in a word with, uh,

490
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,985
number one daughter there?

491
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,236
- For what?
- You know.

492
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,030
Get some a that kung pao coochie.

493
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,073
You fuckin' guys,
this is important to me.

494
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,163
Sex agrees with you,
you look great.

495
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,998
You're bein' discreet, right?

496
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,335
Well, sneaking around
is actually half the fun.

497
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,629
It's like you have this secret.

498
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,339
You know,
you wanna scream to the world...

499
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,715
Yeah, but...

500
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,467
- Do yourself a favor, though, huh?
- Yeah.

501
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,512
So, how was it?

502
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,390
Uh, I will say that
he took his time.

503
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,434
Oh, you're not
gettin' off that easy.

504
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,894
Come on, details.

505
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,312
Come on.
Hello there.

506
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,688
Hey, AJ.

507
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,482
Hey, aunt Ro.

508
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,859
How was school?

509
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,028
It sucked.

510
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,823
Mr. Wegler pulled
me out of language lab

511
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,491
to go over my term paper notes.

512
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,034
I didn't have my stuff with me so

513
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,329
he puts his faggy hand on my
shoulder and says "do your best".

514
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,623
Well, that's his job,
to get you into college.

515
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,375
Or maybe he's just a big homo.

516
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,876
Could be.

517
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,463
I'm making ziti for dinner. Go start
your assignments, I will call you.

518
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,383
Could I watch TV first?

519
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,009
Promise me you're gonna work later.

520
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,469
Mm, but you gotta help me.

521
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,679
I will.

522
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,859
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, my Jackie.

523
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,443
Oh, honey.

524
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,781
They never caught those
goddamn chinks who killed him.

525
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,618
Oh, my God, it hurts.

526
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,706
So I'm findin' the other copy

527
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,333
when gene, the actuary,
completely unloads on me.

528
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,459
Jerk.

529
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,963
Like yellin's gonna make
me do anything but screw up more.

530
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,382
You know you have to remember
that when you're the boss.

531
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,175
The boss.

532
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,635
It's amazing isn't it?

533
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,563
Jerks.

534
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,773
Garbage pails are right there.

535
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,946
Come on.

536
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,331
- Holy fuck.
- What?!

537
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,333
Oh, my God, is it a fetus?

538
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,546
- Oh my God!
- Shh!

539
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,758
It's crack, or crank maybe.

540
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,884
They were drug dealers?

541
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,970
Yeah. They were probably thinkin'
they were bein' tailed by the cops.

542
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,931
Honey, your parole.

543
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,143
Happy?

544
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,561
Come on.

545
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,404
I've never seen that much money
before.

546
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,323
There's gotta be 10, 12 grand.

547
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,701
Look at this,
you're doubly blessed.

548
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:40,082
You're right, Kim, now this.

549
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,335
I am gonna buy you a ring.

550
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,673
You are the sweetest,
sweetest man.

551
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,759
But you should put
it into the business.

552
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,428
See, I gotta start
thinkin' like that.

553
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,639
It's a learning curve.

554
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,146
Well, it seems to say
here that this piggy represents

555
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,107
intellectualism over the physical.

556
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,693
So maybe the... the
eyeglasses are symbolic.

557
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,862
And that's a good topic
for section two in your outline.

558
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,782
AJ, wake up!

559
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,243
I'm not gonna do this by myself.

560
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,870
How are you gonna finish this paper?
It's not gonna write itself.

561
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,170
So now this, uh, so-called bag.

562
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,172
You sure it wasn't
on some old lady's arm?

563
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,592
I can't believe
she thought it was a baby.

564
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,094
People do that shit.

565
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,762
12 grand? Madonna mi'.

566
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,432
So how many guys you gotta jerk off
on a massage table to make that?

567
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,350
I don't know, what do
you charge without the table?

568
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,228
Ho!

569
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,105
Cristal, gentlemen?

570
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,314
Keep it comin', honey.

571
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,443
From now on, anytime somebody
steps in a pile a shit,

572
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,570
it'll be known as a blundetto.

573
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,321
To the blundetto!

574
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,333
Oh, wait.

575
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,794
I wasn't ready.

576
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,817
Huh!

577
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,861
My God, you scared me.

578
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,654
What are you doing here?

579
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,865
Jesus.
Nice greetin'.

580
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,995
How are you, everything okay?

581
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,664
AJ left this in his room.

582
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,416
Thought he might
need it to turn in.

583
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,128
Did you even look at this?

584
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,047
Who the hell is Anne Dunham?

585
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,175
How the hell should I know?

586
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,053
Well, she's obviously
some girl who was an expert

587
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,554
on "lord of the flies"
three years ago.

588
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,139
This is an A-plus paper.

589
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,770
Since when do you eat duck?

590
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,607
I can't believe he would do this.
Neither can I.

591
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,150
Considerin' how tight
he is with money.

592
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,527
That's not what I meant.
What?

593
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,237
Oh, you think he bought this?

594
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,073
Goddamnit!

595
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,702
Hello?

596
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,455
Hi, I was just laying
here thinking about you.

597
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,040
What are you wearing?

598
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,792
Yes, hello, Mr. Wegler, hi.

599
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,669
I'm afraid now is not a good time.

600
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,921
I'm serious.
I wanna know.

601
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,049
Uh, well yes, thank you very much.

602
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,717
I will make sure
that he brings it in.

603
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,261
Okay goodbye, Mr. Wegler.

604
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,472
I made reservations at that
crab place down by the shore.

605
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,100
Dinner and a little night swimming.

606
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,060
Right, okay, thank you.

607
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,480
What'd that fag want?

608
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,066
Jesus Christ,
Tony, everybody's a fag to you.

609
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,985
You know, maybe you're a fag.
You ever think about that?

610
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,570
Can I help it if I know one
when I see one?

611
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,447
Oh really, what are the signs?
Education, culture...

612
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,158
Suckin' a guy's cock
usually tips me off.

613
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,826
How do you know
who sucks whose cock?

614
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,286
What, do ya got a little secret?

615
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,913
And what do you care,
anyway, if somebody's gay.

616
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,250
It must be some big fear of yours
or you wouldn't talk about it so much.

617
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,794
I forget now. What part
of hell did you say they go to?

618
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,964
Are they with the abortion
doctors or the child molesters?

619
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,674
That was a long time ago.

620
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,925
So now you're all
open minded that you...

621
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,303
...got a couple friends
that are bologna smokers.

622
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,512
Right?

623
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,139
What the fuck are you doing?

624
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,682
Goin' for a swim.

625
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,103
What you... you gonna leave
your goddamn socks here?

626
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,897
Your underpants?!

627
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,205
Hey, that's some beautiful suit.

628
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,749
I had to get it.
It went with the shoes.

629
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,168
Whose got those?
Vito's guy?

630
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,961
Vasily's, custom made.

631
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,756
Only thing I ever found
in the street is my first wife.

632
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,509
Dealer has 20.

633
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,636
Son of a bitch.

634
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,971
I just took a beatin' at craps.

635
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,097
How you guys doin'?

636
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,266
Pocahontas here is scalpin'us.

637
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,156
What's the matter?

638
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:27,369
Oh, just nothing.
I... I don't know.

639
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,581
I just keep thinking about
AJ and that girl's paper.

640
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,709
Oh, it's a pretty common thing,
Carm', really.

641
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,629
Honestly, you know,

642
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,756
the important thing
is you took a stand.

643
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,260
A lot of parents just take
it in stride or even condone it.

644
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,594
It's just the cheating, you know.

645
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,972
It's just not like him.
He's always done his work.

646
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,099
Poorly, a lot of the time,
and late.

647
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,393
But he always did it,
he never cheated.

648
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,811
Well wait.

649
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,479
Didn't I read somewhere
in his record that

650
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,064
he stole a test at Verbum Dei?

651
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,857
Oh, please,
no, that was just acting out.

652
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,693
He was with a bad crowd.

653
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,736
They were there to
vandalize the science lab

654
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,905
but it was locked,
so they stole some tests.

655
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,366
Well, I was a late bloomer, too.

656
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,159
Union college took a chance on me

657
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,744
because they saw
that I had potential

658
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,288
but I wasn't that mature.

659
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,872
That's all this is.

660
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,416
AJ's just fighting to keep

661
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,835
pace with the kids
who seem further ahead.

662
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,921
You know you ask me,
I think he was driven to cheating.

663
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,174
It's that... that Mr. Fiske.
He is ridiculous with the pressure.

664
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,260
I mean how hopeless would you feel

665
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,554
if you really worked on
something and still got a "D".

666
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,849
I have been there, Carm'. You're
worrying for nothing, I promise.

667
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,192
I have thought about this all day.

668
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,696
You know I almost called
you from the faculty parking lot.

669
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,581
- Oh, Bob.
- What?

670
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,666
Stop.
Bob, I...

671
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,586
What's the matter?

672
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,755
I can't right now, I'm sorry.

673
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,381
I'm too upset.

674
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,972
Carmela, stay, what are you doing?

675
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,225
What kind of mother am I?
I mean look at us.

676
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,644
Do you realize under the laws
of the church I'm still married?

677
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,104
The church?

678
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,357
I can't do this tonight.
I'm sorry.

679
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,401
Jesus, Carmela, come on.

680
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,018
Okay, thanks.

681
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,436
It was a fuckin' blast.

682
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,063
You sure you don't wanna eat?

683
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,232
Steak and eggs up by skyway's.

684
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,109
Ah, I can't.

685
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,693
Come on!
Shut the door.

686
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,822
I'm gonna mang' then hit
the sack for the next 14 hours.

687
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,889
Hey. I thought once
they move you upstairs

688
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,015
you get to leave early.

689
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,267
No such luck.

690
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,810
Got a second?

691
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,438
The Soprano kid.

692
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,939
How is he doin'?

693
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,566
Got his paper yet?

694
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,776
Well, the usual.

695
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,154
Solidly below average.

696
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,739
So what, a "C"?

697
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,784
Well no, that's a little
generous for 10% insight,

698
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,453
90% Cliff notes.

699
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,912
This is an important class, tom.

700
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,874
Anything less than a "C" is gonna
blow that kid out at Arizona state.

701
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,126
You really think it's gonna
make that much of a difference?

702
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,671
As Dean of college admissions
and head of your department,

703
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,131
I happen to know it's a fact.

704
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,425
He's doing his best.

705
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,469
Well, like my dad used to say,

706
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,345
the world needs ditch diggers, too.

707
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,307
Let me ask you something.

708
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,560
How is floating this kid a C-minus
gonna fuck things up here?

709
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,729
AJ soprano's a spoiled lox, Bob.

710
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,314
He'd be lucky to
go to a trade school.

711
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,732
It's a D-plus.

712
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,110
Tom, cut him a break.

713
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,540
So what does it mean to the kid
who really breaks his ass in here

714
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,251
if Fredo Corleone can
get a "C" 'cause you asked?

715
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,212
Is that what this is about?

716
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,505
His background?

717
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,512
Goodnight.

718
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,138
I'll be workin' over at the place.

719
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,682
That's good dedication.

720
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:01,976
Way to go.

721
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,774
See regular people
need a place to relax, too.

722
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,193
They can't just hop on
a plane to the Bahamas, right?

723
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,488
Hey guys, what do you
think of daddy's business?

724
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,242
Jason, Justin,
I'm talkin' to ya.

725
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,535
I like it.

726
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,203
Yeah, it's nice.

727
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,206
Well, maybe someday
when this thing takes off

728
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,792
you guys can work here,
like as a summer job or somethin'.

729
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,752
Would ya like that?
Workin' with your old man?

730
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,087
Sure.

731
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,215
Alright, put those away.

732
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:33,883
You gotta do your homework...

733
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,885
...before I take you back or
your mom's gonna kill me.

734
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:39,222
Mom says we need helmets
to ride the scooters you got us.

735
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,598
We'll stop at sports authority.

736
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,849
Come on, do your homework.

737
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,142
Where?

738
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,686
I don't know.

739
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,104
Here, on the floor over there.

740
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,136
Hold it like this.

741
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,262
Ready?

742
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,888
Haa!

743
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,100
That was fast.

744
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,810
I took a shortcut.

745
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,033
Did you ever think
of painting that ceiling?

746
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,909
Maybe.

747
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,412
How about a glow-in-the-dark
solar system

748
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,164
like I had in college?

749
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,041
I was thinking blue, maybe.

750
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,668
You know, like when you
stick your hand in the Caribbean.

751
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,045
Oh, yeah.

752
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,383
You think union college
is a good place of AJ?

753
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,761
I don't know.

754
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,054
Could be.

755
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,389
You know,
maybe you could tell them

756
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,767
how he's a lot like you
were when you were his age.

757
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,186
That's a thought.

758
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,689
So have you ever
been to the Caribbean?

759
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,067
Yeah, Barbados, once.
Years ago.

760
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,443
Oh, it was beautiful.

761
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,070
Yeah, it is.

762
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,741
Maybe you could bring
up the fact that he has A.D.D.,

763
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,285
because it's not
the stigma it once was.

764
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,496
That's true.

765
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,289
It isn't.

766
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,416
Where are you going?

767
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,640
Mmm.

768
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,059
Faculty lunch, right?

769
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,395
Patty D'Amico brought them.

770
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,778
What's the matter, you okay?

771
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,614
Maybe we should take a time out.

772
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,409
What?

773
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,160
Really, why?

774
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,830
Because every time I think about

775
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,331
putting the arm on tom Fiske

776
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,417
I wanna poke my eyes
out with a knitting needle.

777
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,585
What does that have to do with us?

778
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,172
I just think we should, uh...

779
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,134
Not do this.

780
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:25,722
Oh, no, here tell me.

781
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,016
I don't know any
other way to put this.

782
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,477
I have been thinking and...

783
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,896
I don't know, I...

784
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,315
I think you're a user, Carmela.

785
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,900
What?

786
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:42,321
Maybe you saw an opportunity in me
and you just took what you needed.

787
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,532
Oh, that is not true.

788
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,076
I am here because
I enjoy being with you.

789
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,786
That it was wonderful, in fact.

790
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,456
Yeah, it was.
I mean, it is, I know.

791
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,751
How could asking someone you're
with for help be using them?

792
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,377
That's what people do.

793
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,676
Bob, this hurts.

794
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,473
Oh, my.

795
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,350
Oh my stomach I feel sick.

796
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,937
You strong-armed me using the
only weapon you have, your pussy.

797
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,732
How dare you talk to me that way?

798
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,026
Okay, let's pretend you
don't know what I'm talking about.

799
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,444
I don't.

800
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,404
Of course I don't have
a fucking masters degree.

801
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,573
Leaving me with a massive
hard-on the other night

802
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,116
and then practically
attacking me sexually

803
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,868
after you got what you wanted.

804
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,245
You know what, Bob?

805
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,538
You are fucked up.

806
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,291
You need help, you know that?

807
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,251
Fucking idiot I am.

808
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,379
Take it easy.

809
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,299
Yeah. Believe it or not,
I thought you cared about me.

810
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,343
I just thought you
should know how I feel.

811
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,011
Fuck you.

812
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,931
You better watch your step.

813
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,147
Jesus Christ, it's four A.M.

814
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,066
Okay, boys, hands on the table.

815
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,361
Full boat.

816
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,613
Jesus Christ.

817
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,533
Three fuckin' Jacks over here.

818
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,076
You just keep jackin', my friend.

819
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,953
That's it for me, tapioca.

820
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,871
You blew the whole 12 grand?

821
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,874
What are you stupid?
I got 400 left.

822
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,713
Punch in in two hours.

823
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,218
There's no sense goin' home.

824
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,645
Fuck.

825
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,132
Hello?

826
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,550
Hey, hon', I'm over at your mom's.

827
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,426
Great.

828
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,803
Roadway Xpress delivered
five massage tables.

829
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,097
There?
They had that address by mistake.

830
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,515
I told them to deliver here.

831
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,100
They're still in the boxes.

832
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,978
I looked inside, though.
They're pretty spiff.

833
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,813
That Salamanca fabric was worth it.

834
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,273
It's like leather almost.

835
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,733
Great.

836
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,067
What's the matter?

837
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,569
Shit gives me a headache.

838
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,487
Details and all that stuff.

839
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,573
Oh, you, it's no big.
For gosh sake.

840
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,699
We'll get Rudy's truck.

841
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,117
Maybe I have a brain tumor.

842
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,535
Honey, you don't.

843
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,995
This headache in my jaw.

844
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,580
I read it in "Time" magazine.

845
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,291
It's really not that likely, jeez.

846
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,169
I gotta get back to the painting or
I'll never get the fuck outta here tonight.

847
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:47,798
I am so fucking sick and tired
of your gambling and complaining.

848
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,258
I've got a headache.

849
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,094
When I think of me waiting outside
that prison for you to come out

850
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,262
sometimes I wanna vomit.

851
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,389
I am sick!
I'm evil...

852
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,190
Hey, Henry For'...
Big entrepreneur.

853
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,525
I like color.

854
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,410
My friend, Pak, come by?

855
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,037
Fix the toilet?

856
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,331
It's not fixed. He's gotta
come back with a fuckin' part.

857
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,626
Oh, Pak, he a good plumber.

858
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,462
Right over here, "Wes-a Calwell".

859
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,048
Wes Calwel, Wes Calwel.

860
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,552
West Caldwell.

861
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:40,226
So, partner,
we open in three day, huh?

862
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:45,815
Fuckin' stroll in.

863
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,525
I'm over here bustin'
my fuckin' ass!

864
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,694
You fuckin' crazy?!

865
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,198
Work in your fuckin' laundry,
all fuckin' day!

866
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,995
Fuckin' scam artist.

867
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,872
Fuck.

868
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,053
Ah!

869
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,162
The pole is bent.

870
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,581
Somebody been punchin' this door?

871
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,169
You had a man around
you wouldn't need to call me.

872
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,004
Yeah, right.

873
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,799
You're still young, Mel.

874
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,259
A good lookin' woman.

875
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,970
There's no reason you shouldn't
move on with your life,

876
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,764
if that's what you want.

877
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,482
Well, there actually was somebody.

878
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,278
And he seemed very nice.

879
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,113
Oh, that's good.

880
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,326
He was a wolf in sheep's clothing.

881
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,497
He made all these accusations
about my character.

882
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,960
Whatever I say, whatever I do,

883
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,505
because I was married
to a man like Tony,

884
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,175
my motives will always
be called into question.

885
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,228
Well.

886
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,250
Hey.
Sit down.

887
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,919
You want somethin'?

888
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,506
Aaah.

889
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,258
What'd you do?

890
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,301
Back.

891
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,678
Fuckin' job.

892
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,346
A work-related injury.

893
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,689
So, here's the thing.

894
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,609
You mentioned you might need
someone to run the swag airbags.

895
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,292
Bring me a vodka rocks

896
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,335
and get me some kind of a cushion,
will ya?

897
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,507
What happened with
the massage parlor?

898
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,559
It's hard doin' business
with strangers.
