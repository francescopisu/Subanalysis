1
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:46,355
New York's only
classic rock station, Q-1043.

2
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,608
Look at this.

3
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,112
The house sang out to us
of both Miami and Taormina

4
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,488
where we had
our honeymoon.

5
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,615
Nicole said,
let's buy it.

6
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,243
Can just about
smell the salt.

7
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,121
You mean the painting
or the view?

8
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,289
Both.

9
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,334
That's called
the "Trumpay la oil".

10
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,336
Fool the eye.

11
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,172
It was done by an artist right
over here in West Hempstead.

12
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,133
I'll be damned.

13
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,468
Follow me, Jerry.

14
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,221
This little bitch
is for you.

15
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,306
It's a Whirlpool Duet.

16
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,641
Top of the line.

17
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,976
Same as mine.

18
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,936
Nicole is head
over heels with it.

19
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,355
This is above
and beyond, Carmine.

20
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,941
Well, thank my father, too,
may he rest in peace.

21
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,402
This is
for Feeport.

22
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,778
It's a token.

23
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,196
You know it's
my understanding, Carmine,

24
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,157
that Johnny's still
sore about that.

25
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,701
That's why I
appreciate your support.

26
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,369
I'm moved up
here now.

27
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,288
You and me are gonna
do great things together.

28
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,123
Amen.

29
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,249
Daddy!

30
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:47,791
Daddy!

31
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,084
The boat
is sinking!

32
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,755
Carmine!

33
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,257
My God!

34
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,099
I just sailed her up
from Miami three weeks ago.

35
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,726
She was fine.

36
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,188
You should call
the coast guard, Carmine.

37
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,377
Oh!

38
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,629
Whoa!

39
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,636
Ah!

40
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,637
Oh, shit.

41
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,681
It's okay,
take it easy.

42
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,017
After all these
years of marriage,

43
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,144
you know what you
find yourself thinking

44
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,812
in your
private moments...

45
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,273
Please, God,
let me die first.

46
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,317
I don't
wanna miss him.

47
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,278
Well, he's gonna
be alright.

48
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,864
You're lucky.

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,535
In some way,
you've been spared that.

50
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,289
Well, you and Tony
calling it quits now.

51
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,506
Maybe we should
cancel the party.

52
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,592
Maybe he'll be fine
by his birthday.

53
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,054
You know he's turning 75,
ma, that's a milestone.

54
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,472
Ooh.

55
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,433
He's got
some bruising.

56
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,268
Very lucky man.

57
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,811
Those hedges
broke his fall.

58
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,063
But a few days of rest
and he should be fine.

59
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,482
The neurologist is
giving him a final look,

60
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,858
and then you can
take him home.

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,735
Thank you
so much, doctor.

62
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,820
Thank God.

63
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,613
Ooh.

64
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,908
His roofing days are over,
I'll tell you that right now.

65
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,243
I guess, huh?

66
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,374
So, uh, what do you
think about the party?

67
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,501
Jeez, Ma, I...

68
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,753
well, I think
we should go for it.

69
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,926
Well, what do you think
about inviting Tony?

70
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,761
Well, that's
the thing.

71
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,763
I don't know if
I should or not.

72
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,558
Everybody would
understand if you didn't.

73
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,809
You're separated.

74
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,601
I know, I know.

75
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,437
But just the idea of
having a family party

76
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,231
in the backyard without
Tony there manning the grill,

77
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,984
playing host,
it wouldn't be the same.

78
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,694
Shh.

79
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,237
It's gonna be
okay, baby.

80
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,698
Why don't they take
care of this man?!

81
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,204
I think it's
a very wise decision.

82
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:32,956
What decision?

83
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,207
I haven't made one.

84
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,127
I thought I heard
you say that you had.

85
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,420
That he wasn't coming.

86
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,803
Maserati.

87
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,972
Kinda draws
attention, no?

88
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:49,848
Ah, true.

89
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,184
Friends of ours, most of 'em,
probably wouldn't own it.

90
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,311
It was always
a dream of mine

91
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,104
to own a fine
Italian sports car.

92
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,939
A salut' then.

93
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,735
And in the Guinea gray it,
uh, looks fantastic.

94
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,905
Tops out a 176
miles per hour.

95
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,741
Standing quarter,
13 and change.

96
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,742
How many horses?

97
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,618
390.

98
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,455
What'd that set
you back about, uh...

99
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,831
99 and change.

100
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,708
You're spendin' like
you're already on the throne.

101
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,543
Had a good year.

102
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,961
Oh, God bless.

103
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,465
While we're doin'
car talk here, Phil...

104
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,802
Madonna mi',
he won't let that thing go.

105
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,970
He owed me money
and he was duckin' me.

106
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,472
Look, I'm not
sayin' you're wrong.

107
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,099
Phil treats nickels
like manhole covers.

108
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,558
Believe me, I know.

109
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,935
But the captains
loyal to me

110
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,728
need to know I stand
behind them right now.

111
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,563
Fuckin' little Carmine.

112
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,734
This asshole's givin' away
washing machines.

113
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,944
You believe that?

114
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,488
He don't have collision
insurance, fuckin' Phil?

115
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,073
His son-in-law's
a broker.

116
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,409
They let it lapse
lookin' for a better rate.

117
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,370
Fuckin' idiot.

118
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,499
Tony, I ruled
in your favor.

119
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,334
The racetrack.

120
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,877
The money
Philly owed you.

121
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,671
Well if
I'm payin' for it

122
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,506
we do it at pussy's
or we don't do it at all.

123
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,550
His wife's runnin'
the body shop now.

124
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,552
So I can at least
control expenses.

125
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,764
Thanks.

126
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,975
Come on.

127
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,476
Get in, take ya
for a ride.

128
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,895
Fuckin' thing's
so powerful,

129
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,440
I had to take a lesson
from the dealer last night.

130
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,870
Pretty low.

131
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,873
How does Ginny
like the car?

132
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,748
She loves it.

133
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,875
But she hasn't
drivin' with me yet.

134
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,417
With her knee,

135
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,961
she has a little trouble
gettin' into the seat.

136
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,551
Ho.

137
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,488
Tony.

138
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,323
Hey, Ang'.

139
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,158
How are ya?

140
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,117
Good.

141
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,747
Listen, a friend of mine
banged up his car pretty good

142
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,915
so I was thinkin',
you know,

143
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,750
maybe help us both out

144
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,710
and, uh, throw
a little business your way.

145
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,753
You didn't need
to come down.

146
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,712
You just could've
phoned me.

147
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,089
The thing is, I gotta
pay for the repairs.

148
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,007
Long story.

149
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,550
I distracted him
while he was drivin'.'

150
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,678
Anyway, the point
bein' that, uh,

151
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,223
anything you can do
to keep costs in line,

152
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,058
would be a big
help to me.

153
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,272
Well, you look like
you're doin' pretty good

154
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,066
since we had
that phone call, uh,

155
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,611
you know, you asked me could
you take over puss's body shop.

156
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,488
Thank you
for that, Tony.

157
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,739
You didn't
have to say yes,

158
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,909
with all the other kinda
business you do through here.

159
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,536
Uh, anyway,
his name is Phil,

160
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,579
and, uh, Carmela
sends her love.

161
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,581
Please say hello...

162
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,022
Finally.

163
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,066
I left a message
I was gonna come by.

164
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,693
Well, I got in late.

165
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,159
Girl called
in sick.

166
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,953
You should
get a new one.

167
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,539
Have a seat.

168
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,630
May I get you
anything?

169
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,222
How's your father?

170
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,932
Much better.

171
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,852
Oh, thanks.

172
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,403
He'll be fine for
the party, thank God.

173
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,698
Well, that's good.

174
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,453
What party?

175
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,954
75th birthday?

176
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,332
You know, the surprise party
we talked about last summer?

177
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, yeah,
that's comin' up?

178
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,293
Yeah, next Saturday.

179
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,632
But actually that's
why I wanted to come by.

180
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,428
'Cause I think maybe
it would be best...

181
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,890
be easier, anyway,
for both of us, if uh...

182
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,350
If I went
at it alone.

183
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,393
And not have
you there.

184
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,067
Oh, yeah.

185
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,610
Uh, you know my father
would love to have you there,

186
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,236
you know he's crazy
about your sausages

187
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,655
and all the rest
of it, but...

188
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,283
I thought, uh,
you know, why put us and...

189
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,619
and people in an
uncomfortable situation.

190
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,164
Well, I decided right away when
we broke up I wasn't comin'.

191
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,124
Really?

192
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,006
I'm so glad
you understand.

193
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,092
It was hard for me
to come to this decision

194
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,301
let alone tell you.

195
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,765
Well, I'd like
to contribute, anyway.

196
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,267
No, mom and I are
taking care of it.

197
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,435
For Hugh's 75th?

198
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,395
I insist.

199
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,107
You know, I would rather see
you go back to your therapist.

200
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,900
I'd like to see you
go to a therapist.

201
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,735
And I'm not
the only one.

202
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,237
Oh, really?

203
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,073
Well, you can tell them all
that I can't afford it.

204
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,533
Well, it's not really
your business anymore,

205
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,951
whether I go
or what!

206
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,437
Brought you some
Danish and coffee.

207
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,439
Fuckin' medication.

208
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,774
I can't think.

209
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,568
Can't stay awake.

210
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,862
It don't have
that side effect.

211
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,405
But it'll help
your outlook

212
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,657
if you take it consistently
like you're supposed to.

213
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,662
What's on?

214
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,415
It said in the guide
it's an Italian movie.

215
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,751
But even with the captions
I can't tell what's what.

216
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,545
They had Jesus hangin'
off a helicopter.

217
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,630
But you could
tell it was a dummy.

218
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,301
You know who I saw
at the bakery?

219
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,095
How the fuck
could I know?

220
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,847
Rosalie Aprile.

221
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,307
Said they're havin'
a surprise party

222
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,933
for Carmela's father
next week.

223
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,602
He's gonna be 75.

224
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,229
You get an invite?

225
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,610
No, but we go way back
to when Moses wore short pants.

226
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,447
I better
call Hugh.

227
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,574
Tell him not
to expect me.

228
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,743
It's a surprise
party, Jun'.

229
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,286
What, are we children?

230
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,374
Anyway, at our age
it's enough surprise

231
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,876
we're still alive
every morning.

232
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,836
What city and state, please?

233
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,087
In West Orange.

234
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,341
DeAngelis, Hugo.

235
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,178
The call can automatically
be completed by pressing one,

236
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,807
for an additional
charge of.35¢.

237
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,808
What the fuck.

238
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,767
It's over anyhow.

239
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:37,899
Hello?

240
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,901
Hugo, como esta?

241
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,319
Who is this?

242
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,862
Corrado Soprano.

243
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,531
Oh, ho ho ho.

244
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,615
Corrado.

245
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,617
How are ya?

246
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,535
How am I.

247
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,245
I'm a prisoner
in my own home,

248
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,412
is how I am.

249
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,873
What do
we live for?

250
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:55,625
Yeah.

251
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,211
Anyhow, I wanted
to wish you abuona fortuna,

252
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,630
and also send
you my regrets.

253
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,507
I'd love to be
at your jubilee.

254
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,550
Junior.

255
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:04,884
Jubilee?

256
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,720
But the federal government
says I can't leave the house,

257
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,848
and my family
keeps me sedated.

258
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,559
Bobby told me
it was a surprise party

259
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,018
but I told him, I go,

260
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,937
at our age
it's enough surprise

261
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,398
every day when we get up
in the mornin', right?

262
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,859
Ohh,
I suppose so.

263
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,945
So Happy Birthday,
my friend, and many more.

264
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,321
Arrivederci.

265
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,805
To think, when I got
outta the joint,

266
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,891
I thought an airbag
was Paulie Walnuts.

267
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,310
How'd we do this week?

268
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:56,811
Good.

269
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,479
The Acura dealer,
what's his name,

270
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,647
he took 20 units.

271
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,525
Carlo gave me
the okay to make

272
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,319
some personnel changes
at the warehouse.

273
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,572
Your call.

274
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:12,952
I don't know.

275
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,245
The airbag thing.

276
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,622
It earns good.

277
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,582
It's not hard work,
Christ knows, but...

278
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,668
But what?

279
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,379
Think I could be of a lot more
service to you in other areas.

280
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,965
And gettin' straightened out
wouldn't hurt neither.

281
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,092
Just eat what's on
your plate right now.

282
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,638
I mean, Christ,
what's it been, a month?

283
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,431
I'm a team player,
cousin.

284
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,058
I'm Charlie Hustle.

285
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,644
If that's what
you want I'll do it.

286
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,561
Look.

287
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,397
If you need
some money...

288
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,857
Get the fuck
outta here.

289
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,362
Alright.

290
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,698
Let's go get a drink.

291
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,453
What should I get Hugh DeAngelis
for his birthday?

292
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,622
I was thinkin' cigars
but then I figured

293
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,457
you were probably
gonna bring some.

294
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,669
Well, actually
I decided not to go.

295
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,381
In light of the situation,
I went, I saw Carm,

296
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,050
I told her I thought
it'd be best if I sit it out.

297
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,402
Hi, Phil.

298
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,277
Joe.

299
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,988
Where's your
brother-in-law, doll?

300
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,073
I wouldn't know.

301
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,868
Hey, Phillip,
how the hell are ya?

302
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,538
How's the neck?

303
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,789
Where's the car?

304
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,792
We all passed a lotta water
since the old days, huh?

305
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,628
I was away when all that shit
went down with your brother.

306
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,672
What the fuck
happened?

307
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,466
We don't like
to talk about it.

308
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,885
Your car's
in here, Phil.

309
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,430
It's all set.

310
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,649
What the fuck
is this?

311
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,031
It was a front-end
collision, Phil.

312
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,116
This new paint
isn't as brilliant.

313
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,076
It's factory paint,
same as original.

314
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,578
It is different,
it's duller.

315
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,381
Something's off
with the seat.

316
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,924
What is it, Phil?

317
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,801
Feels off kilter.

318
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,303
Try it, Joey.

319
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,733
You're right,
it's off its axis.

320
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,359
It reclines
strange, too.

321
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,652
Try it.

322
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,155
Nobody said anything
about the seats.

323
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,741
This is unacceptable.

324
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,242
Come on, Joey.

325
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,244
Give me a call when you
get the job done, alright?

326
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,662
A couple of
days, Phil.

327
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,999
Phil, we did
what was asked of us.

328
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,918
Call me when
it's done right.

329
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,800
So dad,

330
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,760
how does dinner
at Vesuvio's sound

331
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,844
for your birthday
next week?

332
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,845
Just us.

333
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,555
We'll come here first
for the presents,

334
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,015
and then we'll
go over there.

335
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,476
Sure, sure.

336
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,978
That sounds fine.

337
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,526
Did somebody
tell you something?

338
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,944
I know all about it.

339
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,862
You can save
the cloak and dagger.

340
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,782
Huh, what?

341
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,992
Junior Soprano
told me all about it.

342
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,245
That miserable
fucking man.

343
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,287
Ugh!

344
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,330
You don't know
the half.

345
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,832
Relax.

346
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,208
I'm fine
with knowin'.

347
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,919
At my age,
it's surprise enough

348
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,796
to be able to get
outta bed every morning.

349
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,714
So who's comin'
to this shindig?

350
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,591
Goddamn him!

351
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,345
All of us, your brother,
Lester, Dr. Fegoli...

352
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,638
Russ Fegoli?

353
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,639
He's in town?

354
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,766
He retired from
the foreign service.

355
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,310
But they were livin' out
in marin country or wherever.

356
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,563
Well, they
settled on Jersey.

357
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,440
Octavia, the oldest,
lives here.

358
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,986
Wait, who's Dr. Fago?

359
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,988
Fegoli.

360
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:17,655
Feg.

361
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,949
She of the five page
Christmas card.

362
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,909
"...and on flag day,

363
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,787
papa Russ shook hands
with Andrew Cuomo..."

364
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,997
What an honor.

365
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,039
B.F.D.

366
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,250
The Fegoli kids
finished college.

367
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,127
That's what sticks
in your craw.

368
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,712
What sticks in
my craw is that

369
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,588
when he got that medal

370
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,548
you two weren't even
invited to the ceremony.

371
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,508
It was out
in California.

372
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,593
They knew that
your father

373
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,344
doesn't like to be
out of his element.

374
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,600
Now, here's someone we can
all be proud of, Anthony.

375
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,271
Dr. Fegoli served
in the state department.

376
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,190
In Rome, he was
career assistant

377
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,066
to the ambassador
to the Vatican.

378
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,694
He got a medal
from the Pope himself.

379
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,653
Wow.

380
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,780
But when we were kids
together in the Navy,

381
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,616
he had such a bad
case of the crabs

382
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,618
we used to call him
the governor of Maryland.

383
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,329
Hey, Hugh, stop
acting like a child.

384
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,121
Oh, lighten up.

385
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,206
He's old enough
to hear.

386
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,874
She's right,
knock it off.

387
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,211
Who else is comin'?

388
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,587
Freddy di Novi...

389
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,005
Tony'll love him.

390
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,675
Who else?

391
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,054
Dad, Tony isn't
coming to the party.

392
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,931
Why won't he come?

393
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,516
Well, I felt that, uh,
since we're separated,

394
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,353
we should get used to the idea
of living separate lives.

395
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,021
Oh, that's
a crock a shit.

396
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,439
Hugh, don't talk
to her like that.

397
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,357
This is very
difficult for her.

398
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,651
I've known the man
for 20-something years!

399
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,526
It's his house!

400
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,361
How is it gonna look?

401
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,738
I talked to Tony about it,
he's in agreement with me.

402
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,406
Because you put
the screws to him.

403
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,866
Fine, I'll cancel
the party.

404
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:44,992
Go right the hell ahead
because I'm not comin'

405
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,536
if the man of
the house isn't there.

406
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,376
Yeah?

407
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,627
Tony, it's Angie.

408
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,255
We did all the repairs
you said on Phil's car.

409
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,464
He came today

410
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,216
and now he found
a dent in the rear.

411
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,301
His seat, there's
a problem with that.

412
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,261
His seat?

413
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,929
I didn't wanna get
into these extras

414
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,264
without checking
with you.

415
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,724
Ang', honey, you wanna run
a body shop, run a body shop.

416
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,726
You said could you claim
your piece of the garage.

417
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,603
So you wanna be
a woman in business,

418
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,064
then do what you think
the situation calls for.

419
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,191
I just wanna put
my kids through college.

420
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,859
That's a good thing, Ang'.

421
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,988
You know some women left alone
like that would've given up.

422
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,032
Tony, before I outlay
for these costs,

423
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,492
yeah, I need to know...

424
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,244
ang', I'm not there,
what do I know?

425
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,620
It's your call.

426
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,013
Ton'?

427
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:47,888
What's up?

428
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,474
Pussy's body shop is
one of your stops, right?

429
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,269
Well they're fixin'
the fuckin' Shah of Iran's car.

430
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,895
Uh, can you be there
when he picks it up?

431
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:55,980
Make sure he's happy,

432
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,024
but don't let the shit
spiral out of control.

433
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,108
Right.

434
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,026
I'll take care of it.

435
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:00,901
Thanks.

436
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,823
On my way to Welsh Farms,
get a triple blueberry sundae.

437
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,700
Good for you.

438
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,617
Enjoy.

439
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,411
Hot summer night.

440
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,164
Go for it.

441
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,206
You deserve it.

442
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,750
Alright, yeah.

443
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,876
I'll talk to ya later.

444
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:21,964
Opus.

445
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,882
Fine choice.

446
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,928
Angelo, here,
spoke very highly of you

447
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,306
and how you handled yourself
with him in Pennsylvania.

448
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,308
That's why I
wanted to meet you.

449
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,102
We were like
frick and frack in the can.

450
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,937
Angelo's my buddy.

451
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,857
He knew all the Jackie Gleason
stuff by heart.

452
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,609
He acted all
the parts hisself.

453
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,943
Do a little bit
for rusty.

454
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,528
The Mambo thing.

455
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,617
Mambo?

456
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,326
Oh!

457
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,161
Carlos was teaching
you the Mambo?

458
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,913
That's a
different story!

459
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,623
Get out!

460
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,874
Get out!

461
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,630
So how's your
reentry been?

462
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,589
You doin' okay?

463
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,298
Yeah.

464
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,716
Tony's been
good with me.

465
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,843
I always liked
your cousin.

466
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,220
He's a real gentleman.

467
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,931
Angelo's lookin'
out for you, too.

468
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,768
I told rusty that you
might need a little earn.

469
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,939
Well, yeah, I could use
a little cash injection.

470
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,440
Maybe a push up
the pyramid.

471
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,317
You know,
time served.

472
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,488
We need
somethin' done.

473
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,824
Nice little
payday for you,

474
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,828
and an opportunity for you to
hone that rep you left behind.

475
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,789
And this involves?

476
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,083
Somebody needs to go.

477
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,044
Anyone I know?

478
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,217
New York guy,
not Jersey.

479
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,010
Who's he with?

480
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,345
Friend of a friend.

481
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,972
Not a friend of ours.

482
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,892
Friend of Johnny's.

483
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,354
You guys gotta
settle that shit.

484
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,897
It's not the boat.

485
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,941
It's not the boat.

486
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,026
It's Lorraine Calluzzo.

487
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,987
Rainey Calluzzo.

488
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,907
Little Carmine
went to school with her.

489
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,659
They go back
that far.

490
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,871
Kill a woman.

491
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,997
Come on.

492
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,882
I can't sign on
right now.

493
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,718
I wanna give my cousin
the benefit of the doubt.

494
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,638
He don't want us involved in
this problem over here anyway.

495
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,849
Why don't you think
about it for a bit?

496
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,517
I don't know.

497
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,518
I don't think so.

498
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,562
But thanks, guys.

499
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,815
We had a big talk
over here the other day

500
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,234
and the consensus seems
to want your presence

501
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,444
at my father's party.

502
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,489
Well, that's nice but
it's kinda short notice now.

503
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,407
Look, it's for
my father, not me.

504
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,620
I made plans to go
fishin' with sil.

505
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,830
Well, he really
wants you there.

506
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,248
If you could find
a way to make it,

507
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,958
I know he would
be very happy.

508
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,669
He's very
fond of you.

509
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,423
The New York Salsicc',
hickory wood, whatever.

510
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,258
You're not
usin' Artie?

511
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,761
Yeah, I got him doin'
appetizers and salads,

512
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,262
but, uh, he's really
there as a guest.

513
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,430
I am cooking.

514
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,099
Tomorrow's gonna
be a mad house,

515
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,476
just, living hell.

516
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,773
I don't know, I'll...

517
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,067
I'll see
what I can do.

518
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,278
Thank you, Tony,
I appreciate it.

519
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,954
Uh, Jerry say
to refrigerate.

520
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,621
Okay.

521
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,207
I think there is
room in the garage.

522
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:51,882
Hey, carm.

523
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:52,675
Tony.

524
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,343
I know you're
shorthanded, uh,

525
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,220
I thought you might need
some help around here today.

526
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,304
It's my weekend
with the boys.

527
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,264
They'll stay
out of the way.

528
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:09,692
Aunt Carmela's nice enough
to let you guys enjoy her pool,

529
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,652
and you wanna
destroy her property.

530
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,987
It's a beach chair.

531
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,238
It can get wet.

532
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,489
Don't get smart!

533
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,865
You wanna go home?

534
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,002
What can I do?

535
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,378
Ah, the dips.

536
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,838
I forgot the dips.

537
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,257
I gotta duck out later.

538
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,175
I could pick some up
for you at grand union.

539
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,553
Grand union closed
its doors 10 years ago.

540
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,138
You know what,
frig the dip.

541
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,556
They're gonna have
to survive with salsa.

542
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,642
Can I make you
a cocktail?

543
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,519
I make a mean
rusty nail.

544
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,812
Now?

545
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,400
Thanks again for lettin'
the kids take a swim.

546
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,610
Aw, sure.

547
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,902
Anytime,
you know that.

548
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,448
Cheers.

549
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,244
They love bein' here.

550
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,205
This is truly
a beautiful home.

551
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,084
What, are you here,
five years now?

552
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,045
I asked you
to get up at 11.

553
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,588
We got a lot
to do today.

554
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,006
Oh, you were
supposed to send this

555
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,466
to Mr. Wegler
for summer school.

556
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,051
Put it down!

557
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,139
Greetings,
birthday people.

558
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,932
You are here,
which is great.

559
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,142
You can help
with the set-up.

560
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,185
Hi, Mrs. Soprano.

561
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,104
Uh, uh, finn this
is our Uncle Tony.

562
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,689
Tony this is
Meadow's friend, Finn.

563
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,690
Hey.

564
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:33,942
What are you doing?

565
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,779
I'm making grandpa's favorite
maple-walnut icebox cake.

566
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,030
We have cake.

567
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:38,405
Jerry just...

568
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,406
why don't you
take a swim?

569
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,407
I know you're hot.

570
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,909
Do you have a towel?

571
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,828
I'll bring you
a coffee, too.

572
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,538
I'll be outside.

573
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,165
Cake pan?

574
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,334
Meadow, I have
a lot to do today.

575
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,293
Hello?

576
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,128
I'm making dessert,
to help?

577
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,632
Seems like
a nice guy.

578
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:57,716
Yep.

579
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,686
Any luck with Kelly?

580
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,523
I been scourin'
the Internet for any trace.

581
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,359
Here is your
cake pan.

582
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,115
And you're gonna
clean up your baking mess.

583
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,666
I can imagine how much
you must miss her.

584
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,251
Your only daughter.

585
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,504
What was she like 11
when she lived with you guys?

586
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,007
We had her 12th birthday party
right before she moved out.

587
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,012
How'd she do
in school back then?

588
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,139
Straight A's.

589
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,099
Oh, my God, what is
the matter with them?!

590
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,942
Don't lift that by yourself,
Hugh, wait for some help.

591
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,112
What are you
doing here?

592
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,280
You always
do this!

593
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,990
The party is
not for hours!

594
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,116
He needs help.

595
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,075
What am I
doin' here?

596
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,201
I'm returning
your port-a-vac.

597
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,244
You said
you needed it.

598
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,704
Happy Birthday,
grandpa.

599
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,330
Later for that,
get your Uncle out here.

600
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,541
He left, he said he told you
he had to bolt for a minute.

601
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,084
He asked us to
watch the twins.

602
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,924
Here, help me
with this.

603
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,385
Oh, my goodness,
what a bother.

604
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,512
Excuse us for living.

605
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,185
How ya doin'?

606
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,227
I'm Tony.

607
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,189
Oh, yeah, the other
Tony's cousin, right?

608
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,566
It reclines
perfectly, try it.

609
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,650
Fuck that.

610
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,778
I don't feel like
I'm sittin' at 12 o'clock.

611
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,780
You're sittin'
at 12 o'clock.

612
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,531
May I?

613
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,033
I don't
give a fuck.

614
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,702
You can sit in there
'til fuckin' St. Gennaro.

615
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,371
It'll still need
to be dealt with.

616
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,749
This car went through
a major collision.

617
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,421
Seems okay.

618
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,799
How could it be
okay if it's askew?

619
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,138
What's the matter, Joey,
you got a fuckin' eye problem?

620
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,098
Look like Stevie Wonder
your eyes rollin' around.

621
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:10,724
Aw, what'd I say?

622
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,184
I didn't say
nothin', Phil.

623
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,603
Replacin' the seat
will cost a fortune.

624
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,813
Give me
a break, Phil.

625
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,064
The seat is fine.

626
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,816
You just have a problem
with the grain

627
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,359
on the leather
from the factory.

628
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,443
You think
I'm stupid?

629
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,611
Ho, ho!

630
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,279
Don't take
it out on me.

631
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,239
Come on, Joey.

632
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,448
Hey, Phil.

633
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,243
Now, how about this.

634
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,829
They replace the tracks
under the seat,

635
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,914
maybe throw in
a cd player in the dash.

636
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,123
We already
did that.

637
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,500
We replaced
the tracks.

638
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,876
He's got a
cd player.

639
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,002
Jesus God, Duke,

640
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,172
they're hosin' us for
a 2,000 dollar factory seat.

641
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,466
Come on, Joey.

642
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,218
Tony, nice
to meet ya.

643
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,511
Come on,
you comin'?

644
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,264
Joe, try to keep
him cooled down.

645
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,194
Here ya go,
Fredy.

646
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,659
Get it, Jason,
come on!

647
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,293
Oh.

648
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,925
Oh, my God.

649
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,926
Ma, what?

650
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,553
Dr. Fegoli, Russ.

651
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,262
What?

652
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,306
He's allergic
to tomatoes.

653
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,683
Alright, so we
will deal with it.

654
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,059
Jesus.

655
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,897
Don't you have any hors d'oeuvres
without tomatoes?

656
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,773
The prosciutto-wrapped
chevre.

657
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,317
Rosalie just
took 'em out.

658
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,283
An Italian allergic
to pommodori.

659
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,409
Dio mio.

660
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,744
You have
my sympathies.

661
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,704
Well, it wasn't
always like this.

662
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,041
Started when they gave me
radiation for my prostate.

663
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,500
Don't ask me why.

664
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,377
So did you know
Monsignor Kelly?

665
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,213
He was in charge of the tours
at all the catacombs?

666
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,049
I made you
a plate, Russ.

667
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,258
Thank you, Mary.

668
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,178
You know, Carmela's
mother-in-law, Livia,

669
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,846
detested
northern cooking.

670
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,847
Really, why?

671
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,307
She skeeved
the butter.

672
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,768
The father was
like that, too.

673
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,603
The whole Soprano
bunch over there.

674
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,940
So many Neopolitans and
Sigilian' feel that way.

675
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,651
Well, you really have
to go to Italy to know,

676
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,569
and so many
of them don't.

677
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,030
I ate like a champ all
the way up and down the boot.

678
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,198
The whole two weeks.

679
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,660
But those recipes that you
used to send me from Tuscany.

680
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,494
Lena...

681
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,246
My God,
they were a revelation.

682
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,707
Bollito misto,
osso bucco...

683
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,917
Mmm.

684
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,002
The lovely Carmela Soprano.

685
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,212
Would you like
to say a few words?

686
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,380
Oh, he's back,
thank God.

687
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,923
Will you get
the guests arriving?

688
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:48,882
See?

689
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,384
And where
the hell is Tony?

690
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,718
Have a glass
of wine, carm.

691
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,928
Calm you down
a little.

692
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,972
He is bringing the charcoal
and the sausage.

693
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,348
He's always gotta wait
'til the last minute.

694
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,432
I heard that.

695
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,559
Agh, finally.

696
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,811
Hi, Tony.

697
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,479
Got no faith in me.

698
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,022
I wonder why?

699
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,900
Pins and needles,
needles and pins.

700
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,154
Palumbo's.

701
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,323
The birthday boy's
favorite.

702
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,199
Where is he?

703
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,117
He's out back.

704
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,660
Oh, good.

705
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,537
Honey, try
to pace yourself...

706
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,746
'Fritto misto bacala,
a couple of meatballs too...

707
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,082
Hey, there he is!

708
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:26,712
Hey, Happy Birthday to Hugh,
got sazeecha for you!

709
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,467
Russ, wait'll ya
taste this stuff.

710
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,719
There's nothin'
else like it.

711
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,680
Tony, I want you to meet a
couple of our oldest friends,

712
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,890
Dr. Russ and Lena Fegoli.

713
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,058
Nice to meet you, sir.

714
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,979
My son-in-law, well,
whatever, Tony Soprano.

715
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,147
Hey.

716
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,566
A doctor
in the house, huh?

717
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,066
That's good,

718
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,693
'cause somebody usually
goes down at these things.

719
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,278
He's just joking.

720
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:56,366
Unfortunately my doctorate
is in international affairs.

721
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,036
From Princeton.

722
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,245
G.I. Bill.

723
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,457
So you're a doctor like,
uh, Kissinger's a doctor.

724
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,250
Yes.

725
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,171
Russ had an audience
with four Popes.

726
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,257
What section
did you all sit in?

727
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,967
Aw, idiot.

728
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,304
T.B., make sure you
shoot the food tables

729
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,472
before they're pillaged.

730
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,475
Well, I'd, uh...

731
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,935
Love to stay and chat,
but I got a fire to start.

732
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,353
Nice to meet ya, doc.

733
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,772
Nice to meet you.

734
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,407
Everybody!

735
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,825
Could you gather
'round please?

736
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,953
Everybody,
everybody!

737
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,830
Come on over.

738
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,796
I would like to make a toast
to the man of the hour.

739
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,924
A very special man.

740
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,509
A man who I love

741
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,719
more than words
could possibly say.

742
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,262
My father.

743
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,305
Here-here.

744
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,059
You are the best father
and grandfather in the world.

745
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,229
Salut'.

746
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:07,771
Salut'.

747
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,397
Salut'.

748
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,273
Speech!

749
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,191
Speech!

750
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,443
You are the greatest,
my little Melly.

751
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,530
Thank you
for everything.

752
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,405
Mm-hm.

753
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,659
Tony, thank you for
having us at your home.

754
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,457
Mar', my lovely bride.

755
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,585
Still the prettiest
girl in the world.

756
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,088
Thank you for puttin' up
with me all these years.

757
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,926
Aww.

758
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,765
Thank all you
freeloaders for coming!

759
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,815
So why don't you
open up your gifts, dad?

760
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,066
Not now, Carmela,

761
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,734
it's very,
uh, mercenary.

762
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,736
Well good, people
spent money on them.

763
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,781
I'll break the ice.

764
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,533
Here.

765
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,577
Open this one.

766
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,661
It's from him.

767
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,124
Aw, you're too much.

768
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,176
A Stratocaster?

769
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,305
Awww.

770
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,307
A Beretta.

771
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,475
Ooh, aww...

772
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,769
Shotgun, oh wow.

773
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,062
This is...

774
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,981
I don't know
what to say.

775
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,525
It's a Giubileo
12-gauge.

776
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,194
28 inch barrel.

777
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,490
Nice to have money.

778
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,619
Get me another
rolling rock, Jay.

779
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,080
What time did you
start drinkin' today?

780
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,458
Probably right
after you got up.

781
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,126
Ho, cuz!

782
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,004
Tony, can you bring
the camera over here

783
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,214
and get a shot
of this?

784
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,841
Sure, I got nothin'
better to do.

785
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,644
Expect a freezer full
of venison this year.

786
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,270
You got it, kid.

787
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,621
Beautiful piece.

788
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,665
The over-under action,
the engraving,

789
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,166
they're artisans.

790
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,212
And you know, I've been to
the Beretta studio in Brescia.

791
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,005
No kiddin'.

792
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,757
I'd love
to see that.

793
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,927
You know that company
goes back to the 1500s.

794
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,095
Madonn'.

795
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,722
Sure, the best pieces,

796
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,267
they never export,
you see.

797
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,026
I want one and
all here to know

798
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,654
what a wild man
Hugo was in his day.

799
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,824
Remember what he did at the bund
meeting in Paterson, Russ?

800
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,243
Threw that cherry bomb
on those Krauts?

801
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,828
Yeah, tell that one.

802
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,376
You made my father's year
with that gun.

803
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,712
He deserves it.

804
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,342
You look beat, Tony,
why don't you take a break?

805
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,261
Nah, I'm alright.

806
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,182
Could use
a beer, though.

807
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,934
Well, you got it.

808
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:43,862
Thanks.

809
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,114
Salut'.

810
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:00,962
How's that look?

811
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,005
Done?

812
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,175
You're the grillmeister.

813
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,934
I mean don't
get me wrong.

814
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,227
I still think
we have the greatest

815
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,562
legal system
in the world.

816
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,981
But it's becoming more
and more discriminatory.

817
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,817
I mean, if you're
a minority, or worse,

818
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,694
an immigrant from
an Arab country,

819
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,529
civil rights
don't apply at all.

820
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,782
No place is the breach
of civil rights

821
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,784
more evident than
the penal system.

822
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,494
Rehabilitation?
Please.

823
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,828
Yeah.

824
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,664
That nature of the system
instills a convict mentality

825
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,459
to the point where prison
becomes the only venue

826
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,960
where the convict
can function.

827
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,921
My little
bleedin' heart.

828
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,882
She is wise
beyond her years.

829
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,133
She better be.

830
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,843
All the money
I'm spendin' over

831
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,137
at liberal university
in sunny Harlem.

832
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,765
Come here.

833
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,103
How you doin'?

834
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,354
Good.

835
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,313
Yeah?

836
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,189
Remember when you
were a little girl

837
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,148
what I used
to call you?

838
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:03,775
What do you mean
you don't remember?

839
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,402
You were too young
to remember?

840
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,694
Don't!

841
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,904
No!

842
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:11,866
How come you
don't remember?

843
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,784
Remember what I used
to call you, huh?

844
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,368
Ooh.

845
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,160
Hey, ow!

846
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,053
You know Hugh
built this house?

847
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,849
Your friend's maxin' out the
situation down there at puss's.

848
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,183
Sure.

849
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,352
Factory seat.

850
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,270
Two K.

851
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:41,938
I tried.

852
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,525
Well, I'd hate to see ang'
get stuck with that.

853
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,321
Then again, her friend
over there is takin' me

854
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,948
to the cleaners
with this divorce shit.

855
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,325
I gotta belt-tighten.

856
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,170
Can we get some able-bodied
seamen over here?

857
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,212
Tony b?

858
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,592
What am I,
a fuckin' slave?

859
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:11,843
Ho!

860
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,263
I didn't have a drop.

861
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,389
Goddamnit.

862
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,100
Lester'll drive,
he's in the bathroom.

863
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:19,893
Watch your head.

864
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:22,812
Hey!

865
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,481
Virginia Mayo.

866
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,747
Thank you
for coming.

867
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,083
I'm sorry for everything,
what can I say?

868
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,752
Get my boy
home safe.

869
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,340
You're sorry
for what?

870
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,090
Aw...

871
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,467
No-no I wanna hear.

872
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,719
Oh, please, Carmela.

873
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,306
The off-colored jokes,
the sausage twirling...

874
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,224
Tony.

875
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,352
These are
cultured Italians.

876
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,479
Russ is a success,
a diplomat.

877
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,147
This was a shock
for them.

878
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,441
And he's such a diplomat
he insults his host?

879
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,068
You heard what
he said to Tony.

880
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,528
He's a pompous man.

881
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,695
He always was.

882
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,781
Let's talk about
this another time.

883
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,658
That's why you
didn't want Tony here.

884
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,244
Had nothin' to do with
the marital situation.

885
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,747
All along it was so that
your cultured Italian friends,

886
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,959
who were born and raised
on Arthur Avenue I might add,

887
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,585
wouldn't meet your
"gavone" son-in-law.

888
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,546
He made us all
look like "gavones".

889
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,964
Whatever we are
I am proud of it,

890
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,590
unlike you obviously.

891
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,884
I have always been
proud of my heritage.

892
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,135
Oh, bullshit.

893
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,804
I remember you telling
aunt rose you were glad

894
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,597
deangelis didn't
end in a vowel.

895
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,307
I never said that!

896
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,477
And when meadow came out,
"oh my God, she's so dark".

897
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,520
You're drunk.

898
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,563
I'm going home.

899
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,231
You know, there are
Italians all around

900
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,108
with their closet
selfloathing.

901
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,610
I just never wanted to believe
my mother was one of 'em.

902
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,405
And now what the fuck
are you crying about?

903
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,074
You're secret is out.

904
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,660
Marco.

905
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,036
Polo.

906
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:04,664
Marco.

907
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:05,957
Polo.

908
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,000
Marco?

909
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:07,750
Polo.

910
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,010
Fish outta water!

911
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:17,927
You're it, Ton'!

912
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,178
Takin' a T-O.

913
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,430
Marco.

914
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,222
Polo.

915
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,059
Here let me...
let me get this.

916
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:25,643
No, I'm fine.

917
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,561
You have fun.

918
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:27,979
No, no, really.

919
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,064
Let me...
Forget it, I'll get it.

920
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,067
Tony, put me down!

921
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,110
You look like
you could use a dip!

922
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,695
No, don't you,
I'm serious!

923
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:36,237
One.
one.

924
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,196
Aj!

925
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,072
Two.
Two.

926
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:38,990
Tony, don't!

927
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:39,574
Three!
Three!

928
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,580
You bastards!

929
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,581
You're it, carm.

930
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,250
Whoo!

931
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:54,797
Idiots.

932
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,923
Hey, don't
let her get out.

933
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,096
Ho! '

934
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,057
You're still it!

935
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,726
Marco.

936
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,519
Polo.

937
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,189
Alright.

938
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,815
Pleasant dreams,
Hammers.

939
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:13,858
Night, dad.

940
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,109
Goodnight, grandma.

941
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,194
Goodnight.

942
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,321
Your grandma's
not a maid.

943
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,698
I'll put 'em
in the hamper.

944
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,200
What's this?

945
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,493
I don't know.

946
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,577
Yes, you do.

947
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,495
Shut up.

948
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,913
Am I talkin'
to you, Justin?

949
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,919
I asked you
a question, Jason.

950
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:36,964
Pins.

951
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,511
From the '96 Olympics
in Atlanta it looks like.

952
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:47,266
That's when you were stationed
in Saudi Arabia, right, dad?

953
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,435
Yes, that's right.

954
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,853
But I'm talkin'
to your brother.

955
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,648
You took this tonight,
didn't you?

956
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,858
I borrowed it
from AJ.

957
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,820
You stole this from your cousin
who opens his house to you?

958
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,240
I found it on the floor
way in back of AJ's closet.

959
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,700
He doesn't care.

960
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,159
With all
the stuff he has?

961
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,662
He got to go to the Olympics
and everything.

962
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,372
I love
where he lives.

963
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,124
I don't wanna
come back here.

964
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,217
My son steals
from his own family.

965
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,804
You're gonna return it
tomorrow and apologize.

966
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,223
Where are
your gameboys?

967
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,183
That's mine.

968
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,518
Jason's is
in the drawer.

969
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,233
I'm givin' both of these
to the Salvation Army.

970
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,526
I didn't do nothing!

971
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,820
You're just as bad as he is
'cause you didn't stop him!

972
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,202
We should
get going, AJ.

973
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,204
I don't wanna drop you off
at Patrick's too late.

974
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,998
Call me when you
get to Patrick's.

975
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:52,999
Yeah, I'll try.

976
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,876
He's in
a bad cell area.

977
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,882
He'll try?

978
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,302
Just showin' her
he's not a kid.

979
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,428
Mm...

980
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,430
I think he's showin'
her more than that.

981
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,308
Well, that's inevitable.

982
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,518
It's scary is
what that is.

983
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,854
He'll be fine.

984
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,148
He's in love.

985
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,441
Oh, please.

986
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,281
You know what
it's like at that age.

987
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,491
Hmm?

988
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,453
Can't wait
to see each other.

989
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,664
Can't keep your
hands off each other.

990
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,377
Tony, what are
you doing?

991
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,089
What am I doin'?

992
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,175
Tony, let's
call it a night.

993
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:45,635
Why?

994
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,222
You tired?

995
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,723
Yes.

996
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,141
Come on.

997
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,143
Artie is right
over there.

998
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,063
He's comatose.

999
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,118
Tony...

1000
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,538
This is nice, no?

1001
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:16,833
Tony...

1002
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,212
Doesn't feel nice?

1003
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,381
I didn't say that.

1004
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,644
No, Tony, don't.

1005
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:37,979
Shh...

1006
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,905
So which type of,
uh, torture instrument

1007
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,865
we going to use?

1008
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,916
Don't wake up
the neighbors.

1009
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:40,833
Yeah.

1010
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,211
You have to go where you
have like a two-by-four...

1011
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,302
Hello?

1012
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,263
Blundetto.

1013
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,059
How can I help you?

1014
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,686
I'm in.

1015
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:09,904
You asleep?

1016
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,306
Here you go, Joey.

1017
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,433
It's bigger
than last week's.

1018
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:40,935
Hey, Crystal.

1019
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,353
The room is empty.

1020
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,479
Come on,
time is money.

1021
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,605
Thanks.

1022
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:45,898
Phil'll be
very happy.

1023
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,399
Yeah.

1024
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,858
Send him and John
my best, huh?

1025
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:49,819
Goodnight, Heather.

1026
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,112
Goodnight, Muz.

1027
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,488
You're off?

1028
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,281
Yeah.

1029
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,866
I'm goin' downtown.

1030
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,326
Me, too.

1031
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:58,828
Let's go.

1032
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:00,871
See ya next week, Joe.

1033
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,321
Hey, Joe.

1034
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,114
Hey.

1035
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,657
Tony, right?

1036
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,534
What, you
come here, too?
