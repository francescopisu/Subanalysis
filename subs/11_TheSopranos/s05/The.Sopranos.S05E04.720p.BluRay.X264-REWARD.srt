1
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,467
That's so funny!

2
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,262
No, it isn't.
You just poked me in the eye!

3
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,931
Well, you poked me first.

4
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,100
I can't find the thing.

5
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,726
Here.

6
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,772
I don't know what the fuck
happened to the DeWALT.

7
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,108
Everything disappears around here.

8
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,112
Especially now that I'm out of the house,
she lets everything go.

9
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,370
Stop! Stop, Uncle Tony,
it's freezing cold!

10
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,581
Uncle Tony, knock it off!

11
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,088
She wants to talk to me
about something.

12
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,716
Thanks for having us up here, Ton.

13
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,725
Jason, don't put pine cones in the filter.
The hell's the matter with you?

14
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,436
No, Dad, watch me!

15
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,813
- He's hitting me!
- Hey! What did I say?

16
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,941
They will probably go through
their entire lives...

17
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,818
...not knowing their father's sperm...

18
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,321
...was smuggled out of jail
to get Nancy pregnant.

19
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,449
It was the least I could do.

20
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,120
I just remembered what happened
to the power drill.

21
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,831
- Pardon me?
- I loaned it to your cousin, Brian.

22
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,791
And he never gave it...

23
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,253
What's the matter?

24
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,255
I don't know.

25
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,174
Is this one of your attacks?

26
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,345
No, I...

27
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,680
I think it's just indigestion.

28
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,184
It's going away.

29
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,149
I had an attack. Full-blown.

30
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,610
- What'd your therapist say?
- I don't see her no more.

31
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,528
- Why not?
- You think you're the only one...

32
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,865
...that has to cut back on shit they need
because of the separation?

33
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,661
Now, what's on your mind?

34
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:13,627
Mr. Wegler wants us to come to discuss
A.J.'s lousy academic performance.

35
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,837
Is this the same Wegler?

36
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,423
Last year, the riccion
with the Billy Budds?

37
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,009
A.J. got him as a college advisor.

38
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,222
- I told him to start cracking the books.
- Was he supposed to do that...

39
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,892
...after he got back from the Nets game
you took him to on a school night?

40
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,853
It's gotta be hard for him, our situation.
Cut him some slack.

41
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,107
No, that's your department.
I get to be the prison warden over here...

42
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,402
...while you indulge him.
With the iPod, the drums...

43
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,322
Oh, again with the drums. Encourage
extracurricular activity, you said.

44
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,034
Brand-new drums, just like that?
Don't even look in the classifieds.

45
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,578
Why don't you just tell me
when the school meeting is.

46
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,416
Because I don't have to listen to this shit
anymore. That's why we're separated.

47
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,085
Are you kidding me, Tony?
That is not why!

48
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,296
Jas?

49
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,589
Were you knocking?

50
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,969
Hi, Lorraine. I'm Billy.

51
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,222
The fuck?! Jason!

52
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,559
No! Jason!

53
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,185
Jason!

54
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,358
Oh, no!

55
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,490
You were warned, Lorraine.
The money goes up to John.

56
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,626
Fuck.

57
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,929
Lorraine Calluzzo and the kid, Jason.

58
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,183
Fucking Philly Leotardo!

59
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,311
She told me he warned her...

60
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,980
...about giving us points of her take.

61
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,482
Phil's a pimple.

62
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,151
It's goddamn Johnny Sack.

63
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,154
It's his message to the other captains,
that fucking animal.

64
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,782
- Take it easy.
- Fuck that.

65
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,825
Rusty.

66
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,827
Car's here.

67
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,582
I'm telling you, Carmine.

68
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,503
We go all out,
we'll steamroll right over John.

69
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,757
And I predict the guys on the street
in Brooklyn and Queens...

70
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,717
...they'll welcome us as fucking heroes.

71
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,928
It'll be easy.

72
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,598
It's a fucking declaration of war
by Johnny, if you ask me.

73
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,103
Hey.

74
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,938
There he is.

75
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,691
- Let me kiss the ring.
- How about the one in my ass?

76
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,906
- Hey. Good to see you.
- Feech. Good to see you, baby.

77
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,200
Hello there, kid. Good to see you.

78
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,036
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey. How you doing, Feech?

79
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,873
Just talking about that mess
over in New York.

80
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,836
Sounds to me like your friend John
wants to force Little Carmine's hand.

81
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,922
In my day, the top spot would have
gone to Little Carmine.

82
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,883
Unless he was actually retarded,
or crippled or something.

83
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,302
- He's the son.
- Come on, when was that?

84
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,806
Yeah?

85
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,936
- Vodka rocks.
- Thank you, dear.

86
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,230
- Anybody else?
- We need anything else...

87
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,524
...one of the kids'll come out.

88
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,068
Ton? You didn't have any lunch.

89
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,529
- You want a sandwich?
- No, I'm all right. Thanks.

90
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,576
Adriana, hold on a second.

91
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,287
Tommy Pinto's goomar, eh?
When I was coming up...

92
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,248
...she had the long legs up to here,
like that.

93
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,208
Famous beauty. Smart as a whip.

94
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,130
- My compliments.
- Oh, that'd be beautiful.

95
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,091
- Thank you, baby.
- You drove Tommy Pinto?

96
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,678
I was at the Clam Broth House
the night he beat that longshoreman...

97
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,598
...to death over a corner table.
No shit?

98
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,933
Here we go. Memory lane.

99
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,269
It's important these young guys
know the history.

100
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,231
Tell them about when Tony and Jackie
Aprile knocked over your card game.

101
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,486
- Oh, that he doesn't like to talk about.
- I heard this.

102
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,573
- This is a great fucking story.
- He should be dead by now.

103
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,576
They bust in, couple of fucking punks.

104
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,287
Guns out. Bad guys.

105
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,123
This one is fucking scared!

106
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,668
- First of all, it was my game.
- Feech has forgiven...

107
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,087
...even if he hasn't forgotten.

108
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,507
But it's a great yarn, right, Feech?

109
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,468
Yeah.

110
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,138
Actually, it brings me to my business.

111
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,807
Fellas, you wanna give us
a minute, here?

112
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,945
Yeah.

113
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,198
So, what's up?

114
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,450
I came to ask for my game back.

115
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,788
- It's my uncle's game now, Feech.
- Yeah, right, your uncle's.

116
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,040
You also keep a lion's share of the rake.

117
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,501
I'm, in a way,
just asking if I can run it for you.

118
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,752
Why would I need that?

119
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,129
Eleven years I ran it.
No fights, no raids.

120
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,674
Not to mention that
maybe I got it coming.

121
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,802
Considering how it could have gone
after you took the game down...

122
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,306
...if I had been a prick about it.
Or his old man didn't have many friends.

123
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,774
I'll give you 20 percent,
but you gotta rent the house from me.

124
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,944
I could throw some high rollers
your way.

125
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,988
Friends of mine.

126
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,658
All right. Let me get out of here
before I keep talking...

127
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,536
...and fuck this up. Jesus.

128
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,247
Thank you, Don Antonio.

129
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,094
He's a strunz.

130
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,013
He's a busybody, that's all.

131
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,182
He's an egomaniac, Ton.
Always was, always will be.

132
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,269
Nothing's ever good enough.
Praise, money.

133
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,105
Comes in this fucking office,
starts ordering people around.

134
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,940
He's old.

135
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,900
How do you think that feels?

136
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,328
Can I go to the Mudvayne concert
or not?

137
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,248
I'm trying to think of a reason to let you
stay overnight in New York with friends.

138
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,666
But it's not gonna happen.

139
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,211
Todd's mother made arrangements.
She said it'd be better than us driving.

140
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,255
She's not your mother.

141
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,716
Yeah, I know. Believe me.

142
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,093
Isn't life unfair?

143
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,180
So we're at the Peppermint Lounge.

144
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,766
When in walks
these two stewardesses from Braniff.

145
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,477
Everybody's in? Aces high.
Your action, Mr. Taylor.

146
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,770
- Two hundred.
- Hesh?

147
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,689
They're sitting at the bar.
We send them over a bottle of Dom.

148
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,568
Next thing you know, we're in the hotel
room. Me, Frankie and the two broads.

149
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,111
I see you. Raise you three.

150
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,905
- You mother...
- This one...

151
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,574
...this little pothead from Texas,
she fucked me dry.

152
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,410
But she still wanted more!
She's fucking nuts.

153
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,455
So I'm wearing these pointy
featherweights, and I stick the toe in.

154
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,958
- And I'm fucking her with it.
- Don't know where the story's heading...

155
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,961
...but we should all be grateful
he wasn't wearing white bucks.

156
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,173
The maid walks in, and she says,
"What's going on?"

157
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,091
And I say...

158
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,135
Ante up, boys.

159
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,846
Hello, girls!

160
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,390
- Hey.
- Hey.

161
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,142
- Hey, Ton.
- Sir Lawrence from the Meadowlands.

162
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,686
Your Highness. How are you?

163
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,813
Tony, let me introduce
Bernie Brillstein.

164
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,273
- Hey.
- Did you get my list of toys?

165
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,652
- What's up?
- Hey, Ton.

166
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,615
Oh, my cousin.
Kind of high stakes for you, no?

167
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,660
Feech fronted my action.
And thank you for not humiliating me.

168
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,789
Is there something in your parole about
hanging out with degenerates like this?

169
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,166
Hey, come on,
he gets away with anything.

170
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,211
Last time his parole officer
made the unannounced visit...

171
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,004
...he gave him a massage.

172
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,220
- So how's lady luck treating you, huh?
- Jesus-fucking-Christ.

173
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,014
How many times
this guy gotta say hello?

174
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,435
What, did I interrupt
one of your impermeable stories?

175
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,771
Go ahead.

176
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,692
So we had these girls in the hotel room.

177
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,318
Long story short...

178
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,197
...I got my shoe in her snatch...
It falls off and she keels over.

179
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,000
Fuck it. This hand's from thalidomide.

180
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,878
Three ladies, gentlemen.

181
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,548
- Thank you.
- The rich get richer.

182
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,217
So, doc, how's the plans
for the wedding?

183
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,179
Please.
It's not a "wedding planner" anymore.

184
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,639
It's an
"environment and event coordinator."

185
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,058
What the hell? She's my only daughter.

186
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,394
She and Iris have their hearts set...

187
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,230
...on making the "Vows" column
of the Sunday New York Times.

188
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,317
Featured couple of the week.
Our publicist is looking for a hook.

189
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,695
Turns out that Gillian's law degree
from Harvard means bupkis.

190
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,238
Everybody's got that or better.

191
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,658
If it was a black couple or a gay couple,
they'd be in.

192
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,204
My wife calls the Times wedding section
the ladies' sport page.

193
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,705
So, Ira, who's the lucky guy?

194
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,333
Jeremy Silverman. Puppeteer.

195
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,168
Children's Television Workshop.

196
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,005
Father's Asa Silverman. Head of
commercial paper at Goldman Sachs.

197
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,591
- Upper East Side.
- I didn't get my invitation.

198
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,975
Fuck you.

199
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,738
You told me to let you know
when it was a quarter of.

200
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,573
Thank you, Mary.

201
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,118
So with Wesleyan as your fallback,
I think we're in pretty good shape.

202
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,163
Straight A's at Middlebury's
language camp, can't sneeze at that.

203
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,124
And your blues folkloric studies
in Mississippi last summer...

204
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,418
...have an almost community service
spin to them.

205
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,879
I just wish he had the minority thing
going for him.

206
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,966
If we can just nudge Lem's verbals
past 760 on the next round...

207
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,761
...he can basically write his own ticket.
I'm stoked.

208
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,137
Appreciate your help.

209
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,141
Folks.

210
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,604
So let me guess.

211
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,565
He called the English teacher "Daddy-O."

212
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,236
Thing is...

213
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,867
...we are rapidly approaching crisis mode
here with these grades.

214
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,369
And time is of the essence.

215
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,329
Could I ask a question?

216
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,582
I handed in my final list of colleges.

217
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,625
- Did you get that?
- Yes, we talked about this.

218
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,838
So Ramapo and Trenton State.

219
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,341
And our reach schools,
University of Arizona and Arizona State.

220
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,678
I'll take him out there after I drive
him around the ones in New Jersey.

221
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,015
If either of the Arizonas is what
he's got his heart set on...

222
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,518
...he's not gonna get in with these
grades. I know about football, Anthony.

223
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,313
- It's our ace in the hole.
- He says he's trying his best.

224
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,567
SAT-wise, 505 and 430...

225
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,613
I think we can edge-up the math
into the fives the next round.

226
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,366
- Providing Anthony feels he can focus.
- He's had trouble with that before.

227
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,702
Remember, Carm,
when they thought he had ADD?

228
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,622
- You didn't tell me that.
- Anthony, head on back to class.

229
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,166
- Let us talk.
- But if I'm learning-disabled...

230
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,043
...I get unlimited time on my SATs.

231
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,212
- Is that true?
- Let's talk about that later.

232
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:38,937
So you had time to talk to Dr. Rapke
about last week's testing results?

233
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:43,983
Yes. She said Anthony has
good interpersonal skills.

234
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,903
She said his affect was...

235
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,822
Where is this? Constricted, she called it.

236
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,367
But that was normal for a teenager...

237
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,745
...and all in all,
he seemed to be handling the split well.

238
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,123
This is not to say I don't get
a ration of shit in every conversation.

239
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,042
Pardon my French.

240
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,752
Well, still...

241
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,254
...there's this thing with his grades.

242
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:11,928
Do you think it would be a benefit to him
to see a psychologist on a regular basis?

243
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,932
You don't approve of therapy,
Mr. Soprano?

244
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,102
People use it as a crutch.

245
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,729
And I always wonder
what happened to Gary Cooper...

246
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,773
...the strong, silent type?
Well...

247
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,025
...Gary Cooper wasn't a 16-year-old boy.

248
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,861
He was at one time.

249
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,240
And I'm gonna have to agree
with my husband, here, Mr. Wegler.

250
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,577
We sent our daughter to an adolescent
developmentalist, and it was a disaster.

251
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,037
I know my son, he's lazy.

252
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,624
We'll get him a different SAT tutor,
I'll stay on him and he'll work harder.

253
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,917
And that's that.

254
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,631
- They said I might be learning-disabled.
- Hey, didn't he tell you to go to class?

255
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,718
What's going on, Mary?

256
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,971
Domenica Paolini and Sasha Caputo.

257
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,182
They were on their way to school
this morning, and they hit a tree.

258
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,060
Nikka's dead. Sasha's in a coma.

259
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,153
What's that?

260
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,114
It was here when I got here.

261
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:27,253
If a million zeros can be written on
the front and back of a sheet of paper...

262
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,466
...how many sheets of paper do you
need for a googol of zeroes?

263
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,610
Oh, man, oh, baby, an Xterra SE.

264
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,362
It's loaded.
Three-point-three liter, supercharged.

265
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,990
- What, this is mine?
- Yeah.

266
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,784
You are unbelievable.

267
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,661
- Sticker's still on it.
- He doesn't have enough distractions?

268
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,997
After what happened
to those kids at his school?

269
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,041
Thing's got sensors in the seatbelts.

270
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,877
It's part of Nissan's
Triple Safety philosophy.

271
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,171
- Nice ride.
- You leaving?

272
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,799
- Hour's up.
- You're not getting in?

273
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,808
This is so deck.

274
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,435
- What is this, Bose?
- Yeah, six-CD changer.

275
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,313
- It's got surround sound.
- I feel safer already.

276
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,899
Carmela, this car is a tank.

277
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,155
- What's the matter?
- SUVs eat up more of the ozone.

278
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,242
So you wanna be the sucker
in a regular car that gets decapitated.

279
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,411
- I'm gonna catch shit at school for this.
- So, what do you wanna do?

280
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,332
Screw it.

281
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,626
- Can we take it out?
- Yeah, we can take it out.

282
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,880
Once. Then this baby sits in the garage
till you pull your grades up to a C.

283
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,882
- What?
- You heard your father.

284
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,384
I was talking to him, not you.

285
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,265
I gotta put dinner on.
Tony, I have bills for you.

286
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,397
You better be nice to your mother.

287
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,275
She's got the keys
till your grades are up.

288
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,403
I'll be right back.

289
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,950
The car is a motivational tool.

290
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,035
The carrot and the stick,
you gotta do both.

291
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,289
I could strangle him sometimes.
He can be so hateful.

292
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,624
Well, the smart mouth is not good.

293
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,459
That's minor, believe me.

294
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,088
God, what happened to him?
He was always the sweet one.

295
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,633
He had the concept of sharing
before any of the other toddlers.

296
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,970
Well, Meadow was always sharper,
but I remember the same thing with her.

297
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,472
It's like watching an angel fall.

298
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,478
What, are you crying?

299
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,154
Here's the tutor, in writing,
like you had to have.

300
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,906
I had to call Roto-Rooter.

301
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,200
That's the cheap sound system
for the media room.

302
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,826
Yeah, why should I pay for that?

303
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,328
Because you took the last one.

304
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,331
Your little movie connoisseur friends
are still meeting?

305
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,958
- At least I have friends.
- The fuck's that mean?

306
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,170
- Tony, you have a bunch of flunkies.
- What do you know about it?

307
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,756
They compliment you
on your new shoes.

308
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,966
They tell you that you're not going bald.

309
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,509
Think they really care?

310
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,638
You're the boss, they're scared of you.
They have to kiss your ass.

311
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,140
- Laugh at your stupid jokes.
- What about Artie, then?

312
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,851
- You're turning into a frigging cynic.
- Whatever.

313
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,853
What do I give a shit if they're scared.

314
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,773
I'm running a fucking business,
not a popularity contest.

315
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,983
"I been thinking...

316
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,862
...and I apologize for my use
of fowl language..."

317
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,989
Fowl with a "W."

318
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,033
"...in regards to yourself.

319
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:48,746
You said some very hurtful things to me
in regards to myself.

320
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:53,000
But it is still no excuse
to use the vile word that I used...

321
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,504
...of which I am sure you know...

322
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,172
...that I'm talking about."

323
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,883
- Cunt, right?
- Yes, Elliot.

324
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,306
"You don't wish us to be social friends...

325
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,433
...and so that is that.

326
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,728
I still have great 'rigard' for you...

327
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,439
...even though you said
some horrible things.

328
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,359
P.S. I'm doing fine. Anthony."

329
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:25,741
It came with a bathrobe and a basket full
of Dr. Hauschka bath products.

330
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,535
Ablution.

331
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,912
The desire to cleanse himself
of the deed.

332
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,207
Notice he still fundamentally blames me.

333
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,844
- Hello?
- Mrs. Soprano? Robert Wegler.

334
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,595
Oh, hi, hello. How are you?

335
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,764
After our meeting the other day...

336
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:52,184
...I had some ideas about
some further strategies for Anthony.

337
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,353
I thought maybe we could meet.

338
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,940
Have lunch, a cup of coffee.
I could share them with you.

339
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,110
- Next week, perhaps?
- Really?

340
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,321
Well, yeah, I guess that'll be okay.

341
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,458
"Happy Birthday," by the Beatles.

342
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,087
You know,
I heard it the other day in the car.

343
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,049
They have such a good drum solo
in the middle, there.

344
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,925
Drum solo?

345
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,303
It's the basic four-four.

346
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:34,018
You know, Ringo was not their original
drummer. That was Pete Best.

347
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,978
And they fired him.

348
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,482
He put out his own album,
Best of the Beatles.

349
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,192
Sad.

350
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,613
So is this what they call
"common ground"?

351
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,867
Just trying to have
a civilized conversation.

352
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,952
Can I go to my room? I'm full.

353
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,082
- Am I so horrible?
- You are not horrible.

354
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,833
Get over yourself.

355
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,294
Over myself?
What is that supposed to mean?

356
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,383
Just go. Do me a big favor.

357
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,262
If you're gonna be a martyr,
I'll sit here.

358
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,848
Nope, go. Put your plate in the sink.

359
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,407
Two hundred.

360
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,495
- Two to go.
- See, and raise four.

361
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,871
Call.

362
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,541
Tony, you like the Escalade?
Can't keep them on the lot.

363
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,959
I love it.

364
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,295
After I pulled out
that global-positioning shit.

365
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,716
- Oh, right.
- Always got his eye on the big picture.

366
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,302
Up to you.

367
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,223
I think you got that ace,
and I'm not paying you for it.

368
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,684
- Aces over.
- Three threes, my man.

369
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,060
Paulie wins.

370
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,063
- Cards, please.
- You fuck, you.

371
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,899
They used to be a great tax loophole,
those SUVs.

372
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,735
Told all my clients,
write it off on your business.

373
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:10,239
Accountant dies, goes to heaven.
Same time as the pope.

374
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:14,410
St. Peter says, "Come on in!"
Then he shows the pope this shithouse.

375
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,246
That's where he'll live,
and he gives him a crust of bread.

376
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,707
Then he shows the CPA
where he's gonna live.

377
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,585
It's a fucking mansion. Servants, broads.

378
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,839
Pope says, "He gets a mansion
and I get a hovel?"

379
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,926
St. Peter says, "Your Holiness,
we got hundreds of popes up here.

380
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,262
This is the first Jewish accountant!"

381
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,893
I used to be able to write off condoms.

382
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,107
What do you get when you cross
an accountant with a giant jet airplane?

383
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,942
A boring 747.

384
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,637
All right, all right, bet two.

385
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,807
Algebra, huh?

386
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,646
Listen...

387
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,815
I have been doing some thinking.

388
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,569
I've decided to let you stay in the city
after the concert.

389
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,865
- How come?
- On one condition, though.

390
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,492
No Hudson Suites.

391
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,829
I talked to Med. She said
you can sleep over at her apartment.

392
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:44,250
I'll give you cab fare. When
the concert's over, go straight up there.

393
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,670
Sunday morning I want you home,
10:30 sharp.

394
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,713
Thanks.

395
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,343
Don't stay up too late.

396
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,936
Come on. Go, go, go. Hurry.

397
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,985
So you guys like your job?

398
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,030
Beemer, space 43.

399
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,008
Asa, come on!

400
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,743
Can I have your attention?

401
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,998
Apparently there's been
an armed robbery.

402
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,917
Some automobiles were taken.

403
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,257
They left all the American cars.

404
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,593
- Oh, my God.
- I think his skull is broken.

405
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,845
- Oh, my God.
- I'm a doctor. Let me in there.

406
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,889
Brooke, our car is gone.

407
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,767
Now who's a genius
for keeping his Regal?

408
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,852
Asa, they got the SL.

409
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,231
That was a fucking SL55 Convertible.

410
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,693
You know how long my brother
was on the waiting list for that?

411
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,278
A motherfucking year.

412
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,158
You want to go back to that?

413
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,538
Yes! I wanna go back to that!

414
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,374
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

415
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,668
- How was Mudvayne?
- They rocked.

416
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,754
Look... Look, I don't think
I'm gonna be able to make it up there.

417
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,757
What are you talking about?
You know Mom's gonna call here.

418
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,467
I'm a total dick if I leave here.

419
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,219
Just tell Mom I'm on my way up.

420
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,638
- She's just gonna call back.
- Come on.

421
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,392
- When do I ever ask you for anything?
- All right, you better stay there.

422
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,269
And be home on time tomorrow.
I don't want any shit from Mom.

423
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,272
Stop.

424
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,441
Frida, why do you and Diego
have separate houses?

425
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,820
Because we are two different people,
but our love makes us into one.

426
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,269
- Hello?
- Med, hi.

427
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,354
Is your brother there?
He's not answering.

428
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,858
- I know, he's asleep.
- What?

429
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,278
I probably shouldn't be telling you this,
but he was pretty zapped.

430
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,030
I knew it. Is he all right?

431
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,950
- Mom, he's fine.
- Just wait until you have children.

432
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,369
Not me, I'm never having kids.

433
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,540
So how are things going?

434
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,084
We're in the middle of a movie, Mom.

435
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,545
Oh, I'm sorry. Good night.

436
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,505
Good night.

437
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,477
- Come on, light the fucker up.
- Give me the lighter.

438
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,604
It's on the table.

439
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,693
All right. Go, go, go.

440
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:44,323
Go, go, go.

441
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,326
Hold it, hold it!

442
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:55,209
Open up, it's me.
Come on, open the fucking door.

443
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,587
Where's the patient?

444
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,811
I got a new easel, new oils.
I'm ready to go.

445
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,781
The wedding?
What, do you got everybody outside?

446
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,076
- The ushers and everyone? Bring them in.
- It's a fucking disaster.

447
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,494
- What?
- Somebody hit us.

448
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,454
They stole all the fucking cars.

449
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,291
I had to sedate my own little girl
at her wedding.

450
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,794
- Jesus.
- Yeah, I mean, they had one of those...

451
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,421
...what do you call it,
those car-carrier things?

452
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,423
It was a very well-coordinated
operation.

453
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,385
The cops are on it,
but how much faith have I got in that?

454
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,637
You gotta help me
before they're chopped.

455
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,098
I'm not really in that business, Ira.

456
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,184
Asa's brother's Benz was taken.
This special thing.

457
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,895
I'm fucking gornisht
in Asa's eyes now.

458
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,648
Can't you do anything?
I mean, make some calls?

459
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,150
- That shit's insured.
- He's obsessed with that car.

460
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,735
This fucking Stew guy.

461
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,406
The asshole paid a $30,000 premium
just to place the fucking order.

462
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,825
His glasses, his daybook were in it.

463
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,177
A.J., it's your mother. Call me.

464
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,981
It's my mother.

465
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:46,028
Ma'am, I can't put you through.
Room 417 has a block on the line.

466
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,280
I am not waiting.
Who knows what's going on.

467
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,867
God help you if anything happens in
there like those children in Westchester.

468
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,421
No! No, don't answer it.

469
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,717
My face is stuck to the rug.

470
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,221
They fucking Krazy-Glued you.

471
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,309
- Housekeeping.
- Oh, fuck, what should we do?

472
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:21,146
- We're asleep!
- All right, help me.

473
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,196
- Dude, take it easy.
- I'm sorry, man.

474
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,117
Fuck.

475
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,911
Oh, dude.

476
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,458
Oh, fuck.

477
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,963
Oh, fuck me.

478
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,809
- Hello.
- Hi, yeah, it's me.

479
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,312
A.J. stayed in the city with his friends
last night, and he's not home yet.

480
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,274
- And I can't get in touch with him.
- Take it easy. Slow down.

481
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,110
He's probably just sleeping it off.

482
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,404
No, I called Todd's mother
and Todd came home.

483
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,281
He could be dead by now. OD'd.
God knows what else.

484
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,534
- God, why did I let him go?
- He's all right.

485
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,536
I'll take care of it.

486
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,039
- Give me the number of the hotel.
- It's Hudson Suites on the West Side.

487
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,501
Tony, just go there, all right? I'm
so worried I'm not even angry anymore.

488
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,129
All right, all right. I'm on my way.

489
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,383
Anthony?

490
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,221
Goddamn you! I have been going crazy
trying to reach you.

491
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,890
- Later, I don't feel good.
- What happened to your face?

492
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,143
- Leave me alone.
- I want to know what happened.

493
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,770
You never went to Meadow's
after you gave me your word.

494
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,480
- Get off my back.
- You are a liar!

495
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,149
- Fuck you.
- What did you say?

496
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,651
Get back here.

497
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,332
Puritan Salvage.

498
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,003
The big guy's looking for a consignment
from a wedding in Ringwood last night.

499
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:12,340
- Nothing came in here.
- This Benz SL55. He wants it pulled.

500
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,967
I'll make some calls.

501
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,980
- Where is he?
- In his room.

502
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,026
- What happened to your leg?
- He lied to me, Tony.

503
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,154
- Which means that they both lied.
- She's covering for him.

504
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,991
- It's what sisters are supposed to do.
- Oh, of course, right.

505
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,118
He cursed at me.

506
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,287
- Oh, my God.
- What did he say?

507
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,626
- He's asleep.
- Not anymore.

508
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,545
Oh, hey, Dad.

509
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,548
I was just taking out the trash.
It's garbage day tomorrow.

510
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,220
- What's different about you?
- He has no eyebrows, Tony.

511
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,972
Who did this?

512
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,558
- We were screwing around.
- What'd you say to your mom?

513
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,393
- Tony...
- What did you say?

514
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,688
- I said the F-word.
- You're finished.

515
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,441
You're never gonna drive that car
till you're 45 years old.

516
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,693
- I'm selling it.
- She wouldn't let me talk.

517
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,738
- I was trying to tell her what happened.
- Oh, see, it's my fault.

518
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,407
Let's hear it.

519
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,703
Well, I was gonna go to Meadow's
but there weren't any cabs.

520
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,082
And I didn't think you'd want me
sitting in the street at 11:30 at night.

521
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,709
- And we were right by the hotel.
- Enough of your lying.

522
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,712
- I am not lying.
- Look at your face.

523
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,716
If you got some kind of sexual proclivity
with that teacher or whatever...

524
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,553
...now's the time to tell us.
I mean, what went on up there?

525
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,931
- Poppers and weird sex.
- What? No.

526
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:47,269
Look, we don't do drugs.
We're not some stupid dopers.

527
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:51,773
- I had a few beers, it just made me sick.
- How can anybody believe what you say?

528
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,193
Because I told you.
You never believe me.

529
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,283
You had a couple beers.

530
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,827
Yeah.

531
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,413
- You didn't do any drugs?
- No.

532
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,377
Carmela, look it. Couple of beers.

533
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,214
Should be grounded, yeah,
but it's not the end of the world.

534
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,799
What?

535
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,802
Well, you know what?

536
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,598
I am sick of your bullshit.
Both of you.

537
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,642
- He can go live with you.
- Don't get dramatic now, all right?

538
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,769
- Wha...? Great. Good.
- Shut up.

539
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,980
I have never been more serious
in my life.

540
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,277
Take out the trash. Go outside.

541
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,241
What are we gonna do, really?

542
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,285
What did I just say?

543
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,329
No, I mean... I mean really. Come on.

544
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,666
- Did you think I was joking?
- Carmela, this is normal teenage shit.

545
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,668
You remember us?

546
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:57,047
The CYO dance. We left Artie out
in the snow. He almost lost his fingers.

547
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,174
And we still laugh our asses off about it.

548
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,926
No, I don't really blame A.J.

549
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,846
He's doing exactly what he's supposed
to, testing the limits as much as he can.

550
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,682
- I blame myself.
- What are you talking about?

551
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,935
You don't know what it is
to have him hate you.

552
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,938
- He doesn't hate your guts.
- Oh, thank God he's alive.

553
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:19,277
It's my fault, Tony. My pathetic need to
compete with you clouded my judgment.

554
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,906
Or I never would have let him stay over
in New York. I knew he wasn't ready.

555
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,243
- I went against all my instincts.
- His eyebrows will grow back!

556
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,037
- Nothing really happened.
- No, you know what happened...

557
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,873
...I said, "Fuck it."
And you know why?

558
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,876
To get him to love me
as much as he loves you.

559
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,296
He loves you, it's just...
You're his mother, it's different.

560
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:42,217
I can't be the villain anymore, I mean it.
And I can't say "Fuck it."

561
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,552
Take him. Let him live with you.

562
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,769
- Ed Norton?
- Ed Norton?

563
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,066
I'm sorry, Mr. Kramden.
The correct answer is Stephen Foster.

564
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,736
But thanks so much. You've been a
wonderful contestant and a swell sport.

565
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,072
Goodbye, Mr. Kramden.

566
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,242
He's here.

567
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:14,833
- Hey, tarallis. Expiration date. 2007.
- Put them over there.

568
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,007
Have a seat.

569
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,138
Sounds serious.

570
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,975
You have anything to do
with that takedown in Ringwood?

571
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,435
Why? That a problem?

572
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,603
I told you that doctor
was a friend of mine.

573
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,231
I deliberately used that word.

574
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,401
Are you aware of how many things
a fucking M.D. can do for us?

575
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,405
Sorry, godfather, he was at the game.
I thought he was just another pigeon.

576
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,781
Who authorized you to do it?

577
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,243
And don't call me godfather
with that fucking cute smirk.

578
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,789
I know I was away for a long time...

579
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,626
...but when did that happen, you gotta
ask permission to ply your trade?

580
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,296
Here's your end. Be happy.

581
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,300
When were you gonna tell me
if I hadn't called you here?

582
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,886
I'm here now.
I'm telling you about it now.

583
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,472
That's the second time
I'm playing catch-up with you.

584
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,099
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- The lawn cutting.

585
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,478
What, do I have to send you a memo
every time I move my bowels too?

586
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,858
You're so concerned about me,
why didn't you put those cars...

587
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,152
...through my shops?
What?

588
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,821
Johnny Sack told me
about this guy in Newburgh.

589
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,240
- Johnny Sack?
- Yeah, Johnny Sack.

590
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,993
Anyway, he gave me a better deal
for shipping them whole.

591
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,912
Are you fucking serious?

592
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,832
- I don't like the way I'm being talked to.
- What did I say when you came to me...

593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,793
...said you wanted back in?

594
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,504
I said as long as you don't step
on anybody's toes.

595
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,422
- In my day...
- And that's another thing.

596
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,716
I don't wanna hear
about how it was in your day.

597
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,177
Keep your antidotes
to local color, the Dynaflows...

598
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:54,015
...or McGuire Sisters or shit like that.
Otherwise, shut the fuck up!

599
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,524
Jesus Christ, Feech,
I'm trying to ease your transition here...

600
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,150
...and this is the thanks I get?

601
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,119
I'm sorry if I offended you.

602
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,124
You gotta remember,
I still think of you as a kid.

603
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,713
I'll learn.

604
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,508
Yeah?

605
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,137
Yeah.

606
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,781
That's funny.

607
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,713
Come here.

608
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,428
Oh, shit.

609
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,513
We all right?

610
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:21,060
Just get the SL55 back, okay?

611
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,531
You know,
maybe I was too hard on that guy.

612
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,910
Did I learn nothing from Richie Aprile?

613
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,247
Nip it in the bud.

614
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,458
Feech?

615
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,795
He's well-liked, T.

616
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,714
That's another thing.

617
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,763
All right, well,
don't be so hard on yourself, though.

618
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,330
- Hey. Olson and Johnson.
- How you doing?

619
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,666
Stopped by the bakery,
they said you left already.

620
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,335
That's the Canali suit I promised you.

621
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,172
He said you should try on the jacket,
see how the sleeves are.

622
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,219
- How's that?
- How's that? I look better than Sinatra.

623
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,637
Very nice.

624
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:42,684
All right.
Hey, I'm having my wine and peaches.

625
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,144
- You want?
- No, thanks. We gotta get going.

626
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,188
- I'll try some peaches.
- Good.

627
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,691
Peaches are from fucking New Zealand,
they're great.

628
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,277
- I'll get you a glass.
- No, we should go. We should go.

629
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,237
- Take care of that thing.
- Can't wait?

630
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,364
Where the fuck you going?
Come on, sit down.

631
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,200
We gotta do this shit.
You don't wanna know. It's fucked up.

632
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,035
What?

633
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,372
My imbecile cousin.
He was welding his boat trailer...

634
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,040
...burns down his garage.

635
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,418
Now we got no place
to park the truck that we got.

636
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,378
What's wrong with the street?

637
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,881
Georgia peaches.
Those are considered the best.

638
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:18,136
See, he don't want me to know
what's in the truck.

639
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,100
Flat-screen TVs.
Fifty-inch plasma Philipses.

640
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,312
Guy's coming down from Montreal
but he got delayed a couple of days.

641
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,230
I got a garage right here.

642
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,524
My cousin's got a place.
We can lock it there.

643
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:35,236
Park the load here. This way I'm around.
Keep my glims on the stuff.

644
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,530
Yeah?
How much you gonna want for that?

645
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,826
- Two.
- Fuck you, Feech. It's fucking parking.

646
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,162
You gotta kick in a TV.

647
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:54,505
Thought I had a plan for Anthony,
but I'm not so sure now.

648
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,176
I don't know if Rutgers' summer program
accepts boys without eyebrows.

649
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,431
So you heard about that.
I was a wreck.

650
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,434
Look what happened to those girls
just driving to school.

651
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:10,605
We brought in grief counselors.
How's Anthony coping with that?

652
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,565
I have to say he never mentioned it.

653
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,945
They all handle tragedy differently.

654
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,826
He just moved in with his father.
I don't know if he said.

655
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,287
- Really?
- I don't know what you have heard...

656
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,122
...about my husband.
Some.

657
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,793
I mean, he's a good father,
don't get me wrong.

658
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,629
Our daughter's at Columbia.
My friends tell me I'm a snob...

659
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,840
...with this college business,
but with Anthony it's something else.

660
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:44,639
I just know that if he didn't get into
a good enough school to interest him...

661
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,642
...and he dropped out,
went to work as a waiter or something...

662
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,020
...he wouldn't last a week.
You know, he would be drawn right in...

663
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,356
You know.

664
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,317
My husband doesn't want that
for him either.

665
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,154
You met him.
My husband can be very magnetic.

666
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,572
You know, bigger than life.

667
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,744
And I was so young.
It was very exciting.

668
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,125
Anyway, he's over there.

669
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,085
I don't know, maybe it'll be good.

670
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,671
You know, learning the things
that men need to know.

671
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,089
I don't know.

672
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,426
What about you?
How long have you been at the school?

673
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,511
Since '86.

674
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:28,850
I suppose that's what caught me up too,
with Astrid.

675
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,478
Some notion of escaping the quotidian.

676
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,692
- So you were married.
- For about, well, five minutes.

677
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,652
Chicken Marsala.

678
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,700
- And the honey balsamic chicken.
- Thank you.

679
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,368
Have you read Madame Bovary?

680
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,955
- No.
- It's almost a perfect novel.

681
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,917
Flaubert writes about
bourgeois loneliness and emptiness.

682
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,879
Emma Bovary destroys herself
for some fantasy in her head.

683
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,882
It's great. It's truly, truly great.

684
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,677
Somehow horrifically funny,
though tragic.

685
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,304
I think you might enjoy it.

686
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,310
I will stop by Borders on my way home.

687
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,396
- Who is it by again?
- Gustave Flaubert.

688
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:32,205
- Yeah.
- Supervisor Curran, parole board.

689
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,207
Site visit.

690
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,919
- Where's Eddie Stimich?
- He's out sick.

691
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,129
I just wanna take a look around.

692
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,266
Only thing better about here than Russia
is the food.

693
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,811
Good one.

694
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,606
Eddie examined every fucking dust bunny
in the place just last week.

695
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,441
Is that new?

696
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,280
Bequest. Friend of mine passed away.

697
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,959
That your garage?

698
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,128
No, it's where I make
the weapons of mass destruction.

699
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,009
Let's go open it up.

700
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,764
You wanna see my fucking garage?
You never seen an oil stain before?

701
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,307
Let's go.

702
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,781
Here's the wind-up.

703
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,325
And the pitch.

704
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,161
- Come on!
- Fuck Major League Baseball.

705
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,497
Ever since the fucking strike.
Let's watch ballet.

706
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,002
Oh, somebody hot-boxed us?

707
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,671
- I saw you close the window.
- What's that?

708
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,173
It's when you close the windows
and fart on purpose.

709
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,176
- That's a Dutch oven.
- In bed it's a Dutch oven.

710
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:12,263
- Well, what's a Dutch oven?
- When you fart in bed with a woman...

711
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,182
...and force her head under the covers.
That's awesome.

712
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,518
Yeah, but first you gotta be
in bed with one.

713
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,353
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

714
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,731
Yeah, I would.

715
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,985
Oh, my God. What...? Jesus.

716
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,034
All right, that's enough.
Go upstairs, do your Spanish homework.

717
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,870
- Fifteen minutes.
- No, now.

718
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,385
And he goes down looking.
The end of the inning.

719
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,010
Just got the call.

720
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,514
They put him on a corrections bus
this morning.

721
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,148
This was the better move
than taking him out.

722
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,693
- Man was a legend.
- Christopher agrees, by the way.

723
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,278
Well, that's nice that he agrees.

724
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,449
But I'm not running
a fucking popularity contest.

725
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,734
Mommy, look at me!

726
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,115
Anthony!
