1
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,497
Fuck this. I'm calling Carlo.

2
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,800
Yeah, they didn't show.
The Vespa scooters.

3
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,762
We gotta wait.

4
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,723
Carlo was furious.

5
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,559
His guys waited by the Hackensack
River all fucking night.

6
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,602
Fucking Vespas never
got into my hands.

7
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,064
This is Port Newark.

8
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,607
Where were your longshoremen?

9
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,152
There's heightened security at the ports.
Al-Qaeda.

10
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,404
Done, Johnny.

11
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,281
I gotta go.

12
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,784
Nice job, Billy boy.

13
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,169
Carlo was told it was a go. If it
didn't happen, how come nobody called?

14
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,046
A lot of things didn't happen
that seem like they happened.

15
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,756
Your cousin didn't whack Joey.

16
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,717
The Vespas never got into my hands.

17
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,184
- Eye on the ball, Keaton! Hustle!
- Come on. Go, Soph!

18
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,603
Hey, Soph is open! She's open!

19
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,688
- Over here!
- She's gotta be at least 11.

20
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,900
Don't put up with that, Lissie!

21
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,652
Careful with those elbows,
number seven!

22
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,155
Hey, out of bounds! Out of bounds!

23
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,324
Lissie, go!

24
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,369
- They're just a bunch of losers!
- Hey, no negatives, you.

25
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,789
Come on, Putts, charge the ball!
Charge it!

26
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,541
Ah!

27
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,169
Foul! That kid tripped my kid.

28
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,129
That's legal.
She was going for the ball.

29
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,507
- She was not.
- Score! Score! Come on!

30
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,094
Your kid is out of control. She's been
tripping and pushing all summer.

31
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,305
Oh, shut up and get out of here.

32
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,848
Don't tell me to shut up.

33
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,646
What are you, crazy?

34
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,902
Please, come on. Somebody!

35
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,946
- How do you like it now, bitch?
- Help!

36
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,991
No, her kid kicked my kid. Get off!

37
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,329
- Cost you a hundred.
- Call.

38
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,957
Sit down. Sit, sit.

39
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,170
I talked to John.

40
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,923
The Vespa scooters came in.

41
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,927
But there was no opportunity to grab
them because of security at the ports.

42
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,181
Jesus Christ. The young crowd
is crazy for these scooters.

43
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,392
He owes me half that fucking load.

44
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,519
- You're not buying it?
- I don't know what to think.

45
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,604
He's getting awfully cute
with his remarks.

46
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,525
All I know is his behavior
at that kid's funeral was a disgrace.

47
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,904
- It's a big part of my livelihood, the port.
- I will say, very interesting timing, T.

48
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,657
You and John had that little chat
at the funeral...

49
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,409
...whatever that was.

50
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,661
Suddenly, no Vespas.

51
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,875
All right, I gotta take this.

52
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,172
Take one of Carlo's guys.
Start hanging around down Port Newark.

53
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,883
Find out what the fuck is going on.

54
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,970
The property taxes, I know.

55
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,847
Hello to you too.

56
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,766
I thought you should know
your sister, Janice, got arrested.

57
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,227
- What?
- In Essex County this afternoon...

58
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,105
...an incident of sports rage
among soccer moms...

59
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,608
...led to the arrest of a Verona woman
with ties to the Mafia.

60
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,528
Our Gillian Glessner was on the scene.
What about it, Gillian?

61
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,990
Think that other mother better go into
the soccer-mom protection program?

62
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,408
Maybe she should, Carl.

63
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,327
It started here
at Summit Avenue Park...

64
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,038
club soccer match.

65
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,998
An altercation between soccer moms...

66
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,126
...that sent one mother to the hospital
and one to jail.

67
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,628
Denise McCarthy, a parent,
witnessed the violence.

68
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,589
I just feel so bad for the kids.

69
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,091
Parents taping the match
captured the melee.

70
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,803
- Come on! Somebody!
- How do you like it now, bitch?

71
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,516
Her kid kicked my kid.

72
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,185
Charges are still pending but...

73
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,188
...we know that the woman shown here
being taken into custody...

74
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:01,526
...is Janice Baccalieri, sister of reputed
New Jersey mob boss, Anthony Soprano.

75
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,321
Guess you could call it
a Mafia-related hit.

76
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,115
We spoke with psychologist Bela Kakuk.

77
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,534
It's a growing problem in our society.

78
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:15,123
Psychologists are finding that certain
individuals are particularly prone to rage.

79
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:19,002
Almost any frustration, inconvenience...

80
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,506
...or perceived inconsideration
will set them off.

81
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,175
Motherfucker!

82
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,473
Janice, open the door!

83
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,893
- Where is she?
- It wasn't my fault!

84
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,478
My name was all over the TV...

85
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,896
...because of your bullshit!

86
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,398
It's not that simple, Ton.

87
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,900
Apparently, the woman's kid
was picking on Sophia.

88
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,235
Why wasn't she collared?

89
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,529
I am suing the township
for wrongful arrest...

90
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,280
- No, you're not!
- And the YSO.

91
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,949
No, no, you're not!

92
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,910
What you're gonna do is call Neil.
You're gonna plea it down.

93
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,539
You're gonna pay the fine and not turn
this into one of your cause célèbres.

94
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,582
Anybody's side but mine.

95
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,459
That bitch is lucky I didn't kill her.

96
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,003
Well, we know that.

97
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,506
What?

98
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,884
- You and your fucking temper, Janice.
- Get out.

99
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,307
This is the end of it.

100
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,188
Get out!

101
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,733
Tony.

102
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,239
I know this looks bad.

103
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,034
But on the other hand,
she called Sophia her daughter.

104
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,120
I don't give a fuck.

105
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,748
All right, I do give a fuck.

106
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,210
But how many times I gotta tell you,
get control of your wife!

107
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,174
Sophia?

108
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,636
Sophia?

109
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,061
I'm so embarrassed.

110
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,606
I don't wanna see
any of my friends again.

111
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,400
Well, when you're a parent, you'll see.

112
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,028
You'll defend your children
like a lion with her cubs.

113
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,863
You're not my parent.

114
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,781
What did you say?

115
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,868
I'm here.

116
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,038
And I try to care very much.

117
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,291
- Now, get to sleep.
- You gonna punch me?

118
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,962
Jan? Can I talk to you?

119
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,801
Sophia, go to sleep.

120
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,063
We'll talk tomorrow. I'm exhausted.

121
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,023
No, now.

122
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,359
What, I don't have a say in things?

123
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,778
Janice, I think you need
professional help.

124
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,240
Oh, I'll be having an extra session
with Sandy, believe me.

125
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,242
Sandy, Sandy. What does she do?

126
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,954
She says you were picked on by your
father and asks you to read screenplays.

127
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,206
I think there's anger specialists.

128
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,792
And I think you should see
a weight-loss specialist.

129
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,460
You don't see it in yourself.

130
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,754
I heard you with Sophia.

131
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,422
You were getting along
much better.

132
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,884
She says one little thing,
and you get nasty.

133
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,678
I'm so sore.

134
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,638
This is not an isolated incident.

135
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,974
They won't let you shop up
at the corner anymore.

136
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,769
Those coffee beans were burnt, Bobby.
You tasted them.

137
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,731
Janice, I like a spitfire type.
I told you.

138
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,026
- But me and the kids can't live like this.
- Like what?

139
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,822
This was a nice house.

140
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,365
Peaceful. I don't know.

141
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,867
There wasn't all this yelling and tension.

142
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,203
How could you understand?

143
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,080
Your dad was a sweetheart...

144
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,249
...even when he had emphysema.

145
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,669
My house, it was dog-eat-dog.

146
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,005
Well, be that as it may,
the past and all...

147
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,383
...if you don't go to these anger classes
they have or whatever...

148
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,010
...this with us ain't gonna work out.

149
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,741
What do you think he clears here?

150
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,704
Two crap tables, blackjack, roulette.

151
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:27,876
You gotta figure he's grabbing anywhere
from 2500 to 5 G's a night for himself.

152
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,172
It used to be you, didn't it?

153
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,923
Teacher's pet.

154
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,968
- Stop making meatballs, Paulie.
- I'm just saying.

155
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,929
Now you know what I went through.

156
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,936
Okay, it's the same Gina had
at her wedding.

157
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,855
We should see how it looks
on your face.

158
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,815
Chrissy.

159
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,533
What the fuck?

160
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,794
- What's up?
- Hey there, cos.

161
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,587
Guess who called me today.

162
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,589
- How'd you find me?
- Not gonna guess?

163
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,467
- Okay, who?
- Our friend with the orchard.

164
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,220
- No shit. He okay?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,598
- Sold the place. Moving to Florida.
- He should. Getting on in years.

166
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,813
- Oh, shit.
- You still got your canned peaches there.

167
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,942
I just had the car serviced.
Watch what you say.

168
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,694
I gotta move that shit?

169
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,821
- Again?
- That developer's going up there.

170
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,490
Obviously, it wouldn't be good
for you or our friend...

171
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,159
...if somebody opened the canned fruit.

172
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,954
So you and your cousin are
going there to take care of it.

173
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,081
- I'll do it.
- I'm worried about the old guy.

174
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,457
I told you, I'll do it.

175
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,335
The thing is, my old man's
got a few jars up there also.

176
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,962
Could make problems for my uncle.

177
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,091
It's gonna be a lot of work...

178
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,760
...which, with Louise around,
can only be done at night.

179
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,929
- That's true.
- This has to be done...

180
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,389
...in two weeks, the latest.

181
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,224
Bulldozers are coming.

182
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,935
What, you picking out wedding cakes?

183
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,396
- Yeah.
- Hope you have better luck than I did.

184
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,940
Why, you didn't like your cake?

185
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,943
Your luck's been fucking great
and listen to you cursing it out.

186
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,571
Got something you wanna say?

187
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,616
- All right.
- So call me.

188
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,212
Well, who is this Uncle Pat anyway?

189
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,383
He was a knock-around guy
like Tony's dad.

190
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,387
But they let him retire
to this farm upstate New York.

191
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,973
Sounds funny but it wasn't.

192
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,933
He had the hiccups for, like, a year.

193
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,519
- Jeez.
- Great guy.

194
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,646
Had a daughter
but she lived with her mom.

195
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:59,027
Us boys each got sent up there summers
when we hit 12 or 13.

196
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,945
He'd school us.

197
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,156
Did he have the hiccups?

198
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,617
No, I told you, that went away.

199
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,368
What, you think it's fucking funny?

200
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,788
He almost committed suicide
because of it.

201
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,581
How would you like it?

202
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,584
Where's my Barneys underpants
with the ventilated cotton?

203
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,669
Still in the dryer.

204
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,675
Tell you one thing.

205
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,428
I need fucking Tony B. up there
like I need a third nut.

206
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,224
God, all this resentment.
He is your cousin.

207
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,851
Yeah? Should have seen him
when I was little.

208
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,269
Him and Tony both.

209
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,188
How they broke my balls...

210
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,565
...teased me.

211
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,944
One time, I was spending the summer...

212
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,405
...up at Uncle Pat's farm,
just like they used to. I was 11.

213
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,866
They came up... They were, like, 19.
to shoot guns.

214
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,743
They didn't take me with them.

215
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,287
When I tramped through the stickers
and found them...

216
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,581
...they said I had to be initiated
into a club...

217
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,377
...by being tied to a tree alone
in the orchard for an hour.

218
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,382
I was on that tree until 3:00
in the fucking morning.

219
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,552
I worshipped these two guys.

220
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,720
Tony Soprano, especially.

221
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,182
When he was by himself,
he used to push me on my Big Wheels...

222
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,309
...he'd teach me curse words.

223
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,603
When he was by himself.

224
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,608
Where's the Tinactin?

225
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,112
Right on the night table.

226
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,406
And here we are again.

227
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:31,911
Tony B. goes wrong, and Tony lays
a 200-K-a-year cash cow on him.

228
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,837
Christopher, don't get mad, okay?

229
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:46,551
I know we kind of touched on it a
couple of times but... You're so unhappy.

230
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,220
What if we left here?

231
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,139
Went far away.

232
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,391
And you went into something else.

233
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,102
- Like what?
- I don't know, like...

234
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,813
Pick up your writing, maybe.

235
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,982
Male modeling.

236
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,069
I'll get back to the writing someday...

237
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,780
...but from a position of great wealth.

238
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,326
Far as male modeling,
I'd probably be a success...

239
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,037
...but I wouldn't want to be around
those fucking people.

240
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,958
I'm a soldier, Adriana.

241
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,877
When you gonna understand that?

242
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,640
What the fuck!

243
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,308
Carmela.

244
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,186
- What?
- There's no water in the pool.

245
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,856
Yeah, I had it drained.
The electricity costs a fortune.

246
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,275
I can't afford it.
You're the only one who uses it.

247
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,243
I thought we were
getting along better.

248
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,123
So you polluted all the decent lawyers in
New Jersey so they can't represent me?

249
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,960
- You couldn't play fair.
- I'm not the one that wanted it!

250
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,795
Okay, so let's just pretend...

251
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,547
...that you weren't begging for it
in millions of ways...

252
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,299
...because I am worn out here.

253
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,944
Fucking...

254
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,004
He's a nice kid, Finn.

255
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,672
Right?

256
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,757
Right.

257
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,931
We gonna throw them
an engagement party?

258
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,059
Well, if we can be civil.

259
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,895
She's so young.

260
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,397
Same age we were.

261
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,279
It wasn't all bad.

262
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,083
Last time, I asked you
to jot down one or two situations...

263
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,918
...or people that trigger your anger.

264
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,172
So much that when you think about it,
you get angry all over again.

265
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,590
Anybody got...?

266
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,051
Let's give Bradley a chance this time.

267
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,306
My partner parked me in again.
I couldn't find the keys.

268
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,018
- I woke him up, and he starts yelling.
- Describe the feelings.

269
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,354
- I think...
- My stepkids do that all the time.

270
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,648
They leave their bikes in the garage...

271
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,651
...and if I wanna pull in,
I gotta get out and move the bikes...

272
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,153
...with a car of groceries.

273
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,489
Doris, can't you keep
Billy's bike out of the driveway?

274
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,703
It was a famous commercial
from the '60s.

275
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,205
Bufferin.

276
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,791
Guy has a headache,
and he takes it out on his wife.

277
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,795
Back to Bradley...

278
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,964
...I'm trying to get into his actual
physical sensations of anger.

279
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,092
He saw red. Who wouldn't?

280
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,135
She's right. I mean, why is he in here?

281
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,472
Why isn't his roommate in therapy
for selfishness issues?

282
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,601
There are things that are irritating
and annoying and out of our control.

283
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,771
What we can control
is our response to those triggers.

284
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,232
So people just get a free pass?
The whole world?

285
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,944
I told you about my supervisor
checking my work and nobody else's.

286
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,571
- I wonder why.
- Because you're a minority.

287
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,282
- Exactly. That's why I'm in here.
- Uh huh.

288
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,537
- You seem angry about Evelyn's problem.
- It makes me mad.

289
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,415
It doesn't make you mad.
You make you mad.

290
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,377
I come from a biased family,
but I was different.

291
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,212
I put all my faith and my hopes...

292
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,882
...into the civil rights movement.
I left home, and I marched.

293
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,300
And for what?

294
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,929
So they could ride around in their SUVs,
blasting that rap shit?

295
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,598
And you can't say anything
because they might have guns?

296
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,851
Wait a fucking minute.
Who's "they"?

297
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,352
If the shoe fits...

298
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,521
This is fucking priceless.

299
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,191
Okay, let's not time travel here.
Let's try to stay in the present.

300
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,444
Janice, you're angry.
Let's stay with that.

301
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,780
What are your actual
physical feelings right now?

302
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,158
I'd like to punch you in the face.

303
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,160
Your hands are clenched.

304
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,120
Did you realize that?

305
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,666
You're provoking me to make a point and
maybe that's your job, but I don't like it.

306
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,169
Look at you. You're not even listening.

307
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,254
- Hello, he's talking to me.
- No.

308
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,174
You and me,
we do most of the talking in here.

309
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,678
The man is trying to say that those
people outside, they do the thing...

310
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,849
...but we're the ones that get upset and
start carrying on. That's all he's saying.

311
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,398
The Hudson Valley.

312
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,237
That Legend of Sleepy Hollow cartoon.

313
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,364
Scared the piss out of me as a kid.

314
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,949
Would you mind
watching your shoe?

315
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,161
Oh, sure.

316
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,872
It's a $50,000 vehicle.
I don't want it scuffed up.

317
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,467
Uncle Pat's farm.

318
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,263
When you're 12, 13, man,
it's like fucking heaven, right?

319
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,683
Running around in the woods.

320
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,352
Driving that tractor.

321
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,190
He made me clear the brush by the fence
with a fucking scythe, though.

322
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,568
Yeah, I had to do that. Tony too.

323
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,989
And water his fucking tomatoes
and his

324
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,408
Changed, though, you know, Pat's.

325
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,827
After Louise came back there to live...

326
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,121
...it wasn't just you and Pat
and his stories.

327
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,006
They used to call me Ichabod Crane.

328
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,386
- Who?
- Some very sorry people, that's who.

329
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,433
The Carmela front.

330
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,354
Did you two ever discuss
that evening you made love?

331
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,441
It was a one-time deal.

332
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,736
- I've moved on.
- What about the depression?

333
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,200
Your revelation about your cousin...

334
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,369
...his prison sentence.

335
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,037
You were very upset.

336
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,542
I haven't had a lot of time
to think about that.

337
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,587
My sister.

338
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,174
She attacked some woman...

339
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,180
...at her stepkid's soccer game.
You've mentioned her temper before.

340
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,183
She got charged
with aggravated assault and...

341
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,602
...resisting arrest.
Excellent.

342
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,979
Let's talk about that.

343
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,523
- What?
- Rage.

344
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,735
- Why?
- Depression is rage turned inward.

345
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,906
Tell me about the Soprano temper.

346
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,992
Well, the thing is, it's bad for business.

347
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,785
Clouds your judgment.

348
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,121
John, he always had a terrible temper.

349
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,622
- John?
- Gotti.

350
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,499
In the end, I think it hurt him.

351
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,003
See, we forget that in the old days,
the ones that came over...

352
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,339
...that started this thing...

353
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,965
...they didn't get mad.

354
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,177
They just smiled and nodded
and made sure you got it later.

355
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,972
That's the whole, beautiful point.
You know what they say:

356
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,475
"Revenge is like serving cold cuts."

357
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,480
Yeah, I think it's,
"Revenge is a dish best served cold."

358
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,399
- So, what did I say?
- But why revenge all the time?

359
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:45,654
Where does it come from, this insatiable
anger you and your sister share?

360
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,115
I wondered how long
it'd take for her to come up.

361
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,160
Your mother? What about your father?

362
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,413
You never saw her
chop off someone's finger.

363
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,207
Told you about that, didn't I?

364
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,958
Yes.

365
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,338
- Oh, Jesus, I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

366
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,673
I dress up nice and everything
when I come here.

367
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,176
Okay, let's stick to the subject.

368
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,638
- Which is what?
- Your own intolerance for frustration.

369
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,644
"Thank you for holding.

370
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,437
Your call is important to us."

371
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,981
If it's so important to you,
answer the fucking phone!

372
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,945
- Stay with that.
- It's a level of bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

373
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,198
Each idea they come up with
that's supposed to make things better...

374
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,159
...makes things worse.
Okay, right. I agree.

375
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,203
"The center cannot hold."

376
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:38,374
- "The falcon cannot hear the falconer."
- What the fuck are you talking about?

377
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,545
We live in a time
of technological and spiritual crisis.

378
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,713
But you feel you're above all of it.

379
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:49,135
Certainly above any
inconvenience or annoyance.

380
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,762
And if things don't go your way...

381
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:57,351
...instead of being merely disappointed
or inconvenienced, you blow.

382
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,026
My sister's...

383
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,738
She's taking anger management classes.

384
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,908
You know,
maybe she's on the right track.

385
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,286
Is this something you'd consider?

386
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,954
No.

387
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:23,169
Well, but I'll admit, it's not good for me,
all this fucking agitation.

388
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,796
Wears me out.

389
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,882
Fucking exhausted all the time.

390
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,258
Where did we start off?

391
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,719
I don't know.

392
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,013
Depression is rage turned inward.

393
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,809
Yeah, yeah.

394
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,234
This is nice.

395
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,572
For inner city kids like me,
this was important.

396
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,617
Inner city? You lived by the
largest shopping mall in Jersey.

397
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,245
It's over now. She's sticking me
in that home in Florida...

398
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,957
...and that's the last I'll ever see of her.
- I'll be right down the road, Pop.

399
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,584
I got a beautiful condo.

400
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,962
Thinks she's gonna meet
some old, lonely widower.

401
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,262
Louise, it's time for dessert.

402
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,848
I'm getting it.

403
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,684
And do me a favor.

404
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,188
Be as polite as you are
when it's just the two of us.

405
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,949
We know where Chrissy buried the guy.
But with Uncle Johnny's...

406
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,201
...you gotta help us out.

407
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,079
Well...

408
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,831
...I'm not exactly sure...

409
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,583
...but there was two of them.

410
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,960
The Johnson brothers.

411
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,545
You don't remember where?

412
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,132
It was a long time ago.

413
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,928
We can't excavate
the whole fucking place.

414
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,305
Because you know what
Tony's gonna say.

415
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,516
Let him come up here and dig then.

416
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,978
Please. He's a heart attack
waiting to happen.

417
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,729
That's no joke.

418
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,690
Our bodies are 86 percent water.

419
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,401
His last blood test,
he was 65 percent zeppole.

420
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,578
When he heard the term "pie in the sky,"
he volunteered for the 82nd Airborne.

421
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,204
That's pretty good.

422
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,419
I learned in recovery that he's just
tamping down his feelings, T, by eating.

423
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,715
I should talk to him.

424
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,175
It's a shame, because he
used to be the funnest guy.

425
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,927
When was that?

426
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,434
He's got the world by the balls and acts
like everything's a big imposition.

427
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,438
Being at the top, he's isolated himself.

428
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,732
Yeah, it's just him and his money.

429
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,915
Hello.

430
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,755
- Who is this guy, anyway?
- My first.

431
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,382
Czechoslovakian guy.

432
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,135
This is the second time I'm moving him.

433
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,987
- Come here, you little fuck.
- Guys, wait...

434
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,448
- Come here, you little fuck.
- It wasn't me...

435
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,078
Help! Please, don't kill me.

436
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,622
What the fuck are you running for?

437
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,084
The night of the 12th,
there was a ship from Italy...

438
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,378
...with these containers
of Vespa motor scooters.

439
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,838
I don't know anything
about any fucking Vespas!

440
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,508
We know they got here.
What happened to them?

441
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,636
I don't know. I wasn't here.

442
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,806
Well, apparently he says he wasn't here.

443
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,768
Who picked up...

444
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:12,231
...our motherfucking,
cocksucking Vespas?

445
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,609
In two seconds...

446
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,362
...this is going up your ass.

447
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,572
It was the guys from New York.

448
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,074
Phil Leotardo and them.

449
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,048
Listen...

450
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,634
...thanks for doing this.

451
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,721
- You didn't have to.
- Fuck that. You're my little cousin.

452
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,651
Think I can imagine what you
may be hearing about me.

453
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,028
And what happened in New York.

454
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,408
- All I can say is, there's no truth to it.
- I didn't think nothing.

455
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,120
As for Tony putting me in at the casino,
I knew people were gonna resent that.

456
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,249
But I went away for a long time.
Stood up for this family.

457
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,419
And you, or anybody,
can think what they like...

458
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,380
...but I feel I had a little coming to me.
Hey, absolutely.

459
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,008
I was telling Benny the other day.
He was complaining.

460
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,553
And what I said about Tony before?
You know I love him like a brother.

461
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,930
I love him too.

462
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,309
We saw the guy down the pier.
John has the Vespas.

463
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,855
And to think of how
supportive you were of him.

464
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,400
- The whole little Carmine fiasco.
- It's fucking payback.

465
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:24,279
Johnny has it in his head that my cousin
had something to do with Joey Peeps.

466
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,074
Johnny should be out looking
for the real killers...

467
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,535
...instead of spending
his time on that golf course.

468
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,833
A whole fucking shipment of cheese
coming in next month.

469
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,168
The imported provolone.

470
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,338
I guess we can kiss that
goodbye too now, right?

471
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,763
Motherfucker!

472
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,492
Carmela, hi. What are you doing here?

473
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,580
My son is a senior here now. We were
electing party chairs for senior night.

474
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,082
Oh, right.

475
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,500
So how are you?

476
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,336
- Fine.
- You were pretty upset when you left...

477
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,005
...and I wanted to call.

478
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,883
I began to rue what happened,
and I was probably a little...

479
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,926
I'm going back with my husband.

480
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,137
Oh, well, that's good.

481
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,098
Well, all the best.

482
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,992
You don't drink no more?

483
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,953
Clean and sober 14 months.

484
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,539
Yeah, your mother has that problem.

485
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,751
Good for you.

486
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,642
That's right.

487
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,477
What?

488
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,730
The Johnson brothers' bodies.

489
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,232
I know where they are.

490
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,404
Over by the fence
in the northwest corner...

491
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,865
...because that night
I noticed one of my pickers...

492
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,786
...had stuck a Swiss Colony bottle
upside down on one of the fence posts.

493
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,539
I was goddamn mad they
were drinking on the job, I'll tell you.

494
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,960
It's still there, the glass bottle.

495
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,212
- Are you fucking sure?
- Lunch!

496
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,466
- Look what I got for you.
- Thank you.

497
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,010
- Sandwich?
- Oh, very good.

498
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,721
- Here, Pop.
- Oh, thank you.

499
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,893
- Beautiful.
- For you.

500
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,774
This is mail from
three fucking weeks ago.

501
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,568
The girl didn't even show up today.

502
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,487
Call the service and get somebody new.

503
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,198
Two classes, she's telling people
how to run their life.

504
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,535
Don't let it stop you from taking
your kids to the rink.

505
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,215
You have every right to be mad at me...

506
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,591
...and I apologize.

507
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:36,805
I know it's bad for the family.
For... For business.

508
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,056
But I'm working on it.

509
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,937
Yeah, I know. Bobby told me.

510
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,986
- So how's that going?
- Anger management?

511
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,196
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

512
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:57,534
It's such a relief to let go
of all that shit. And...

513
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,203
...I never realized what
an angry person I was and...

514
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,747
...how it fed itself.

515
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,582
So they got you on tranquilizers?

516
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,792
No.

517
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,170
Basically...

518
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,048
...it's taking responsibility
for your anger...

519
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,885
...and, you know, learning to recognize
your feelings of anger...

520
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,180
...and that they're just feelings.
You don't have to act on them.

521
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,474
People want that
so they can walk all over you.

522
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,477
A lot of anger is self-importance.

523
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,063
- Self-importance?
- Problems with authority.

524
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,400
Dr. Seepman locks
the door promptly at 7.

525
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,652
People wig out if they don't get in.

526
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,614
Start banging on the door.
It's a big lesson.

527
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,160
I was making everybody
in my life miserable.

528
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,538
Yelling and screaming or pouting
and feeling victimized...

529
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,876
...but I feel so much better now.
About everything.

530
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,838
It's like this great
sadness is beginning to lift.

531
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,341
- Sadness?
- Yeah.

532
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,180
Well, I'm happy for you.

533
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,140
Thank you.

534
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,519
I am.

535
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,254
Your bid, Chrissy.

536
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,549
You expecting someone?

537
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,803
There he is.

538
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,265
My God, I don't believe it.

539
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,184
Who's that, Anthony?

540
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,483
What's the matter? You all right?

541
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,403
God, you're big.

542
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,448
Look at those shoulders.

543
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,368
- Jan sends her love. And Bob too.
- Did you eat?

544
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,579
Louise, don't ask him. He's a guest.

545
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,664
Just go get him a plate.

546
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,000
Sit down.

547
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,210
You look good.

548
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,670
Feel good.

549
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,423
So how we doing?

550
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,803
Took care of mine last night.
The Johnson brothers, we'll get tonight.

551
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,892
Uncle Pat was like Johnny Mnemonic.
Right, Uncle Pat?

552
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,311
We're playing pinochle. Take a hand.

553
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,447
- This is the life, huh?
- I'm with you.

554
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,449
Yeah, we were just saying that.

555
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,703
Here's to a job well done.

556
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,794
This place hasn't changed much, huh?

557
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,006
Met some pretty nice college
girls the other night, huh, Ton?

558
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,884
She liked you. Miss Raven-Hair.

559
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,014
- Pat seems good, huh?
- Yeah.

560
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,600
Louise seems fat.

561
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,608
The human body is 86 percent water.

562
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,779
But Louise's last blood test,
she was 65 percent zeppole.

563
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,451
That's a good one.

564
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,497
I knew a guy. When he was
gonna eat Philly cheese steak...

565
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,834
...the mayor of Philly would have
to call out the National Guard.

566
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,089
What the fuck's so funny about that?

567
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,466
Doesn't even make sense.

568
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,261
Well, he's drunk.

569
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,471
Him? No way.

570
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,598
He's in recovery.

571
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,602
Well, if you recover your
fucking balls, give us a call.

572
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,022
We might like to hang out.

573
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:41,526
No, seriously, it's not funny.
He's... He's a 12-stepper. Right?

574
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,362
Well, yeah. You know that. That's right.

575
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,659
Maybe he could take a couple of steps
out the door so we could have some fun.

576
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,623
Come on, don't get pissy now.
He's just having a joke. That's all.

577
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,794
Sobriety's hard enough work
without having to get mocked for it.

578
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,464
Oh, Jesus Christ. Why don't you have
a fucking drink?

579
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,008
Because you're driving
everybody crazy with this shit.

580
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,677
The fucking higher power
yammering and the sweets...

581
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,598
...and the key lime pie and the... Jesus.

582
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,227
Order a fucking bull shot,
will you? Do me a favor.

583
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,988
I'm sorry. I...

584
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,158
- Didn't realize I was being a jerk off.
- No, no.

585
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,411
- No, no, no.
- Look, it's just, you know, come on.

586
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,041
Hey, you're doing the right thing.

587
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,834
You're doing the right thing.

588
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,221
Do you like his car? Schwarzenegger's.
Pretty fucking great, huh?

589
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,390
Oh, yeah, the Humvee, yeah.
Yeah, it's nice.

590
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,183
Kind of steep, though.

591
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,061
You told me you didn't pay.
You gave the guy a hum job.

592
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,063
For the Humvee.

593
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,401
- Maybe he'd like to hum me.
- Who, a friend of Bill over here?

594
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,154
- Fucking wits over here.
- Bill? I'll say.

595
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,865
That? That's not a bill, that's a beak.

596
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,992
You know...

597
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,330
...that was you he made that joke
about the zeppole content.

598
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,794
On the way home,
we can drop him off at Beakskill.

599
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,631
Well, if beaks could kill,
that one certainly would.

600
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,096
You know, I could have
called you Ichabod Crane.

601
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,390
But I didn't.

602
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,768
What the fuck's he talking about?
Ichabod Crane?

603
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,020
Nothing.

604
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,653
Well, here's to the Johnson brothers...

605
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,781
...whoever the fuck they were.

606
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,659
- Johnson brothers.
- Johnson brothers.

607
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,714
Back pain? Is your pain...

608
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,425
carrying case and are ergonomically...

609
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,968
Port Newark in New Jersey...

610
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,553
Ninety-five...

611
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,388
but one example.

612
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,558
Six million containers enter
U.S. ports every year...

613
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:23,563
...yet fewer than 2 percent of them are
opened and inspected by U.S. Customs.

614
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:27,150
It is physically impossible to check
every container without essentially...

615
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,569
...stopping global commerce.

616
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,363
But what keeps officials
from sleeping at night they say...

617
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,616
...is terrorists could
use shipping containers...

618
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:38,161
...to smuggle in a weapon
of mass destruction.

619
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,747
It is within capabilities of
Islamic fundamentalists...

620
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,417
...to track a container with a
global positioning system...

621
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,379
...and detonate a nuclear
or biological weapon hidden inside.

622
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,049
- Son of a bitch.
- In fact a terrorist could even use...

623
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:55,595
...a shipping container
to smuggle himself into the country.

624
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,516
There he is.

625
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,394
What I saw on TV last night...

626
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,774
...the ports are wide open.
Government's not doing shit.

627
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:11,152
- Louise, where's my butter substitute?
- Right in front of you.

628
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,404
You hear what I just said?
I knew it was bad...

629
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,823
...but do you realize there's
7 million containers?

630
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,326
The news team put
radioactive shit in one of them.

631
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,496
- Wasn't even detected.
- Please, my ears.

632
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,582
Sit down. Sit. Come on.

633
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,751
I made eggs.

634
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,046
Could have been a goddamn A-bomb.

635
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,340
- You want coffee?
- Yeah.

636
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,803
Fucking terrible nightmares.

637
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,847
Yeah, it knocked the edge
right the hell off your appetite.

638
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,728
- What's the matter with you?
- No, it is some scary shit.

639
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,855
Not my problem much longer.

640
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,402
Speaking of scary shit, was that you
in the bathroom this morning?

641
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:57,448
Oh, yeah. I thought they already
dropped a biological weapon.

642
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,996
All right, I gotta go.

643
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,582
I thought we were gonna
do a little hunting.

644
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:09,085
- You hear the turkeys this morning?
- No, I gotta take off.

645
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,130
Uncle Pat, take care of yourself.

646
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,215
Be careful of the alligators down there.

647
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,384
All right, tough guy.

648
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,090
Hey, Ton. What'd you do?
Knock over a roadside stand?

649
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,176
My uncle's farm.

650
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,386
Less than a hundred miles from here.

651
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,263
It's like a whole different world.

652
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,684
The bullshit really falls away up there.

653
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,656
Hear about that shit with the ports?

654
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,993
I know customs agents are bad for us,
but anti-terrorism-wise, they do nothing.

655
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,371
What's it gonna take?
A fucking nuclear bomb?

656
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,333
They caught one of these Al-Qaeda
cocksuckers trying to sneak in here.

657
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,169
- Thank God they got him.
- There's enough they don't catch.

658
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,963
You gotta realize the
administration's busy, though, too.

659
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,008
Handing out non-competitive
building contracts to their friends.

660
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,428
Hell, we can all understand that.

661
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,808
We're fucking sitting ducks here.
The only thing between our homes...

662
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,976
...and Port Newark is a chainlink fence.

663
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,896
There's a nuclear bomb in a
container and we're fucking dead.

664
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,524
That's why you gotta live for today.

665
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,488
- What'd you say?
- That's why you gotta live for today.

666
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,199
Talking about annihilation,
you stupid fuck!

667
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,077
Your kids! My kids!
Burning into cinders!

668
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,204
I can't even think about it.

669
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,790
You stupid...

670
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,378
Can't even fucking think about it.

671
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,505
Think about it now.

672
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,174
Thinking about it now?

673
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,552
- Right now?
- Hey, Tony.

674
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,346
Yeah, yeah, take it easy.
Take it easy. Take a walk.

675
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,849
- Get some air.
- Take it easy.

676
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,726
- Take a walk outside.
- Take it easy.

677
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,728
All right, everybody.

678
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,899
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Come on.

679
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,332
- I wake you up?
- Yeah.

680
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,295
I just come from the hospital.
You said you wanted to know.

681
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,505
Oh, how's he doing?

682
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,051
- Hey.
- Hey.

683
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,929
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

684
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,807
Doctor has a peel at 1.

685
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,186
- Hi.
- How you doing, hon?

686
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,313
- Call me?
- Yeah.

687
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,983
Bye.

688
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,528
- See you later.
- That the dermatology nurse?

689
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,363
- Yeah.
- Nice looking.

690
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,866
Well, they get the best
skin treatments half-price.

691
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,917
So, what'd they say?
He's gonna be okay, the kid?

692
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,169
He's big, strapping. He'll be all right.

693
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:42,048
But he's got some hearing loss in one
ear. Looks like it could be permanent.

694
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,009
Skip, the poor fuck knows
he should keep his mouth shut.

695
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,974
Go over there.

696
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,936
You make sure he gets the best.

697
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,779
Thing is, Ton, he's quitting the Bing.

698
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:09,033
And he told Sil, "And I'd appreciate
it if Tony don't come visit me."

699
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,035
He don't wanna see you.

700
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,996
I told him, watch his mouth.

701
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,960
These things happen, T.
That's why I don't like to talk politics.

702
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,808
- You did?
- Please, I couldn't believe it myself.

703
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,019
- Well, are you going back with Tony?
- No.

704
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,981
- Then why'd you say it?
- I don't know, it just came out.

705
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,858
Asshole. He was gonna call me.

706
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,193
- Did he?
- Jerk.

707
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,405
Come in.

708
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,951
Hi.

709
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,995
Uncle Pat.

710
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,206
- Where's A.J?
- He's not coming.

711
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,959
You lose them to their friends
for a bit but he'll be back.

712
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,711
- Hi, Uncle Ton.
- Hey.

713
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,925
Soph?

714
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,932
- Before dinner?
- Half?

715
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:23,357
- Thank you.
- Mahatma Gandhi over here. Nice.

716
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,568
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

717
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,403
- I thought I heard your voice.
- Hello?

718
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,988
- Good game on later.
- Yeah?

719
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,240
I think we're on the "Do not call" list.

720
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,075
No, no, we're happy with our service.

721
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,579
Are those telemarketers?
Just hang up. Hang up!

722
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,541
We're just sitting down to dinner.
Okay. Please don't call again.

723
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,586
Thank you, thank you.

724
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,716
Bobby, Soph, come on.

725
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,768
It's a G5. It's got a 64-bit architecture.

726
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,978
They speak a different
language with computers.

727
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,440
I saw a show on computers,
how the prices have dropped so low...

728
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,902
...that you can buy one for $500
at Costco, that's more powerful...

729
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,447
...than the one that they used
to put the astronauts on the moon.

730
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,783
Good eggplant, Jan.

731
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,328
Yeah, delicious.

732
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,254
Wonder where Harpo's eating
his Sunday dinner?

733
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,133
What?

734
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,597
- Just wondering what Harpo's up to.
- Who's Harpo?

735
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,683
That's Hal, Janice's son.

736
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,102
- You have a son?
- You didn't tell us that.

737
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:53,823
You know that song,
"Harpo's Song" by Phoebe Snow?

738
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,118
Because that's the song
you named Harpo after, right?

739
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,955
He's half French-Canadian, Harpo.

740
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,083
All right, Tony,
make fun of a boy because of his name.

741
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,677
I wonder what's French-Canadian for
"I grew up without a mother"?

742
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,603
Sacre bleu,
where is me mama?

743
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,024
Son of a bitch.
You fucking son of a bitch!

744
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,608
- Come on!
- Daddy!

745
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,404
- Daddy!
- You miserable fuck!

746
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,073
I don't got a right to ask?
I'm the boy's uncle.

747
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,992
Easy, sweetie, easy.

748
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,456
Easy, sweetie, easy.

749
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,082
Hate him. I hate him...
