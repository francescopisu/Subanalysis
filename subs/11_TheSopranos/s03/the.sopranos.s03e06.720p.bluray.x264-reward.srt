3
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,248
The guy on 13th street,
I told him, Go see Gigi.

4
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,533
You call Beansie?

5
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,955
Gigi, Beansie?

6
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,334
Us Italians, I think we're the only ones
that use nicknames to that extent.

7
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,214
No, your Chinese.

8
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,290
Nah.

9
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,668
Yeah, this violinist,
Yo-Yo Ma.

10
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,798
"Soubriquet"...

11
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,806
It's another word for nickname.

12
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,801
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,054
What's the matter, hon'?

14
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:58,849
Nothing.

15
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,555
Tony?

16
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,434
How you doing, sweetie?

17
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,067
Good, good.

18
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,611
I took Danny to the doctor
like you said.

19
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,525
My son.

20
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,201
Oh, yeah, yeah, Right, right.

21
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:13,986
How's he doing?

22
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,199
Good, you were right.

23
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,285
Just a chest cold,
not pneumonia, thank god.

24
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,536
Oh, great, great.

25
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,783
I'm glad to hear it.

26
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,625
I made you some bread.

27
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,673
You know, like a "thank you".

28
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,371
You didn't have to do that.

29
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,920
Oh, really, I wanted to,
it's datenut for breakfast.

30
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,091
Listen...

31
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,423
Tracee, right?

32
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,383
The bread's very sweet.

33
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,260
And you're a great girl.

34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,597
Don't take this the wrong way,

35
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,267
But you can't be doing
stuff like this.

36
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:45,855
No good.

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,233
But I just wanted
to say thanks.

38
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,237
I know.

39
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,403
But I already got a family,
they give me gifts.

40
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,903
What we have is
an employer/employee thing.

41
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,286
Can't we be friends?

42
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,165
Well, I'm not so sure
that's such a good idea either.

43
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,246
'Cause, you know,
you and Ralphie...

44
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,165
Yeah, Ralphie.

45
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,749
I'm glad your kid's okay.

46
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,924
Let's go, Betty Crocker.

47
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,722
Bread.

48
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,939
So, Russell Crowe, I mean,
he's trapped, right?

49
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,475
They're gonna
sever off his head.

50
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,935
And he's telling them
how to do it?

51
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,989
I know, and then he yanks the sword
from that dude.

52
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,239
That was so phat.

53
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,034
What about when the guy gets
hit with that spike thing

54
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,573
And chunks of his head
go flying?

55
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,448
Enough already.

56
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,871
We're making conversation here.

57
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,198
People are trying to eat.

58
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,119
Thank you.

59
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,414
Why do you let him
watch this garbage?

60
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,080
"Erin Brockovich",
that was a nice one.

61
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,710
I didn't care for it.

62
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,466
You did too,
what are you talkin'?

63
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,216
See who that is.

64
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,382
Since when did
I become the butler?

65
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,851
It's probably Jackie JR.,
he locked himself out.

66
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,436
No accountability, this kid.

67
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,514
What, people forget their keys.

68
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,599
There he is...

69
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,150
Fresh Prince of New Jersey.

70
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,652
Hey.

71
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,271
How you doing?

72
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,323
Don't get up, Don't get up.

73
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,483
I'll fix you a plate.

74
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,076
Sit down,
have something to eat.

75
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,408
No, I can't, Dino Zerilli's
out in the car.

76
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,664
You sure, something quick?

77
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,412
Why don't you go bring him in?

78
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,458
Next time.

79
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,248
I'll leave them in the mailbox.

80
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,746
That's alright,
we'll use my set.

81
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,292
I'll put them on the counter.

82
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,207
What am I,
the invisible man here?

83
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,458
Hey.

84
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,173
Hey, man, your sister around?

85
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,387
She decided to stay
at school and study.

86
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,175
Any message?

87
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,969
No, just, you know, hello.

88
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,933
Alright, I'm gonna
hit the road.

89
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,802
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

90
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,970
Stay out of trouble.

91
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,638
So handsome.

92
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,806
Good kid.

93
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,857
Little pig-headed,
if you ask me.

94
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,692
Every advantage, this kid.
College, good home life.

95
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,567
I had to quit school
when I was in 11th grade

96
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,610
To help my mother.

97
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,908
Supposed to be an architect.

98
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,249
So...

99
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,585
When did you first notice me?

100
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,794
I don't know.

101
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,011
"History of film", I guess.

102
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,677
The way you talked, you know?

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,888
Turned around
to see who you were.

104
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,019
And?

105
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,267
Nothing.

106
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,436
What?

107
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,524
Say it!

108
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,608
No, no, no!

109
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,564
Leave me alone!

110
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,187
I'm not gonna stop
until you say it.

111
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,770
Okay, okay, wait.

112
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,489
I thought you
were cute, alright?

113
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,817
Ahh...

114
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,951
I knew it.

115
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,128
<i>Ah, hello?</i>

116
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,427
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,298
I just don't know
where else to go.

118
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,601
You guys hanging out?

119
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,891
We were.

120
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,736
You Okay?

121
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,112
I went over...

122
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,736
To see that movie
over at the student union.

123
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,195
Old, like, horror film
or something, "Freaks".

124
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,954
Tod Browning, 1932.

125
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,457
All these horrible people in it
with pointy heads and stuff.

126
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,626
This one guy had no legs.

127
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,104
He just hopped around
on his hands.

128
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:33,999
Caitlin...

129
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,588
We talked about this.

130
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,799
You can't keep exposing yourself
to things that upset you.

131
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,126
I know, it's just...

132
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,133
Why is other people's pain
a source of amusement?

133
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,093
Caitlin, what the hell
are you doing?

134
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,386
It's just a habit.

135
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,393
Well, stop it, alright?
You're gonna be bald.

136
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,232
It's obsessive compulsive.

137
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,894
I'm gonna head upstairs.

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,482
Don't go on account of me.

139
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,605
I have that
Poly-Sci paper anyway.

140
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,415
Please, don't be mad.

141
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,837
I'm not mad.

142
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,082
It's just you're
really moody, you know?

143
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,795
I think I miss my ferrets.

144
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,839
You gotta snap out
of this, Caitlin.

145
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,391
Maybe you need to
talk to somebody.

146
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,552
Yeah, well, I'm already
taking those buspar pills.

147
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,224
Well, maybe that's not enough.

148
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,146
Where are you going?

149
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,943
To the library.

150
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,619
See you later.

151
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,920
I'm sure coming here has been
a culture shock for her.

152
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,254
I mean, for us,
L.A., New Jersey,

153
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,014
We're kind of used to
the mean streets, you know?

154
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,602
Someone like Caitlin
from Bartlesville, Oklahoma...

155
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,355
New York's probably a little

156
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,060
Overwhelming.

157
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,568
Maybe we should try
and be patient with her.

158
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,364
What?

159
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,321
Nothing.

160
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,402
You're sweet.

161
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,576
Most guys wouldn't
even give a shit.

162
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,741
Well...

163
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,248
I'm not most guys.

164
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,942
Do you have a condom?

165
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,112
Are you okay?

166
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,732
Yeah.

167
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,976
A.J., call
Lindsey Blundetto.

168
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,770
Hi.

169
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,012
Hey, what are you doing home?
Don't you have class?

170
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,433
It's Friday,
only in the mornings.

171
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,817
I got a postcard
from the dentist.

172
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,356
It's time to
schedule a cleaning.

173
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,777
God, I just went.

174
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,867
Smells great, what is that?

175
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,245
It's a bundt cake
for A.J.'s fund raiser.

176
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,992
<i>Nice shoes.</i>

177
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,657
Ls daddy home?

178
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,708
He's upstairs.

179
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,294
What's with you, you seem...

180
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,461
What?

181
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,126
Nothing, I don't know.

182
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,375
Hey, you know what I read?

183
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,716
They're making
a movie with Eloise.

184
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,046
Oh, really,
that should be cute.

185
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:53,248
It's supposed to come out
around Christmas or something.

186
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,514
Remember at the plaza
that time?

187
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,263
That kid who kept
calling her Heloise

188
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,685
And I almost got
in a fight with her?

189
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,103
Yes, that little Spanish girl.

190
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,603
She was so annoying.

191
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,241
I can't believe
you even remember that.

192
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,481
You were like,
nine or something.

193
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,311
Hey.

194
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,189
Hello.

195
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,611
Anyway, so, when it opens,
we are so there, you and me.

196
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,284
I know you're excited to see me,
but try to control yourself.

197
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,703
So...

198
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,114
How is school, what's new?

199
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,372
Caitlin's still a pain.

200
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,083
She cries over
like, everything.

201
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,035
She probably misses
her family, the poor thing.

202
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,587
Thank god for Noah, though.

203
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,304
He's the only one
that can calm her down.

204
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,545
She started pulling
her hair out last night

205
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,963
'Cause she saw a scary movie.

206
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,259
She does it all the time now.

207
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,677
Her scalp is like, all raw.

208
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,800
Oh, my god.

209
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,306
Nothing a straight jacket
wouldn't cure.

210
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,551
Sorry, I forgot,
it's Mr. Sensitivity

211
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,386
Who doesn't have any
problems of his own.

212
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,478
I'm agreeing with you.

213
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,847
Like you have a clue.

214
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,022
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck already?!

215
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,730
Cut her some slack, tony,
she's under a lot of strain.

216
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,322
And you did start this.

217
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,445
Did you see?

218
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,363
How I didn't rise to the bait?

219
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,861
The mulignan?

220
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,283
A lot of good It did me.

221
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,571
Does anybody!

222
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,534
It's still going on!

223
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,985
Whoa, you're on
the poles tonight, honey.

224
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,649
Why the hell's Mandee in?

225
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,985
VIP work, VIP prices.

226
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,277
It's 50 bucks to me,
plus a blow job later on.

227
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,989
You know you're gonna make
at least half a "g" in there.

228
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,665
Oh, look at that.

229
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,425
It's like an ad for
a fucking weight loss center.

230
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,964
Before...

231
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,553
And way before.

232
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,672
This guy ever stop
breaking balls?

233
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,716
Hear what I said, Ton'?

234
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,764
They're like an ad
for a weight loss center.

235
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,640
Before and after.

236
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,601
Come here.

237
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,474
I want to show you
where the horse bit me.

238
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,186
Hi, Tony.

239
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,392
Hey.

240
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,857
Look at this vision.

241
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,442
How you doing, sweetheart?

242
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,995
Hey, Ralph.

243
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,286
I have come to reclaim Rome...

244
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,918
- For my people.
- How you doing?

245
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:35,425
I have come to reclaim
Rome for my people!

246
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,837
I don't get it,
what do you mean?

247
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,093
Fucking "Gladiator", ya fuck!

248
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,674
Oh, the movie.

249
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,721
I didn't see it.

250
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,092
You're an asshole then.

251
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,144
Ho, ho, ho.

252
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,639
What do we have here?

253
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,900
What is this,
a handsome contest?

254
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,192
Ralphie.

255
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,227
Yo...

256
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,527
Behave you.

257
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,646
Hey...

258
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,691
Hey, baby, I was
wondering where you were.

259
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,734
Oh, oh, oh, fucking kiss me!

260
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,911
How many cocks
you suck tonight?

261
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,370
Go on.

262
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,448
Get me a drink.

263
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,288
Skipper!

264
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:12,958
Where's Tony?

265
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,924
Getting his weasel greased.

266
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,875
Oh, your kid brother's here.

267
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,843
Ralphie.

268
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,383
Word to the wise.

269
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,303
I'm just fuckin' around,
breakin' balls.

270
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,591
Yo.

271
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,760
I got a cousin who's a fag.

272
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,854
Oh!

273
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:31,939
Fucko!

274
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,396
This weekend...

275
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,565
Get the video.

276
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,943
There'll be a quiz next week.

277
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,867
They're gonna find this piece
of shit in the trunk someday.

278
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,536
We are all dead men,

279
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,951
As Russell Crowe said, ahh...

280
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,032
Hey, c'mon.

281
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,538
All we can do...

282
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,043
ls choose...

283
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,795
How we die!

284
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,590
That fucking hurts!

285
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,757
Nah,

286
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,843
All that fat?

287
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,841
He's out of control,
this oobatz.

288
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,261
Hey, Ralph.

289
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,976
C'mon, man.

290
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,226
Alright, c'mon.

291
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,977
Put it down, Ralphie, c'mon.

292
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,774
I am father...

293
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,686
To a murdered...

294
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,316
Son, husband.

295
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,108
Ralphie!

296
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,272
Murdered wife.

297
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,532
My vengeance.

298
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,910
Jesus Christ!

299
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,037
Goddamnit!

300
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,247
Ralphie!

301
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,293
C'mon!

302
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,204
The fuck you doing?!

303
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,298
My fucking eye,
I'm blind, I'm blind!

304
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,962
The fuck's the matter with you?

305
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,544
What are you,
hopped up on something?

306
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,924
It was an accident.

307
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,716
What did you do?

308
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,514
Nothing, we were
fucking around.

309
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,309
It was an accident,
stop being such a crybaby.

310
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,836
Take him to the emergency room.

311
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,473
What?

312
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,732
Just take him.

313
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,861
C'mon, pussy boy-

314
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,237
Fucking stunad, this guy.

315
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,408
Did you like the bread?

316
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,030
What?

317
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,323
The datenut bread.

318
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,407
I have recipes...

319
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,960
Hey, sweetheart,
not now, alright?

320
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,974
I was up all night.

321
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,426
You could've called
or something.

322
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,762
Sorry, I didn't realize
I needed your permission

323
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,555
To visit my house.

324
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,474
I'm sorry.

325
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,229
It's just...

326
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,024
I kept having this image
of you in the hospital

327
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,696
With your throat cut.

328
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,523
I appreciate your concern,

329
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,202
But maybe you should focus
on your own problems, okay?

330
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,537
You know, there was
this thing on TV once

331
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,489
About that pilot,
Charles Lindbergh,

332
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,577
And about how his baby
was kidnapped and killed...

333
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,878
Jesus Christ, already!

334
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,583
Don't go.

335
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,915
I'm going to Noah's.

336
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,626
Well, at least
you have a boyfriend!

337
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,433
Now she's got me all wound up.

338
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,893
Put her out of your mind.

339
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,478
Duh, if I could do that.

340
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,603
Maybe we should find her a guy.

341
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,358
Don't you have any friends?

342
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,521
Do you really think I'd subject
one of my friends to Caitlin?

343
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,695
I have an idea.

344
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,693
I think her birthday's
coming up.

345
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,282
Why don't we take her out,

346
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,996
Like to celebrate?

347
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,036
You mean like to live bait?

348
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,126
Get her drunk,
maybe it'll cheer her up.

349
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,712
Please, she's bad enough sober.

350
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,713
I bet I know what
would cheer you up.

351
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,094
Ch, yeah?

352
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,758
What?

353
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,228
Go to the fuse box.

354
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,598
In the cellar, Janice.

355
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,352
So, call the gas company,
what do you want from me?!

356
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,780
You chose to
live there, remember!

357
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,327
Well?

358
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,955
What do you think?

359
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,156
About what?

360
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,916
What am I looking at?

361
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,035
My teeth, I got braces.

362
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,665
What do you want, a parade?

363
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,712
Oh!

364
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,335
What did I tell you
about fraternizing?

365
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,416
I'm not, I was just
showing Tony my braces.

366
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,380
Yeah?

367
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,135
I didn't shell out
three crackers

368
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,054
For you to be
modeling your teeth.

369
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,346
Get to work.

370
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,342
C'mon.

371
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,263
Anything else?

372
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,360
Ralphie's the one sticking her,

373
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,108
Why don't he pay for her teeth?

374
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,822
It's a loan, I'm juicing her.

375
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,449
Usually it's fake tits
they want.

376
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,236
Yeah, well, she don't
need those, that's for sure.

377
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,704
That kid's a thoroughbred.

378
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,615
But, Madonn', those choppers.

379
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,539
A fucking train wreck.

380
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,547
Well, Happy Birthday to us all.

381
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,595
That was a barrel of monkeys.

382
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,426
That guy Jeff
kept staring at me.

383
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,639
What do you think?

384
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,062
You want to check out "smokes"?

385
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,101
I'm a little tired, you know?

386
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,766
Yeah, yeah, right.

387
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,480
It is getting a little late.

388
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,606
Oh, my god.

389
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,443
That is so sad.

390
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,399
The chairs,
the pears, the bears,

391
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,159
The social security cards.

392
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:36,865
C'mon, Caitlin.

393
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,280
We should give her some money.

394
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,825
Caitlin!

395
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,375
Excuse me, miss.

396
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,577
Miss!

397
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,997
Miss!

398
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,708
Oh, my god!

399
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,011
Not bad, chrissy.

400
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,217
Decent week.

401
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,422
Not bad?

402
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,681
I'm running ragged here.

403
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,262
If I wanted to work
18 hours a day,

404
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,684
I could get a job at Denny's.

405
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,980
Like they'd fucking hire him.

406
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,732
What, are you crying?

407
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,146
Keep <i>it UP...</i>

408
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,144
I'll give you
something to cry about.

409
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,326
Watch the braces, honey.

410
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:25,001
God, it was so horrible.

411
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,999
It's over, Caitlin, okay?

412
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,292
How can you be so callous?

413
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,462
That was the most
horrific thing ever.

414
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,757
It was a homeless woman with
"The Daily News" up her butt.

415
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:41,305
Every time I close my eyes,
I just keep seeing her.

416
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,178
Oh, my god.

417
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,521
Caitlin, why don't we go over
to the health center?

418
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,730
They'll help you.

419
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,437
They'll give you something
to calm down at least.

420
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,392
No.

421
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,860
No more drugs.

422
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,190
Caitlin, don't start
drinking, c'mon.

423
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,569
Listen...

424
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,948
I have to get up
really early tomorrow.

425
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,371
Josh is on the red eye
from L.A. and...

426
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,461
My friend, Josh, from Crossroads
High School, I didn't tell you?

427
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,837
No.

428
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,166
Sorry, I thought I did.

429
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,422
Anyway, he's coming in
and we're gonna head up

430
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,261
and see his brother
at Hampshire.

431
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,679
Try and get some rest, okay?

432
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,945
Where do you think
she sleeps at night?

433
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,786
Hi.

434
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,626
When did you come in?

435
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,037
Just now.

436
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,756
Sorry, were you sleeping?

437
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,221
It's a good thing we're
paying for that dorm room.

438
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,435
It's Caitlin again,
I can't sleep there.

439
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,562
Forget about studying.

440
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,599
Like you were studying
at two A.M.

441
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,481
Noah and I took her
out for her birthday.

442
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,945
She's all depressed
to begin with

443
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,397
and then she starts
having conniptions

444
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,567
over this homeless lady
in the street.

445
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,490
And how are things with Noah?

446
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,502
He's going up to Hampshire
College with his friend from L.A.

447
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,377
He said he told me about it,
but I know he didn't.

448
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,879
Don't you think that's weird
that he would just do that?

449
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,010
I don't know,
I don't really know him.

450
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,671
And his friend, Josh, I mean...

451
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,427
I guess he's okay.

452
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,092
So, you two are
still dating then?

453
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,427
Is that a problem?

454
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,188
You started this conversation.

455
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,143
The hygienist from
Dr. Maceras called.

456
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,819
You never scheduled
your appointment.

457
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,193
I'm sorry, I forgot,
I'll do it.

458
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,286
And Jackie JR.
Says hello.

459
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,412
Noah's great, but he can
be odd, you know?

460
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:12,584
It's like...

461
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,879
One minute he's all affectionate
and then the next,

462
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,089
he's like a totally
different person.

463
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,888
Meadow, are you in love
with this boy?

464
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,675
I don't know.

465
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,269
I guess so.

466
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,102
At this point, I better be.

467
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,776
At what point,
what does that mean?

468
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,318
Sorry, but we are so not
having that conversation.

469
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:04,883
Tony?

470
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,592
You have a second?

471
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,891
I know you said
we can't be friends,

472
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,969
But there's no one else
I can talk to.

473
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,814
I'm pregnant.

474
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,650
It's Ralphie's.

475
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,649
Congratulations.

476
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,071
I don't know what to do.

477
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,739
He acts like
he doesn't give a shit.

478
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,537
Did you ever think
he's not acting?

479
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,285
Well, what should I do,
should I keep it?

480
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,366
I don't get involved
in affairs of the heart.

481
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,168
But if I have it...

482
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,037
You think he'll
help me support it?

483
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,460
Oh, sure, it'll be
father knows best over there.

484
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,588
Look, you want my advice?

485
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,349
You already got one kid.

486
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,720
Problems with that,
burning him with cigarettes,

487
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,145
Whatever the fuck
you were doing.

488
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,847
I got help for that,
I had a lot of repressed anger.

489
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,807
The county social worker
says it all goes back

490
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,859
To my mom and holding
my hand on the stove...

491
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,356
Whatever, okay?

492
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,939
Your age, your situation,

493
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,908
You need another kid like you
need a fucking hole in the head.

494
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:11,116
You're young, still got your
figure, you're making money.

495
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,455
So, you think I should
get an abortion?

496
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,912
Believe me,
with Ralphie as the father,

497
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,995
You'll be doing this kid and the next
three generations a favor.

498
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,590
Hey, Urban Outfitters
is having a sale.

499
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,630
We're out of syrup.

500
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,465
'Cause you use a whole
gallon at a time.

501
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,133
Shut up.

502
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:32,842
A.J.

503
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,717
You wanna go?

504
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,927
What do you need, shoes?

505
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,227
Shoes, some new tops.

506
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,387
I need underwear.

507
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,605
So, you wanna go or not?

508
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,315
I put your whites
in at 10:30.

509
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,829
I need to wait until
the dryer's free.

510
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,060
Let Lilliana do it.

511
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:43,894
Lilliana's off.

512
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,979
It's gonna be a zoo
by the time we get there.

513
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,926
Meadow here?

514
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,963
She paged me,
she's at her parents.

515
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,263
Oh.

516
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,888
Want to hang out?

517
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,976
I'm writing my paper.

518
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,271
You mind if I just
sit and study then?

519
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,807
I'm fine, really, it's just...

520
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,481
You know, it's creepy
up there alone.

521
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,904
Um...

522
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,444
Alright.

523
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,131
What are we, shod?

524
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,591
Who we missing?

525
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,096
Tracee.

526
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,932
Left sick on Saturday,
haven't seen her since.

527
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,638
For three days?!

528
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,932
Fucking twat.

529
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,829
I talked to my mom.

530
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,456
And she wants me to go
to Vermont this weekend.

531
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,411
For what?

532
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,004
Friends of my dad's.

533
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,798
Paul and lrione Dudley.

534
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,010
Paul's a psychiatry professor
at Dartmouth Medical School

535
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,047
And they have a horse farm
and ride and talk.

536
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,473
Paul's very inspiring.

537
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,809
Sounds good.

538
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,221
I just feel better already.

539
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,731
Irione is an amazing cook.

540
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,934
Now, if I just don't
get freaked out

541
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,815
By the sound of
the pine trees at night.

542
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,612
I'm going to Noah's.

543
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,995
This Moltisanti kid,
he's got his head up his <i>ass.</i>

544
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,409
This is a great
gladiator movie?

545
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,329
Look at Kirk Douglas'
fucking hair.

546
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:10,040
They didn't have flat tops
in ancient Rome!

547
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,343
What do you want
to drink, baby?

548
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,928
Get me a Fresca.

549
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,100
C-fucking-minus
and it's all her fault.

550
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,312
You know, six hours I'm trying
to work and she just won't stop.

551
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,479
Tell me about it.

552
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,692
The questions, the whining,

553
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,236
the crazy goddamn nonsense.

554
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,906
She starts crying about
her economics class.

555
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,650
She doesn't get it, so I give her
my notes from last year.

556
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,577
I'm talking primo notes,
I got an "a".

557
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,072
But even that's a problem.

558
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,581
She doesn't understand
my writing.

559
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,333
"What does this word mean?
Blah, blah, blah, blah."

560
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,411
Nothing's ever enough with her.

561
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,999
I mean, I know
I'm the R.A.

562
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,961
But technically she's not
even on my floor.

563
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,422
C-minus.

564
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,258
Really beautiful, Noah.

565
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,135
It's not that bad, okay?

566
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,890
I want options when
I graduate, meadow.

567
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,271
I'm going to law school
in two short years.

568
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,524
A c-minus
is fucked for me.

569
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,396
It's early in the semester,
you'll make it up.

570
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,664
Is that alright, honey?

571
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,249
Fine.

572
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,213
You know I take
care of you, right?

573
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,799
You, Danny.

574
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,600
Our gorgeous little baby.

575
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,018
Who's that?

576
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,263
How the fuck should I know?

577
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,065
Ralphie, open up!

578
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,772
Ah, shit.

579
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,281
Ralphie!

580
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,870
Where's tracee?

581
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,417
She's busy.

582
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,002
Hey, Sill.

583
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,287
Put your shoes on!

584
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,964
Oh, what'd I say?

585
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,882
I don't know,
what'd you fuckin' say?

586
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,001
Three days she missed work.

587
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,379
I've been sick, Sil.

588
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,546
Ch, yeah?

589
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,132
I called your house.

590
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,596
Your mother says you haven't
been there for two days either.

591
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,552
I was here,
Ralph's taking care of me.

592
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,889
You got a little kid at home!

593
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,270
Her mother's watching him!

594
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,189
Mind your fucking
business, Ralph!

595
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,735
Oh, where do you get
the balls to come here?

596
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,358
Three grand
this cunt's into me,

597
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,608
And where do I get
my fucking balls?!

598
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,954
Go on, get out of here.

599
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,032
Let's

600
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,668
What's the matter
with you, huh?!

601
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,583
You know how many
girls would kill

602
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,876
for the opportunity you've got?

603
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,176
What, working for you?

604
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,629
Oh, go ahead, keep it up.

605
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,796
Give me a break,

606
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,256
In two seconds I could
get a job at any other...

607
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,476
Listen to me,
you little boochiac'.

608
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,349
Until you pay what you owe,

609
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,346
that shaved twat of yours
belongs to me!

610
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,727
You understand?!

611
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,567
I asked you a question.

612
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,149
Yeah, now, get in the car.

613
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,374
And then I go to pour the milk
and the carton is empty.

614
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,294
I keep telling you,
it's not me, it's A.J.

615
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,416
Nice try, mister.

616
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,963
How about the football trance?

617
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,378
I swear to god, we can have
an entire conversation,

618
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,302
But if that TV's on, he's not
hearing a word I'm saying.

619
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,762
One time this happened.

620
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,259
Forget it, gab,

621
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,931
You might as well be
talkin' to the furniture.

622
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,639
Well, that's because men have
the attention span of children.

623
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,474
Sorry, honey, what'd you say?

624
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,558
This cake, Rosalie.

625
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,521
Really, R0, delicious.

626
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,689
The whole meal.

627
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,279
I'm glad we could reciprocate.

628
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,655
Hey, college boy, how's school?

629
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,073
Good, you know.

630
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,829
Crackin' the books.

631
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,247
Almost dean's list.

632
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,666
What's this, almost?

633
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,039
Give me his name,
no more almost.

634
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,045
I'm going out.

635
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,714
I'll probably end up
staying at Bobby's.

636
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,086
No drinking and driving.

637
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,793
C'mon, he knows
better than that.

638
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,085
Right, tough guy?

639
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,800
Yeah, whatever you say, Ralph.

640
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,051
Get lost.

641
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,761
<i>Enjoy your youth.</i>

642
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,430
I'm gonna kill you.

643
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,721
Why didn't you tell me
this place was so fancy?

644
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,015
Calm down, it's just my father.

645
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,646
Believe me, it'll be nothing
compared to meeting your dad.

646
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,696
There he is.

647
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:44,648
Hey.

648
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,325
Hey, dad.

649
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,577
Meadow.

650
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,908
This is my father, Len.

651
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,704
Hello.

652
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,908
Len Tannenbaum, please sit.

653
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,793
How was the flight?

654
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,714
Aside from Tim Daly
chewing my ear for an hour,

655
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,757
It was wonderful.

656
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,672
The guy from "wings",
you know him?

657
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,302
He did his deal for "fugitive".

658
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,301
Usually I enjoy
L.A. to New York.

659
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,840
Five hours
without interruptions,

660
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,971
It's the only time I get
to do some real work.

661
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,225
Unbelievable.

662
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,518
He flies first class,

663
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,806
personal DVD player
with any movie he wants

664
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,307
Never even opens the case.

665
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,788
Bad enough representing
these people,

666
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,607
I have to suffer
through their movies too?

667
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,028
God, it must be so exciting
being an entertainment lawyer.

668
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,988
Get to meet
all the celebrities.

669
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,993
It beats working for a living.

670
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,787
He's in town to
meet with Dick Wolf.

671
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,079
The sportscaster?

672
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,995
Actually, he's a TV producer.

673
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,080
"Special Victims Unit,
Law and Order".

674
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,202
"New York Undercover".

675
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,788
I used to love that show.

676
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,123
Good evening, may I offer you
a cocktail before dinner?

677
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,338
Guys, are we drinking wine?

678
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:50,594
Clos Pegase, the '94
if you've got.

679
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:58,598
So, meadow, what business
is your father in?

680
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,143
Actually, um,
he's in waste management.

681
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,979
Ah, toxic chemicals,
medical waste,

682
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,314
that sort of thing?

683
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:10,196
Yeah, sort of,
environmental cleanup.

684
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:21,374
<i>Let's give a Big Bada Bing
welcome to Tracee.</i>

685
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,480
Hey, that guy cut the line.

686
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,025
What's the matter?

687
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,533
I told Caitlin if we went
to the movies I'd call her.

688
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm starting to feel bad.

689
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,625
I stopped feeling bad
the second I saw that grade.

690
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,838
Did I tell you my father's filing a
restraining order against her?

691
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,418
What?

692
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,172
You're kidding, right?

693
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,087
You obviously
don't know my father.

694
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,640
He totally freaked when
he heard about the C-minus.

695
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,514
Well, I mean...

696
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,555
Couldn't you try
talking to her first?

697
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,390
At this point?

698
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,393
She thinks we're her friends.

699
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,978
Well, you have to set limits.

700
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,563
The girl was ruining our lives.

701
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,316
Think about it, we couldn't do
anything without her horning in.

702
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,111
We certainly couldn't
take her to see this.

703
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,714
Mrs. Custer
grabs the artist,

704
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,468
"Oh!

705
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,879
"I tell you I want a painting

706
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,182
"Commemorating my husband's
last thoughts,

707
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,144
You give me cows with halos
and Indians making love?”

708
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,809
"Mrs. Custer,"
he says.

709
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,689
"Those are your husband's
last thoughts."

710
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,063
"Holy cow,

711
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,900
look at all
those fucking Indians."

712
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,790
Oh, what, not even a hello?

713
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,700
Fuck you, asshole.

714
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,370
Oh, that's nice, very nice.

715
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,331
That's how you talk to a man
in front of his friends?

716
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,503
Yeah, right.

717
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,167
What man?

718
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,550
Oh, a double.

719
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,675
You tell him, sweetie.

720
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,472
I like this girl!

721
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,550
Women, women, women.

722
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,893
Why was I born handsome
instead of rich?

723
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,908
Leave me alone.

724
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,494
What's the matter with you?

725
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,579
What are you being
like this for?

726
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,702
Fuck you, three days you don't
call even to see how I am.

727
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,084
Baby, I'm busy, I gotta work.

728
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,503
How else am I gonna
take care of you

729
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,789
when you're
nine months pregnant?

730
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,925
You serious?

731
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,298
Of course I'm serious.

732
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,475
We'll get a little house...

733
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,432
In a cul-de-sac.

734
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,265
I know that guy
who's a mortgage broker.

735
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,892
Really?

736
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,483
Ralphie, I love you.

737
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,864
I love you too, baby.

738
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,117
Hey...

739
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,078
If it's a boy...

740
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,032
We'll name him after me.

741
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,374
If it's a girl, we'll name it
Tracee after you.

742
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,797
This way she can grow up
to be a cock sucking slob

743
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,378
just like her mother.

744
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,712
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

745
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,342
Guinea motherfucking
piece of shit!

746
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,347
That's right, that's right,
get it all out.

747
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,345
Get it all out,
you little whore.

748
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,278
That make you feel good?

749
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,614
You feel like a man?

750
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,529
Look at you now.

751
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,011
Oh...

752
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,431
Give me a fucking drink.

753
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,596
What happened to you?

754
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,229
Tracee.

755
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,105
She slipped.

756
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,066
We were arguing, I don't know.

757
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,152
She fell.

758
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,364
Holy fucking shit.

759
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,497
Get a sheet, Chrissy,
cover that up.

760
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,207
Where is he?

761
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,007
Inside.

762
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,460
Go get him.

763
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,435
She fell?

764
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,732
That's my story.

765
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,067
You stupid motherfucker!

766
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,443
How fucking dare you!

767
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,857
Take it easy.

768
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:25,950
You don't think.

769
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,406
You disrespect this place.

770
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,739
That's the reason why
you were passed the fuck over.

771
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,870
It's my fault she's a klutz?

772
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,752
Motherfucker!

773
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,255
Are you out of your fucking mind
layin' your hands on me?!

774
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,597
He's the boss of this family!

775
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:49,967
Shut the fuck up!

776
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,176
I'm a made guy!

777
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,356
Ton', we gotta
get you out of here.

778
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:57,895
Is this place open?

779
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,017
No!

780
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,477
Get the fuck
out of here, Ralph!

781
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,909
Keep that back door locked!

782
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,744
And get her the fuck
out of here.

783
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,288
You got a rug,
a piece of carpet?

784
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,701
Cocksucker was way out of line.

785
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,037
20 years old, this girl.

786
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,623
That too.

787
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,337
Let's go.

788
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,160
What?

789
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,000
I think we need to talk.

790
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,969
I think that maybe we've been
seeing too much of each other.

791
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,053
And?

792
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,681
I don't know.

793
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,433
I mean...

794
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,722
I really like you, meadow.

795
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,518
It's just...

796
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,524
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

797
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,489
Are you breaking up with me?

798
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,570
Are you really that surprised?

799
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,620
Why, I mean...

800
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,501
Things were going so good.

801
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,082
Look, honestly,

802
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,289
You're too negative.

803
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,716
It's like you have
this underlying cynicism

804
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,545
about everything.

805
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,586
What are you talking about?

806
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,884
I really didn't
want to get into this.

807
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:12,950
So...

808
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,027
Things are better then?

809
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,659
Since our first session?

810
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,382
Yes, I guess.

811
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,502
We seem to talk more easily.

812
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:40,099
Sometimes even painful sessions
can break the log jam.

813
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,017
Yes.

814
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,277
And then this.

815
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,860
You're being
particularly quiet today.

816
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,450
Sometimes I got nothing to say.

817
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,372
Anthony.

818
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,081
Carmela is here.

819
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:05,795
She's giving up her time to
talk about your panic attacks.

820
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,589
A young man who...

821
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,056
Worked for us...

822
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,097
Baronet sanitation, he...

823
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,271
He died.

824
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,015
Who?

825
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,351
You don't know him.

826
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,940
He died, that's all.

827
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,536
Work-related death.

828
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,962
It's sad when they go so young.

829
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,862
How was the dentist?

830
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,166
God, is there nothing
to eat in this house?!

831
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,187
Who knows, maybe she quit.

832
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,520
I heard she went outside with
Ralphie and never came back.

833
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,064
Do yourself a favor,
keep what you hear to yourself.

834
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,865
Parties are usually
Friday night.

835
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,113
A lot of high rollers,
a lot of big tips.

836
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,823
You want in the VIP room?

837
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,655
It's 50 bucks to me
plus a blow job later on.
