3
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,450
This is so amazing!

4
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,914
Hey.

5
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,419
Oh, my God. How you just said "hey"
to me? You are so nice.

6
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:07,129
I mean, I knew that the first day
you saw me. Hug me.

7
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,007
Try it.
I'm so not depressed anymore.

8
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,800
Try What?

9
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,968
Ecstasy!

10
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:19,603
- Where did you get it?
- Your friend.

11
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,936
- What the fuck is he doing at Columbia?
- He's fucking cute!

12
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,902
Our families are friends.
I've known him forever.

13
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,655
You like that?

14
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,866
I choose you.

15
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,661
Having fun?

16
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,001
- Not as much as Caitlin.
- You see her look at me?

17
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,550
The lid. From Okla-fucking-homa.

18
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,672
- You're in a frat now?
- Rutgers chapter.

19
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,344
I came up here to see you.

20
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,430
Got any more X?

21
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,976
For you, the first hit's free.

22
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,237
- Just don't tell your dad.
- I don't even talk to him anymore.

23
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,417
Read them and suck my dick! Yes!

24
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,452
Yes, baby!

25
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,126
30 times, right there,
that's mine.

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,874
He still got the dice?

27
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:32,179
- I own these fucking dice.
- You're making me a rich man, Ralphie.

28
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,350
The boss.

29
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,891
- Hey, how are you?
- What can I get you guys?

30
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,903
Fucking <i>faccia di</i> merda,
he don't say hello?

31
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,659
What's this, a new suit?

32
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,915
Hey, how are you?
How you doing?

33
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,540
- What's wrong? The Skip's here.
- I'm on a roll.

34
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,873
You'll be on a slab, you keep it up.

35
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,092
- Hey.
- Hey, Ton.

36
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,428
I'm sorry, this fucking guy...

37
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,568
Hello, Anthony.

38
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,575
You look good.

39
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,079
Want a drink?

40
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,877
Another time, Anthony.

41
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,044
Another time.

42
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,145
Let's whack this cocksucker
and be done with it.

43
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,776
I'm here to enjoy myself.

44
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,534
I'm so fucking hard.

45
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,666
No, Jackie, don't.

46
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,005
Meadow. Meadow, wake up.

47
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,717
I'm so sleepy.

48
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,977
You drank too much fucking tequila.
Come on, I can't stop now.

49
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,558
- "Another time, Anthony"?
- Cocksucker turns his back on me?

50
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,686
- Couldn't believe it.
- I could have shot him.

51
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,390
Don't be surprised if
Paulie pops the question.

52
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,609
Ralphie's star is rising.

53
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:37,022
All those unions. Paulie can't
come near that kind of cash.

54
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,031
- Ralphie's a good earner.
- Guy like that? Loose cannon.

55
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,742
He'll pull a Jack Ruby on you.

56
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,252
- Why did I have to punch this asshole?
- I was a little surprised.

57
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,040
Are you gonna start on me now?
He disrespected the Bing.

58
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,759
So? He's barred from the place.

59
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:05,218
- He bashed that poor girl's brains in.
- I hear you. I know.

60
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,808
It was a tragedy.
The fact is though...

61
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,726
she was not related to you.
She was not your goomar.

62
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:19,612
Ralphie's a made guy. All things
considered, he has a legitimate beef.

63
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:26,451
Make him disappear. Or make nice.
You only got two choices.

64
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,830
- I would suggest an apology.
- Absolutely fucking not!

65
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,208
Do something to show
there's no bad blood.

66
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,257
Give him...
Give him a piece of the casino.

67
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:46,600
We're with New York on that. I don't
want him close to Johnny Sack.

68
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:51,685
You could bump him up to captain.
It's what he's been wanting, you know.

69
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,975
Ralphie, a fucking captain?

70
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,396
Over my dead body.

71
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,159
Thank you.

72
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,830
You see that shit before?

73
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,877
Tony's face when I turned down
that drink. Buy me a drink? Fuck you.

74
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,622
He knew it was wrong what he did.

75
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,507
He's the boss.
He can do what he wants.

76
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,840
Boss or no,
you don't hit another made guy.

77
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,514
Joe Mo from Mulberry Street.
Exact same situation.

78
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,851
He smacked a guy from Bergen.
Huge problem.

79
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,852
Of course. Rules are rules,
otherwise what? Fucking anarchy.

80
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,188
He owes you an apology.

81
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:41,863
With the money I put in his pocket,
the prick should hit his knees.

82
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:47,119
What? You think I'm afraid
of that fat fuck? No offense.

83
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,907
I could see if it was
his daughter or a niece.

84
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,247
But all this over some dead whore.

85
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,041
- He had to be fucking her.
- No. He knew you were.

86
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,922
That's why, that's how he is.
Like a dog with two bones.

87
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:11,055
I'm supposed to go to Tony's
for Thanksgiving. Me and Ro.

88
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,812
- Really?
- Fuck him and his turkey.

89
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,059
I ought to shove
a drumstick up his <i>ass.</i>

90
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,735
Look who I caught sneaking in.

91
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,157
My parishioners won't understand
I'm here to help feed the hungry.

92
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,247
- Reverend.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

93
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,543
Who needs it?

94
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,748
Turkey, pumpkin pie?
You gotta love it.

95
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,838
You never lived through
the Y.O. version.

96
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,842
- Major antipasti first.
- Then soup.

97
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,969
Meatballs and scarole,
then the baked manicotti.

98
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,729
- Then the bird.
- Oh, I love manicotti.

99
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,434
- Turkeys are here.
- There's some in here too.

100
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,113
Turkeys got no sense of direction.

101
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,992
They're on their way to Food Emporium
and now look.

102
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:15,742
What's this about Ralph?
He refused to have a drink with you?

103
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,454
So?

104
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:23,461
He refused because he's a
despicable fuck that I bitch-slapped.

105
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,793
That sounds like a problem.

106
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,882
- Happy Thanksgiving to you.
- Yeah, you too.

107
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,970
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- That mine? Beautiful.

108
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,767
- Look at that. Oh, shit!
- What's the matter?

109
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,148
That asshole's coming
to Thanksgiving with Rosalie.

110
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,154
- He won't show.
- I'm gonna give him the option?

111
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,487
Cocksucker shouldn't be there
in the first place.

112
00:10:54,946 --> 00:11:00,999
Honey, I know you don't like
to be pinned down...

113
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:06,754
but Thanksgiving, it would be nice
to tell Carmela if you're coming.

114
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:12,680
- Who's gonna be there?
- Besides us? Carm's parents.

115
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,971
Great. How about Meadow?

116
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,556
- So who's coming this year?
- You know. The usual.

117
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:26,854
Nana, Grandpa, Chris and Ade. Janice
is bringing someone from her church.

118
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:32,743
<i>- Aunt</i> Ro and <i>Uncle</i> Ralph.
- Jackie's probably not coming, right?

119
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,825
- Why?
- Can't I just ask anything?

120
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,374
- All right.
<i>- I'll</i> see you Thursday.

121
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,372
All right, bye.

122
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,092
- Hello?
- Hey, Carm, it's Ro.

123
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:54,465
That's weird. Meadow just asked
if Jackie was coming for Thanksgiving.

124
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:59,561
Oh, really? Jackie just asked me
about her. My radar's up.

125
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,688
You and those romance novels, Rosalie.

126
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,395
Can you imagine the beautiful
children those two would make?

127
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,234
Remember what we said?

128
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,737
We said a lot of things.
Concentrate on your almond torte.

129
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,577
<i>- I'm looking for the recipe.</i>
- All <i>right. Bye.</i>

130
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,080
Here's the turkey.

131
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:32,219
Oh, my God. It's huge.
That's good. I'm feeding an army.

132
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:37,099
Not as many as you think.
Call Rosalie and cancel with them.

133
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,805
- Thanksgiving? Why?
- Just do it.

134
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,516
- Enough of this shit.
- I just talked to her. What do I say?

135
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:50,441
Fine, I'll call. But my excuse
won't be nearly as nice as yours.

136
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,529
Goddamn it, Tony.

137
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,787
What, your stomach still?

138
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,540
Dr. Akavi?

139
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,135
Gloria Trillo, Globe Mercedes.

140
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,966
Listen, a pre-owned,
2001 S600 just came in.

141
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,847
You're the first person I thought of.

142
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,314
Wood trim package,
GPS, with everything.

143
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,150
Only 7500 miles.

144
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,690
I don't think it's gonna last
till Saturday.

145
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,030
Tomorrow? Great.

146
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,574
No, I'm sorry. I can't.
We're doing a sales meeting at lunch.

147
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,578
Okay. See you. Bye.

148
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,015
- Waiting for somebody?
- Got an appointment...

149
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,472
Did she double-book us?

150
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,605
I had to reschedule
because of the holiday.

151
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,570
This is when I usually come.

152
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,702
I'm trying to quit smoking.

153
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,745
Serial killer.

154
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,285
I murdered seven relationships.

155
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,541
Hey, why don't
you take my appointment?

156
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:35,376
- I couldn't do that.
- Lt'd be my good deed for the day.

157
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,930
Flag on the play.
I'm pretty sure you said Tuesday.

158
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:46,224
- I did?
- I'll come back next week. No problem.

159
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:51,438
- She can have my appointment.
- It is hard getting away from work.

160
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,146
See?

161
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,819
I could see you tonight at 7?

162
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,785
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

163
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,704
How hard was that?

164
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,092
- Hello?
- Ro, <i>it's</i> Carm.

165
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,969
This is short notice but I just
got off the phone with Ma.

166
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,434
- What's the matter?
- It's <i>my dad.</i>

167
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,941
They had some troubling test results.

168
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,946
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, <i>I</i> know.

169
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,070
<i>They have to do further testing.</i>

170
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,779
Ma wants a quiet Thanksgiving.
Just the two of them, but...

171
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,118
They should be with family.

172
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:54,709
- I feel awful giving so little notice.
- I wish I could do something.

173
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,084
<i>That is so sweet. I'll let you know
when I know anything.</i>

174
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,841
Okay. Take care, sweetheart. Bye.

175
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,472
All right. Bye-bye.

176
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:15,108
Carm's father, he's sick.
She had to cancel Thanksgiving.

177
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:27,329
- It's 3 a.m. and barn! Come wide awake.
- Something specific?

178
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,954
It's a management problem.
A situation with an underling.

179
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:37,836
Now it's partly my fault. But he never
should have done what he did.

180
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,422
What was it?
Could you tell me that?

181
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,762
Caused the...

182
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,015
early retirement...

183
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,972
of somebody else.

184
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,854
Particulars aren't important.
He fucked up.

185
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,072
Now, ordinarily I would,
you know, put him out to pasture.

186
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,989
But he's a very valuable
piece of manpower.

187
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:11,073
Is it complicated
by a personal relationship?

188
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:21,333
Been reading that book
you told me about.

189
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,716
<i>The Art of War by Sun Tzu.</i>

190
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:33,854
Here's this guy, a Chinese general,
wrote this thing 2400 years ago.

191
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,556
And most of it still applies today.

192
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,397
Balk the enemy's power.
Force him to reveal himself.

193
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,526
I have to ask.
Are you in any sort of danger?

194
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,488
No, no. Can I go on?

195
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,204
Most of the guys I know
read Prince, Machiavelli.

196
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:58,253
And I had Carmela go and get
the Cliff Notes once. It was okay.

197
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,167
But this book is much better
about strategy.

198
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:15,103
I wanted to ask you about
the girl that was here today.

199
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:19,357
- The Mercedes saleslady.
- I'm sorry about the confusion.

200
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,856
- What does she need a shrink for?
- I can't talk about another patient.

201
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:30,444
Just... it makes you wonder,
that's all.

202
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:47,002
Listen, it's after-hours. It's dark.

203
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,046
You want me to walk you to your car?

204
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,635
No, thank you.

205
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,144
I have some work
I have to catch up on here.

206
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,198
Anyone for a turtle?

207
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,447
Aaron. Honey?

208
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,454
What?

209
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,625
- Who's winning?
- Like you know who's playing.

210
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,625
It so happens I do.
Detroit plays every Thanksgiving.

211
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,925
What a shame Barry Sanders retired.
He's a real sweetheart.

212
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,013
A.J., did you tell them
how I served him at Kenny Rogers?

213
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:36,847
- Colonel Sanders.
- No. At Kenny Rogers. Barry Sanders.

214
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,645
Yeah, she served him.

215
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,645
Yes!

216
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,237
Hey.

217
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,248
Yeah!

218
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,589
- Hey.
- Hey.

219
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,050
You know I love you more than
anything in this world, right?

220
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,678
What are you talking about?

221
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:25,233
I know things haven't been
so good with us lately. It's just...

222
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:31,106
- If anything happened to you...
- Everybody, come on! Dinner!

223
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,073
Go ahead.

224
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,413
This turned out to be
a blessing in disguise.

225
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,914
My two boys.

226
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,873
I was worried about the gravy, but...

227
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,095
You okay?
You hardly touched your manicotti.

228
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,390
I'm fine. Christ, how many times?

229
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:01,769
Jackie, you don't have to stay
for dessert if you don't want to.

230
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,769
- A little manners, huh?
- What'd she just say?

231
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:11,438
It's okay. Go see if Meadow wants
to go to a movie or something.

232
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,197
Sure, Ma.

233
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,946
Good dinner.

234
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,329
I'll tell you a trick.
Break off a piece of a match...

235
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,628
in the screw hole
so the threads grab.

236
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:33,669
- I used Elmer's and it still fell out.
- Forget about it.

237
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:47,269
Narcolepsy is an ASDA-certified
dyssomnia. It's no picnic.

238
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,602
Almost time for turkey sandwiches!

239
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:56,824
- I'll put more coffee on.
- Oh, my God, who could that be?

240
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,907
- It's the Boston Strangler. Jesus, Ma.
<i>- I'll</i> get it.

241
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,824
Hey-

242
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,992
Hey.

243
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,957
Jackie, hi.

244
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:14,380
I guess you know everybody here
except Aaron, Janice's friend.

245
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,379
- Hi, Aaron.
- Have you heard the good news?

246
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,343
- He is risen.
- Sit. We're gonna have sandwiches.

247
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:29,312
I already ate. I just figured I'd see
if Meadow wanted to do something.

248
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,771
See a movie, whatever.

249
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,856
Sure. I was gonna go to Hunter's.
You wanna go?

250
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,861
- Whatever.
<i>- I'll</i> be down in a sec.

251
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,080
A Soprano and an Aprile.

252
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,336
So how's school?
Everything good, right?

253
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,039
Yeah, GPA's up this quarter.

254
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,927
Why don't you just bag
and come to Dov's?

255
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,055
Hunter's expecting me.

256
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:26,914
We can hang out all weekend.
We wouldn't have to do anything.

257
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:32,079
I have to study.
Don't you have midterms too?

258
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,920
- I don't even go anymore.
- What? Why?

259
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:41,342
Organic chemistry?
Nucleotides and shit?

260
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,802
You wanna know what I'm interested in?
Men's fashion.

261
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,847
Not the faggy part of it,
but, like, to be Hugo Boss.

262
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,775
Did you ever think
of applying to F.l.T.?

263
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:00,691
Come on, come to Dov's.
I wanna be with you so bad.

264
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,110
I can't, Jackie.

265
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:08,948
What?

266
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,618
You won't go with me
but you'd go with that black guy?

267
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,837
It's not that I don't want to go.

268
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,211
I've been hurt.

269
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,462
Just give me some time, okay?

270
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,659
As <i>street corners are heaps
of crumbled wrath and masonry.</i>

271
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:48,992
<i>- Darling Christmas gift...
- Three shuttles remain</i> now...

272
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,162
It makes me crazy.

273
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,545
Rosalie, all of them,
they're already hiring the caterers.

274
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:02,302
We married young, but those two,
emotionally they are much younger.

275
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:07,348
<i>Until then, here's how
you'll get your thrills:</i>

276
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,977
<i>The Mercedes-Benz coupes
and convertibles.</i>

277
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,020
Earth to Tony.

278
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,017
Thinking of getting one of those.

279
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,519
What, a Mercedes?

280
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,651
Go ahead. It's a cute car.

281
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:29,203
Did you hear?
T disinvited Ralph to Thanksgiving.

282
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,031
- No shit.
- Madonna.

283
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,533
Tony sees the big picture.

284
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,162
Oh, little Paulie.

285
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,207
- This prick treating you okay?
- No complaints.

286
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:46,675
Little Paulie, everybody,
I'm gonna buy you an egg cream.

287
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,218
Come on, sit down.

288
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:03,195
So how are things going over there,
you know, with our friend?

289
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,899
- They're the same.
- What's he saying about me?

290
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,735
To me? Nothing.
He knows better.

291
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,322
He's still breaking my balls though
about taking orders from me.

292
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,491
Plus now, with you and him,
and all that other shit there.

293
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,747
It's your job to make my job easier.

294
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:23,208
I'm not complaining. You asked me.
He's a frustrating guy.

295
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,758
I don't know how things
are gonna go.

296
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,764
He might not go away.

297
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:35,845
It's not just him. This Freon deal.
We're renovating at the house.

298
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,057
I got two kids going to college.

299
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,899
Hey, hang in there.
You're doing a good job.

300
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:04,089
Did you see those bags?
Fucking stress is killing him.

301
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,541
Yeah.

302
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,470
Maybe he wants my fucking job.

303
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:15,510
<i>- -Third-year Randy Moss. It's a matter
of honor, because everyone in Texas...</i>

304
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,896
- Sure you don't want to eat?
- No, thank you.

305
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,982
Johnny, please, don't get up.

306
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,690
I'm off to physical therapy, hon.

307
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:30,908
Used to be some hoofer, poor thing.
Takes a terrible toll on the joints.

308
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:39,660
- Heard what he did with Thanksgiving?
- It's not good, Ralph.

309
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:45,628
Tell me what I did to this guy.
Turned down a drink? I wasn't thirsty!

310
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,926
Ever since I'm back from Miami,
he's up my ass.

311
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:53,969
I'm earning with three hands here
and he's still not satisfied.

312
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,097
And then he fucking hits me?

313
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:02,557
- He's not leaving me a lot of options.
- Don't talk crazy.

314
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,478
You wanna commit suicide,
pills are a lot easier.

315
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:17,371
What would Carmine say if I wanted to
switch families, come with you guys?

316
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:22,501
- Carmine doesn't know who you are.
- You could tell him.

317
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:28,086
Ralph, listen to me. As a friend,
I know Tony can be difficult.

318
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:32,219
His father was the same.
They need someone to demonize.

319
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,757
New York and Sopranos have
long-standing ties. That won't change.

320
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:42,472
Not for you or anybody else.
You want me to be frank?

321
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,942
- You brought it on you with that girl.
- She was a whore.

322
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,444
She hit me.

323
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,900
And that wasn't my kid
she was carrying.

324
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,531
It was the fucking coke.

325
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,622
I should have never started
with that shit.

326
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,543
Fucking Miami,
it's all over the place.

327
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,464
- Tell Anthony you're sorry.
- I was high, I admit it.

328
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,425
And I'm not doing it anymore.

329
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,761
- "Tony, I'm sorry..."
- What good would it do?

330
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:23,600
- It might save your life!
- He hit me.

331
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,936
He was wrong. Believe me, he knows.

332
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:34,649
- People are laughing behind my back.
- Talk to Tony. He'll make it right.

333
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,659
At this point, how?

334
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,445
I don't know.

335
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,788
Would you take capo of your crew?

336
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,296
No. No, I wouldn't. No fucking way.

337
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,957
Ralph Cifaretto came by.

338
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:56,796
What'd he want? A fully fueled jet
and a safe trip to the pope?

339
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,431
He's scared
since you canceled dinner.

340
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,602
If your opponent is
of choleric temper, irritate him.

341
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,937
- Yeah, well, he wants to apologize.
- Oh, really?

342
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,777
Would that put this to rest?

343
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,695
If it's sincere, it might relieve me
of an unpleasant decision.

344
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:22,496
They're about to break ground
on the Esplanade.

345
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,656
We're talking about millions.

346
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,586
Be nice to have a man in there
who feels appreciated.

347
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,090
It wouldn't hurt to throw him a bone.

348
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,838
Like what?

349
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:42,349
- Capo.
- No fucking way. Never.

350
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,396
You heard what he did.
That poor girl just turned 20.

351
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,900
Capo's what he mentioned.
I threw cold water on it right away.

352
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,029
But she was a whore, Tony.

353
00:30:56,355 --> 00:31:01,737
I don't want to talk about that
ever again. You understand me?

354
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,873
It was just a suggestion.
Keep a happy shop.

355
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:10,620
- You weren't gonna stick your beak in.
- Can't two friends talk?

356
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,297
<i>I talked to him.
He's delighted you wanna see him.</i>

357
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:19,720
Great. He said that? That's great.
That's fucking great news.

358
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,346
What'd I tell you?

359
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,722
The other thing, what's he
gonna do to make that right?

360
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,229
He indicated he's open
to working something out.

361
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:35,441
Thank you. Thank you. Anything.
Thank you, thank you.

362
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:43,285
Oh, Fabian.
Fuck you doing up before noon?

363
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:49,200
- I'm moving out. Over to Dov's.
- Beanie boy?

364
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,412
His reserve unit in Israel
got called up.

365
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,084
God bless America, huh?

366
00:31:56,248 --> 00:32:01,971
Listen, you find yourself
short on X, I know a guy.

367
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,924
- X?
- What?

368
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,473
I'm trying to do you a favor.

369
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:14,313
And that bullshit your future
father-in-law pulled on Thanksgiving?

370
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,105
He knew I had no intention of going.
He's trying to save face.

371
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:23,492
He stooped so low,
he had his wife lie to your mother.

372
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,447
Whatever you need, give me a call.
Be good.

373
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:39,133
The woman is 50 years old. Sometimes
I just wanna scream in her face:

374
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:43,462
"Quit whining! No wonder he left you!"

375
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:49,264
Her supervisor looks at her cross-eyed
and I get a call at 3 a.m.

376
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:55,980
She wants to talk about how her father
used to laugh at her when she was 7.

377
00:32:56,141 --> 00:33:00,817
- Did she call your emergency number?
- That's not the point, Elliot!

378
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,074
Oh, these fucking interruptions.

379
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,490
- I was raped.
- You have feelings, and who listens?

380
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,078
That's right, damn it.

381
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:19,586
I have to sit there and take care
of these people hour after hour.

382
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:24,845
With all their problems.
And some of them are very real.

383
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:31,098
And very serious. And I'm sorry.
I care, I really do.

384
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:37,350
But it's hard sometimes.
I just wanna say, "I hurt."

385
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,062
Good. Sure.
That's why you're here.

386
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,319
I'm sorry, Elliot.

387
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,243
No need to be sorry.

388
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:52,073
You've been through such trauma.

389
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:56,710
It takes tremendous strength
of will and inner resource...

390
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,371
to soldier on as you do at work.

391
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,882
Thank you, Elliot.

392
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:09,675
I try. I really do.
It's just hard sometimes.

393
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:18,315
And Patient Soprano?
How's all that?

394
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:22,107
He offered to escort me to my car.

395
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,527
I almost fell in his arms crying.

396
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,364
Oh, Jesus Christ.

397
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,041
Chris.

398
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,711
- Paulie.
- Ralphie.

399
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,533
You wanted to see me?

400
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,454
- Yeah, Tony.
- About what?

401
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:25,465
About what? You know...

402
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,047
to apologize.

403
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,802
Oh.

404
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,676
Sit down?

405
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:48,109
I was doing a lot of coke.

406
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,988
I said some things
and I did some things...

407
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,279
that I'm sorry for.

408
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,119
It's not gonna happen again.

409
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,620
What'd you do?

410
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,291
I was rude...

411
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,545
when you offered me the drink.

412
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,470
And I disrespected the Bing.

413
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,064
And the girl.

414
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:33,154
That shouldn't have happened.
Like I said, I was doing a lot of coke.

415
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,954
I gave that up.

416
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,242
And end of story.

417
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:48,708
And I'm sorry, Tony. Okay?

418
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,857
Anything else?

419
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,995
- Hey.
- How's it going, Geeg?

420
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,340
- Hey, Geeg.
- My wife made some turkey sandwiches.

421
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,254
- I'm bloated from Thanksgiving.
- Thanksgiving, 1982.

422
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:39,428
Fucking turkey. It's like Spackle
in my bowels. Nothing moves.

423
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,932
- You want some Metamucil?
- No, I hate that shit.

424
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,565
Think I'll try one
with lettuce and cranberry.

425
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,566
- Ralph around?
- No. Want me to call him?

426
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,570
Please. Let's just enjoy
the quiet, huh?

427
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,527
<i>After decades of planning,
ground was broken...</i>

428
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:03,624
on <i>Newark's Museum of Science and
Trucking and Riverfront Esplanade.</i>

429
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:07,127
Oh, hi, Ralphie. Come on in.
He's watching TV.

430
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:11,298
<i>The project was held up
by political infighting.</i>

431
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,292
Nothing. He gave me nothing.

432
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:19,924
Look, the fucking Esplanade.
We'll need bulldozers for the money.

433
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,765
Not a thank you, not an apology.
Nothing!

434
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:28,853
- Calm down, take it easy.
- He let me stand there like...

435
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:33,774
a servant. Scraping. Bowing.

436
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,656
Didn't even ask me to sit down.

437
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,484
- It's part of the game.
- He's going down.

438
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:44,789
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I don't give a fuck any more.

439
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:50,462
I've given my life to this thing.
And this is the thanks I get?

440
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:11,604
- it's Silvio Dante on the phone.
- Tell him I'll call him back.

441
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:16,029
<i>- They're my children, Thorne.
- You seriously cannot be...</i>

442
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,072
<i>I'm so sorry!</i>

443
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,700
You shut the door?

444
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,293
Jesus, you're worse than Bobby.

445
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,664
- Anybody see you come in?
- Yeah.

446
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,256
Fuck them. I don't care anymore.

447
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,047
I brought some leftover turkey
and stuffing.

448
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,760
Keep it. Everything goes through me.

449
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,430
And these drafts.
I should be down in Boca.

450
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,394
Drafts? It's like the fucking
Amazon jungle in here.

451
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,897
- What's the thermostat say?
- Don't touch it!

452
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:04,862
All right. Jesus.

453
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:19,926
Grandpa. Did he ever work
for somebody named Trillo?

454
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:24,931
- He owned a lumberyard?
- Dad was a mason. He didn't cut wood.

455
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:30,145
A contractor, then.
Built garden apartments?

456
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:35,730
There was a guy named Trillo. He had
seven daughters. I can't remember.

457
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,774
I thought you were gonna ask
my advice about Ralph Cifaretto.

458
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:52,163
- Got any thoughts?
- What else do I have left?

459
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:57,293
Real contretemps you have
on your hands here.

460
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:04,471
- You shouldn't have put Gigi in there.
- Strong, good earner, well-respected.

461
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:09,601
Not by that crew. To them he's
a Ghibelline coming over to butt in.

462
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,644
They don't trust him.

463
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,973
Plus, you got Ralph now
pissing in their ears.

464
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,648
Any day, you'll have a mutiny
on your hands.

465
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,944
So I take Gigi out.
What kind of message is that?

466
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:27,703
- That you're unsure of yourself.
- Exactly.

467
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,824
- Who do I replace him with?
- Good question.

468
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:36,377
- Great. What's the fucking answer?
- Who says there is one?

469
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:40,541
That's what being a boss is.
Steer the ship the best you can.

470
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,670
Sometimes it's smooth,
sometimes rocky. In the meantime...

471
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,756
you find your pleasures
where you can.

472
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,266
How much longer, Skip?
I gotta take a leak.

473
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,249
Holy Jesus!

474
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:29,055
What the fuck you looking at?
Call 9-1-1.

475
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,842
I don't feel a pulse.

476
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,900
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you, Tony.

477
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:50,743
He was a good man. Never said
a bad word about anybody.

478
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,823
Thank you, Tony.

479
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,937
It's fucking awful.
He was a young man.

480
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,598
Heart disease.

481
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,977
The silent killer.

482
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,365
Hey, there are worse ways to go.

483
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:34,367
Even still, on the pisciatoio?
Pretty fucking humiliating.

484
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,614
It's how Elvis died.

485
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:42,914
That guy in Hollywood too. Don something.
Producer of The Simpsons.

486
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:52,764
So there's a vacancy.
There's a lot of business to do.

487
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,013
You thought about who it's gonna be?

488
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:36,141
Terrible. It's a terrible thing.
Guy was in here twice a week.

489
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,310
Brought the kids
and everything on Sundays.

490
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,021
Artie. Hey, Ton.

491
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,194
I gotta go rotate my pork shoulder.

492
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,452
- You wanted to see me?
- Sit down.

493
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,222
I'm making you captain.

494
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:23,062
You are? That's great.
That's fucking great.

495
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:28,227
Anthony, you're not gonna be sorry.
Thank you.

496
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,079
What?

497
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:48,747
I need to hear it was merit.

498
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:55,637
And not just because somebody
was constipated and blew a gasket.

499
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:04,929
You're gonna be making a lot
more money. So don't question.

500
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,770
You wanted captain, you're captain.

501
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,482
Thank you, Tony. You're right.

502
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:15,986
I have wanted this so fucking long.

503
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,193
Well...

504
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,822
Well, you know what they say?

505
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,785
Be careful what you wish for,
you just might get it.

506
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,297
So, um...

507
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,003
So we gonna have a drink together
or what?

508
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:12,956
So, what's this shit I hear about Tony
having a fight with Ralph Cifaretto?

509
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,632
On Thanksgiving?

510
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:20,172
- I was there.
- At Tony's? On Thanksgiving?

511
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,717
After dinner. To take Meadow out.

512
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:32,810
- Did you fuck her yet?
- Her body is mad ripe.

513
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:38,023
- Yeah, but did you fuck her yet?
- She's creaming for me, man.

514
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,571
You didn't fuck her yet.

515
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:45,739
I don't know if it's smart.
She's Tony Soprano's daughter.

516
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,157
I'll be right back.

517
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,577
See you.

518
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:54,088
Jackie, come on, Vassar. That band.

519
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,334
- Come on, double or nothing.
- Yeah, rack them.

520
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,513
- You said you were gonna take me.
- Go sit down.

521
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,634
Ha, Ha, Ha.

522
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:10,229
Fucking brat. Meadow!
Goddamn it!

523
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,705
Hey, no!

524
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,122
Meadow!

525
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,208
Oh, my God. Fuck. Meadow!

526
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,759
- Jackie...
- Jesus, Meadow.

527
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,215
- You all right?
- I think so.

528
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,721
- Easy. What's the matter?
- My purse is stuck.

529
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,768
- You guys all right?
- We're fine.

530
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,771
We're fine.
Nobody got hurt. Blew a tire.

531
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,937
- But your car.
<i>- I'll</i> call it in stolen.

532
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:02,107
Oh, my God. Jackie, I am so sorry.

533
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:06,778
As long as you're okay. I don't know
what I'd do if you got hurt.

534
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,788
- You almost died.
- I'm so sorry.

535
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:14,748
- I should have taken you to Vassar.
- You loved that car.

536
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:19,002
It's all right.
Come on, let's get you home.

537
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,169
No. I wanna go with you.

538
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,429
You're sure?

539
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,133
Here's my card.
I'll be here at 10:00.

540
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,010
- Great.
- Nice to meet you.

541
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,174
Great. Nice meeting you.

542
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,265
Hey.

543
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:19,775
- It's you.
- I had my eye on one of these.

544
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,312
You have good taste.

545
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,566
Can I go for a test drive?

546
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:31,488
- You have to go with a sales rep.
- Anybody available?

547
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,493
- Dale!
- Yeah.

548
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:37,331
I'm going out. 600.

549
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,168
Thanks.

550
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,507
Thank you.

551
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,724
Hm-hmm.

552
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,209
Hello?

553
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:28,469
<i>Jennifer, it's Gloria Trillo.
I'm sorry, but I can't make it today.</i>

554
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,095
Everything all right?

555
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:34,972
- Yeah. Yeah, fine.
- All they had was wine coolers.

556
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:43,602
Well, I'm glad you called.
Do you want to reschedule?

557
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:48,239
No. I'll just see you next week
at the regular time.

558
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,781
Okay, I'll see you next week.
