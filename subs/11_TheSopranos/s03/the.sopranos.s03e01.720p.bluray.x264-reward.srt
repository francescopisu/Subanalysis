2
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,202
<i>- So how's your mom, Ton?
- </i> Same.

3
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:38,334
<i>But my ex-goomar's cousin, I got her
to take care of her. Russian girl.</i>

4
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:43,506
<i>Who was telling me the Bevilaqua
kid has money from construction?</i>

5
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:48,211
<i>- Fucking Matthew was never any good.
- He sure cried like a baby.</i>

6
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,888
<i>I think the family was relieved
he got taken out.</i>

7
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,807
<i>What are you gonna eat?</i>

8
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,725
<i>Hey, waiter!</i>

9
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:03,017
That's the closest CW16 got Tony
to discussing the Bevilaqua murder?

10
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,939
I think at this point it's time
to consider 16, Bonpensiero, compost.

11
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:13,945
Bonpensiero was crucial
to the Webistics stock fraud case.

12
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,280
So RICO-wise...

13
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,542
the airline tickets,
mail and wire fraud...

14
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,461
if the mother testifies
for immunity.

15
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,131
Whose own mother's gonna testify?

16
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,839
I say focus on his garbage business.

17
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,924
- Extortion. Interstate trucking.
- It'll yield a prosecutable murder.

18
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,766
Richie Aprile, no doubt about it,
the cartel had him whacked.

19
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,933
But Tony shows diligence
when it comes to debugging.

20
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:49,363
- What about the home?
- They talked in the basement.

21
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,238
His own basement?
Where's the due diligence there?

22
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,577
Tony avoids business at home.

23
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:01,125
He'll take somebody out by the pool.
Except there he fears parabolics.

24
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:07,582
The basement has noisy AC ducts.
He turns on the air and he feels safe.

25
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:14,088
"Surreptitiously enter and leave."
A "sneak and peek" warrant.

26
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,591
- Correct.
- I said you could enter the basement.

27
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,598
Do we have to impact
this family's privacy?

28
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:25,099
First we determine
where to best place the wire.

29
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:30,445
Then the listening device
will be fabricated and we install it.

30
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,362
See that they limit both
entrances to the basement.

31
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,953
<i>It's not</i> a
<i>Better Homes and Gardens</i> tour.

32
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,955
Happy hunting.

33
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:58,466
<i>You know, the coffeemaker's
got to be plugged in for it to work!</i>

34
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,269
Same time as yesterday.

35
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,773
I'm just going to the stationery store.

36
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,857
I'll be right back.
You don't gotta follow me. All right?

37
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:23,203
To drop a wire there's got to be
nobody home for at least two hours.

38
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,159
The maid is gone
on Tuesday afternoons.

39
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,959
- Why?
- Classes to get her U.S. citizenship.

40
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,666
She's gone from 1 till about 2:45.

41
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,674
Class, then she and
her husband have lunch.

42
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,890
He's applying for citizenship too.

43
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,476
What's his name again?

44
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:47,898
- Stasiu Wosilius.
<i>- I'll</i> run that by Anti-Terrorism.

45
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,809
Carmela's gone on Tuesday. Tennis.

46
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:56,194
We need somebody on her and everybody
that's got a key to the house.

47
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,199
Daughter's at Columbia.

48
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,496
Why risk it? She's 45 minutes away.
Put somebody on her.

49
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:07,709
Anyone breaks for home, we need
to warn the team to get the hell out.

50
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:49,039
- Unit 1, Baby Bing headed your way.
- Copy, control.

51
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,153
Unit 2, you got Bada Bing
headed your way.

52
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,283
Excuse me. Unit 3,
Mrs. Bing also in motion.

53
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,945
<i>(sums POP some</i>

54
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:51,563
<i>- Do you have contact of Princess Bing?
- Roger, control.</i>

55
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,861
Unit 4, here comes the maid.
Gray Jetta.

56
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:10,207
S.E. Team, the location's secure.
You have 90 minutes.

57
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,557
Control, we're headed
into the sausage factory.

58
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,527
Oh, Look at this.

59
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,109
- Just in time.
- Set a plate.

60
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,816
You got it.

61
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:30,321
I had him darn it in the shoulder,
like she wanted.

62
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,907
- It shouldn't have torn.
- Beautiful coat.

63
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,961
- What the fuck? Lunch is ready.
- I wash my hands.

64
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,956
- You washed your hands.
- I tied my shoe.

65
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,634
- So what?
- I can't stand touching shoelaces.

66
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:49,214
Ever tie your shoes and notice
the ends of your laces are wet?

67
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,768
- From what? Why would they be wet?
- I got no fucking idea.

68
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,765
- You stand at the urinals...
- Come on, will you?

69
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,858
He's asking, I'm telling.
It's important.

70
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,780
Even if the lace is dry
and you don't touch the shoe.

71
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,483
- Bacteria and virus migrate.
- You see this on TV?

72
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:14,206
I gotta watch TV to figure out the world?
A men's shithouse is a sewer.

73
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:19,123
In ladies' johns, you could eat
maple ice cream from the toilets.

74
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,672
There's exceptions. But a men's?

75
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,678
Piss all over the fucking ﬂoor.
Urinals jammed with cigarettes.

76
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,558
They can pour all the ice they want,
it does nothing to kill germs.

77
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:38,306
- Even if you don't drag the laces.
- Shut the fuck up!

78
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:45,695
Mission control, I'm disabling
the line to the phone company.

79
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,493
Phone line to the alarm
is neutralized. Cut it.

80
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,742
Hold your breath.
I'm clipping the siren.

81
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,833
Pick it, Wilson.

82
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:06,216
<i>Control, we're working on entry.
Estimate three to four minutes.</i>

83
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,150
You're not hungry?

84
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,654
- Have some <i>braciole.</i>
- No, thanks.

85
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,574
I got no appetite.

86
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,784
- Today would've been our birthday.
- "Our" birthday?

87
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,742
Oh, yeah.

88
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,536
Spoons.

89
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,965
- Happy birthday. How old are you?
- 51.

90
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,293
Who came first, you or Spoons?

91
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,796
Philip was my kid brother
by 11 minutes.

92
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,970
Hey, it was a fucking tragedy.

93
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,802
What're you gonna do?

94
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:04,309
- It's the life we chose. Right, Pat?
- But my brother was never a heavy guy.

95
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,278
I mean, he was a sweet, gentle man.

96
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,365
- Your brother was your twin brother?
- Philly.

97
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:19,081
Friends, like us, called him Spoons.
Somebody whacked the kid.

98
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,283
Before you came over.

99
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,835
You big-mouthed fuck! Fuck!

100
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:31,676
- You identical twin? Or the other kind?
- Identical.

101
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,762
Here, have something to eat.

102
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:41,095
There's a twin bond. Unless you
experienced it, you can't understand.

103
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,107
- Okay with onions?
- Maybe it sounds crazy to you.

104
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,778
Hey, nothing sounds crazy anymore.
The older I get...

105
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,614
It's over, right?

106
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:02,328
Don't it happen that twins can
die within days of each other?

107
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:07,746
- That would've been okay, believe me.
- Come on! God forbid!

108
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:14,378
- I miss him so much.
- Well, that's natural.

109
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,970
You're with us. Leave the morbid
shit back at Junior's crew...

110
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,263
and have a happy birthday.

111
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,186
Happy birthday.

112
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:29,777
You wanna commit suicide?
Tie your shoes and have a bite of braciole.

113
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,239
Hey, stonato, it's a joke. Come on!

114
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,451
Hello!

115
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:48,587
- God, don't transfer me now.
- Adriana La Cerva.

116
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,046
How green was my fucking valley.

117
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,085
Carmela!

118
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,837
Hi, Ed.

119
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,679
This is my friend.
Adriana La Cerva, Ed Restuccia.

120
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:06,980
I'm delighted to teach a pal of Carm's.
My most disciplined student.

121
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,020
Perfect muscle tone
doesn't hurt either.

122
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,027
I have to apologize, Carm.

123
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,446
I thought I called everybody.
I won't be teaching here anymore.

124
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,114
- Everything's all right?
- Basically.

125
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:25,825
Kitty got this dot-com job
in San Diego, so we're moving.

126
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,704
- I didn't even know you were married.
- Yeah.

127
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,214
But you're in luck.
Birgit is taking over.

128
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,009
- How wonderful.
- I never even played once.

129
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,712
That's why you're here.

130
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,642
Carm, I was wondering about
letters of recommendation...

131
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:58,357
Kitty's company sells antiques,
so if you wanted a piece...

132
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,574
- No antiques. My house is traditional.
- I'm cutting into your lesson.

133
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,869
- Carmela, bye. Nice meeting you.
- Take care.

134
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,177
Baby Bing is leaving school property.
I'm on it.

135
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,010
- Taking orders.
- Snapple.

136
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,355
- Me too.
- I only got <i>2</i> bucks.

137
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,934
Mrs. Celeste almost saw my board.

138
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:39,110
- "No boards."
- They can't see how useful boards are.

139
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,610
In the cafeteria, each person
could just roll past the food...

140
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,038
- ...and make their decisions.
- Yeah.

141
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,743
That food tastes like <i>ass.</i>

142
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,582
Hit it!

143
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,429
- I had enough for one.
- Give me a hit.

144
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,852
Don't backwash.

145
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:19,483
- I won't do anything for this school.
- Mom's all, "Get involved."

146
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,566
- I am. With boarding.
- It's Egon.

147
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,032
Hey, Kosma!

148
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,151
Okay!

149
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,909
- Where you been?
- Orthodontist.

150
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,663
- What class you ditching?
- Assembly.

151
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,007
- Excellent jersey.
- Yeah.

152
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,218
- Wait. You went out for JV ball?
- Yeah.

153
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,590
Mr. Quadriplegic, remind me
not to visit you in the hospital.

154
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,013
- That is a cool shirt.
- Yeah.

155
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,972
- What position?
- Douche bag.

156
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,201
Okay, cut it!

157
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,640
Y'all should have come.

158
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,937
- Where'd you go?
- We started off at Smoke's, <i>as</i> usual.

159
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,062
But we wound up
at this place, Ruby Foo's...

160
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,407
round Broadway and 65th,
or something.

161
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:51,412
It was so fun.
God, did I get hammered!

162
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:57,620
- Don't you have a quiz today?
- Frosh Week. What do they expect?

163
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:04,422
<i>- I'll</i> study now.
- I have a bio lab. I haven't read it.

164
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,423
- Still miss New Jersey?
- It's only, like, half an hour away.

165
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,101
It's just this transition.
It's a lot of work.

166
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:18,978
New York is an experience
that unalterably changes a person.

167
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:24,153
- It is really great.
- And all this freedom of college.

168
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:38,543
- When did you have your last cocktail?
- 11:30 this morning.

169
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,788
Jesus, Caitlin.

170
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:05,567
- What is the most important right?
- Right to vote.

171
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,480
What is this?

172
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:12,489
Special capers from Italy.
Soprano kids don't like them.

173
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,244
- Who wrote the "Star-Spangled Banner"?
- Martin Luther King.

174
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,495
- Stasiu, you know this.
- I want to eat.

175
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,542
Francis Scott Key.

176
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,624
Fuck his whore of a mother.

177
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:32,342
What holiday was celebrated
by the American colonists?

178
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,178
- Martin Luther King.
- Stasiu!

179
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:40,851
That's answer to number 49.
"Who was civil rights leader?"

180
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,069
- Which sandwich is for you?
- I don't care.

181
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,363
This hostility of yours.

182
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,526
Why do we bother having
our picnics together?

183
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:57,163
Are you so bitter about driving a cab
you have to ruin a beautiful day?

184
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,876
- Ready.
- Start shooting over here.

185
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:12,429
Back in Lodz, I was an engineer
with 20 employees...

186
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:17,551
and a grant from the state
to do autonomous research.

187
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,845
It bores you?

188
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:28,858
Don't take those out.
Put them with capers. I take them home.

189
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,197
They belong to Mrs. Soprano.

190
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,698
They have so much stuff. Tomorrow
I'm taking some champagne glasses.

191
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,625
That's just for Anthony Jr.

192
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,126
- They're expecting WWIII.
- More likely the Colombo wars.

193
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,628
He's got the Black & Decker.
I got one of those.

194
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:04,393
- 120-gallon water heater.
- My house, we shiver after showers.

195
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,643
Wait a minute. Go back.

196
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,529
Look at the brown water, there.

197
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,819
- What, Ike?
- You don't see it?

198
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,449
Creep forward.
Give us some magnification.

199
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,954
That baby's gonna blow.

200
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,371
Tony got about six months
left on that lining.

201
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:31,124
- A shame we can't warn him.
- During his trial we can inform him.

202
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:35,712
Except that's at least a year from now.
By that time, boom!

203
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,765
Okay, now you see that lamp there?

204
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,827
- Is that the C-140 microphone?
- They took sound readings. That's new.

205
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:08,954
They talk where the AC is loudest.
That's where we're placing it.

206
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,359
When's this puppy going in?

207
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,193
Tomorrow.

208
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:04,343
Okay, fellas and gals, our big day.
As I speak I have Baby Bing, on time.

209
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,768
Handing off to you, George.

210
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,730
<i>I'm on Baby Bing's carpool vehicle.</i>

211
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:32,000
Furio Giunta Cadillac returning.
Went past me about five minutes ago.

212
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,669
Der Bingle's up early.
He's in the Cadoo.

213
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,886
- Copied. <i>I</i> got the handoff.
- Roger that.

214
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,952
- How's the stock doing?
- Up three at the close.

215
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,292
- Another two so far today.
- Beautiful.

216
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,208
Listen, Ton,
I think we may have a problem.

217
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,417
Log off. That cookie shit
makes me nervous.

218
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,846
We may have a problem
about our friend, the twin.

219
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,301
Yeah, so?

220
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,593
Joey Fleiss hangs out at The Nest,
in Bloomfield.

221
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,515
- Chip's place.
- Yeah.

222
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:35,687
Our friend is a fixture there.
Joey says he's been into the booze.

223
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,987
He's all fucked up.
They had to pick him up off the floor.

224
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:46,365
Chip went to him. "Pat, what the fuck?
Can I do anything?" Etcetera.

225
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:52,583
Pat launches this diatribe about how
one can smile and still be a villain.

226
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:57,706
And that he knows how his brother
died and who's responsible.

227
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,380
- He mention me by name?
- No. Me neither.

228
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:07,340
- Hearing this?
- How would he know we clipped Spoons?

229
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:11,724
- Twin telepathy?
- Somebody's putting ideas in his head.

230
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:23,447
- Don't let us interfere with your game.
- May be a cop trying to flip him.

231
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,618
Getting him worked up with theories.

232
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,661
- He was talking weird.
- What do we do?

233
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,790
We brought him over from Junior
to keep an eye on him.

234
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,088
So that's what we'll keep doing.

235
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,884
Make no mistake,
part of this guy loves you.

236
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,050
But it's gotta be hard
coming in to work...

237
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:51,430
looking in the eyes of the guy
who had your brother whacked.

238
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,519
And even having to smile.

239
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,439
We always have the option.

240
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,190
Mrs. Bing in motion.

241
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,236
We got the housekeeper
then it's all yours.

242
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:29,138
Hit low to high, Carmela!
And think about your grip.

243
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,465
Fuck!

244
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,802
No, that's good. Nice extension.

245
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:35,681
Ah!

246
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,014
Racket back, Carmela! Come on!

247
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,774
- Fuck.
- No, that's good.

248
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,445
- Shouldn't that housekeeper be out?
- Take a look.

249
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,026
Ow!

250
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,533
Okay, guys, collect.

251
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,833
Ade, let me work with you here.
Carm, you collect.

252
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,218
Maid's car is still here.

253
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:25,733
Okay, let's just focus.
Be serious and follow through.

254
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,697
- Right! Almost.
- Okay.

255
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,199
<i>Oh my God. Oh my God.</i>

256
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:40,247
- Did you hear something?
- I don't know.

257
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:49,669
We think we heard something
from inside the sausage factory.

258
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,595
<i>Hold your position.</i>

259
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:53,968
Okay.

260
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,721
- Stand up straight.
- Okay.

261
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,222
Here you go.

262
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,765
See? Low to high.
All right, I can't do this with you.

263
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,233
- Okay.
- Sorry.

264
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,202
She's leaving the court.

265
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,800
Der Bingle's leaving the Bing too.

266
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,307
Hey, watch it!

267
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:57,237
This does not look good. Mrs. Bing
bearing north on Grand View Avenue.

268
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,330
She's on Boxwood Road.
She's heading toward the factory.

269
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,178
Abort. Repeat, abort!
S.E. Team, get the hell out of there.

270
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:19,009
<i>Abort, Andy. It's not a go.
Repeat, we are not a go.</i>

271
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:41,455
- Must be a crisis with a kid.
- I place Baby Bing in the school.

272
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,831
<i>- Unit</i> 5, report.
- A big Roger from this end too.

273
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:51,170
She went in her room.
She told a friend she was gonna sleep.

274
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:55,003
<i>- Think somebody made us?</i>
- I <i>don't know.</i>

275
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,885
But we're finished for today,
ladies and gentlemen.

276
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:12,529
Ten years. Ten fucking years he said
this thing would last! Motherfuck!

277
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:18,526
- You said that. What are you doing?
- I told you not to put this shit here!

278
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,078
Fuck!

279
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:29,378
- Fuck!
- Never mind that. Save the pictures.

280
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,971
The prom. Look at this. Fucking ruined.

281
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:49,189
- Mr. Ruggerio, thank God.
- The fucking water heater blew.

282
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:53,186
Your guarantee's
gotta be expired by now.

283
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,608
<i>Madonna.</i>

284
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,284
- Do we have any idea what went down?
- No.

285
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,620
- Family emergency.
- Plumber went there.

286
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,745
Look, we don't have any idea
what happened.

287
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,002
So let's not speculate.

288
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,546
We're shit out of luck till Tuesday.

289
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,259
We'll send somebody there
to stake the house out.

290
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,300
Maybe we got a long-term problem.

291
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,094
Well, we're heading back to Quantico.

292
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,726
We got a job in Denver
day after tomorrow.

293
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,512
A mosque.

294
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:41,776
Morning. We'd like to get onto
your property to trim some growth...

295
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:46,075
that's posing a safety hazard
with the power lines.

296
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,408
Okay. Go around the side.

297
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:54,622
Records show our repair department
had some crews here yesterday.

298
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,552
- Were you affected by the shortfalls?
- Yesterday?

299
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,013
No.

300
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:04,548
Oh.

301
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:10,980
The people next door had some trucks
go up there. But, no, we're fine.

302
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:15,692
How about them? Do you know
if everything's okay over there?

303
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,437
As far as I know.

304
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:23,405
- Well, we'll go talk to them.
- Probably you should.

305
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,120
- They're in the M...
- Pardon?

306
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,876
Nothing. They're different.

307
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:37,582
For this neighborhood,
they're different, that's all.

308
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:42,006
- Well, we'll get busy in the back.
- Thanks.

309
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:53,556
- Still nothing out of the ordinary.
- Ls the kid home sick?

310
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,107
I don't see him. I see an arm,
piece of robe...

311
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:03,402
it could be Tony.
He's eating Sugar Pops.

312
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,696
Wait, somebody just walked past
the kitchen window. It's the maid.

313
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,079
- They're good.
- Fresh this morning.

314
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:18,081
- How are things on Bloomfield?
- The Cuban was at the casino.

315
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:23,128
Big John's okay with a 60-40 split
because we own the building.

316
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,425
- What the hell?
- What?

317
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,555
The fuck? Is that Pat Parisi?

318
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,479
Oh, shit!

319
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,615
What should we do?

320
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,374
He's drunk!

321
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:02,007
- I told John, "Look..."
- Let's talk downstairs.

322
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,928
Motherfucker.

323
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,649
I don't understand this at all.

324
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,104
Cocksucker.

325
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,128
What's up, Ike?

326
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,136
What happened at the Soprano house
was, the heater blew.

327
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,174
Our unit saw Ruggerio
haul the old one out.

328
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:56,265
- Ruggerio. A plumber?
- Why?

329
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,557
My sister was friends
with Mrs. Ruggerio.

330
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,024
Yeah, that's Mr. Ruggerio's
neighborhood.

331
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:09,032
We have to get it in
before our warrant goes stale.

332
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:14,201
Boy, we've had every one of Tony's
phones bugged for four years.

333
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:19,703
- The guy says <i>less</i> than Harpo Marx.
- Next Tuesday the wire drop's a go.

334
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,751
Der Bingle has left the building.

335
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,256
They fucking made me.

336
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:38,729
<i>- Wire drop is still</i> a <i>go.
- Confirming access to switching</i> box.

337
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,893
I'm going in.

338
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,489
Unit 2, Mrs. Bing in motion.

339
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,570
- Just the maid and it's yours, team.
- Copy <i>that.</i>

340
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,832
Siren wire is cut.

341
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,167
The teacher knows nothing.

342
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:09,293
Why do you quarrel with him always?
English is his first language...

343
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:15,345
He waste our time with those
trick questions. "Stop. Men at work."

344
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,936
How do we know it doesn't mean,
"Stop all men who are working"?

345
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,601
He shouldn't have taken a point.

346
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,602
He thinks I'm a hack cabbie
from Pakistan.

347
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:32,403
- Please, where are you going?
- I'm going back to work!

348
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,579
- Excuse me?
- You scared me.

349
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,709
Sorry. ls the West Essex
Language School around here?

350
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,462
- There.
- Is it coed?

351
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,257
- What?
- You wouldn't happen to be Polish?

352
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,600
Yes.

353
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,225
That's... My grandmother is Polish.

354
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,784
It's locked today.

355
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,956
- Yes?
- My grandmother...

356
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,828
Excuse me. How can I help you, sir?

357
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:32,585
I was wondering if I could ask
you about the school. How is it?

358
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:37,302
Sweet mother of Jesus!
Look at her today.

359
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,815
Hi, Ade!

360
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,394
Hi, guys. Be back in a second.

361
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,897
Listen to this now. "Hi, Ade!"

362
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,407
Hi!

363
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,952
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

364
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,786
- I love those.
- Yeah?

365
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,750
Oh, my God.

366
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,541
- Where'd you get them?
- Near my house.

367
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,756
Ay-Ay-Ay.

368
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,428
- This table's been moved.
- From the flood.

369
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,352
It's not under the duct anymore.
Should we move it?

370
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:34,188
- Two, three feet? Who's gonna notice?
- No, wait. Somebody might.

371
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:40,240
But normal course of events,
Tony will assume Carmela moved it back.

372
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:44,164
- If anybody even notices.
- Make an executive decision.

373
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,455
- Grab an end.
- Easy.

374
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,255
When she heard I was deferring,
she's like, "That's sketchy."

375
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,467
Are you serious?

376
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,053
Eric Scatino hates Montclair.
He's doing acid.

377
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,674
God, he was so straight-edge.
Hi, Caitlin.

378
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,510
Hi.

379
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,472
This is Hunter,
my friend I was telling you about.

380
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,608
Wow.

381
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,195
Do you like Citron Jell-O shots?

382
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,695
- I haven't had any alcohol in a week.
- I know.

383
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:30,206
I was gonna say we should go to
Panchito's, then I remembered. Bad idea.

384
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:35,294
- I went to the health center.
- For that problem swallowing?

385
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,963
They gave me BuSpar.

386
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,712
That's for anxiety, right?

387
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,759
I guess.

388
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,555
There was this weight lifter
on the subway.

389
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:53,025
He was eating chicken parts and
spitting bones back in the container.

390
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,148
And the whole car reeked.

391
00:39:56,352 --> 00:40:01,404
This blind man sitting next to him,
you could tell he felt invaded.

392
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:06,530
We all did.
Everybody just stared straight ahead.

393
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,740
New York.

394
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,789
Hey.

395
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,337
Where is everybody?

396
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,341
- What're you doing?
- Receipts from Sunday's game.

397
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,945
- You got a problem?
- What, Ton?

398
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,657
I said, "Do you got a problem?"

399
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:31,911
- With what, Ton?
- I heard you got a problem being here.

400
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,162
I like being here.

401
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,912
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

402
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,547
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

403
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,126
Don't say you're sure
if you're not sure.

404
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:55,435
You bought your daughter a nice house?
After you came over with us?

405
00:41:56,681 --> 00:42:00,481
- Yeah, that's nice.
- Wonderful thing.

406
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,198
And your brother, buon'anima.

407
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:15,242
You've recovered from that shit?
You put your grief behind you?

408
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,468
You put your grief behind you?

409
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,257
Let me hear you say it.

410
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,938
I put the grief behind me.

411
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,727
I'm gonna go get a coffee and a bun.

412
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:52,199
You got a younger son too?
You ought to bring him to the house.

413
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:56,120
We can get something to eat,
they can go in the pool.

414
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:12,175
We'll have to leave this junk on the table.
Don't know where to put it.

415
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,973
Control, you hearing me?

416
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:20,725
<i>- Loud and clear. Leave the factory.
- Roger that.</i>

417
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,946
Wire's in, Bobby. I'm good to go.

418
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:35,280
- Control, <i>we're</i> in motion.
- Touchdown.

419
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,867
Dig, Soprano! Come on!
You wanna join the team?

420
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:43,247
You think it's all for show
and not for go? Dig in.

421
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,834
<i>You're out of there, George.
Unit 3, we're in.</i>

422
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:12,651
<i>- So I got a job for you.
- Right.</i>

423
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:16,329
<i>- Might get a little messy.
- I understand.</i>

424
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,166
<i>- Wet work.
- All right.</i>

425
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:26,214
<i>- I'll make it worth your while.
- I'm not worried.</i>

426
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,671
<i>- Look</i> over here.
- Minimization, 40 seconds.

427
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:41,809
- The old one flooded the whole place.
- I can smell the mildew, you know?

428
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:46,435
You're an engineer.
I figured you could rig a system...

429
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:50,405
some PVC shit or something,
so if it happens again...

430
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:54,526
you get the overflow
and put it over to a sump pump.

431
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:56,828
<i>Chip out the concrete.</i>

432
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,656
- Four-O.
- They're not discussing OC.

433
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,540
In two minutes
we're allowed to check back in.

434
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,305
What do you think?

435
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,431
Whatever.

436
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,804
Well, how much?

437
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:26,684
Time, materials...
I don't know how to concoct estimate.

438
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,528
Well, fair enough.

439
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:36,030
- Let me get measure. Get started.
- All right.

440
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,238
- Hi, Stasiu.
- Hello.

441
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:46,332
- You gonna use this?
- If you want it, take it.

442
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,672
- No, you go ahead.
- Go ahead. I'll use the bike.

443
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,001
I have to sort Meadow's laundry
anyway.

444
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,471
Lilliana's making her a leg
of lamb to take.

445
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:01,393
In Lodz, I had grant from the state
to do an autonomous research.

446
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,766
Why don't you use it?
I'll take the bike.

447
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,191
Jesus, already. No, you go ahead.

448
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:17,366
Stas said he could smell
the mildew down here. Right, Stas?

449
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,205
We've gotta let the place dry out.

450
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,129
Got some girl
to take care of my mother.

451
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,132
- Yeah, where'd you find her?
- Agency.

452
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,147
<i>Good coffee this morning.</i>

453
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:01,570
<i>Vienna Roast.
It's not as acidic as the Italian.</i>

454
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,579
<i>Cleaned me out.</i>

455
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:08,452
<i>What you need is more roughage
overall in your diet.</i>

456
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:13,791
I've had something stuck
in my teeth for two days.

457
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:17,002
You gotta use the other floss.
