1
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:44,686
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes
the presentation of evidence for today.

2
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,690
I repeat my earlier admonition that you
not discuss the case among yourselves...

3
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,236
...or with anyone else, including media.

4
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,322
Your Honor, I have a logistical problem
to discuss.

5
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,491
I'd like to call a witness out of order.

6
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,287
Now I missed the Early Bird Special.

7
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,958
Took a half a chicken home
the other night. Got two meals out of it.

8
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,129
Mr. Soprano. Big bombshell
from the prosecution today...

9
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,757
...with testimony detailing misuse
of Joint Fitters' 401K funds.

10
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,759
- Your reaction?
- No comment.

11
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,596
- Mr. Soprano, Allison Pak, Channel 6.
- Allison, hi...

12
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,682
Corrado!

13
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,392
Corrado!

14
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,937
- Has he been shot?
- He got hit in the head by a boom.

15
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,940
I'm here at the federal courthouse
where reputed mob boss...

16
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:35,195
...Corrado Soprano just fell nine...
No, seven steps.

17
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:41,368
- Hey, how's our royal highness in there?
- She's doing good.

18
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,370
Lois, this is Carmela, my wife.

19
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,414
- Hi.
- Hi.

20
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:49,459
Great to see her run again. Had her first
full-speed workout this morning.

21
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,962
Go ahead, fourth stall down.
I'll be right there.

22
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,841
- What is that, a goat?
- Yeah, that's her friend.

23
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,889
- She ready for the Toboggan Handicap?
- Yeah.

24
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,020
Hello.

25
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:13,567
- She's something, isn't she?
- She is magnificent.

26
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,071
Yeah, that's a good girl.
You're feeling better, huh? Yeah.

27
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,908
You see that? When she saw you,
she came right over.

28
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,661
You know what she likes? She likes
when you rub her muzzle right here.

29
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,956
Right, Lady Pie? Yeah.

30
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,002
You ought to see her race.
She busts her heart to win.

31
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,132
You like the ponies. I'll take you.

32
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,642
Follow my finger.

33
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,895
He said they'll do this every hour.
Check the neurological.

34
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,440
You ought to go.
The family's on the way.

35
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,442
Thank you.

36
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,196
My daughter's addressing
the Irish Parliament.

37
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,324
Abortion issues.

38
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,205
Corrado?

39
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,959
I gotta go. I gotta catch a plane.

40
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,670
I'll be back Monday.

41
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,215
- Feel better.
- Make sure Beppy gets my chicken home.

42
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,760
Corrado, you didn't get
to the Early Bird Special.

43
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,805
He was disoriented.
Scored low on his Folstein...

44
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,848
...but that's consistent with concussion.

45
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,518
We're gonna sue the goddamn
Justice Department!

46
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,813
His CAT scan's negative, so,
so far so good.

47
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,358
He, I don't know...
He didn't seem like himself.

48
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,111
He could've been working
on a dementia for a while...

49
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,862
...and the blow tipped him over.

50
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,240
- You mean Alzheimer's?
- That's one form of it.

51
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,325
That's why we want to keep him here.

52
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,370
Listen, good chance
this could all go away.

53
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,122
Bobby.

54
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,208
- Where is he?
- They took him down for an x-ray.

55
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,918
We gotta get him into the city.

56
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:59,298
Columbia Presbyterian head-trauma unit.
The best.

57
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,385
Why don't you take it easy?

58
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,471
- Had to be Paulie told Johnny.
- You think so?

59
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,765
He hates my success.

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,270
I been thinking about
that birthday dinner.

61
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,565
Who was there when I told
the Ginny Sack joke?

62
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,651
Not Paulie. I remember Albert saying
he didn't get a gift.

63
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,821
It was Little Paulie,
the witless fucking nephew.

64
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,615
He told Paulie, Paulie tells Johnny.

65
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:29,328
Fucking telephone game,
like high-school girls!

66
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,622
Wanna play phone games?

67
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:37,044
That party was the only time
I ever mentioned Shamu's fat ass.

68
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,717
Hello. Verona, Green Grove
Retirement Home something...

69
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,928
- Just connect me.
- The fuck you doing?

70
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,265
Yeah, hello?

71
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,394
I'd like to talk to a Mrs. Gualtieri,
she's a resident there.

72
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,896
One moment, please.

73
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:09,034
- Hello?
- Mrs. Nucci Gualtieri?

74
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,620
- Yes.
- Hi, this is Detective Mike Hunt...

75
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,623
...Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania
Police Department.

76
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,834
- You have a son, Peter Paul?
- Oh, my God. What happened?

77
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,670
He's all right, but I'm afraid
he's in a little trouble.

78
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,132
We found him in a public men's room
in Lafayette Park.

79
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,553
I don't know how to put this delicately.
He was sucking a Cub Scout's dick.

80
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,098
What? No, it's a mistake!

81
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,018
Ma'am, I wish that was all.

82
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,564
But I'm afraid we had to have emergency
surgery performed upon arrival...

83
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,944
...at headquarters, after discovery
of a small rodent in the rectal passage.

84
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,321
- Oh, my God!
- A gerbil, ma'am.

85
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,699
The county does not cover medical
procedures deemed caused...

86
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:54,704
...by criminal sexual activity.
Section four, paragraph 15.

87
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,290
- We'll need an insurance number.
- Oh, Madonna.

88
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,043
I have BlueCross BlueShield,
is that all right?

89
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,129
Ma'am, could you hold on
for one second?

90
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,840
I have the hospital on the other line.

91
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,017
Uncle Jun.

92
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:20,897
- Hey! Nephew number one.
- How you doing today?

93
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,774
You look better.

94
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,736
Guess who came in earlier.
Tommy Formicola.

95
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:31,992
Uncle Jun, Tommy Formicola
died a few years ago.

96
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,328
Not Tommy, you cetriolo.
The son, Tommy!

97
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,832
Jesus Christ, you had me
worried there for a minute.

98
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,837
You know, when you came in yesterday,
they said you were very confused...

99
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,214
...and you flunked your Holstein,
I don't know.

100
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,175
I'm 71 years old, for chrissake.

101
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,302
Get hit in the head,
see how you do.

102
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,804
- I'm glad you're feeling better.
- Better?

103
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,724
This is Xanadu compared
to that courtroom.

104
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,478
I'm milking this thing for all it's worth.

105
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,650
Maybe you're not milking it enough.

106
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,611
What?

107
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,906
You don't by any chance have
headaches or blurred vision...

108
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,782
...or any of that shit, do you?
No.

109
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,453
- Okay, then.
- Who you calling? They charge a fortune!

110
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,461
- Hello.
- Mel, what the fuck are you doing?

111
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,423
Just on our way to St. Stephen's Green
for dinner. Why? What's going on?

112
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,468
Back here in the States,
I think we got a mistrial.

113
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,224
Son of Gondor!
The bow is meant to find the Ring!

114
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,892
Dick.

115
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,147
- Yeah!
- Yes! My turn!

116
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,112
Mr. Ralph! Mr. Ralph!
Come! Please! Help!

117
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,658
What? For chrissakes, what?

118
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,912
It's Justin, he's hurt very bad!

119
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,671
Justin, baby.

120
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,675
I don't know what to do.
The boy, he comes to the house.

121
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,969
Shut up! Shut up!

122
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,764
All right, nobody move.
Don't touch him, okay?

123
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,849
I gotta get help.

124
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,541
- How is he?
- Not good.

125
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,087
He couldn't get any breath
in his lungs for five minutes...

126
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,091
...so there was no oxygen to the brain.

127
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,761
So they don't...
They just don't know yet.

128
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,014
Thank God you were home.

129
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,646
Get the door.

130
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,115
Ralph, it was an accident, all right?
Just kids.

131
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,705
Ralph.

132
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,588
He must be the surgeon.

133
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,512
- Please, allow me to introduce myself.
- This is my ex-husband.

134
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,306
Justin's biological father.

135
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,850
He was supposed to take him
to the archery range.

136
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,771
They were playing a video game, Ronnie.
I don't know what happened.

137
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,564
No, nothing's ever your fault.

138
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,359
- I should never have let you near him.
- He's my son.

139
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,611
Before he goes to your house,
he can't sleep.

140
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,571
- Ronnie, don't.
- You son of a bitch!

141
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,907
Hey, please! Please, stop it!

142
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,950
- You scumbag!
- Honey, please!

143
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,912
- You bought the bow, you stupid cunt!
- People!

144
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,872
Don't you talk to her like that!

145
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,500
Nobody talks to my wife like that.
Nobody talks to her!

146
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,337
- All right. Knock it off, this is enough!
- We were just fooling around.

147
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:18,468
- Just fooling around?!
- Knock it off! Stop! Ralph, stop.

148
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:37,362
Our psychiatrist will testify
as to your reduced mental capacity.

149
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,448
Of course, the government
will bring in their own expert.

150
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:45,203
We get you 24-hour-a-day nursing care
because they didn't rule out dementia...

151
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,331
...and you might be a danger
to yourself and blah, blah, blah.

152
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,625
Which only bolsters our case.

153
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,170
If the court finds you lack
fitness to proceed...

154
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,716
...the trial will be suspended and
the charges against you dismissed...

155
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,843
...with prejudice, or delayed.

156
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,679
I called this woman,
she runs an elder-care agency.

157
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,766
She's got an RN that'll play ball.
All you gotta do is act pazzo.

158
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:11,813
Crazy like a fox, my little nephew.
Now get me the fuck out of here.

159
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,984
Mel, this muffin basket from you
and your partners...

160
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,153
It's the least we could do.

161
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,413
Ralph?

162
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:35,420
- Rosalie. Oh, Jesus.
- I didn't know if I should come.

163
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,215
- I don't know what to do.
- I know.

164
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,595
I'm so happy to see you.

165
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,056
How is he?

166
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,436
He's not...
Not as good as yesterday.

167
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,563
- How are you?
- I didn't understand...

168
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,191
...what you were going through, Ro, I...

169
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,276
I didn't know anything.

170
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,447
I was stupid. I'm sorry.
I apologize.

171
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,824
It's okay.

172
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,621
I mean, there's no way to know
what it's like until it happens to you.

173
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,374
You were so strong
when Jackie Jr. passed away.

174
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,711
- I don't know how you did it.
- Justin's gonna be all right, Ralph.

175
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,839
You'll see. He's gonna be fine.

176
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,760
He's gonna be a vegetable.

177
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,889
At least I have a daughter.
Ralph's all alone.

178
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,725
I told him he should go and talk
to Father Intintola.

179
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,436
- He should.
- He won't.

180
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,776
There's another one who should
talk to the priest.

181
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,196
- Is it true he overdosed on sleeping pills?
- Apparently.

182
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,033
I also know that he and Tony are
on the outs, but Tony's not talking.

183
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,919
First question. "What is today's date?"

184
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,840
A blond with big tits
and a hatful of Viagra.

185
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,300
Yeah, cute. Fuck around.

186
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,221
When that government shrink gets ahold
of you, you better know how to fake it.

187
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,141
- I could do it in my sleep.
- Oh, yeah?

188
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,727
- What's your name?
- My name?

189
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,147
You can't not know your name.
They'll know you're fucking with them.

190
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,776
Listen to this. "Give the subject
a piece of paper.

191
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:26,281
Ask him to draw a circle, fold the paper
in half and give it back."

192
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,450
These demented old bats can't do that.

193
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:33,997
Maybe you should wipe your ass with it,
then they'll know you're a whack job.

194
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,834
You think this is funny?
I'm a source of amusement.

195
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,546
- I pretend to wipe my ass!
- No, take it easy.

196
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,382
I lived my whole life with dignity.

197
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,678
Now I gotta pretend I'm a fucking
drooling idiot. A scumparì.

198
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,472
It's just a good, clean way out,
Uncle Jun. That's all.

199
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,227
My poor fucking brother, Eckley.
How they mocked him.

200
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,438
- No, look...
- Suppose it doesn't work.

201
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,316
- We'll go after a juror.
- Suppose nothing works!

202
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,738
Let's do another question.

203
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,912
- Fucking Grand Central Station!
- That must be the nurse.

204
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,372
Maybe she'll give you a sponge bath.

205
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,711
Svetlana! I've been wanting
to talk to you.

206
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,047
I bring nurse. I don't come to see you.

207
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,133
I should never have taken
your prosthesis.

208
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:32,055
- But it did bring me to the Lord...
- You're a boring woman.

209
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,644
- Hey. How are you?
- Okay.

210
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,898
- Good to see you.
- This is Branca. She is registered nurse.

211
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,235
- He is Mr. Tony. This is the uncle.
- Help me up, I gotta go to the bathroom.

212
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,029
I do it.

213
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:55,078
- What's your problem now?
- Like anyone would care.

214
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,502
- Pleased to meet you.
- How are you doing?

215
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,213
I feel like such a hypocrite.

216
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,299
I haven't been in church in years.

217
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:13,137
But we had a Mass for Justin's baptism.

218
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,473
- For all the good it did.
- Ralph.

219
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,642
See?

220
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,353
- What am I doing here?
- God understands.

221
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,440
That's why it's at times like these
he's the only one we can turn to.

222
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,442
God.

223
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:33,324
My son's lying in a hospital
hooked up to a machine.

224
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,618
He never did nothing to nobody.

225
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,539
Our Lord gave his only
begotten son to suffer.

226
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,333
Nothing compared to this.

227
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:47,672
Were you there when Jesus Christ
had his moment of doubt and pain?

228
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:57,140
It's a great mystery to us,
why things happen as they do.

229
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:01,394
- But God has a plan for all of us.
- Come on, Father.

230
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,982
I've done things in my life
that I shouldn't have done.

231
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,737
He's making my son pay for it.

232
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,116
- That's how he's punishing me.
- God is merciful.

233
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,202
He doesn't punish people.

234
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,540
I would do anything if Justin
could even walk again.

235
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,876
Justin's in God's hands now.

236
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,130
And I assure you,
God loves him very much.

237
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,967
Your job is you.

238
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,180
To get yourself right with God.

239
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,433
For yourself and for your son.

240
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,524
- Would you like to make a confession?
- I think I need a little more time.

241
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,070
You know, to do a good one.
But when I'm ready...

242
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,656
- I understand.
- Thank you.

243
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,201
Let's pray.

244
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,749
Have mercy on me, God,
in your goodness.

245
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,712
In your abundant compassion,
blot out my offense.

246
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,591
Wash away all my guilt.

247
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,471
From my sin, cleanse me,
for I know my offense.

248
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,183
My sin is always before me.

249
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,859
- A scholarship at Rutgers?
- That's right. In Jackie Jr.'s name...

250
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,781
...for $20,000. And that's every year.
Ralph? Give me a break.

251
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,202
That's not all. He asked Ro to marry him.
She had the presence of mind to say no.

252
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,665
Although, she did say he went to see
Father Intintola and they had a long talk.

253
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,751
- No shit?
- I know what you mean about Ralph.

254
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:55,466
Although, to see him like that, and
Justin hooked up to those machines...

255
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,389
Good morning, you.

256
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,272
- When have I ever asked for French toast?
- Just eat the bacon.

257
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,650
It's unhealthy, this whole obsession
with your weight.

258
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,660
So...

259
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,622
- Where were you out so late last night?
- Nowhere.

260
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,458
Fooling around with blondie?

261
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,669
Quit it.

262
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,797
- Look at that guilty look on his face.
- Let him eat.

263
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:39,177
Mr. Tough Guy, huh? Come on,
tough guy. Come on, tough guy.

264
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,262
Jesus.

265
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,642
I have calls to make.

266
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,586
Ton, can I come in?

267
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,014
How's Justin? Learn any news?

268
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,686
Well, it's the left side of the brain.
That affects speech...

269
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:36,317
...right side of his body.
It's too soon to tell.

270
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,072
All right. Well, sit down. Come on.

271
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,995
You want something to eat?

272
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,831
I just came by to give you...

273
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,793
- From the thing.
- It could have waited.

274
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,338
I had to smack the guy around
this morning.

275
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,507
Nice.

276
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,718
Least I'm good for something.

277
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,353
How could I let something
like this happen?

278
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,191
It could happen to anybody, Ralph.

279
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,529
You know where I was
on his seventh birthday?

280
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,865
Florida.

281
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:31,747
So high on coke I forgot to call him.

282
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,668
Then I thought I did.

283
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:41,048
- Well, you cut back on that shit, right?
- I'm a different man.

284
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,388
My poor baby.

285
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,810
My little boy.

286
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:22,340
You're covered by the Sheetrock
and Plasterers' Union, right?

287
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,760
Here.

288
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,612
Yeah, he's...

289
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,950
He's covered on her husband's
insurance, as far as that goes.

290
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:54,080
You know, I'll take care of the rest,
whatever it takes.

291
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,458
I don't care if it breaks me.

292
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,419
He's gonna get the best care there is.

293
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,089
So, Ralph, there's...

294
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,842
There's something...

295
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:12,056
Look, I don't want you to hear it
through the grapevine. Especially now.

296
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,563
I'm seeing that girl you used
to date. That...

297
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,650
...Valentina.

298
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,498
I gotta go to the hospital.

299
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,046
Hang in there.

300
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,011
Well, maybe you should go see Pie.

301
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,139
- Take your mind off.
- I know.

302
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:58,769
Lois called, told me about the
Toboggan Handicap, Grade 1. I...

303
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,064
You...

304
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,818
- You look after it, I can't.
- I understand.

305
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,821
Give my best to Carmela, she's...

306
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,115
- She's been a great help.
- Yeah, I will.

307
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,619
I have bad luck. I had to get
hooked up with that miserable twat.

308
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,292
Maybe if I met a girl like Carmela, I...

309
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,920
My life could have taken
a whole different trajectory.

310
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,719
See you, Ton.

311
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,269
How's it going, pal?

312
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,398
Thanks for the flowers.
They were beautiful.

313
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:57,661
- That poor fucking guy.
- Fuck him and his alligator tears.

314
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,581
Paulie, his kid's in the hospital.
A little sympathy?

315
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,541
That gives him a pass?

316
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:06,253
I don't care if he's got 100 kids
in the ICU with arrows in their heads.

317
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,340
He's a piece of shit.
You know it and I know it.

318
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:13,344
Who got you those no-show jobs?
And not a word of gratitude.

319
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:18,057
He's a saint. You forget the thousand
incidents with that guy?

320
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,436
Kid in the hospital. Just take a look
how he fucking earns.

321
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,773
I know it was that miserable prick
called Ma at the home.

322
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,984
They had to put her on Xanax
just so she could sleep.

323
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,488
She was in the hospital for over an hour
with nervous bowel syndrome.

324
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,824
Whatever happened there, that...

325
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,036
- That was fucked up.
- Fucked up?

326
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,997
- You don't know if it was him.
- Listen to your friend here.

327
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,042
And I'll promise you something else,
on my old man's grave.

328
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,795
I get proof it was him,
he's a fucking corpse.

329
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,090
- Nobody's killing anybody.
- All due respect, T.

330
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,759
There's a line in the sand
when it comes to mothers.

331
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,428
You lay a hand on him,
you're gonna answer to me.

332
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:00,766
If you can quote the rules, you can
fucking obey them. You hear me?

333
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,650
Don't just look at me.
This is a business.

334
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:14,154
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes.

335
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,660
Goes for all of you.

336
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,705
All right, now, listen...

337
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,457
...I'm gonna visit your mother.

338
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,919
That was a terrible thing,
whoever did it.

339
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:33,340
It's been too long now.
I'm gonna go pay my respects.

340
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:40,389
- Okay. She'd love that.
- All right. Come here.

341
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,691
He has no fucking conception.

342
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,279
He's got no kids.
You can't expect him to understand.

343
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,410
I'm going to say three words
and I want you to repeat them.

344
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,122
Boat. Flag. Shirt.

345
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,708
Boat.

346
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,419
Shirt.

347
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,799
Let me give you a hint.
We pledge allegiance to the?

348
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,719
United States of America.

349
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,807
Okay, let's move on. Who's
the president of the United States?

350
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,977
- I'm tired. I wanna go to the bathroom.
- We're almost done.

351
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,689
- Who is the president of the U.S?
- George Bush.

352
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,026
And who was the president
before George Bush?

353
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:40,449
John Kennedy. You know where
I was when he was shot?

354
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,078
I was getting a haircut.

355
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,840
- Hello?
- I'm sorry to bother you, but...

356
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,969
...I can't find Ralph.
He sticks to himself nowadays.

357
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,057
There was a fire at the stables.

358
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,352
- They lost some horses.
- Pie-O-My?

359
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,313
- She survived, but...
- Why didn't you tell me? I'm late!

360
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,274
We did everything we could,
but she had to be destroyed.

361
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,151
She was too badly burned.

362
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,014
Jesus.

363
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,977
It just went up?

364
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,439
The fire marshal says it looks electrical.

365
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,777
They found pieces of a blown-out
light bulb in a stall...

366
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,739
...and the hay was a natural accelerant.

367
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:07,077
They'll investigate, but it's a formality,
considering the value of the stock.

368
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,919
- No, don't.
- Come on, it's all right.

369
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,136
- How are you?
- Hey, Ton.

370
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,270
I was just down at the stables.

371
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,689
I got some bad news.

372
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,275
Pie-O-My...

373
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:25,614
...she was in a fire. She's dead.

374
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,080
Oh, Madonna. Oh, Jesus.

375
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,755
That's why Lois called me.
Four messages I got on the machine.

376
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,174
Three other horses too.

377
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,426
Jesus.

378
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,805
Look, Ton. I...

379
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,810
I just made some coffee,
if you want, you know, eggs.

380
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,404
Sorry about the timing.

381
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:09,700
No, I actually just got
some good news on Justy.

382
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,744
They think it's just gonna be speech.

383
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,498
Poor kid will have to learn how
to talk again. Years of rehab.

384
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,834
Well, that's...

385
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,837
- That's good.
- He'll walk.

386
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,672
He'll use his hands.

387
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,719
Life goes on. One day at a time.

388
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,598
Lois said the horse was still alive...

389
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,810
...but was burned so bad that they had
to put her out of her misery.

390
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,188
I don't even want to think about it.

391
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:44,651
At this point the fire marshal says
that it looks accidental.

392
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,530
What sick fuck would do something
like that on purpose?

393
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,453
You know, Ton, Justin loves my eggs.
See?

394
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,080
Sour cream's the secret ingredient.

395
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,832
Right.

396
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,752
What sick fuck?

397
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,922
What?

398
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,675
That's funny about God and fate
and shit like that.

399
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,887
The horse gets better and we take out
200 grand in insurance...

400
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,264
...on the race coming up.

401
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,725
Suddenly there's a fire.

402
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,478
What are you saying?
I had something to do with it?

403
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,854
I didn't.

404
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,358
Anthony, what are you, a fucking
arson investigator now? Come on.

405
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,443
They said it was an accident, right?

406
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,740
You know what,
maybe I will have some eggs.

407
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,953
- Toast?
- Yeah.

408
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,337
How's Corky lanucci?
You heard from him lately?

409
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,632
You know, Sil used him
in that restaurant fire. Excellent work.

410
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,220
You know, I don't understand you,
Anthony. We got lucky.

411
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,808
That accidental fire
was a bolt from beyond.

412
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:02,479
The horse was no fucking good
with the fucking colic all the time...

413
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,108
...and the fucking bills!
She bounced back!

414
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,653
This time. But each time
it takes something out of them.

415
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,030
It was all downhill from here.

416
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:15,158
Now, I know it's tragic
to think this way.

417
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,744
But you can't argue
with the fucking logic!

418
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,289
Jesus Christ, you did it.
You cooked that fucking horse alive.

419
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,834
No, I did not!

420
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,544
- But so what?
- So what?

421
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,423
It was a fucking animal!
A hundred grand apiece.

422
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,550
My kid's in the fucking hospital!

423
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,928
I don't hear you complaining
when I bring you a nice fat envelope.

424
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,140
You don't give a shit
where that comes from.

425
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:43,478
Don't give me that look.
It was a fucking horse!

426
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:48,734
What are you, a vegetarian? You eat
beef and sausage by the fucking carload.

427
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,569
Fuck you, you...

428
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,036
You fat fuck!

429
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:39,826
She was a beautiful, innocent creature.
What'd she ever do to you?

430
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,125
You fucking killed her.

431
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,797
You killed her, you fucking killed her.

432
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,881
Fuck!

433
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,720
Motherfuck!

434
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,795
- Hello.
- It's me.

435
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,047
I need you to call me back
from a pay phone.

436
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,926
- Now?
- You got three minutes.

437
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,496
- Yeah?
- It's me.

438
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,625
I called you half a fucking hour ago.

439
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,336
Adriana put my keys
where I couldn't find them.

440
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,924
Go to the drugstore.
Get two pairs of surgical gloves...

441
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:05,513
...some bleach, come to
our friend's house. The contractor.

442
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,613
What's going on?

443
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,531
Come on.

444
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,794
I found him like this.

445
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,345
Guy was a piece of shit!

446
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,099
Whoever did this, it should have
happened a long time ago.

447
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,436
- So, what do you wanna do?
- Get rid of the body.

448
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:03,530
- Tried to move him myself, but couldn't.
- Why do we have to get rid of the body?

449
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,907
What, with the fucking questions now?

450
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,827
When they find him like this...

451
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,706
...and somebody will, there'll be
a major fucking investigation.

452
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,835
And we got enough light shining on shit.
Junior's trial, all that.

453
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,838
No body, no murder.

454
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:25,135
Can't take him out till after dark,
so we'll get him ready here.

455
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:38,189
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

456
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,486
Don't lie to me. You're high.

457
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,823
I smoked half a joint
before you called. I'm fine.

458
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,535
Look at you. Your nose is running,
you fucking junkie.

459
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,246
You promised me you wouldn't
do that shit anymore.

460
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,332
I didn't.

461
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,918
Jesus fucking Christ!
Can you even do this?

462
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:20,190
He was a captain, T.
He was the biggest earner.

463
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,359
You gonna lecture me now?

464
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,653
- You fucking drug addict.
- Not me.

465
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,865
But other people are gonna wonder.

466
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:45,131
Up! Up! Get the fucking mop.
Get him draining.

467
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,892
T, okay, I snorted a little H.

468
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,980
I was out on my collections and I just
wanted to come down so I could sleep.

469
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,863
See if he's got some Visine.

470
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,490
I'm fucking nauseous.

471
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,785
My eyes are fucking killing me.

472
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:29,467
- Holy shit! I had no idea. Did you?
- Of course I did.

473
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:33,930
You're so high you wouldn't know if
he had your mother's muff on his head.

474
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,259
Charlie?

475
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,222
I mean, I got all pissed off when
she said she couldn't have kids.

476
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,559
But this new doctor says
maybe she can.

477
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,520
But I don't know if I'm ready.

478
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,398
Don't over-think it.

479
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,776
Either jump in with both feet or don't.

480
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,532
Leave a message and make sure
you leave your phone number.

481
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,619
With my schedule, I cannot
look up phone numbers.

482
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:43,875
I'll tell you one thing. You can't
be high on scag and have children.

483
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:01,768
I mean, look at that shit with Justin.
It would fucking ruin your life.

484
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,897
Those kids on milk cartons.
Teenage girls, they run away.

485
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:10,485
God knows what happens to them.
Killed, I guess.

486
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,746
When it gets a little darker...

487
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:25,250
...I want you to move my car away
and put yours in the driveway.

488
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,419
I wanna finish up and get him
the fuck out of here.

489
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,176
Listen...

490
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,136
About this...

491
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,098
This fucking guy...

492
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,687
I came over...

493
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,022
...he was still moaning.

494
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,776
He died almost right away.

495
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,863
Ambulance wouldn't have
helped him anyway.

496
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:06,082
Paulie was in New Paltz all day.
I know that for a fact.

497
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,251
Well, good. Good.

498
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,669
I heard about your horse, T.

499
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,713
I'm sorry.

500
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,636
What the fuck happened over there,
you think?

501
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,889
Tragic.

502
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,730
What the fuck?!

503
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:21,658
It's the bowling ball.
Cellar stairs.

504
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,411
Go get it. Help weigh him down.

505
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:35,857
Hey, I'm not saying I'm a saint.
I've done drugs. When I was younger.

506
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,443
I've even done coke with you.

507
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,154
You're acting like I'm some
kind of skeeve junkie.

508
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,448
I only do it once in a while.

509
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,576
Somebody gave me some
when they didn't have any money.

510
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,411
I'm sorry.

511
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,416
You got your whole life in front of you.
Wanna throw it away on drugs?

512
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,421
Okay.

513
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:04,260
One, two, three.

514
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:33,706
Let's go. Palmice's farm is all the way
up in fucking Sloatsburg.

515
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,357
All right, this is good.

516
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,945
- Mikey's old man lives here?
- Retired here.

517
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:09,534
He's in a VA hospital now.
He's having prostate surgery.

518
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,003
It's frozen.

519
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,760
Come on.

520
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,433
And there's Artie with three kids.

521
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:38,938
- Think he's banging that French broad?
- He fucking wishes.

522
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,317
Can you hot-wire this thing?

523
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:21,480
Keep the scoop up!
You gotta put it up to move it!

524
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,443
Up! Raise it up!

525
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:31,032
What the fuck? Put it up!
You gotta put it up to move forward!

526
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:36,704
What are you doing? All right, get out.
Get out, come on. Get out.

527
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,372
Get out.

528
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,458
This is what I'm talking about.

529
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,961
That shit fucks up your
hand-eye coordination.

530
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,744
Over there.

531
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,115
Great. Go!

532
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,985
Kick leaves and shit over it.

533
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,241
Where did you learn how to drive
one of those?

534
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,995
Grandfather's construction site.

535
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,498
He let me fuck around
when I was just 13.

536
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,625
He was a good guy.

537
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:42,223
Here's the problem, as I see it,
with Ralph getting whacked.

538
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,185
People could take it the wrong way.

539
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,695
- What are you trying to convey to me?
- Friends of ours...

540
00:51:56,863 --> 00:52:01,242
...like it could happen to them.
Without, you know...

541
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,994
...the protection of the boss...

542
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,336
You're the only other one
that knows about it.

543
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,982
We were right to disappear him.
You're right.

544
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,484
For the business.

545
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:44,034
Take these out back later and burn them.

546
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,052
Hi, Mr. Soprano.

547
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,387
- Can I have some ice cream?
- What?

548
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:53,145
- Well, wait there.
- Okay.

549
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,068
Mr. Soprano! Mr. Sopr...

550
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:03,405
What are you doing? Come here!
Come back here. Come in the house.

551
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:07,576
- You'll catch cold. Come on.
- I was getting the paper.

552
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,667
You'll catch cold. Come on.

553
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,884
I was just getting the newspaper.

554
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,221
It's your fault. You forgot to get
the newspaper this morning.

555
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,431
I make tea.

556
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,838
Christopher?

557
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,830
Christopher?
