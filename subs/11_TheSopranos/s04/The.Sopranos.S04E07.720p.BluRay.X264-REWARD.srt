1
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,523
What do you hear? What do you say?

2
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,443
Welcome home.

3
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,947
Youngstown, my ass. Look at this guy.
You look like you were in Miami.

4
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,408
- Hey, you look like you were in Miami.
- Good to be home, skip.

5
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,119
What can I get you, Paulie?

6
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,788
After four months inside?
How about laid?

7
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,336
- It's Papillon.
- Oh, hello, Sil, how are you?

8
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,005
I heard you were getting laid
up there all the time.

9
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,299
Come here, you little prick.
Hello, Chrissy.

10
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,135
- Let's have a drink.
- Here you go.

11
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,970
Come on. Pass them back.

12
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,349
- Over here.
- There you go.

13
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,184
All you guys!

14
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,978
- Salute.
- Salute.

15
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,482
Just a second, just a second.

16
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,880
My song.

17
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,509
Welcome home.

18
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,846
Come on.

19
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,600
What the fuck?
Why is this his song?

20
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,312
Paulie, say hello to Brian Cammarata,
Carm's cousin.

21
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,855
The financial guy.

22
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,525
- How you doing, kid?
- So just back from college, huh?

23
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,863
Let me talk to Paulie for a sec, all right?

24
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,532
Nice meeting you.

25
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,035
Have a seat.

26
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,996
So how you doing? You okay?

27
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,666
Thank God that piece of shit from
Youngstown finally copped to that gun.

28
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,629
I could've been wearing
an orange jumpsuit till I'm 90.

29
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,257
Well, you're home now.
That's the important thing.

30
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,927
Here, get back on your feet.

31
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,596
Thanks, T.

32
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,098
Not that I don't appreciate it...

33
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,893
...but I could've used a boost
when I was gone too.

34
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,272
Fucking bills. Then there's Ma
with the private home care.

35
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,858
You know she almost lost her spot
at Green Grove?

36
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,111
An extra 5 G's it cost me just
to hold her place.

37
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,281
You been back 30 seconds,
you already got a fistful of cash...

38
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,576
...not to mention the no-show jobs
I got for you.

39
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,078
You're right, Ton. I know.

40
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,747
- Enjoy the party.
- I will.

41
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,374
All right.

42
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,264
Were you having dinner
at Citris last year...

43
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,767
...when a man threw a drink
in Richard Cross' face?

44
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,394
Yes.

45
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:35,274
Subsequent to that incident,
did Mr. Cross telephone Rusty Arnold?

46
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,775
Yes.

47
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,113
And the following day, were you
informed that the man in question...

48
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,782
...had suffered a fractured skull?

49
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,661
Your Honor, objection. This whole line
of questioning is irrelevant.

50
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,748
Overruled. You may answer,
Miss Costello.

51
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,251
I don't think I'm supposed to, judge.

52
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,129
I just made my ruling.
You are required to answer.

53
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,092
But isn't there some law about testifying
against your husband?

54
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,636
Excuse me?

55
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,974
Richard and I were married
night before last in Reno.

56
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:14,980
Your Honor, the defense requests
a conference in chambers.

57
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,691
We'll stand in recess for 15 minutes...

58
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,736
...while the court confers
with counsel in chambers.

59
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,365
- Bailiff, will you escort the jury out.
- Did Julie say anything to you about this?

60
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,332
What we saw in that courtroom is a
transparent attempt by Richard Cross...

61
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,335
...to subvert the intent
of the marital privilege.

62
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,546
Hey, she's his wife.

63
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,535
Where are my pants?

64
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,915
Some mouthwash and shit in the back.
We'll go get breakfast.

65
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,542
Oh, aspetta, I'll go with you.

66
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,214
Any investment advice for an ambitious
young man such as myself?

67
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,258
Buy land, I guess.
God ain't making any more of it.

68
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,094
That's what Will Rogers said.

69
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,305
It's true. My house is worth
nearly triple what I paid.

70
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,226
Well, location's the key, right?
Otherwise, you get stuck with shit.

71
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,104
Sometimes there's money in shit.

72
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,314
How do you mean?

73
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,402
- Nothing, I don't know.
- We're just talking here. Come on.

74
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,197
I don't know. Some guy I went
to school with, this black guy.

75
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,909
We worked one summer
for this not-for-profit housing group.

76
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,955
Told me about some scam his minister
was involved with up in Harlem.

77
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,376
I read about this. Fugazy mortgage
loans or something, right?

78
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,754
- Actually, you ever hear of HUD?
- Housing development, yeah.

79
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,757
HUD was set up to help minorities
and low-income families...

80
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,301
...become homeowners.
There are more programs...

81
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,095
...for these deadbeats, I swear.

82
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:14,391
As long as the feds guarantee the home
mortgage, the banks will loan the money.

83
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,477
You get a front man to buy houses
in some crummy neighborhood.

84
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:22,482
Talking about some real shit-boxes,
maybe they're worth 100 grand apiece.

85
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,778
Next, you tie up with some nonprofit
organization who goes to HUD...

86
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,656
...says they intend to buy these houses
from your stooge.

87
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,160
They're gonna convert them to homes
for working-class blacks.

88
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,578
Thing is, though...

89
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,341
All right, sit tight.
I'm gonna be a while.

90
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,885
I'll be over here.

91
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,292
Maurice and I met in college.

92
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,378
All the way to the University of Michigan
to make friends with a guy...

93
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,007
...who lived 20 blocks away from me.
You should've seen his Jewfro.

94
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,967
Out to here.

95
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:35,222
So, Maurice, Ron tells me you're
from down Roseville Street.

96
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,682
My father was a typesetter
for the Star-Ledger.

97
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,810
No shit?
Sixth and Orange.

98
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,687
Then we were practically neighbors.

99
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,232
Yeah, that's why he moved.

100
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,501
- Hello?
- Carmela, it's me, Furio.

101
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,921
I guess I missed you this morning.
I was in the bathtub.

102
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:13,218
The reason I call, I leave my sunglasses
in some place, I don't know.

103
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,556
Oh, you're kidding.
Oh, let me have a look around.

104
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,226
So how is everything? How's your dad?

105
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,229
Not so good.

106
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,065
But I get the pictures
from the housewarm finally.

107
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,025
Oh, good, bring them next time.

108
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,569
I will.

109
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,613
There's a pretty one of you.

110
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,908
Oh, that's sweet.

111
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,580
I don't see the glasses, Fur.

112
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,458
That's okay. I probably leave them home.

113
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,420
All right. Well, if I find them,
I'll give you a call.

114
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,214
Okay.

115
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,758
I see you soon.

116
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,726
The summer of '67,
we're both home on break.

117
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,438
I'm interning at the state Legislature,
and he... What were you doing?

118
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,400
East Newark Food Co-op.

119
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:14,154
Right. But come July...

120
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,573
The Newark riots.

121
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,450
What a fucking summer that was.

122
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,912
Later that year, Maurice and I organized
one of the first black voting drives.

123
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,957
Maurice, were you around
for Anthony Imperiale?

124
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,584
The White Knight?

125
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,420
Around? Who do you think
he was fighting against?

126
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,089
"Italian pride." "Keep Newark white."

127
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,842
Aspiring Klansmen, some of those boys.

128
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,762
So this group you got now,
the Urban Housing League.

129
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,305
What's the story there?

130
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,310
Like many nonprofits,
we've fallen on hard times.

131
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:50,106
Republican administration, plus a
proliferation of new charities post-9/11.

132
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,485
Sounds like you three got a lot to talk
about. I'm gonna hit the showers.

133
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,197
- Maurice, nice meeting you.
- Same here.

134
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,494
I filled Maurice in on the broad strokes.

135
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,997
Okay, and we got a guy, Dr. Fried.
He's a urologist.

136
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,375
We're gonna give him a half mil
of our money...

137
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,127
...have him grab up four houses
on Garside Street...

138
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,797
...for 125 grand apiece.
The old First Ward.

139
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,841
Once we own the houses,
we got an appraiser who'll play ball.

140
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,011
He's gonna reappraise them
in the $300,000 range.

141
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,390
What you do, Maurice, is you take
the phony appraisals to HUD.

142
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,851
Tell them your Urban Housing League
wants to buy these shit-holes...

143
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,729
...convert them to low-cost housing
for working families.

144
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,191
Once HUD guarantees the mortgage app,
you take it to the bank.

145
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,820
They cut a check,
and we work it up nice.

146
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,032
At which point I assume my organization
fails to make the mortgage payment.

147
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,202
Unforeseen construction delays
and repeated vandalism...

148
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,081
...force the project into dissolution.
We all walk away from the houses.

149
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,000
Your cut will be in the 10 percent
of the profit range.

150
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,504
My office will write a letter
in strong support of your application.

151
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,424
Sounds about right.

152
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,059
Tony, good, you're still here.

153
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,228
Is there a problem?

154
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,272
No problem. I just wanna talk to you.

155
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,276
You remember that time
in Atlantic City?

156
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,361
You brought Irina, your old girlfriend?

157
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:23,074
Yeah, the cystic fibrosis thing,
the fundraiser.

158
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,203
God, this is awkward.

159
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,372
Irina and I are seeing each other.

160
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,876
What? You're fucking kidding me.

161
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,961
I met her that night at the fundraiser.

162
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,298
I gave her my card. She was having
some problem with her landlord.

163
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,260
She called me months later, after you
broke it off. One thing led to another...

164
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,723
All right, all right, take it easy.
It's ancient history.

165
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,144
Still, I've been meaning to tell you.
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

166
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,565
What am I, your father?
You're both adults. Enjoy yourself.

167
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,610
It's more than that. I care for her.

168
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,988
Very deeply. Roz and I are separated.

169
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,824
The heart wants what the heart wants,
I guess.

170
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,077
The heart also wants
what the dick wants.

171
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:12,123
Okay, who's gonna scrub my back?

172
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,251
Ralph, you steal my water?

173
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,012
Man, I love this song.

174
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,766
The Chi-Lites, the best.

175
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,853
Believe it or not, the Chi-Lites
were signed to the same label...

176
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,105
...as Tommy James
and them damn Shondells.

177
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,442
See, a lot of people think that,
but they're wrong.

178
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,445
Chi-Lites were on Brunswick.

179
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,324
See you soon.

180
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,661
So, Tony, anyway...

181
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,788
Look, she's a great girl.

182
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,124
Beautiful girl. Little needy.

183
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,336
Frankly, I'm glad to have her
off my payroll.

184
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,171
Thanks. Thanks for understanding.

185
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,383
Wish you nothing but the best, Ron.

186
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,518
Dr. Fried, you are now the legal owner.

187
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,645
Eat my dust, Donald Trump.

188
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,199
- Hey, Adriana.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

189
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,410
Why don't you go haunt a house
or something.

190
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:35,331
- It's been a while, figured I'd check in.
- So you crawl up my ass?

191
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,836
What do you want, Robyn?

192
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,213
I heard Paulie Gualtieri's out of jail.

193
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,050
- What do I know?
- How does Christopher feel about that?

194
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,720
Christopher likes Paulie.
They're friends.

195
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,055
Is that a crime now too?

196
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,728
How is Christopher, anyway?
He looked tired last time I saw him.

197
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,564
If you're gonna turn me
into a fucking traitor, fine...

198
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,817
...but stop asking about him
like you give a shit how he is.

199
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,903
How's he doing with his drug problem?

200
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,073
He doesn't have a drug problem.

201
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,743
How are you doing, Ade?

202
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,748
- Really.
- I'm fine.

203
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,584
We're both fine.

204
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,756
As a matter of fact, we're thinking
of finally getting married.

205
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,261
You have a good time today?

206
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,389
Yeah, it was cool. I love the ocean.

207
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,647
Feel like taking a ride?

208
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,486
See that church?

209
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,615
Your great-grandfather helped build
that almost 80 years ago.

210
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,450
He was a stonemason, the old man.

211
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,495
Came over from Avellino
with $4 in his pocket.

212
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,623
Yeah, but I saw in a book
where you could get a hotel room...

213
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,625
...for, like, 10 cents a week then.

214
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,128
Room service must have been,
like, 1 or 2 cents a meal.

215
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,423
Room service? We're talking
about history here, A.J.

216
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,134
Your family's history.
Newark's history.

217
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,305
- Well, who gives a shit about Newark?
- I'm making a point.

218
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,643
This neighborhood used to be beautiful,
100 percent Italian.

219
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,437
The 1920s, most of them
right off the boat.

220
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,691
Most Italians couldn't even find a church
that wanted them.

221
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,526
So, what did they do,
did they cry?

222
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,112
Did they go to the government
with their hand out?

223
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,698
No. They took care
of their own problems.

224
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,325
They said, "You don't want us
in your church? Fine.

225
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,496
We'll build our own. A better one."
Look at all these buildings around here.

226
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,165
Most of them are falling
down to the ground.

227
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,334
But that church is still standing.

228
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,961
You know why?

229
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,005
The bricks?

230
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,010
Because our people give a shit,
that's why.

231
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,554
Every Sunday,
Italians from the old neighborhood...

232
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,223
...they drive miles
to come here to pray.

233
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,142
They keep this place alive.

234
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,811
So how come we never do?

235
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,026
Buy land, A.J., because God
ain't making any more of it.

236
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,449
Hey, this is advice I'm imparting
to you as your father.

237
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,098
Now what?

238
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,561
Are you afraid?

239
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,774
Right, like I haven't seen places
like this before.

240
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,404
See those houses over there?

241
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,117
I'm buying them.

242
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,079
Those crappy ones?
What for?

243
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,872
For an investment.

244
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,791
What have I been saying?

245
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,501
I don't know.

246
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,296
Real estate. Buy real estate.

247
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,761
Dad, the black dude's coming over.

248
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:22,100
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up? Five-O?

249
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,019
Yeah, I'm Starsky and this is Hutch.

250
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,729
Smoke, crack or crank?

251
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,273
No, thank you.
We're just having a look around.

252
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,276
- No eyeing if you ain't buying.
- This is a free country.

253
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,988
Unless you want something,
motherfucker, get the fuck off our street.

254
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,534
The language on you.
You blow your father with that mouth?

255
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,452
What the fuck you say to my sister?

256
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:45,081
I don't want no trouble. I'm just showing
my son the old neighborhood.

257
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,626
Well, this is our neighborhood now.
Guinea motherfucker.

258
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,630
Yeah, I can see that.

259
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,804
So that's a crack ho.

260
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,308
Keep your fucking cracker-ass off
my motherfucking block!

261
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,810
Come on, ease up, ease up.

262
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,646
She's really gonna marry him?

263
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,273
What is wrong with this girl?

264
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,109
Come on. Moltisanti's a great catch.

265
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,486
Tall, dark and sociopathic.

266
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:22,118
From a strategic standpoint,
do the nuptials help us or hurt us?

267
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:27,498
Well, if they do get married,
brings them closer, obviously...

268
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,459
...and, by extension, gets
her closer to Tony.

269
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,004
It could cause her to stop cooperating.

270
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,008
The guilt becomes overwhelming.
Remember Angel DiLetto?

271
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,177
I think it'll have the opposite effect.

272
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,596
His problems really become
her problems.

273
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,517
If they have kids,
that's even more pressure.

274
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,186
The DiLettos never had kids.

275
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,896
I wouldn't count on children.

276
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,524
She's had some issues, female trouble.

277
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,237
Maybe Darwin was right. Nature
really does weed out the nimrods.

278
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,531
So, what do we do, people?
Yea or nay?

279
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,200
Supportive or discouraging?

280
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,037
If anyone objects to this marriage,
speak now or forever hold your peace.

281
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,206
I say neutral or supportive.

282
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,708
Even if we discourage it,
she'll go through with it.

283
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,045
Agreed then. They have our blessing.

284
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,714
To the happy couple.

285
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,060
These doctors own so much property.

286
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,729
You're buying four houses
on Garside Street?

287
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,943
You've certainly got your work
cut out for you.

288
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,611
One day at a time.

289
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,197
Keep on keeping on.

290
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,897
Tony, hey, come on in.

291
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:22,446
You know, it really would've been better
if we met over at Denny's.

292
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,616
What are you worried about?
I was in the neighborhood.

293
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,952
So, what's up?
Can I get you something?

294
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,954
Scotch, right?

295
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,294
Sent some of my guys down there
to start gutting the place.

296
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,504
One of the houses was a crack den.

297
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,798
- So?
- What "so"?

298
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,466
We gotta get them out of there.

299
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,302
Why didn't your guys roust them?

300
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,763
Oh, nice. Bunch of white guys
setting off caps in the ghetto.

301
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,516
That won't attract any attention at all.

302
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,643
What do you want me to do?

303
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,770
Exert some influence.
Make some calls.

304
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,982
Get the doughnut squad to
go down there and roust the shit-bags.

305
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,776
Tony, it's not that eas...

306
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,863
Hello, Tony.

307
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,825
How you doing, hon?

308
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,119
I'm very good.

309
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:15,333
No, I'm very well, thanks you very much.

310
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,296
She's taking a class at the community
college, English as a second language.

311
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:25,801
Well, you sound great.

312
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,015
Ronnie, I'll go make some lunch,
some egg salad.

313
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,975
Great. You hungry?

314
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,061
No.

315
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,688
Go light on the mayo.

316
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,196
Look...

317
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,532
...when you're dealing
with squatters' rights...

318
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,370
...or anything having to do with
the homeless, it can get very tricky.

319
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,206
What homeless? I saw them myself.
They're crackheads.

320
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,541
I understand. They're gumming up
the works.

321
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,669
But try to see the big picture.
The HUD approval came through.

322
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,381
In two weeks, we're looking at
a huge windfall.

323
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:08,177
See, that's why you're a politician
and not a businessman.

324
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,180
Maximum value is the big picture.

325
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,724
There must be $7000
of copper pipe in there...

326
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,810
...if they haven't taken it out already.

327
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,396
I still don't know
what you expect me to do.

328
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,524
Okay, all right, well...

329
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,692
...we'll take the 7 K
out of your end?

330
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,945
- Well, no, but...
- Come on, Ronnie.

331
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,239
University of Michigan.

332
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,075
Fucking figure it out.

333
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,874
Good dinner, baby.

334
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,215
Christopher.

335
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,802
Let's get married.

336
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,430
Whoa!

337
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,973
Where'd this come from?

338
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:58,269
I don't know. It's gonna be two years
we're engaged.

339
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,438
Let's just go down to City Hall.

340
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,275
City Hall? What are we, shlubs?

341
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,069
You said you wanted
a big wedding, anyway.

342
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,947
I don't care about that shit.

343
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,616
I just want you.

344
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,620
It'll be cheaper anyway.
We could buy a house.

345
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,789
Plus...

346
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,501
...a wife can't testify
against her husband.

347
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:32,470
You can't have a club, stay out all night
getting high when you have a kid.

348
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,606
What if we didn't have kids?

349
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,941
Fuck that! What's the point
of being married?

350
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,695
I mean, what if we can't?
If I can't?

351
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,615
Would you still love me?

352
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,535
Of course I'd still love you.

353
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,997
Why?

354
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,507
There's something you should know.

355
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:17,640
A long time ago, years ago,
I had a medical procedure.

356
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,559
It was before we met.

357
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,146
My uterus got pierced.

358
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,192
- Both of them?
- There's only one. That's ovaries.

359
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,028
So, what does that mean,
you can't get pregnant?

360
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,738
My doctor said it might be hard.

361
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,574
A friend gave me the name
of a specialist in Manhattan...

362
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:39,870
You knew you were damaged goods
and you never fucking told me?

363
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,332
- How could you call me that?
- Jesus-fucking-Christ!

364
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,376
How could you lie to me like that?

365
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,087
I tried to tell you once.
I wanted to.

366
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,714
I was afraid that you wouldn't propose.

367
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:56,262
You don't get it, Adriana. I don't have a
son, the Moltisanti name ends! That's it!

368
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,472
- We could adopt.
- Yeah, that's great!

369
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,100
Some kid with Chinky eyes
called Moltisanti!

370
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,060
He'd get his ass kicked every day!

371
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:08,065
- You said you'd still love me.
- That doesn't mean I'll marry you!

372
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:26,208
She's a great girl, Christopher.
You don't wanna lose this one.

373
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:31,589
T's right. You could have
more kids than the Kennedys.

374
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,008
If you're married to some twat,
what good is it?

375
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,968
Gotta have balance in a relationship.

376
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:40,097
I know all that, but what
if the kid thing never happens?

377
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,266
Come on, medicine today,
technology?

378
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,395
You want my advice?

379
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,481
And this is nothing about Ade
or anybody else.

380
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,525
Stay single as long as you can.

381
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,652
Come on. What are you saying?

382
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:58,282
Oh, no offense, but ask me,
marriage and our thing don't jive.

383
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,284
Everybody we know is married.

384
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,286
Not everybody.

385
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,958
- You love her, right?
- Yeah. You know.

386
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,252
Then do the right thing.

387
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,464
When the shoe was on the other foot,
your spleen...

388
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,592
...she stood by you, right?

389
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,470
What, do you wanna end up
like my Uncle Junior?

390
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,680
Or worse, like Paulie?

391
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,976
Exactly.

392
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,611
Thanks. I gotta go think about it.

393
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,613
All right.

394
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,683
- Ron!
- Hi, Lenore.

395
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,519
- What a nice surprise.
- We're overdue for that dinner...

396
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,563
...the four of us.
We absolutely are.

397
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,691
- Here they come.
- We're late for practice.

398
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,068
- He's in the den.
- Okay, thanks.

399
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,077
The fact is, Mo, these people
are criminals.

400
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,247
Addicts and dealers who've been
occupying that house illegally.

401
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,751
What about the police? Get the seller,
what's his name, the urologist.

402
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,753
- Let him call.
- They're crack addicts.

403
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,463
They'll be back in two hours.

404
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,049
The deal was for me to effectuate
the purchase of these houses, period.

405
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,261
- I realize that.
- Nobody mentioned violence.

406
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,638
We renounced it, remember?

407
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,224
When Eldridge went in
the codpiece business.

408
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,643
- I'm in a bind here, Mo.
- I appreciate that...

409
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,313
...but what can I do?
Get your people to handle it.

410
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:38,317
- What people?
- Well, we can't send whites in there.

411
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,780
People of color. You run a youth gang
outreach program, don't you?

412
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,741
- I'm on the board, Ron.
- Fine, I understand.

413
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,827
How about you take the 7000
this is costing out of your end?

414
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:52,623
Oh, come on. You know what I pay
in child support to my first wife.

415
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,625
The chances I'm taking
with this thing.

416
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,460
I'm putting it all on the line.

417
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:01,089
So you get some kids, gangbangers,
whatever. You throw them some money.

418
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:05,302
From a policing standpoint, it's just one
group of recidivists beating on another.

419
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,763
Stop trying to justify it, Ron.

420
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,140
It's about the 7 grand.

421
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,815
Let me tell you something else.

422
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:23,445
Guys like Tony, you don't fool around
with these people.

423
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,665
My son.

424
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,459
I don't know what he understands.

425
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,670
I'm trying to tell him
about the immigrants.

426
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,213
He talks about room service.

427
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,759
We need to talk about
your recent behavior in here.

428
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,845
Your angry tirade?

429
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,306
You wanna talk about that now?
That was weeks ago.

430
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,517
It was my judgment that, at the time...

431
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,688
...you were in crisis
about Gloria's suicide.

432
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,400
Didn't you get the flowers I sent?

433
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,028
Your behavior was unacceptable,
Anthony.

434
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,365
You cannot have these outbursts
and expect to redeem yourself...

435
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,410
...with an FTD bouquet.

436
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,370
I'm sorry, all right?

437
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,207
It's good that you're sorry,
but no, it's not all right.

438
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,376
We've been down this road before.

439
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:24,172
- I know, I know.
- The fact that you're angry is fine.

440
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,675
And it's okay to talk about your anger.

441
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,554
But when it manifests itself
in physicality...

442
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,890
...it becomes unacceptable.

443
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,558
I never laid a finger on you.

444
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,727
You loomed.

445
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,729
You threw my tissue holder.

446
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,607
Yeah, and then I picked it up.

447
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,113
- I was very upset. You lied to me.
- I did not lie to you.

448
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:52,409
You withheld information
about a very sensitive subject.

449
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,079
All right, look.

450
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:00,334
I know what I did was wrong, okay?

451
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:05,130
And you may not believe this,
but I did exercise impulse control.

452
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,091
And I have been controlling my anger.

453
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,801
This thing with my son.

454
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:13,430
I showed him the old neighborhood,
and we got accosted by crackheads.

455
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,934
One of them had a gun. And
the other one threw a bottle at my car.

456
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:21,271
Now it may not sound like much,
but I let it go. I drove away.

457
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,775
Well, in the future I'll ask
that you extend to me...

458
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:29,112
...the same courtesy
you would a crack addict.

459
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:42,125
All right, as long as we're being
truthful here, you know, opening up...

460
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:46,672
...I've been holding a grudge against you
for recommending that Wendi Kobler.

461
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,799
That half-assed adolescent shrink.

462
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,886
That stupid bitch almost sent
my daughter to Barcelona.

463
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:01,186
You're right, it's no excuse.
It's no excuse.

464
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,775
I knew I hit something last night
when I turned off the road.

465
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,861
Up and at 'em, lieutenant.

466
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,863
How was your ride?

467
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,866
- Busted brake line.
- Yeah, what's it look like?

468
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,369
Like a busted brake line, man.

469
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,205
- Good morning, honey.
- Can you fix it, B.A?

470
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,708
Gonna try. Thanks, Hannibal.

471
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,877
- I need those.
- What do you need my tools for?

472
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:30,340
Get my hands on the tape
that'll prove Calvin Cutter's a murderer.

473
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,634
I'm not gonna leave the county
without proof.

474
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:36,847
The tape ain't gonna do us any good
if we can't get out the county with it.

475
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,984
Listen, I've been doing some thinking.

476
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,695
The kid thing and all.

477
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,406
I'm not happy that you lied to me...

478
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,243
...but I think I wanna try
and deal with it.

479
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,581
Really?

480
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:07,544
I love you, Adriana.
I want you in my life.

481
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,881
I love you too, Christopher.

482
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,392
Are you high?

483
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,103
You gotta start with that now?

484
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,523
- I just wanna be sure it's real.
- It is real.

485
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,276
I love you.

486
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,242
When can we get married?

487
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,579
I was thinking maybe our anniversary
we could go to Vegas.

488
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,760
Vegas? Wanna get married
by some Elvis impersonator?

489
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,805
- We would save money at least.
- No, it's a sacrament, Ade.

490
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,599
Why don't we have it here,
all your friends could come?

491
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,102
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we'll have it in the great room...

492
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,605
...or in the yard even, if it's nice out.
We can have Artie cater it.

493
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,066
Christopher's gonna ask
Tony to be his best man.

494
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,818
I am sure he will be honored.

495
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,279
- Does your mother know yet?
- You're the first person I've told.

496
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,782
We'll decorate the whole house
with mums.

497
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,951
And you will not save any money
in Vegas.

498
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,413
My cousin Jackie and her husband,
Tommy, 60,000 at blackjack.

499
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,334
- I'm getting married!
- I know!

500
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,305
- What's up?
- Give me some of that. One of them.

501
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,446
Remember, just shoot the ceiling
and shit. No 187s.

502
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,404
Get the fuck out my house,
motherfuckers!

503
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,659
Get out and stay out!

504
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,000
Hey, mister, mister.

505
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,045
I'll kill you, come around here, bitch.

506
00:36:55,254 --> 00:37:00,217
- Don't come back here no more.
- Get out before we kill your asses, nigga!

507
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,231
Fucker's got a 9!

508
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,737
Yeah.

509
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,200
All right.

510
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,749
Don't come around here no more.

511
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,386
That's my brother.

512
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,222
Angelo.

513
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,936
Get out of here, you filthy bitch!

514
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,903
Go, go, go!

515
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:12,289
I told you young people that crack
is some bad shit.

516
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,013
Dr. Fried, 1,300,000.

517
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,808
Mr. Tiffen, you take possession
as of today.

518
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,145
Good luck now, and congratulations.

519
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,605
Thank you, doctor.

520
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,624
- It's for you.
- What's this?

521
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,502
It's a music box.

522
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:05,258
Holy shit! A Patek?

523
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,887
Yeah, me and Ralph got lucky
on a new real-estate investment.

524
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,472
You actually did it?

525
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,643
- I was just speculating. I never meant...
- Relax. Your name'll never come up.

526
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,563
No, it's not that. I mean,
the American taxpayers are...

527
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,150
The American taxpayers pay for
airport security. Look how that's going.

528
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,903
Give me a fucking break.

529
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,075
This is, like, a $15,000 watch, Tony.
I can't take this.

530
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,827
It's just a little thank-you, that's all.

531
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,913
A.J., what are you doing down there?

532
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,666
It's me, Carm, down here with Bri.

533
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,670
- I'm just borrowing some tools.
- All right.

534
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,882
Thank you for this, really.

535
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,094
I gotta get dressed.

536
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,406
Furio, hi, good morning.

537
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,074
Good morning.

538
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,410
Come in. What are you doing
out in the cold?

539
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,579
Today I'll wait in the car, I think.

540
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,415
Why, don't you want some coffee?

541
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,584
The motor is acting funny.

542
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,255
I need to keep my foot
on the gas pedal.

543
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:30,218
Well, okay. I was looking forward
to seeing those pictures, though.

544
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,432
Okay, I'll let Tony know you're here.

545
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,947
Furio's here.

546
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,283
You doing some work on the house?

547
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:59,122
Yeah, you know, sinking
some anchors for a wall mirror.

548
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,970
Thank you.

549
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,265
How's the mousse?

550
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,476
Fucking great.

551
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:24,772
I tell you, the shit you miss
when you're inside?

552
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,152
There was a week where I would've
killed for some Good & Plenties.

553
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,196
Should've told me.

554
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,490
I would've sent you some.

555
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,950
I know you would.

556
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,660
See, that's the thing, though.

557
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,164
What I need's not your problem.

558
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,125
- What do you mean?
- Fucking Tony.

559
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,378
Four months I'm up there like
the Man in the Iron Mask.

560
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,715
Not one visit, not even
a fucking phone call.

561
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,509
The guy didn't reach out at all?

562
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,969
John, when do I ever complain?

563
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,932
Paulie, look, the guy's a boss.

564
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:05,355
You visit a guy in the can these days...
You know the feds.

565
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,192
You give someone the time of day,
it's a criminal conspiracy.

566
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,444
So he can't phone?
You fucking did.

567
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,700
Even before I left, he was treating me
like the ugly girl at the dance.

568
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,913
I'm sucking wind, and he's rolling in it
with that fucking Christ-killer.

569
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,873
- Hesh?
- Fucking Zellman.

570
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,501
Fucking real-estate scam.

571
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,504
The Frelinghuysen Avenue thing.

572
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,340
We had some words.

573
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,760
- Tony made it right.
- It's a different one now.

574
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,679
I'm not sure what it is.

575
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,014
All I know is, Ralphie's going around...

576
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,725
...bragging about how much
they're making.

577
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,405
Listen, John, I know we talk sometimes.

578
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,533
I tell you my problems.
You tell me yours.

579
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,369
And I have the highest regards
for Carmine.

580
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,246
He thinks the world of you also.

581
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,749
Even still, this shit don't leave
the table, right?

582
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,211
I'm hurt that you even have to ask.

583
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,471
As far as we know, Loretta,
those transformers are safe...

584
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,974
...but like I said,
I'll propose an ad hoc study.

585
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,436
- Thank you, assemblyman.
- Okay, bye-bye.

586
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,481
Mr. Olmstead called regarding lunch...

587
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,776
...and you've got
the zoning hearing at 4.

588
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,907
I'll call him later.
I'm gonna make a stop.

589
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,451
I'll see you at the office...

590
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,662
...and make sure she's on the list
for the fundraiser.

591
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,794
What's this, go to your cousins?

592
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,631
No, Verrazano Salvage. Ask for Gene.

593
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,508
Don't forget the fireplace mantles
and the wall sconces.

594
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,677
Go downtown, yuppies
pay top dollar for it.

595
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,138
We're on it, Ton. Don't worry.

596
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,807
Tony, hey.

597
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,603
Assemblyman, what brings you
to beautiful downtown Newark?

598
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,980
Meeting with one of my constituents.

599
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,815
You gonna be at the Bing tomorrow?

600
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,817
I don't know yet.

601
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,320
Maybe I'll see you over there, then.

602
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,614
Maybe you will.

603
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,208
Is it gonna be a nice house here now?

604
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,726
I'm taking it. I'll put it on my card,
okay? It's with my clothes.

605
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,187
Of course. I'll get the seamstress.

606
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:55,233
Can't believe you're finally doing this.
So sudden too.

607
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,528
The best part is gonna be seeing
how much people give us.

608
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,531
Lisa told me at her and Ricky's wedding,
Bobby Canzoneri...

609
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,033
...didn't even cover his plate.
Shut up.

610
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,869
Forty dollars in an envelope.
Not even a card.

611
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,373
I'll tell you, the main thing
about getting married...

612
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,835
...I can never be called to testify.
What do you mean?

613
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,839
- A wife can't testify against a husband.
- Oh, right, right.

614
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,175
Actually, though, I don't think
that's actually true.

615
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,429
- What do you mean?
- They did a Murder, She Wrote about it.

616
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:28,224
See, this butler thought his wife
couldn't testify against her husband.

617
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,352
But it turns out,
legally, she actually could.

618
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,737
To claim marital privilege,
three conditions must be met.

619
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,573
First, the communication must be
made during marriage.

620
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,576
Anything said before you were married
is fair game.

621
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,370
Two, the communication
must involve only the spouses.

622
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,039
The presence of a third party
destroys the privilege.

623
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,376
Three, the communication can't
be made in furtherance of a crime.

624
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:59,088
Oh, my God, it's a simple question.
Can they make me testify or not?

625
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,592
The short answer? Probably.

626
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:07,054
In an organized crime, a RICO, the feds'll
spend a fortune putting on their case.

627
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,683
Believe me, if they want you to testify,
they're gonna find a way.

628
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:16,272
Here you go, 10 percent apiece.

629
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,941
Technically, it's a little less...

630
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:23,196
...but our friend rounded you up
to an even 60 G's.

631
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,949
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

632
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,620
There's a lot of poor families need
affordable housing in Newark.

633
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,800
Ronnie, listen...

634
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,303
...I been wanting to say this.

635
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,971
No hard feelings, huh?

636
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,307
No, of course not.

637
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,018
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

638
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,604
You're just being...

639
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,439
You're being awfully quiet.

640
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,983
I don't know, tired.

641
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,323
- You ever feel bad about any of this?
- What do you mean?

642
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,660
When I think about
where we started out.

643
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,454
I used to think what I did
made a difference.

644
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:17,124
The anti-drug programs,
the voter drives.

645
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:21,546
But over the years, it's like shoveling
shit against the tide, you know that.

646
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,756
I guess.

647
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:28,219
Yeah, you... You cut corners,
but you help out.

648
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,471
Do the best you can.

649
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,182
Hey, if it ain't us, it's gonna be
somebody else.

650
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:38,187
Really, I mean, what are we supposed
to be, the only honest men?

651
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,857
We were gonna lead a revolution,
Maurice.

652
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,859
Revolution.

653
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,528
The revolution got sold, Ronnie.

654
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,197
You heard the Beatles for H&R Block?

655
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,534
Sometimes I feel like I
should be punished.

656
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,370
Come on, let's get something to eat.

657
00:47:56,164 --> 00:48:00,084
Well, here's something
I never thought I'd say:

658
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,379
To the federal government.

659
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,967
Depends on which department.

660
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,562
A cappuccino maker. This is great.

661
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,523
Oh, is that the Capresso?
You are gonna love that, Ade.

662
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,610
Cappuccino now.
He used to drink Bosco.

663
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:29,238
I got it at Fortunoff's
if you want to exchange it.

664
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,955
Oh, no, no, no scissors!

665
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,708
Bad luck.

666
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,763
That's from me. I can't count
how many cheese-melts...

667
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,933
...I've made for Silvio in that thing.

668
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,230
Here, open this one, Ade.

669
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,200
Tony?

670
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,037
You got anything to drink?

671
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,757
Tony?

672
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,469
What's going on?

673
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,889
What's up?

674
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:08,397
- Why don't you just calm down and...
- I'm perfectly calm.

675
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,900
- We can talk about what's bothering you.
- Yeah?

676
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,860
Tony, this is crazy.

677
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,695
Tony! Tony!

678
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,282
Come on! Fuck!

679
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,243
Tony, no!

680
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,913
Tony!

681
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,749
Tony!

682
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:35,257
All the girls in New Jersey,
you had to fuck this one?

683
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:39,261
Go ahead, cry like a bitch.

684
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,412
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.

685
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,916
Ronnie.
