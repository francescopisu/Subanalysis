1
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,447
So she's a dancer, right?
Broadway, summer stock, all that shit.

2
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,575
Who was telling me, Ginny...
Used to do a little dancing, right?

3
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,578
Taught ballet, years ago.

4
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,878
- Who's that?
- Nobody. Jersey.

5
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,047
Ralph Cifaretto's crew.

6
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,550
Anyway, I go over to her house
one night...

7
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,553
...she's dressed like a fucking cat,
like from that show.

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,764
Eye makeup, claws, the whole bit.

9
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,892
You okay?

10
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,149
Pardon me a minute, huh?

11
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,414
Hey. Donny, right?

12
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,916
John, how you doing?

13
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,587
What's the matter?
Not funny anymore?

14
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,965
- Bitch! You're fucking funny, huh?
- John!

15
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,094
- What's the matter with you? Please!
- Can't shut your mouth?

16
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,139
Funny, huh?

17
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,602
- Funny? Funny?
- Whoa, whoa, John! What the fuck?

18
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,273
- What'd he do?
- He's a cunt! A sorry sack of shit!

19
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,527
- Come on, let me get you out of here.
- No, no. Please.

20
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:20,949
Scumbag, let me buy you a drink.

21
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,288
What the fuck?

22
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,342
John?

23
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,518
- John?
- What are you doing still up?

24
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,313
Penny Serenade was on AMC.

25
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,858
John, your coat!
Is that the Burberry?

26
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,818
Oh, my God, what happened?

27
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,987
Nothing. I tripped.

28
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,323
- You tripped where?
- I don't know.

29
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,660
- The steps by Carmine's.
- John, your hand is bleeding.

30
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,998
I used it to break my fall. Jesus,
what is this, the Inquisition now?

31
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,168
I had a few cognacs.

32
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,837
Go to sleep.

33
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,223
For tax-deferred growth the annuity's
fine, but if I'm hearing you right...

34
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,642
...liquidity's the real concern?

35
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,063
Well, we do occasionally need
ready access to our money.

36
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,233
Honestly, guys, I'd recommend
a life insurance trust.

37
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,695
That, coupled with a growth-oriented
reallocation of your assets.

38
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,864
Including an assortment
of other investment vehicles.

39
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,574
What, like classic cars?

40
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,868
No. Stocks, bonds...

41
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,538
I think he's pulling your leg, Brian.

42
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,040
I gotta remember that one.

43
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,044
So great, we'll open an account,
get the paperwork started and...

44
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,381
Brian, look, no offense.

45
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,218
I know we're family,
but let me think about it.

46
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,262
Run it by my accountant.

47
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,390
Ginsberg? He's a CPA.
He's not an investment advisor.

48
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,892
Whatever, he knows about this stuff.

49
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,979
You know what? Talk to your
accountant. Two heads, huh?

50
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,941
- Dad, it's Uncle Sil!
- I gotta get that.

51
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,943
Say hello to Janelle.

52
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,612
I'll walk you out, Bri.

53
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,952
Hang it up, A.J!

54
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,122
Hey.

55
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,750
What happened?

56
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,769
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

57
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,313
What the fuck, John?

58
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,441
- I got nothing to say.
- You got nothing to say?

59
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,443
That fucking kid is in intensive care.

60
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,612
I thought he worked for Ralph.

61
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,782
And Ralph works for me.
So I ask you again, what the fuck?

62
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,284
Let it suffice that I know
and Carmine knows...

63
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,120
...that foppy cocksucker's
holding out on us.

64
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,541
Fernandez Paving, Ralph's contracting
company. We went over the receipts...

65
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:21,338
...for waterproofing at the Esplanade.
Ralph's more creative than Spielberg.

66
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,342
He's off almost four grand,
third time in a row now.

67
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,637
We agreed, no looting the job site.

68
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,139
First of all, that hasn't
been established.

69
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,559
Second of all, this is
how you handle it?

70
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,647
- Consider it a message.
- He's in Miami.

71
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,192
- They got phones down there.
- He's got a bad history, Tony.

72
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,569
Cute cocksucker could wind up dead.

73
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,366
What are you saying here?

74
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,040
He's a two-faced fucking prick.

75
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,168
- I thought Ralph was your friend.
- Right, that's rich.

76
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,505
Did you hear what my friend
said about my wife?

77
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,883
He made a crack about Ginny's weight.
Something about her having...

78
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,303
...a 90-pound mole on her ass.

79
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,309
Well, that's...

80
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,312
That's deplorable.

81
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,398
Who told you this?

82
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,400
What's important is that it was said.

83
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,193
If he said it, I didn't hear it.

84
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,530
He knows better than to make
a remark like that when I'm around.

85
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,451
She's fighting a weight problem
since the kids were born.

86
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,955
Weight Watchers, Richard Simmons,
fasting.

87
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,915
She works very fucking hard.

88
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,418
- You're telling me?
- It's different for women.

89
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,880
Body image, self-esteem.

90
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,258
I'll tell you, though...

91
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,554
...I never had a problem
with Ginny's weight.

92
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,558
To me, she's beautiful.

93
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,728
Rubenesque.

94
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,482
That woman is my life.

95
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,777
To think she's being mocked...

96
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,364
All right, look, John...

97
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,785
...I'm not gonna sit here and deny
that Ralph can be a fucking asshole.

98
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,872
And that was a horrible thing to say.

99
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:24,503
But even if it was said, you can't be
serious about him winding up...

100
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,756
- You know.
- She's the mother of my children.

101
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,425
I know she is, John. I know she is.

102
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,929
At least hear Ralph out.

103
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,431
How long we go back, huh?

104
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,391
All of us?

105
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,269
The kid last night...

106
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,271
...he was laughing.

107
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,023
About this?

108
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,817
I don't know.

109
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,445
All right.

110
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,113
You're right.

111
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,825
It's just been sticking in my craw.

112
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,164
So this kid gonna be okay?

113
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,292
I don't know. He's still unconscious.

114
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,630
My fucking temper.
Is he married, children, anything?

115
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,340
Lives with his mother.

116
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,637
I'll send her something nice.

117
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,649
I'm surprised he didn't call you.
Who knows? Maybe he'll be right back.

118
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,028
One sugar, right?

119
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,913
So how are things at Casa del Furio?

120
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,206
Ehh.

121
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,709
The Pakistani, the neighbor.

122
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,671
I want to make my garage into the
guesthouse, so my parents can visit.

123
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,049
He says to me because
of the rules I cannot do it.

124
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,218
Right, right, the zoning.

125
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,430
The man who sells me the house,
he says nothing.

126
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:05,186
As far as I remember, once title
has passed, you have no legal recourse.

127
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:09,983
Anyway, next week, I make a party
for the housewarm.

128
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,694
What a nice idea.

129
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,238
This is my real-estate exam.

130
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,533
There's one more prep course
I wanna take.

131
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,913
So next Sunday is the party.

132
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,291
We will be there.

133
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,754
Now, here, you see?

134
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:35,634
"Except in cases of demonstrable fraud,
transfer of title is binding...

135
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,429
...once the grantee registers the deed
with the county clerk."

136
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,060
Some people say college only serves
to show grad schools...

137
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,604
...you've managed to show up
four years in a row.

138
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,816
But volunteering at the Law Center
actually allows you to make a difference.

139
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,278
Last year, with our help,
over half a dozen crack babies...

140
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,656
...were reunited
with their natural mothers...

141
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,075
...several of whom are now in recovery.

142
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,452
Eventually with the help
of ACLU attorneys...

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,247
...you'll be filing court papers
and helping with legal research.

144
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:10,627
There's a sign-up sheet and some fliers
if you're interested. Thanks.

145
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,425
That's so true what you said about
college being an audition for grad school.

146
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:21,096
So much for higher learning, huh?
Living in the moment.

147
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,767
Check out the Law Center.
There's some really cool people there.

148
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,943
There were 15 guys at the dinner
when Ralph told that joke.

149
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,861
Could be anybody flapping their gums.

150
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,780
What I don't get is why.

151
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,826
- What's the upside of telling Johnny?
- To get in good with New York.

152
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,619
Loose lips sink ships.

153
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,789
First Johnny knows about flipping
the property by the Esplanade.

154
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,083
Now this shit.

155
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,836
How about Patsy?

156
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,964
He's had issues.
Maybe he's holding a grudge.

157
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,883
- Oh, you really think he's that cagey?
- Albert, then.

158
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,468
Wait a minute.

159
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,847
What if Vesuvio's bugged and
the fucking feds told Johnny?

160
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,182
- Conspiracy theories now?
- Why not?

161
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,852
Create a little dysentery
among the ranks?

162
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,563
First of all, the place is swept
once a week.

163
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,232
Second of all, there's
a lot more interesting shit...

164
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,819
...being talked about in there
besides Ginny Sack's fat ass.

165
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,740
Sil, the liquor inspector's here.

166
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,714
What do you think?

167
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,841
It's not possible, right?

168
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,927
Silvio talking to Johnny?

169
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,389
You never know, T.

170
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,524
Jason's always been
a well-adjusted young man.

171
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,401
So why now, Elliot?

172
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,114
Three years at Bard and suddenly
now as a senior this epic drift.

173
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,617
No focus, no drive.

174
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,622
He's actually talked about dropping out
and joining the Forestry Service.

175
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,458
Well, some people thrive on solitude.

176
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,589
Senior year. There's something
about the light...

177
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,550
...at the end of that tunnel
that can be very frightening.

178
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,887
Saskia's a senior.
Is she going through any of this?

179
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,058
Sask has always been highly motivated,
kineahora.

180
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,268
Where's Richard in all this anyway?

181
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,940
Jason barely speaks to him anymore.

182
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,318
- Since when?
- Right after the rape.

183
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,614
Jason may be feeling
guilty himself, Jen.

184
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,617
He's powerless to avenge you...

185
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,913
...and resents his father
for the same shortcomings.

186
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,127
- Oh!
- Hey, George Hamilton.

187
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,755
How's the back?

188
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,591
The masseuse down there, the Del Rey?

189
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,427
Magic fucking fingers.

190
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,097
- Tony call?
- On his way.

191
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:14,310
- He know you broke up with his sister?
- No, no. Not unless she told him.

192
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,938
- You know what that bitch was into?
- What?

193
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:22,277
She wanted to stick a dildo up my ass,
make believe she was pimping me out.

194
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,488
I told her, "Get the fuck out of here!"

195
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,324
- What the fuck?
- Whole family's nuts.

196
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,161
- Hi.
- Hey, Ton.

197
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,831
Hey!

198
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,625
- How are you?
- Hey, Ton.

199
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,627
How you doing?

200
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:45,341
Fellas, take this shit to my house.
Open some windows, air the place out.

201
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,639
For you. Florida's finest.

202
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,517
Thanks.

203
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,645
How's Donny K?

204
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,398
I was just asking them about that.

205
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,985
I gotta get over there,
get the full report.

206
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,196
Any idea who's writing
the family gossip column?

207
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:12,493
Funny thing about that, Ton, I don't
remember saying anything about Ginny.

208
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,163
Come on, Ralph.
I was sitting right there.

209
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,584
Then maybe I said something. I forget.
There was a lot of wine that night.

210
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,836
What about the land deal?
Frelinghuysen?

211
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,506
You forget and tell him that you,
me and Zellman made all that money?

212
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,842
Did I tell him about it? No.

213
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,011
But I sure as shit ended up
paying for it.

214
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,264
When you think about it,
Johnny's got some balls.

215
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,101
Big house, lining his pocket
with our hard-earned cash?

216
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,896
Who's he think's keeping
that fat bitch in Devil Dogs?

217
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,732
Whatever he is, he's also
Carmine's underboss...

218
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,901
...so you're gonna fucking placate him.

219
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,529
Oh, what, apologize?

220
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,865
No, you do that it'll be worse.

221
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:56,579
Whoever told him this,
it's your word against theirs.

222
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,624
You're highly fucking outraged.

223
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,716
- Hello?
- Hello, sweetie. It's your secret admirer.

224
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,636
- Is he there?
- Oh, hi, Ralph. One sec.

225
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,056
John, Ralph Cifaretto!

226
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,854
- I'll take it in there.
- Okay, honey.

227
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,067
- Yeah?
- John, it's me.

228
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,485
And?

229
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,238
And I'm calling to tell you
how appalled I am.

230
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,573
I just got back. I talked to Tony.

231
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,243
I love Ginny. I would never say
anything like that.

232
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,412
- That's not what I heard.
- From who?

233
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,163
From who, John?

234
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,749
I don't betray confidences.
Are you denying it?

235
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,252
Fuck yes, I'm denying I said it.

236
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,092
I don't believe you.

237
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,929
Just tell me who said this.
I'll put a bullet in their fucking eye.

238
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,931
You're a real weasel, you know that?

239
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,271
John, please.

240
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,900
Look, last year, when Tony and I had
our thing, that misunderstanding...

241
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,362
...you were the voice of reason.

242
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,990
You were the one that told me
to apologize.

243
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,324
So you're apologizing?

244
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,618
No.

245
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,120
If that's what it takes.

246
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,706
Why would you?
I thought you didn't say it.

247
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,042
- I didn't say it.
- You know something, Ralph?

248
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,003
Not only are you a thief,
you're a lying, fucking prick.

249
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,965
I should've let Tony chop
your head off a year ago.

250
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,935
What did I say? No apology!

251
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,524
I want you to sanction a hit
on Ralph Cifaretto.

252
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,152
What, are you fucking kidding me?

253
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,737
He violated my wife's honor.

254
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,530
Ralph slept with Ginny?

255
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,202
He insulted her.
He made a very insensitive joke...

256
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,205
...about her body
to some friends of ours.

257
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,248
- What did he say?
- I have to repeat it?

258
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,836
- My word's not good enough?
- Not if you want him clipped over it.

259
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,883
He said...

260
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:19,347
...she was having a 90-pound mole
removed from her ass.

261
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,895
The implication was her ass
is so big...

262
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,190
...she could have a mole that size
removed from it.

263
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,861
It's an off-color remark.
It was highly inappropriate.

264
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,864
You want, I'll demand he's taxed.

265
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,408
But clip him?

266
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,121
Is it all just about money?

267
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,749
I'll crack him good.
I'll ask for 200 grand.

268
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,418
Two hundred grand for insulting
my wife. What's next?

269
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,421
- He gets to fuck her for a million?
- He wants to fuck her?

270
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,718
I'm making a point! I'm talking about
my wife's honor here. My honor!

271
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,731
We depend on this guy.
There are millions of dollars at stake.

272
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,484
We can't afford it, John.

273
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,487
A roomful of guys making fun
of my wife...

274
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,073
...and you're not gonna let me deal
with this?

275
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,910
Not that way.
My answer's gotta be no.

276
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,002
I wanna sit down, then, with Ralph,
the fucking thief.

277
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,090
Get this Fernandez Paving
bullshit dealt with.

278
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,647
He was accused of a crime
of severe immorality.

279
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,358
They actually beat him for it
with sticks.

280
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,821
The truth was, he had a photograph
of Britney Spears with his belongings.

281
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,490
That's horrible.

282
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,329
Dad?

283
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,709
Thought I was in the wrong place.

284
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,337
What are you doing here?

285
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,006
I was looking for a glass of milk
to dunk these in...

286
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,800
...and I thought maybe you could
help me out.

287
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,306
Got a meeting in the city later.

288
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,141
Rahimah, this is my dad.

289
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,893
- How you doing?
- Hello.

290
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,687
- Want a doughnut?
- No, thanks.

291
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:35,650
- Well, I'll see you later, Meadow?
- Okay, Rahimah.

292
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:55,711
So, what's this your mother tells me
about you joining the Legal Aid Society?

293
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,090
South Bronx Law Center.
I'm volunteering.

294
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,177
They provide free legal counsel
for the indigent and disenfranchised.

295
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,764
And this Rahoomi, she's what,
your first client?

296
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,685
What happened to being a pediatrician?

297
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,896
I thought that was a great field
for you, the way you love kids.

298
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,275
Nothing happened to it.
I can't explore some career options?

299
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,027
Oh, defending fare beaters is a career?

300
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,072
Is that why you came here,
to annoy me?

301
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,868
Hey, you wanna help people. That's fine.
That's... That's very noble.

302
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,622
Really, I mean it.

303
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,875
Just don't be a sucker.
A lot of these indigenous types...

304
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:39,755
...they got plenty of money to smoke
crack and gamble and all that shit.

305
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,383
You ought to know.

306
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,220
Oh, I see. That's what this is, huh?

307
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,391
You're working with minorities now to
get back at me for being mean to Noel.

308
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,060
God, listen to you.

309
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:57,606
Believe it or not, the world
doesn't revolve around you.

310
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,619
Come on, let's...
Let's go to the bookstore.

311
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:14,707
You probably need a sweatshirt
or something.

312
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,353
Oh.

313
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,277
Hey, take it easy!

314
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,137
How was the traffic?

315
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,181
Tunnel was a little backed up.

316
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,142
This time of day, GW,
you zip right over.

317
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:23,067
All right, let's straighten this out.

318
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,531
I talked to the guy over at
Fernandez Paving, the accountant.

319
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,492
Fernandez's been using
this jerk for years.

320
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,286
Anyway, it turns out you're right.

321
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,289
He's adding 50 gallons of sealant
every 1000 yards.

322
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,834
Excuse me. I can't do this.

323
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,420
- What?
- John, what's wrong?

324
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,755
I can't listen to this bullshit.

325
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,174
- I'm trying to explain.
- Fuck you!

326
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,260
- John, please...
- Don't fucking "John" me!

327
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,930
- Hey, hey, we're trying to settle this.
- It's not about that.

328
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:57,685
I'm sorry, Carmine. I can't be
in the same room with this man.

329
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,698
Have you talked
to Jason La Penna lately?

330
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,827
Actually, I try not to.
When I came out, he acted all weird.

331
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,204
I can't believe I actually
kissed him once.

332
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,540
His mother tells me he's having
a rough time.

333
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,877
Jen? Please.
I'm sure she's overreacting.

334
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,254
Apparently he's talked
about dropping out.

335
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,799
He's okay, but Jason is like
the cliché psychiatrist's kid.

336
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,429
Slightest bump in the road, he knows
exactly what to say to get attention.

337
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,562
Hey.

338
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,606
Is there any of that crumb cake left?

339
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,066
Counter.

340
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,908
What's all that?

341
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,744
I'm consolidating some bills.

342
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,378
Maybe you don't care about
our future, Tony, but I do.

343
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,507
Where do you get that I don't care?
I met with your cousin.

344
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,511
Yeah, you met with Brian. You sat there
eating cake and making wisecracks.

345
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,180
It's boring to me, okay?

346
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,313
You gonna cry now?

347
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,276
What the hell is wrong with you?

348
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,153
When you ignore me, Tony...

349
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:35,824
...when you trivialize things important
to me, like our financial security...

350
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,118
...it makes me feel unloved.

351
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,330
That's your problem there,
because you equate love with money!

352
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,459
No, you equate love with money!

353
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,689
- Is it safe?
- We each got a new cell phone.

354
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:10,150
Talk on it once, you toss it.
Totally untraceable.

355
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,861
It's what the Taliban used to do.

356
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,532
Let's get started. My daughter-in-law's
coming here with the baby later.

357
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,329
Hello?

358
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,374
- Is he there?
- Yeah, Ton.

359
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,544
Okay, you're all set.
Just talk into there.

360
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,463
- Junior?
- Who's that? Tony?

361
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,008
Junior, it's Carmine. How you doing?

362
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,177
I'm going to the poorhouse,
that's how I'm doing.

363
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,848
When you had that RICO trial,
what'd that run you?

364
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,349
- A lot.
- Where you going?

365
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:46,020
I told you I gotta pick up Sophia.

366
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,859
Junior, can we do this already?

367
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,987
Yeah. Yeah, right.

368
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,990
Johnny and Ralph Cifaretto, right?

369
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,618
- Ralph insulted John's wife?
- That's correct.

370
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,121
- Who's on the wire now?
- It's John, Corrado.

371
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,250
So, what did Ralph do exactly?

372
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,045
He made a very hurtful remark,
not worth repeating.

373
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,465
It's not important.
Let's just agree it was unkind.

374
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,719
Let's point out, too, that it's only
been alleged something was said.

375
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:23,724
He "allegedly" said what he said
to a group of people, friends of ours.

376
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,893
If you weren't there,
how do you know?

377
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,561
I'm not at liberty to say.

378
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,897
All due respect, but this is bullshit.

379
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,400
Someone in my family's talking,
and you're not at liberty to say?

380
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,904
- I should be making the beef here.
- My nephew's right.

381
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,949
Let's stick to the issue. A horrible
insult was made against Ginny.

382
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,743
End of fucking story.

383
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,789
- What does he want done about it?
- I wanna avenge her honor. It's my right.

384
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:51,585
All right, fine. You tell me who told
you about it, we'll bring him in here.

385
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:56,924
He corroborates what you're saying,
I'll give you Ralph on a platter.

386
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,640
Is nothing sacred? I mean, this is
my wife we're talking about here.

387
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,602
If this were years ago, would
I even have had to ask?

388
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,438
I mean, what's happened to this thing?

389
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,441
For God's sake, we bend more rules
than the Catholic Church.

390
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,777
All right, look.

391
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:22,366
Let's assume for the sake of argument
Ralph said what you think he said.

392
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,786
- Is clipping him gonna unring that bell?
- Nobody's getting clipped.

393
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,081
- I want satisfaction.
- Will you accept an apology?

394
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,793
- That ship has sailed.
- You're being unreasonable, John.

395
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,295
Ralph's the only one
who can handle the Esplanade?

396
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,465
- Put Pontecorvo in there.
- There are millions at stake.

397
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,343
- Again with the money?
- Yeah, again with the money.

398
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:45,973
It's settled, John. So either name
a price or get the fuck over it.

399
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,990
John?

400
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,995
What would you say to a piece
of Ralph's company?

401
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:13,375
John? Just think about it at least.

402
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,393
- Hello?
- It's me.

403
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,353
What, are you still asleep?

404
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,523
No, I was doing something.

405
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,525
I took John to dinner last night.

406
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,778
Ralph's got a big problem, kid.

407
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,905
- I thought you squashed it.
- I did.

408
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,574
Problem is, I don't know
if John's hearing me.

409
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,536
- So, what are you gonna do about it?
- Me? Nothing.

410
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:53,290
- What does that mean?
- I didn't say nothing.

411
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,209
We share the Esplanade, Tony.

412
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,753
I don't want that apple cart upset.

413
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,047
Then somebody should do
something about it.

414
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,258
I appreciate your thoughts.

415
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,305
You saying what I think you're saying?

416
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,933
I didn't say nothing.

417
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,105
All right, then. I'll talk to you.

418
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,823
Twenty years I been friends with John.
Now he's gotta go.

419
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,742
All over a stupid joke.

420
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,670
I was fucking around.

421
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:44,132
For chrissakes! You never made
a joke about Ginny Sack?

422
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,093
- Not like that.
- Of course not.

423
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,637
Yeah, well, fuck him
and his highfalutin bullshit.

424
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,931
Who does he think he is,
Sir Walter Raleigh?

425
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,976
That's enough of you and
your stupid fucking remarks!

426
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:57,855
Go back to Miami and play volleyball,
whatever the fuck you do down there...

427
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,315
...while we clean up your fucking mess!

428
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,485
Maybe even keep your ass alive.

429
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,292
A mole on her ass?

430
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,627
What's the joke? I still don't get it.

431
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:26,383
It's not a joke, per se. It's...
You had to be there.

432
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,469
Real lack of standards, your generation.

433
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,640
My day, John was right. A man would
never stand for a remark like that.

434
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,684
Fucked up thing is, I don't like Ralph.

435
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,478
If he were drowning,
I'd throw him a cinder block.

436
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,772
But not protect one of my own captains?

437
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,319
Besides, it's too late anyway.

438
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,863
Carmine gave me the nod.

439
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,490
On Johnny?

440
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,368
That one's a slippery fuck, huh?

441
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,830
Him and those big fish lips of his?

442
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,875
Look at this.

443
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:04,504
The fifth question, and the poor prick
used all his lifelines.

444
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:16,183
John goes, Carmine's gonna position
himself for maximum deniability.

445
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,937
So you make it easy for everybody.
Take it out of the neighborhood.

446
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,231
- What, like an accident?
- Accident, stickup.

447
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,943
He could choke on a chicken wing.

448
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,071
The important thing is,
Johnny disappears.

449
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,199
With Johnny out, Carmine's gonna
put his son in there...

450
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,327
...fucking Brainless the Second.

451
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,540
Who knows, maybe there's an upside
to Johnny going.

452
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,715
He goes to Boston a lot,
visit his father.

453
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,592
Could happen up there.

454
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:56,390
You want my advice,
you'll call Lou Dimaggio.

455
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,933
The Atwell Avenue boys.

456
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,978
What, those sick old fucks
in Rhode Island?

457
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,564
They may be old, my little nephew,
but those dogs can still hunt.

458
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:10,570
My old man used to talk about them,
something to do with drugs.

459
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,906
Heroin.

460
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,284
Back in the '50s, it was raining cash
with that shit.

461
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,746
Dimaggio and his crew
never saw a dime.

462
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:23,625
The guy they worked for, Lenny Caputo,
he didn't believe in it.

463
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:30,465
For 15 years, everyone and their mother
was getting rich dealing H.

464
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,301
Everyone except these guys.

465
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:38,306
They're eking a living doing hits,
running swag.

466
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:42,978
Anyway, lo and behold, one day
Lenny gets pinched...

467
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,272
...for heroin trafficking.

468
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,359
It turns out the cocksucker's
been making a fortune...

469
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,112
...working with the melanzane.
And not only that...

470
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,781
...he's been selling out
his own guys to the feds...

471
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,326
...so he can keep his ass
out on the street.

472
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:02,122
Dimaggio and another guy in his crew
did eight years on a murder rap.

473
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,708
So much for loyalty, huh?

474
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,336
You go to Rhode Island and whatever
you do, don't mention drugs.

475
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,839
Coke, heroin, not even Tylenol.

476
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,010
So, what happened
to this Lenny prick?

477
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,724
Lou Dimaggio, his real name's Galina.

478
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,144
They called him Dimaggio after
the cops found Lenny and his wife...

479
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,563
...with their heads bashed in
by a baseball bat.

480
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,651
Anyway, that was Lou
while he still had his health.

481
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:45,040
We could do this ourselves, ninja style.

482
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,669
Father?

483
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,089
We're here to see Lou Dimaggio.

484
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,966
Oh, come in.

485
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:33,296
Hello. Silvio Dante.
We spoke on the phone.

486
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,884
Chris Moltisanti, how you doing?

487
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,929
- My name's Chris too.
- Oh, yeah?

488
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,224
- Are you into drugs?
- What?

489
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,395
No. What do you mean?

490
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,397
We don't work for drug dealers.

491
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,440
- No. No.
- Course not.

492
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,109
Want some coffee?

493
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,403
- No, thanks.
- Rose?

494
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,407
- Yeah, Pop?
- More Sanka.

495
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,620
Anyway, this is him.

496
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,456
John Sacrimoni.

497
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,959
He...

498
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,839
He'll be coming up through here
next few days.

499
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:19,259
He stays at the Boston Harbor Hotel.

500
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,429
The guy on the left.

501
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:27,309
- It's my birthday too.
- We're having cake later.

502
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,978
Carvel.

503
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:42,282
Chromosomes. Runs in the family.

504
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,619
There was a guy once, Tommy Neri.

505
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,955
Got him coming home
from the track one night.

506
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,458
Caught him good with a tire iron.

507
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,461
When he woke up, I held him down...

508
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,297
...while Frank cut his head off
with a hacksaw.

509
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:01,176
Silent as a mouse pissing on cotton.

510
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:06,348
If you like, we could arrange to have
that same thing happen again.

511
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:11,478
I don't know that we need
to be that overstated.

512
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,730
What'd you have in mind, then?

513
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,149
Nothing fancy.
As long as he disappears.

514
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,734
It's your money.

515
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,325
Yeah, about that.
Twenty grand, we said.

516
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,744
Half up front.

517
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,753
So...

518
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,130
...we'll call you then?

519
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,344
Pop, Father's here.

520
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,181
Would you like some cake?

521
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,894
Actually, we got a long ride back.

522
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,906
Have you seen my sweater,
the cable knit?

523
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,702
The white one? It shrunk.
I put it in the bag for Goodwill.

524
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,745
I told you I'd bring it up to Dad.

525
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,707
I'm sorry. It's in the basement,
near the card table.

526
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,463
- Hello?
- It's me.

527
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,800
I just hung up with a guy, Jerry,
from Fort Lauderdale.

528
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,053
That guy we're looking for,
he's at the Del Rey Hotel in Miami.

529
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,055
Our friend with the paving problem.

530
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,600
Send someone over there tomorrow
to take care of it, then.

531
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,311
Are you sure you wanna do this?

532
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,938
I'd feel a lot better
with the pope's blessing.

533
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:41,276
Just do as you're told.
I'll deal with the fallout.

534
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,571
Who was that, hon?

535
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:49,117
Nobody. A plumber for the store.

536
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,953
- What's that you're making?
- Fruit salad. You want some?

537
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,496
Low-fat whipped cream.

538
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,916
No. You enjoy it, sweetie.

539
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,114
Why did I have to come?
He's not even home.

540
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,035
Hey, look who's here.
Carmela, Anthony, how you doing?

541
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,621
We were passing by,
I figured we'd give it a shot.

542
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,124
- No, we weren't.
- Come, come, I show you.

543
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,799
I was working in the yard,
clear the weeds.

544
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,803
Next year I'll grow grapes
for the falanghina.

545
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,847
Gonna make my own wine.

546
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,684
It's gorgeous, Fur.
So that's the garage in question.

547
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,478
Anthony, don't wander off.

548
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,855
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Just stay put.

549
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,650
We're leaving in five minutes.

550
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,903
So you're thinking of making that
an apartment for your parents?

551
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,572
A garage. I don't need it.

552
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,496
One time back in Naples...

553
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:21,376
...I work in the garden as a landscaper
for a very rich man.

554
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,380
Just me, I work there alone,
growing olives.

555
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:30,510
My hands in the dirt, the hot sun.

556
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:37,851
I was never so happy in my life
as when I work at that place.

557
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,272
Sometimes I get the smell of olives...

558
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,066
...in a restaurant, in the store maybe.

559
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,197
It makes me very sad.

560
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:08,381
You know, I'm not sure, but I think
if it was built before 1938...

561
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,758
...you can apply for a zoning variance.

562
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:15,388
Pre-existing non-conforming structure,
I think it's called.

563
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,814
I just got it back from the Martinizing.

564
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,734
They do a nice job over there.

565
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,571
Say hi to Dad for me. I put Allegra's
graduation picture in a frame for him.

566
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,239
Good.

567
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,909
- Love you.
- I love you too.

568
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,745
Careful driving.

569
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,644
Shit!

570
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,645
It's me!

571
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,439
Hello?

572
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,651
Why is the door unlocked?

573
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,988
Gin?

574
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,379
Gin?

575
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,674
- Jesus, you scared the shit out of me!
- What are you doing?

576
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,052
- I thought you left.
- I forgot the sweater.

577
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,682
- What are you doing on the floor?
- I was getting the laundry together.

578
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,193
John...

579
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,448
What's this?
I thought you're on Atkins.

580
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,284
I was. I am.
It's hard, John. I'm trying.

581
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,040
This is how you try?

582
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,417
I'm not out of the house 10 minutes?

583
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,919
I was dizzy. I was having
low blood sugar.

584
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,713
What happened to fruit salad?

585
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,508
- You were supposed to quit smoking!
- Nicotine's an addictive substance!

586
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,802
What's wrong with you?
Why are you yelling?

587
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,056
Did I ask you to go on a diet?
Did I ask you to be thin for me?

588
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:07,435
The fasting, the NutriSystems,
those goddamn Deal-a-Meal cards?

589
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,271
It's the world, John, our culture.

590
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:14,400
Fuck that! Do you have any idea
what you've done?

591
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:18,446
- What do you mean?
- You lied to me! You lied!

592
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,283
I know I've gained weight
these last few years.

593
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:26,079
I see the other wives,
the way men look at them.

594
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,040
Don't I look at you like that?

595
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,293
Haven't I always?

596
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,797
It was your idea,
all this dieting nonsense.

597
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,257
I wanted you to be proud of me.

598
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,593
I am proud of you.

599
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,431
I love you.

600
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,190
Welcome to the Del Rey Hotel, ma'am.

601
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,110
- Can I get your bags?
- Oh, thanks.

602
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,946
Okay, go on into the lobby,
I'll meet you inside.

603
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,675
- Hello?
- Listen, it's me.

604
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,969
I talked to my guy,
we're calling it off.

605
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,471
I'm already out here though.
Like, right there.

606
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,392
We'll work something out, then.
Don't worry about it.

607
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,313
- I want half.
- All right, whatever.

608
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,524
Getting out?

609
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,860
No.

610
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,430
What's your fucking problem?

611
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,026
Oh, I love the pine flooring.

612
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,029
I know, it's so rustic.

613
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,921
This is pretty cool.
It's actually from Italy.

614
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,299
I'm so bored I feel like crying.

615
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:55,061
It's adorable, Furio, really.

616
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,063
I'm gonna be leaving soon.

617
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,315
Come on.

618
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,984
Stick around. Have some food.

619
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,237
Anything from our friends up north?

620
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,240
Carmine called. Johnny's still in town.

621
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:12,662
I'm not kidding. There's tons of toys
in there he said you could have.

622
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,580
They're back behind those boxes.

623
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,250
Bullshit, you're gonna lock me in.

624
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:21,087
Okay, fine. But don't say
I didn't tell you.

625
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:26,592
He gets them from Italy.
His father owns a steamship company.

626
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,762
Okay.

627
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,598
Go ahead, I'll get the flashlight.

628
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:38,145
Help! Let me out of here!

629
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,610
Gabriella, come.

630
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,654
Come on, dance. Come on.

631
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,323
- No.
- Go.

632
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,376
Silvio, you tell her, she can't wear
fancy shoes and no dance, come on.

633
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,003
- No, no.
- Shake it up a little.

634
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,634
- Come on, Dad, dance with me.
- No, no. No, thanks.

635
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,177
Tommy Tune over there.

636
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:18,144
Carmela, come here.
You come too.

637
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,313
Yeah, Carm, go ahead. Good idea.

638
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,986
Okay. You watch me,
you do the same.

639
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,155
Everybody, come on.

640
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,496
Everybody, come on.

641
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,666
- That's it.
- God, I'm such a spaz.

642
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,668
- No, no, you're good. Come.
- Meadow.

643
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,504
Come on.

644
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,528
Nice.

645
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,840
- We'll be in fucking big trouble.
- It ain't gonna happen.

646
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,144
At least it's not just Jason
who's regressing.

647
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,607
Soprano? His own daughter was
going through the same thing.

648
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,736
I felt like such a fraud
giving him advice.

649
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,572
My own son has three years
on his daughter...

650
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,785
...and look how he's acting.

651
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,914
Jen, why do you still feel guilty?

652
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:07,753
Sometimes I wonder
if Richard had a point.

653
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:12,591
I shouldn't have gone down into
that garage that late at night.

654
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,430
I went to see Sask at school
the other day...

655
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,182
...and I'm in the parking garage
over there?

656
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,936
I was driving around for 20 minutes
when finally I spot someone leaving...

657
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,605
...this big Bluto sort of guy.

658
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,525
I must have crowded him
as he headed for his car.

659
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:35,781
Anyway, he turned around
and became quite confrontational.

660
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:39,618
And for a second, I'll admit,
I thought of you.

661
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,954
What are you getting at?

662
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,459
Parking garages are not
inherently dangerous places.

663
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:51,172
Jen, you cannot blame yourself
for what happened to you.

664
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,970
Turns out this guy was probably another
parent or, more likely, a repairman.

665
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:02,308
But if he had dragged me out of my car
and beaten me up...

666
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:07,021
...would I be saying, "Gee, I shouldn't
have tried to park my car?"

667
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,650
Anyway, enough about him.

668
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:15,196
Let's get back to you.

669
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,379
You wanted to see me?

670
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,175
You can tell Ralph I've decided
to accept his apology.

671
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,685
You know that kid you pissed on?
Donny K?

672
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,855
He's got fucking nerve damage
on his left side.

673
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,359
I'm sorry, Tony.

674
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,780
I bet you are.

675
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,908
I'll expect to hear from Ralph, then.

676
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,371
Why the big reversal all of a sudden?

677
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,875
No more weight remarks, Tony.

678
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:14,130
They're hurtful,
and they're destructive.

679
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,007
Oh, I agree.

680
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,622
Still awake?

681
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,333
I'm just reading.

682
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,254
Bought you something.

683
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,757
What's this for?

684
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,093
No reason.

685
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,929
I don't know if I believe that.

686
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,358
Put a call in to Ginsberg, by the way.

687
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,445
He's back from California.

688
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,951
Tony, this is beautiful.

689
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,622
What size is this?

690
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,875
I don't know, small.

691
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,128
I don't know if this'll fit.

692
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,964
Try it on.

693
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,703
See? I knew you could pull it off.

694
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,916
You look like a model.

695
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,627
Listen to him now.

696
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,725
Tony.

697
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,563
Tony!

698
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,066
I'm sorry, Tony.

699
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,236
- What's the matter?
- I can't. The music.

700
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,947
Meadow, turn it off!

701
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,826
What?

702
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,296
Meadow?

703
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,175
Meadow!

704
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,968
- What?
- The music!

705
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,971
Will you turn it down, please?

706
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,273
I'm going out.
