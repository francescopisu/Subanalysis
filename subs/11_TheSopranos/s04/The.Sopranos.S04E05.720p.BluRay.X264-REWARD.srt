1
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,415
What the fuck?

2
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,503
Wow, hey!

3
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,464
Look who's here.

4
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,551
- Finally!
- Look at her...

5
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,761
...with her own business now.

6
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,806
I got some radio tie-ins to help
with Mondays and Tuesdays...

7
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,560
...plus I'm thinking about
adding some contests later on.

8
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,311
- Glenlivet, right, Ton?
- Yeah.

9
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,481
- Sil?
- Just seltzer, dear.

10
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,692
Christopher here?

11
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,570
Is he supposed to be?

12
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,574
- You want me to call him?
- We're gonna sit down there.

13
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,497
The VIP table's better.

14
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,346
Hello?

15
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,309
An FBI informant?

16
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,979
I must've been out of range, Carm.

17
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,733
Your accountant didn't reach you?
A.J. said he talked to you hours ago.

18
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,278
Well, Ginsberg didn't call me.

19
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,617
I'm gonna fuck her face up
before I kill her.

20
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,453
Look, I said I'll talk to him,
so I'll talk to him.

21
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,289
Cousin Brian is dropping the
estate papers by tomorrow.

22
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,418
Good, I'm anxious to look them over.

23
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,356
Let's give it up for No Soap Radio.

24
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,571
Was that a steamroller of a set?

25
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,991
Pick up one of their new CDs for sale,
up at the front.

26
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,884
Come on, Giovanni.

27
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,388
Jesus Christ, he's pissing his pants.

28
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,419
- No, no, no.
- Want me to do it again, huh?

29
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,047
No, no!

30
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,758
- I don't think he gets it.
- Hit him again.

31
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,899
Hey, there you go!
Pretty good.

32
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,322
Okay, well, that's great.

33
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,453
Okay, let's bring out your lover.

34
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,040
The weight she put on in rehab!
How could you do that to yourself?

35
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,626
She always had a bad can. It's genetic.

36
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,591
Hello? Hey, Ma. What's up?

37
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,011
Adriana, you got a call.

38
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,890
Ma, hang on a sec.

39
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,685
- Hello?
- Adriana, it's me.

40
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,522
- Why the fuck are you calling me here?
- Don't hang up, I'll just call back.

41
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:03,070
Ma, I'll call you later. I know, Ma.
Goddamn it, I'll pick up the Sensodyne.

42
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,865
- Norman, I gotta take this.
- Ade, I got a boliage at 11.

43
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,993
- Are you following me?
- We wanna talk to you.

44
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:14,706
- A & B Bakery, Route 10, East Hanover.
- I gotta drive all the way up there?

45
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,167
Want us talking to you
in your neighborhood?

46
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,504
And don't go anywhere. We got
a unit watching the beauty shop.

47
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,553
- I'm getting lights and a wax.
- We'll wait.

48
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,769
- Janice, hi.
- Hi.

49
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,562
Listen, I can't stay.

50
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,857
I just brought Bobby Jr.
a couple Xbox games...

51
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,818
...a friend of mine burned for him.

52
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,780
JoJo. Hi, wow.
What are you doing here?

53
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,158
Janice, look at you.

54
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,079
I made Bobby and the kids
some of my chicken Marsala.

55
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,748
Times like this, I remember
when I lost Mikey.

56
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,167
It's impossible to think about food...

57
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,712
...but like the president says,
we have to keep going.

58
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,714
The family's gotta eat.

59
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,718
I'm picking up the kids after school,
Bobby. No argument.

60
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,763
He's hanging in, though.
Aren't you, Bobby?

61
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,015
Janice, leave those.
The girl's coming today.

62
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,642
Then I better do these pots.

63
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:21,481
I've seen Rigoberta with those copper
Tuffies. What she's done to this Teflon!

64
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,110
Anytime you want to drop Sophia and
little Bobby off, don't be shy.

65
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,155
I mean it.
My kids would love it.

66
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,950
How is Michael Jr.
doing on the Ritalin, Jo?

67
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,787
The way they medicate kids today,
it's the answer for everything.

68
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,623
And then they wonder why
teenagers get hooked on drugs.

69
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,543
If a child had diabetes,
you'd give him insulin.

70
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,713
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Bobby's got to come home anyway.

71
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,550
Karen always made him do his homework
before dinner, or it didn't get done.

72
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,151
The chicken, Bobby.

73
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,155
Put it in a 350 oven for 20 minutes.
You just want to heat it.

74
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,994
And if you have some egg noodles,
it's better the first night, so enjoy.

75
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,787
Thank you, JoJo.

76
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,888
- Everybody's been so nice.
- I'll bet.

77
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,936
Look at all these casseroles
people brought.

78
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,274
Stuffed shells. Gabriella.

79
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,655
- Ziti.
- Karen made that.

80
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,576
- I'm sorry.
- That's her last ziti before she died.

81
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,870
I didn't know.

82
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,000
I loved her so much.

83
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:08,171
I thank God for every day
we had together.

84
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:13,051
- She was an angel.
- I know. She was special.

85
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,020
Miss La Cerva.

86
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,985
Agent Harris. We met.
This is Agent Sanseverino.

87
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,363
- Hi, Adriana.
- Eat shit, Danielle.

88
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,074
Or whatever the fuck your name is.

89
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,244
Get you a latte? Scone?

90
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,956
I just want you to leave me alone.
How many times do I have to tell you?

91
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,125
I don't know anything.

92
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,045
You people are just trying to scare me.
Nobody's trying to hurt Christopher.

93
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,132
What was he doing
in Yonkers last night?

94
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,343
What? I don't know.

95
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,263
Somebody saw him having drinks
at the Renaissance Inn...

96
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,765
...with an individual named Chip Zoto.

97
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,978
Christopher ever mention a Chip Zoto,
or just plain Chip?

98
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,273
- No.
- Here's what's problematic:

99
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,901
You don't know where he is,
so how do you know if he's in trouble?

100
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,820
He's into heroin, organized crime...

101
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,156
...he's associating with some
dangerous people.

102
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,660
- Not to mention Tony Soprano himself.
- See, that's where you're wrong.

103
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,204
Tony wouldn't let anything
happen to Christopher.

104
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,998
They're cousins. He loves him.

105
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,792
He loved Pussy Bonpensiero.
What happened to him?

106
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,255
- He's in the Witness Protection Program.
- Dwight, he went into the program?

107
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,717
- You know anything about that?
- No.

108
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,052
We would've heard.

109
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,222
And your Uncle Richie,
I suppose he's in the program too.

110
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,850
He is.

111
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,897
Isn't he?

112
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,281
Adriana, this is a way out for you.
You have your whole life in front of you.

113
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,284
We'd like to see you two have a chance.

114
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,994
Okay.

115
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,790
- I'm gonna get back.
- Where are you going?

116
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,085
You're gonna be working with
Agent Sanseverino here.

117
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,961
What?

118
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,881
- Why?
- It's for your own safety.

119
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,968
And you know what we were
talking about? About the little creatures?

120
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,097
- Good luck with that. I mean it.
- Fuck you.

121
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,073
The more you can tell us, the more
we can help you and Christopher.

122
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,121
He doesn't need your help.
He can take care of himself.

123
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,251
- You want some water?
- Yeah.

124
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,880
- How's Tony been lately?
- I have no fucking idea, I told you.

125
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,426
- Been over to the house?
- I don't go over there.

126
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,179
Hardly ever.

127
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,433
Well, that should be your area
of focus, if possible.

128
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,518
I don't feel so good.

129
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,076
Here. A little more salt?

130
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,537
No, it's delicious.

131
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,042
- I was talking to Cousin Brian.
- Carm, I'm gonna see Ginsberg, all right?

132
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,088
No, not that. He gave me a free tip on
a medical stock that's gonna move soon.

133
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:41,134
- He said we should put $10,000 in it.
- Oh, 10,000?

134
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,386
- It's not that much.
- Right.

135
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,388
It's not a meaningful investment.

136
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:50,310
That much of Dell Computer bought
in 1989 is worth 5 million today.

137
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,106
We don't have that kind of money
on hand right now.

138
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,066
Things are tight.

139
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,153
Don't you read the papers?
The economy.

140
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,073
Well, it sounded like
a wonderful opportunity.

141
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,243
What are you gonna do, huh?

142
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,576
Waldorf Astoria for horses back here.
Groom, trainer, three meals a day.

143
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,330
No, Ton, watch out for the goat.
It butts.

144
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,333
- My nonna Lento cooked goat.
- What's it doing here?

145
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,045
Horses like company. Seabiscuit had
his own horse that he traveled with.

146
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,339
How do you like that?
You own a horse, Tony?

147
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,508
Please, as his accountant...

148
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:09,138
I thought about it a couple times,
but it's an animal, it's a commitment.

149
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,266
Don't tell me
with the bucked shins again.

150
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,227
No, she's fine.
We had a great morning.

151
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,856
- Jesus, that's a beautiful horse.
- She's gonna be a bottle of LePage...

152
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,441
...if she don't win.
Bubeleh, you want a sure thing?

153
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,194
Buy bonds.
Lois is the best trainer here.

154
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,324
This chooch, he sells me a horse,
the next week it starts losing.

155
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,870
I don't know what happened. She ran
ahead by two lengths...

156
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,414
...then she stopped in the backstretch.
Stopped?

157
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,542
- Slowed down. Finished fourth.
- As in out of the money.

158
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,587
Try holding her back.
Keep something for the finish.

159
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,673
Horse is a front-runner.
She likes running up front.

160
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,135
- Well, so what, if she don't win?
- I have to agree with Lois here.

161
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:52,223
- The horse has style. Don't fuck with it.
- Her kind of track today. Fast.

162
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,101
- And she did draw the one-hole.
- Done, said, finished.

163
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:59,439
Tony, all due respect,
I'm inclined to defer to the experts.

164
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,191
- Me too.
- All right.

165
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,028
Wire to wire.

166
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,364
And tell that midget not to be shy
with the whip.

167
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,702
If only his mother had taken that advice.

168
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,289
That's what you're wearing to court?

169
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,211
- I'll get it.
- Now what?

170
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,924
It's your niece.

171
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,260
Morning, Uncle Jun.

172
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,138
Great tie!

173
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,474
- What's that?
- Dinner tonight.

174
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,684
Some delicious chicken Marsala.

175
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,022
Murf, 350 oven for 20 minutes,
just so it's hot.

176
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,150
- And if you have some egg noodles...
- Go bring the car around.

177
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,529
- Where you going?
- I'm getting my jacket.

178
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,241
I'll bring it.
Go get the car, we're late.

179
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,536
I gotta go upstairs,
get some change for the parking.

180
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,332
I been meaning to get down to the court
to show my solidarity.

181
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,503
But this thing with Bobby,
he needs help with those kids.

182
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,590
- He needs help? I'm on trial for my life.
- He's gonna get through this.

183
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,344
When? I'm waiting like
patience on a monument.

184
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,977
You really depend on him, don't you?

185
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,565
Well, this one, he drives like a little
old lady. Gas, brake, gas, brake.

186
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:31,114
You know, I remember Daddy said that
someday Bobby would be your linchpin.

187
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,491
My brother said that?

188
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,370
Bobby was still a headwaiter
when Johnny died.

189
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:42,250
Bobby's doing better.
We had a very healing day yesterday.

190
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,337
I helped him go through Karen's things
for St. Vincent de Paul.

191
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,424
- Psychologically, that's enormous.
- Yesterday?

192
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,510
- Bobby was home?
- Why?

193
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,347
He was supposed to take care
of something for me.

194
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,726
- What was it?
- Goddamn it.

195
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,354
Each of us is alone
in the fucking universe.

196
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,195
So this estate-planning shit...

197
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,365
Carmela wants it, and I got nothing
against getting well set up.

198
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,160
Half of these cetriolos
live one day to the next.

199
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,831
A blue-chip portfolio like your cousin's
suggesting, to keep pace with inflation...

200
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,752
...if it makes your wife happy,
go with God.

201
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,712
Thanks.

202
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,591
I'm supposed to make the money,
she takes care of the house.

203
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,052
That's the way it should be.

204
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,721
Carmela's a smart woman.
We start winning...

205
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,183
...it's gonna be Intel this
and Coca-Cola that. It'll never end.

206
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,685
- Tony!
- Post time is in one minute.

207
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,606
- Anthony!
- This other thing your cousin advised.

208
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:51,069
Life-insurance trust?
Big red flag.

209
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,072
What? The kid says there was
tremendous tax advantages.

210
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,282
To Carmela. When you die.

211
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:01,579
But present day, if something
unforeseen should arise, divorce, say...

212
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,333
...that type of trust is irrevocable.
That means it can't be changed.

213
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,711
You have to petition the court
and even then...

214
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,509
Don't get me wrong.
A trust per se is a good thing.

215
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:19,305
Avoids probate, prying eyes,
but there's other ways to go.

216
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,599
Such as an inter vivos, or living trust.

217
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,106
- Here they go.
- They're in the gate.

218
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,734
- And they're off.
- Come on, baby!

219
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,447
It's Vision Be Mine, Miss Rae Rae
and Zucker's Mother going for the lead.

220
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,827
Yeah Boy right there on the outside.
Pie-O-My settling into fifth.

221
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,329
Go, goddamn, go!

222
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:47,250
- Come on, move up!
- Come on, baby! Come on, girl!

223
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,878
I hate this fucking pygmy, I hate him.
What's he doing?

224
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,713
Get her out of there!
Move her up!

225
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,716
Vision Be Mine following by a length.
Pie-O-My behind.

226
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,469
No, goddamn, no.
I got five G's on her.

227
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:02,306
- He's gonna make it. Here we go.
- Come on, baby! Come on, girl!

228
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,185
Miss Rae Rae, Vision Be Mine
and Pie-O-My join the front-runners.

229
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,188
Look at her. She's coming around.
Jesus, look at her go!

230
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,441
Moving on the outside, it's Pie-O-My
with a tremendous push...

231
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,443
...Pie-O-My with tremendous speed.

232
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,696
Come on, girl! Come on, Pie!

233
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,866
It's Pie-O-My challenging
Zucker's Mother for the lead.

234
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,826
Pie-O-My and Zucker's Mother.

235
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,329
Pie-O-My and Zucker's Mother
as we head for home.

236
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:31,294
Pie-O-My pulling ahead. Pie-O-My
with speed to burn, and it's Pie-O-My.

237
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:36,549
Pie-O-My coming from behind to win it.
Pie-O-My hits the wire first.

238
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,593
Son of a bitch!

239
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,845
- And it's Pie-O-My to win.
- I won!

240
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:45,516
I'm rich. I'm rich. I'm rich!
Five grand and an 8-to-1!

241
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,562
Heading for the winner's circle
is Pie-O-My, owned by Inez Munoz.

242
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,647
- Beautiful. Fantastic.
- Whooo!

243
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,528
- Who is that?
- That's his girlfriend.

244
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,449
I'll give you a shot
in the fucking head, my girlfriend.

245
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,369
- It's his maid.
- Oh, right, the racing license.

246
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,665
Miss Munoz, as the owner of the horse...

247
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,461
...you'll receive an 8-by-10
glossy in two to four weeks.

248
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,510
You, Anthony. You, you, you.

249
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,722
What did you say?
"Hold her back."

250
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,936
You are not going unthanked.
You, I'm giving a taste of my win.

251
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,607
Hey, Inez.

252
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,694
- Come here, have some champagne.
- Mr. Ralph, I don't know if I...

253
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,488
Ahh.

254
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,619
There he is.
I wanna congratulate you.

255
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,581
- I asked, and she was there.
- You know, not for nothing...

256
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,918
...the horse won, but that was not
the agreed-upon strategy.

257
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,256
Nicky didn't sit on her. She was bumped
and got stuck in a speed trap.

258
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,550
So this coming behind, this was a fluke?

259
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,554
- This man here, he knew.
- We all get lucky.

260
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,598
No. Right is right, Anthony.

261
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:11,936
Fluke, escolar, whatever the fuck.
I'm giving you your taste.

262
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,897
- Your money's no good.
- I insist.

263
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:20,319
She ran your race. You called it.
End of story.

264
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,698
Three, four, five, 600.

265
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,451
And I need 150 more this week
for A.J.'s football cleats.

266
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,996
In my day, they were 50 bucks.

267
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,958
Fifty? That's what I pay to get
your suits out of the cleaners.

268
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,963
So you got those papers for me to sign?

269
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,882
- Brian's?
- Yeah, I told you I'd talk to Ginsberg.

270
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,804
- Got a pen?
- Anthony Soprano, that is wonderful.

271
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,435
That's so great.
I am so impressed.

272
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,312
Here.

273
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,483
- "Authorization to open an account."
- It's wherever there's a little red arrow.

274
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,027
Okay.

275
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,529
And there.

276
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,573
You need to sign the
agency papers too.

277
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,034
It gives Brian authorization
to buy stocks for us.

278
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,661
What are the little circles here, initials?

279
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:14,457
You won't regret this, Tony, truly.
This is the best thing for all of us.

280
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,751
It'll give us such peace of mind.

281
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,711
Okay.

282
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,046
Mmm.

283
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,089
Wait, there's one more.

284
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,926
I'm not gonna sign that one.

285
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,348
- Why not?
- I don't think it's a good idea.

286
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,517
But this is what it's about,
in case something happens to you.

287
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,354
- Well, I'm not gonna sign it.
- You have to.

288
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,899
Remember? Your children, your wife.
So they don't end up on the street.

289
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,361
Yeah, well, there's better ones.
In vitro or something?

290
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,655
- What? What's wrong with this one?
- It's irrevocable.

291
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,075
- And we don't wanna get locked in.
- To what?

292
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,746
- Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
- Excuse me.

293
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,040
It's the government.
You gotta be flexible.

294
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,584
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

295
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,798
Come on, Carm, be fair.
I gave you two out of three.

296
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,884
You gave me?

297
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,771
Ade?

298
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,402
In here, hon.

299
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,702
What are you doing in bed?
We got dinner with Tony and Carmela.

300
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,081
I can't go. I'm sick.

301
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:41,419
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, I got chills and a fever.

302
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,713
I think I'm getting the flu.
I shouldn't go up there.

303
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,968
Come on, get dressed. Couple of drinks, it'll
kill the germs. You'll forget about it.

304
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,595
- You better go without me.
- But you have to go.

305
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,807
This is the inner sanctum here.
I'm not just a relative anymore.

306
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,852
You think Paulie and his goomars
ever get invited to dinner?

307
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,937
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,108
Maybe if I just sleep...

309
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,951
Nothing ever goes my way.

310
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,173
Is that sausage?
My mom made it with hamburger.

311
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,717
See?

312
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,679
Just a spoonful, Jan.
That's enough, thanks.

313
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,517
Tell Daddy what we saw
on the way home from school.

314
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,483
The Fuji blimp over Willowbrook Mall.

315
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,568
So?

316
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,155
Well, you kids seemed to like it
when you saw it.

317
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,865
You begged me to follow it.

318
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,660
It was nice of you
to pick them up, Janice.

319
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,872
- And making dinner.
- Enjoy, everybody.

320
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,044
It does smell good, doesn't it?

321
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,713
- Did you eat yet?
- I'll get something at home.

322
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,634
No, it's all right. Isn't it, kids?

323
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,223
- Can we eat in front of the TV?
- Yeah.

324
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,226
- That's rude.
- Oh, no, no, no, kids.

325
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,813
I'm the one barging in.
You go right in there.

326
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,817
You know how to set up the TV trays.
You want a little more?

327
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:32,613
- Okay. It's pretty good, actually.
- Thank you, Bobby.

328
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,532
Thanks.

329
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:40,579
Jan, I told you, I don't want them to be
spoiled because they lost their mother.

330
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,043
I saw my uncle today.

331
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,089
- Jesus.
- That's right.

332
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,217
Is he mad?

333
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,637
What's going on, Bobby?
What were you supposed to do?

334
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,848
- Union business.
- What's going on?

335
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,102
- This election coming up, that's all.
- Bobby...

336
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:08,649
I'm the one that should've
been in that car, not Karen.

337
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,236
And Junior's been so good to me,
and I'm letting him down.

338
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:18,033
Fuck him. He only thinks of himself,
selfish old fuck.

339
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:22,580
Now listen to me.
I know my uncle. He's a patient man.

340
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,250
But if you don't do your job,
he'll find somebody who will.

341
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,211
You know what I'm talking about?

342
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:34,258
All your effort, all the years you put in
getting your ticket punched...

343
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,052
...you'll be a nobody.
I don't care anymore.

344
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,221
That's the problem.

345
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,016
I don't care if I live or die.

346
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,102
We lose that luxury
when we have children.

347
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,774
I remember my son Harpo
when my husband left us.

348
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,944
I had both barrels
of a shotgun in my mouth.

349
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,364
But then just one thought of Harpo...

350
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,826
My little boy without his mother.

351
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:09,752
- Every day is worse than the last.
- Bobby, my uncle loves you.

352
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,045
He needs you.

353
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,841
So you're gonna get up tomorrow
morning, and you're gonna get dressed...

354
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:20,846
...and you're gonna get in that car and
you're gonna do what needs to be done.

355
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,931
Aren't you?

356
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,818
Okay, then.
Now, will you eat something?

357
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,202
So show me one of those trusts,
the living ones.

358
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,413
Okay. I can see where you'd
want more mutability, Ton.

359
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,958
Does mutability mean money?
Because, yeah, that's what I want.

360
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,293
Oh.

361
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,464
Carmela's cousin Brian Cammarata.
Ralphie Cifaretto.

362
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,050
- This is the life, huh?
- What life's that?

363
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,761
- I didn't mean...
- I'm kidding.

364
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,805
Just kidding. Any cousin of Tony's...

365
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,057
Lois, how's she look today?

366
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,851
Been clocking her best fractions yet,
21/45.

367
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,896
She's in some rich company, though.
Zucker's Mother again.

368
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,691
And this other one,
frigging Kentucky thoroughbred.

369
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:18,404
You wanted a stakes horse,
this is a stakes race. I think she's ready.

370
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,241
- So, Dr. Dolittle, any thoughts?
- Only six furlongs.

371
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,119
- She should run it head-to-head.
- Excuse me, signora...

372
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,288
...if I'd listened to you last time...
No, she's right.

373
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,500
Short race like this,
let her blow them away.

374
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,001
Hmm.

375
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:37,715
Well, foolish that I am,
I'm gonna place some bets.

376
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,885
They're all in line, and they're off.

377
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,305
Look at that. The five horse bumped her.
You see that? Piece of shit.

378
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,267
- Come on!
- Go, go, Jesus!

379
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:53,021
Zucker's Mother, Lil Camille, Pie-O-My,
Tenant's Harbor sprint out for the lead.

380
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,774
- Run, goddamn it!
- Go, go, go!

381
00:28:55,942 --> 00:29:00,070
Coming to the top of the stretch,
Pie-O-My ahead by two lengths.

382
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,115
Run, you fucking nag!
Come on, Pie!

383
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,909
- Come on, baby, go!
- Look, she's pulling ahead!

384
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,413
Lil Camille challenging Pie-O-My,
Lil Camille giving it all she's got.

385
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,041
- He can't get you, baby.
- But she just can't beat Pie-O-My.

386
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,336
And Pie-O-My hits the wire first,
Lil Camille was second...

387
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,131
...and Tenant's Harbor third.
Beautiful.

388
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,300
Beautiful.

389
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,343
Damn it, I bet to show!

390
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,390
What'd you win, 5 bucks?
My financial adviser.

391
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,350
This is it. This is happiness.

392
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,479
Winning is one thing,
but when it's your horse, right?

393
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,272
Yeah.

394
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,193
Anthony.

395
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,947
Once again, your horse wisdom
is not going unappreciated.

396
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:57,544
Heading to the winner's circle
is Pie-O-My.

397
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:03,509
Pie-O-My is owned by Inez Munoz
and trained by Lois Pettit.

398
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,889
Hey.

399
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,480
I see the flowers got here.

400
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,362
Which you like better,
the lilies or the roses?

401
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,423
Came into some cash.

402
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,553
Sold a property down on
Frelinghuysen Avenue.

403
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,435
- So, okay, let's buy that stock.
- It split. It's too late. We missed it.

404
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,602
You're Teddy Genaretti, aren't you?
The shop steward for Local 184?

405
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,272
Guilty. Are you a joint-fitter?

406
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,193
- What can I get you?
- Wild Turkey, neat.

407
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,155
I saw your caravan in the lot.
It's a nice car for a family.

408
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,158
- Do I know you?
- Jim Blake.

409
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,745
- What local you in?
- My bad back.

410
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,249
It's just that I follow these things,
this election coming up.

411
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,376
Dick Hoffman for president.

412
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,629
I heard he's got 184's vote.
I think it's a mistake.

413
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,132
Pension's been ripped off
the last 25 years.

414
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,218
Hey, I'm sure you guys got grievances,
but Dick Hoffman?

415
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:38,473
What do you owe this guy? It's all talk.
He's out of touch with reality, Dick.

416
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:42,185
You think if push came to shove,
he'd give a fuck about you?

417
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,522
- I know what you're trying to do.
- You look like a smart guy.

418
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,192
I can see why your local puts their faith
in you to do the right thing.

419
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,403
I'm just saying, if it was me...

420
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,531
I got kids that depend on me,
like yourself.

421
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,784
And to waste my votes on somebody
like Dick Hoffman...

422
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:03,248
...I might as well put a bullet
in my head. Here, here and here.

423
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,729
Affordable solutions
to all your fitness challenges.

424
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:30,609
Now, the Body by Jake design team
has used a remarkable new technology...

425
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,571
...to attack three of the biggest problem
areas below the waistline...

426
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,199
...with the Body by Jake
bun and thigh rocker.

427
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,409
The 3-minute hip, thigh
and bun machine.

428
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:44,414
So now you can quickly and easily
trim and tone the hips and thighs.

429
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,710
- What, are you up?
- Cosette, go to your basket.

430
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,592
- What's the matter with you?
- Because I'm glad to see you.

431
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,304
- I worry about you staying out so late.
- Since when?

432
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,598
You hungry?
Want some scrambled eggs?

433
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,558
Yeah, all right.

434
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,377
Christopher?

435
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:36,466
I was thinking, maybe we should
try someplace else.

436
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,470
I saw this thing on TV, a tour
of this house in Santa Barbara.

437
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,306
You should see the flowers they had.
And the ocean...

438
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,643
- I was in California. Didn't like it.
- I'm just saying, we're young.

439
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,312
We got our whole life in front of us.

440
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,730
Looks really nice out there.

441
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,941
- No snow.
- You're burning the butter.

442
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:03,326
Let's be honest.
What's our future here, Christopher?

443
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,496
You could end up in jail,
or something horrible could happen.

444
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,332
Fucking negative shit.
Stop with that.

445
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,376
Somebody could have it in for you.

446
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,503
- Who?
- I don't know.

447
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,215
- What is this? Who told you that?
- Nobody.

448
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,593
Fucking negative shit coming
out of your mouth.

449
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,220
I had that bird watching me
when I got made.

450
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,764
I'm already under a
what-do-you-call-it, possibly.

451
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,267
So stop with that.

452
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,522
I worry about you, that's all.

453
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:36,943
- I love you so much.
- So if you love me, stir my eggs, okay?

454
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,702
Excuse me.

455
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,208
- Is Tony here?
- Tony?

456
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,793
- It's all right, we'll wait in the office.
- What?

457
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,506
- Can I see a bar menu?
- I'll take a CC and Seven.

458
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,884
Nachos grande and a Diet Coke.

459
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,307
Where's your office, in the back?

460
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,478
You should play Skynyrd.

461
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,404
- It smells in here.
- Mold.

462
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,824
- Stuff can kill you, I read.
- Fuck that.

463
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,620
What the fuck you think cheese is?
Mold.

464
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,794
- Holy...!
- You okay?

465
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,605
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

466
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,447
And I gotta rot in that courtroom.

467
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,783
I'll put the heat on under the gravy.

468
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,954
And my daughter's coming over
to the house for dinner, so I gotta go.

469
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,834
The three men were arrested
in Germany last month.

470
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,545
Did we miss it? Goddamn it.

471
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:22,924
In the federal courthouse in Newark,
there were few surprises in the trial...

472
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,885
...of Corrado "Junior" Soprano.
Hey, Murf.

473
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,637
- Hello, Junior.
- Shh.

474
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,973
The defendant listened as government
auditors detailed...

475
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,476
...financial irregularities
at Comley Trucking.

476
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,395
The prosecution outlined how...

477
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,397
- The fuck?!
- What?

478
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,982
What kind of likeness is that?

479
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,484
If they were great artists,
they'd be in a museum.

480
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,823
I'm fucking fodder for cartoonists now?

481
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,373
You know, Bobby, a little support
in the courtroom would be nice.

482
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,836
- Or are you still hanging crepe?
- I took care of the thing. Last night.

483
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,964
- The guy, you saw him?
- Him and 184 won't be a problem.

484
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,508
Good.

485
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,512
Hand me that weight over there.
The one in the middle.

486
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,355
I'm glad to see you back in the swing
of things. All that moping around...

487
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,941
- You just gotta put it behind you.
- That's what Janice said.

488
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,153
- Janice?
- She's been wonderful through all this.

489
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,865
Looking after Bobby Jr. and Sophia,
bringing dinner over the house.

490
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,493
- Janice?
- She's a pretty good cook.

491
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,787
Since when?
Everybody steers clear of her food.

492
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,707
Nah. She made lasagna
the other night. Delicious.

493
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,545
With sweet sausage along with the beef.
I thought Karen's was good, but...

494
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,049
Sweet sausage? In little pieces?

495
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,718
And a layer of basil leaves
underneath the cheese?

496
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,970
- That's right.
- That's Carmela's lasagna.

497
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,807
Fuck you talking about?

498
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,017
You always think the worst
of everybody.

499
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,727
Well, fine.

500
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:01,481
Enjoy your lasagna.
Just don't come running to me.

501
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,150
Oh, shit!

502
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,904
Go see if he's all right.

503
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,993
They were here till 1:00.
I couldn't even get into my office.

504
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,414
- This is a good thing, Adriana.
- Why?

505
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,208
They don't pay for nothing.
They ran up a $200 bar bill.

506
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,752
Overcharge some of those
college students.

507
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,592
Ralph and them wanted to know
if Tony was here. Why? Is he gonna be?

508
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,761
You don't know what
this guy did for me.

509
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,596
Yeah, I do.

510
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,100
Not getting my stripes.
Something I can't talk about.

511
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,770
Something that was ruining
my whole life, and he made it right.

512
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,064
I would follow that man into hell.

513
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,651
But why do they have to come here?
I don't understand.

514
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,447
This place isn't bugged. The cops
and the feds don't know about it.

515
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,866
Probably in time they will.
Until then...

516
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
Ow!

517
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,247
Oh, shit.

518
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,918
They broke my fucking chair!

519
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,295
Oh.

520
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,631
We're having Sunday dinner
at Tony's, and you're coming.

521
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,550
I don't care if your mother's dying.

522
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:16,097
Your Honor, I introduce as evidence
government exhibit 27B...

523
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:20,018
...which is a stipulation between
the parties that if called as a witness...

524
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,646
...Koren W. Jonic, supervisor
of the U.S. Post Office...

525
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:27,233
...located at 8721 Wayland Ave.
In Paramus...

526
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:33,573
...would testify that post office box 206
was registered to and paid for...

527
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:38,786
...by one Ira E. Barad, who resides
at 43 Bellingham Blvd., apartment 4B...

528
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:45,251
...Paramus, NJ, and was initially rented
by Ira E. Barad on September 16, 1998...

529
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,878
...with a payment of...

530
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,506
I don't care what your psychic said.

531
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,092
Ma, if a guy don't call back within
the first 48 hours... No, don't.

532
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:57,764
Don't call him, Ma.
Because I don't wanna hear about it.

533
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,600
Oh, fuck.

534
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,103
Nothing, Ma. I gotta go.
I'll call you later. Bye.

535
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,982
I can't stay.
Christopher's waiting for me.

536
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,610
Just checking in,
seeing how you're doing.

537
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,863
How I'm doing? I can't even
get my dog clipped anymore?

538
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,282
- Anything interesting going on?
- No.

539
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,117
Ralph Cifaretto was in your club.

540
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,332
Vito Spatafore, Gene Pontecorvo
and Patsy Parisi?

541
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,836
It's the law. If they got shirts
and shoes on, I gotta serve them.

542
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:32,257
Ralph Cifaretto drove down
to Philadelphia last Thursday.

543
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,842
Had a couple of guys with him.

544
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,845
- You know who was in the car?
- No.

545
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:51,109
You ever heard the name
"Cogo, Giovanni"?

546
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,695
Giovanni?

547
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,824
No.

548
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,221
Okay, look...

549
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,725
...Patsy Parisi goes to White Plains
a lot. He gets these suits.

550
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,893
- Suits?
- Yeah, suits.

551
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:29,188
Some guy came in, and Patsy went out
and got him a bunch of suits.

552
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,984
Boss and stuff, half-dozen, dozen...

553
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,614
...from his car.

554
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:44,245
See? How hard was that?

555
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,255
Finally, the woman finds the Easy-Off.

556
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,968
- Thanks for picking the kids up.
- No prob.

557
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,846
So how about you?
How was your day?

558
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,389
- Good.
- Oh?

559
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,184
- Yeah.
- I knew it.

560
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,979
See? I knew you would feel better.
Did you make sure that my uncle knows?

561
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,023
- Yeah.
- We should celebrate.

562
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,942
- I'll make something special for dinner.
- No. I mean...

563
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,945
...we should go out.
Vesuvio?

564
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,990
Takes too long for them.
Kids like Chinese.

565
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,663
MSG. I collapsed one time at
the Hunan Palace. Complete blackout.

566
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,456
I'll just open a can of soup.

567
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,292
That's crazy. There must be
something I can heat up.

568
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,837
Really, Janice, you do too much already.

569
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,424
What about this?

570
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,761
Karen's ziti?

571
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,431
I'm not ready to eat that yet.

572
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,310
I understand.

573
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,488
Hold on a minute, hon.

574
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,866
Sorry.

575
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,247
What does that mean, "basically"?

576
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:13,167
Doesn't matter how he keeps
Old Man Rictora...

577
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,420
He's laying out cash to us every week.

578
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,715
So let him write a check to one
of our shell companies.

579
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,967
You got it.

580
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,141
How's our girl?

581
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,812
- Our girl?
- Yeah, she had a hot tendon.

582
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,440
You know, it's always something
with her.

583
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,901
You should see the veterinarian bills.
Fucking racket.

584
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,487
Know what we should do,
if you don't mind my saying?

585
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,450
I think we should switch her shoes
to those titanium ones.

586
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,410
They don't weigh anything...

587
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:52,373
...so they're good for a tender hoof.
Sure. Why not?

588
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,262
Here you are, baby.

589
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,308
Shit.

590
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,936
- You don't have to answer it.
- See who it is.

591
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:18,441
- You want me to answer it?
- Will you answer the fucking phone?

592
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,113
- Hello?
- Hello, I need to speak with Mr. Ralph.

593
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,282
It's your maid.

594
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,910
What, she's gotta go to the clinic
again tomorrow?

595
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,120
Talk to her, tell her to get her ass
in here.

596
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,833
- He isn't in.
- Because the horse is very, very sick.

597
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,796
And he put the horse in my name,
and he say I won't get in no trouble.

598
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,881
But the horse doctor won't do nothing...

599
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:45,134
...because Mr. Ralph don't pay
the money he owes it to him...

600
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,386
...and the horse may die...

601
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:51,265
...and I don't know what it to do.
All right, wait.

602
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,142
Hold on.

603
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,396
Your horse is sick, and the vet
won't help until he gets paid.

604
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,901
These guys, no compassion
for the fucking animals whatsoever.

605
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,070
Maybe you better go down there.

606
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,993
Tell her to call 555-0157.

607
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:24,048
History has vindicated his part of the
British disaster that followed...

608
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,259
...and placed the blame...

609
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,635
A.J!

610
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,304
At the outbreak of the second
Great War in 1939...

611
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:34,141
...Sir Winston again answered his
country as first lord of the Admiralty.

612
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,394
- After the British...
- Churchill.

613
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,313
You know, you saw that TV
movie you liked about him?

614
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,900
- War efforts as prime minister.
- Yeah.

615
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,319
Three days after his appointment,
he was to make his...

616
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,578
Carmela, can you shut the door?

617
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:01,210
Carmela,
could you please shut the door?

618
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,055
- Hello?
- The horse is sick.

619
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,391
- And the lady says to call you.
- Who's this?

620
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,562
Mr. Ralph's housekeeper. The horse
is very sick, and she said to call...

621
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,148
...because they needed a doctor.
Slow down.

622
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,984
The horse is sick! The Pie-O-My.

623
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,320
- How bad is it?
- They said she may to die.

624
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:32,074
And the doctor, he won't do nothing
until he gets his money.

625
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,535
Tell them I'll take care of it.

626
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,042
Son of a bitch.

627
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,670
I am now nearing the end of my journey.

628
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,717
I hope I still have some
services to render.

629
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,404
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go out.

630
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,366
- It's raining.
- Ralphie Cifaretto's horse is sick.

631
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,536
And they can't find him, so somebody's
gotta go down there and pay the vet.

632
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,623
- Down where?
- The racetrack.

633
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,125
It's a racehorse?

634
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,461
So why do you have to go?

635
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:30,257
- You bought a racehorse?
- No. I didn't buy it.

636
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,552
- It followed you home?
- The horse is sick.

637
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,277
I told him you were coming
with the money.

638
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:35,573
He finally gave her something
to settle her down, so I don't know.

639
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,534
- Is she gonna be all right?
- Well, she stopped thrashing.

640
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,246
That's dangerous. The intestines
get twisted, and you have to cut.

641
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,832
And they're finished as racers then.

642
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:51,047
- You the vet?
- I gave her a shot. She's quieted down.

643
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,677
Here. Here's your fucking money.

644
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,847
You better hope she's gonna be all right.

645
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,772
Shh shh shh.

646
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,733
Good girl.

647
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,572
That's a good girl, okay?
Shh. Okay?

648
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,657
Trust me.

649
