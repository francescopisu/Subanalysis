1
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,988
I told you you didn't have to come.

2
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,034
Yeah, let you drive yourself
when you look this bad?

3
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,706
- Yeah?
- He's out.

4
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,377
He looks good.

5
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,339
- Well, talk to him. Get a sense.
- Okay.

6
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,733
Your cousin's out of rehab. Looks good.

7
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,112
Okay. Sorry about that.

8
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,699
So...

9
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,412
Lyme titers, sed rate, inconclusive.

10
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,040
Score one for the Italians.
You don't have lupus.

11
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,043
Thank God for that.

12
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,009
Think we might be looking
at a viral syndrome.

13
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,595
Maybe mono.

14
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,264
- Oh, God.
- How's your emotional level?

15
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,975
Stress off the charts lately,
like all of us?

16
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,312
- What do you mean?
- Death? Major change of any kind?

17
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,608
No, just the usual.
One day runs into the next.

18
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,321
Stay on the Advil.
Your temperature goes up, you call me.

19
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:22,868
You know, it's amazing. I got
a relative who's got a heroin problem.

20
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,538
Now, the people that need drugs,
all they can get is shit like Advil.

21
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,083
Thank you for coming.

22
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,551
- That was Grove Street.
- I gotta make a stop, down in Sea Bright.

23
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,096
- Tony, I don't feel well.
- Get some sea air. We'll stop at Barr's.

24
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:47,726
- You won't have to cook.
- Goddamn it. Yeah, I really want lobster.

25
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,187
The student-loan people called.

26
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,106
We're late with Allegra's
nursing-school payment.

27
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,737
- Where you going?
- Nordstrom's. They're having a sale.

28
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,115
Sallie Mae calls and your response
is to go shopping?

29
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,703
It's a sale, John.
I need clothes for Italy.

30
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,582
- We're still going, aren't we?
- Might be time to tighten our belts.

31
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,127
I'll be losing money every day
the Esplanade is shut down.

32
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,464
We should try to go.
I spoke to Nicole Lupertazzi.

33
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,593
When she and Little Carmine stayed
at the house all last year, he loved it.

34
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,304
That's good for Little Carmine, then.

35
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:29,434
His fucking wallet isn't tied to
the goddamned Esplanade, goddamn it!

36
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,940
John, why are you yelling at me?

37
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,609
John, what'd I do?

38
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,419
Is that my father's truck?

39
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,968
- What the hell's going on?
- Me to know, you to find out.

40
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,309
So, what do you think, Mel?
Don't see no dry rot.

41
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,687
Mrs. Soprano, Virginia Lupo,
RE/MAX Community Realty.

42
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,147
Hi.

43
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,442
- Tony?
- That's right. It's even got a name.

44
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,071
- Where did this come from?
- That's if we can get it.

45
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,200
It is a huge amount of money.

46
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,828
And your construction
project shut down...

47
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,957
Yeah, well, that can't last forever.
And it's for the family.

48
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:40,088
As the kids get older, it gets harder to
keep us all together, but this is a draw.

49
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,593
Bring friends down,
have big cookouts, Jet Ski...

50
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:49,056
And for us too, though.
When we were piss-poor...

51
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,559
...this was the biggest caviar wish
we could come up with.

52
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,067
Kind of reminds you of
the Kennedy compound, don't it?

53
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,037
Can I ask you why they're selling?
My husband said, "If we can get it."

54
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,249
Well, there is a buyer already.
In fact, the house is sold.

55
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,796
But there's a chance that these buyers
won't qualify for financing.

56
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,590
And I know the owner, Alan.

57
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,635
He lives just next door here.
He's an attorney.

58
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:31,890
If you're offering cash, I thought
you should at least see the place.

59
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,518
So it's not really for sale.

60
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,396
It's just as well,
because we really couldn't swing this.

61
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,689
There's Al!

62
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,785
The jury has claimed
they are deadlocked.

63
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,789
However, I'm inclined
to agree with prosecution.

64
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,209
I'm going to give them
additional time to reach a verdict.

65
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,629
We should've had a hung-jury mistrial.
Object, for chrissake!

66
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,591
Allen charge. It has to play out.

67
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,058
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've communicated that you feel...

68
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,019
...that you're unable to come
to a unanimous verdict.

69
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,524
Now, I know that you've been at it
for a while, and it can be frustrating...

70
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,819
...but we've all spent
a lot of time on this trial.

71
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,739
And being as I have no reason
to believe that another jury...

72
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,493
...with the same evidence would
be better able to reach a verdict...

73
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,789
...I'm going to ask you to go back
in there and reason with each other...

74
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:42,919
...and apply the law and come back
in here with a verdict.

75
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,297
If not, I wanna move on.

76
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,300
Here.

77
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,723
Did somebody check this
to make sure we got everything?

78
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,099
Yes.

79
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,229
Well, keep me posted.

80
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,024
Dinner's served!

81
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,742
- Get any sleep?
- Couldn't.

82
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,997
We have absolutely no business getting
into something like that house...

83
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,541
...with A.J. two years away
from college.

84
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,212
That was Virginia Lupo on the phone.
She hasn't heard from the owner.

85
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,255
I guess that deal's gonna go through.

86
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,424
I wonder who they are.

87
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,471
Motherfucking goddamn
orange-peel beef!

88
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,099
Well, call them up.
You got me plain soup, right?

89
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,769
We'll be finished eating
by the time he gets back.

90
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,230
You have to check the order
while they're here.

91
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,775
What good does that do? You still gotta
go get it and come back again.

92
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,569
- What happened?
- They left out part of the order.

93
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,697
- Call them up.
- Sit down and eat.

94
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,079
Well, I guess some things
just weren't meant to be.

95
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,705
What are we talking about?

96
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,375
I was thinking of buying
a house on the shore.

97
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,086
- Tony.
- Un-fucking-believable!

98
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,088
Well, would we have a gym?

99
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,591
It's the shore.
Wouldn't you want to be outdoors?

100
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,386
Forget that.
You're fined $3 for the F-word.

101
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,472
I heard Dad say "mother-F"
when I was coming down the stairs.

102
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,850
He's fined too.
We're gonna make this policy work.

103
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,352
It's too late.

104
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,828
What's going on?

105
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,668
You know, it does seem like
a good value, even at that price.

106
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,338
Waterfront property in that area...

107
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,843
We probably wouldn't get hurt,
as an investment.

108
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,638
Well, you're the one that took
real-estate classes.

109
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,517
Didn't you say that a person shouldn't
look at a house as an investment?

110
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,938
I know you. If you don't get the place,
you'll sulk. And I'll be the wet blanket.

111
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,525
I'll sulk? I was sleeping.

112
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,614
Just...

113
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,533
If you want me to sign off...

114
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,578
...we probably wouldn't lose money.

115
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,460
But if you don't want to go through
with it, believe me, that's fine too.

116
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,311
But if you did, Virginia Lupo's
phone number is on the bureau.

117
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:51,858
And, you know, better to act
quickly if, you know...

118
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:57,906
More is lost by indecision than by
wrong decision, that's all I'm saying.

119
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,288
- Hey, Jack Lemmon! How's Lee Remick?
- Hey, Ton.

120
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,750
So how the fuck are you?

121
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,378
- That place help you?
- Oh, yeah.

122
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,589
I found out about strengths I have
I didn't even know I had.

123
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,384
- Well, you look fucking great.
- Thank you.

124
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,054
Thank everybody for forcing me
to deal with it.

125
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,350
- Especially Adriana.
- So you're not shooting junk, right?

126
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,020
Fuck, no.
I'm completely clean and sober.

127
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,106
Which one of the 12 steps you on now?

128
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,692
The only one I haven't exactly
done is go around...

129
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,320
...to all the people I fucked over
while I was using and apologize.

130
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,119
Maybe you shouldn't do that one.

131
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,872
- You know, let sleeping dogs lie.
- That's what I was thinking.

132
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,502
Maybe in a couple of cases,
I'll send flowers. Or cash, in some cases.

133
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,680
- Where's Carmine at?
- No change whatsoever.

134
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,100
Where you at?

135
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,938
I think a movement from below
is not palatable to the other bosses.

136
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,982
It's what they fear most.

137
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,026
A movement from outside,
it's more forgivable.

138
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,447
And more understandable,
given the facts.

139
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,533
I mean, you've been reasonable.

140
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:29,330
If I do it, what do you do for me?

141
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:35,170
I take a sad song and make it better
with the other families, as regards you.

142
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,505
You're smart to have reservations.

143
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,426
But there's differences between
this and Castellano.

144
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,804
Yes, you still got the four other
families who could raise a stink.

145
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,641
But Andy's my brother-in-law.
I have their ear.

146
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,396
I'm gonna pass.

147
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,982
- Fuck you talking about?
- I'm taking all the risk.

148
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,568
Fuck were you talking about
last time then?

149
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,528
What would it take?

150
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,576
Fuck even one percentage point.

151
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:11,080
All claims to my HUD
business are irrigated.

152
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,624
- All right.
- Not yet.

153
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:17,879
All future construction projects,
60/40 in my favor.

154
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,310
What I'm gonna tell you
is for your ears only, and Sil's.

155
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,064
We're gonna take out
Carmine Lupertazzi.

156
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,407
- Johnny Sack's gonna go to war, Ton.
- No, he's not.

157
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,540
That's right. Carmine's got major income
besides construction, Johnny don't.

158
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,835
The only other person hurting worse
than these pricks is me.

159
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,380
Whacking the boss of one
of the five families?

160
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,883
- Johnny's a snaky fuck.
- Well, that's something to be considered.

161
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:08,012
But remember also how deeply hurt
fucking Johnny felt over Carmine...

162
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,473
...not backing him on those slurs
against Ginny.

163
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,766
Life's funny.

164
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,477
Carmine never made that right
with John.

165
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,313
I knew back then that was a mistake.

166
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,024
We gonna hit Carmine soon?

167
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,736
If I'm gonna buy this house,
I need the Esplanade scratch.

168
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,158
It shouldn't look like what it is.

169
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:33,788
Home invasion, carjacking,
fucking ingrown toenail.

170
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,334
- I know these black guys from Irvington.
- Well, that's the right idea.

171
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:43,381
It can never get out
who whacked the old fuck.

172
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,926
- Are they trustworthy, these guys?
- Yeah.

173
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,012
Make sure.

174
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,484
Help you?

175
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,112
Hi, how you doing? I'm Tony Soprano.

176
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,741
I was here with my wife
the other day with Virginia Lupo.

177
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,577
Oh, right, right. Alan Sapinsly.

178
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,955
- How are you?
- So, what do you think?

179
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,000
She says those other people
are gonna go through with it.

180
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,629
I was gonna go talk to you,
after I took another look at the place.

181
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,674
The whole thing is galling. I don't think
they're gonna qualify for financing...

182
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,470
...and we gave them this God-awful
90-day escrow. My wife's doing.

183
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,931
She liked Mrs. Kim.

184
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:37,393
I can do 15 days.
Shortest allowable by law.

185
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,523
Never tire of painting this.

186
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,530
- You'd be coming in with cash, right?
- Yeah.

187
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,160
Fuck this.

188
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,375
Dr. Kim? Hey, Alan Sapinsly.

189
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:04,712
It's not, huh?
Well, we've got serious problems.

190
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,715
On the house. Sure.

191
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:11,219
He's going into surgery. Doesn't want
to talk there in the prep room.

192
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,848
Yes, I'm here.
So, look, what does your lender say?

193
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,145
Jesus, doctor. Well, I take almost
no comfort from those words.

194
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,564
And were I you, I wouldn't either.

195
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,733
I'm aware we have a contract in place.

196
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,319
Doctor, please, I'm an attorney.
Look, Cho-san...

197
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,113
No, wait, you're not listening.

198
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,992
Simply stated, I want the chance
to sell to a more-qualified buyer...

199
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,120
...if I can find one at this late date.

200
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,497
Well, actually, it's very simp...

201
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,875
Do you want to do all the talking
and I'll just stand here?

202
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,335
Thank you.

203
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,297
You call Virginia Lupo, she calls
the bank, you get your deposit back.

204
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,760
Your wife's a grown woman,
she'll adjust.

205
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,138
Look, Dr. Kim,
I spent 10 years as a litigator.

206
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:59,559
Buy this property, I'll make your life
a misery. I'll tort you into the poorhouse.

207
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,853
I've got an overseas call.

208
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,856
Well, think it over.
You have Virginia's number.

209
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,152
- We'll see.
- I wouldn't wanna be the patient...

210
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,822
...he's gonna operate on.
Let's hold a good thought?

211
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,002
Hello?

212
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,464
Oh, Virginia, sure, hi.

213
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,883
We did?

214
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,645
All right!

215
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,068
Picture the fishing off that dock.

216
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,782
God, it really is beautiful, isn't it?

217
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,911
- First time I felt good signing papers.
- Dad, blue crabs!

218
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,915
Oh, my God. This is nice.

219
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,134
You'll inherit this.

220
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,639
Dad, what a thing to say.

221
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:38,157
Anthony Soprano,
you are full of surprises.

222
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,203
It's good to see a smile on your face.

223
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,135
- Praise the Lord for sobriety.
- The higher power.

224
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:04,142
- That 12-step shit doing for you?
- Yeah. Thanks for asking.

225
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,227
We sold you H when
that was your thing.

226
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,856
And still we here when it's
wop-whacking time in Brooklyn.

227
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,819
- It should look like a carjack.
- See? That's why you came to us.

228
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,779
That's some stereotyping shit.

229
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,282
He goes mall-walking
inside King's Plaza.

230
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,577
7:00 a.m., Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Regular.

231
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,621
Macy's entrance,
Avenue U and Flatbush.

232
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,915
You got the down payment?

233
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,553
Next sound you hear.

234
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,944
Home of the burger, what's your beef?

235
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,945
OHH

236
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,864
I'm sorry.

237
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:04,118
- I have wrong number.
- Well, this is the Soprano residence.

238
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,330
- Tony?
- No, this is Anthony.

239
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, yes. The handsome boy.

240
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,377
Who is this?

241
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,255
Is your mother there?

242
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,466
Ma, telephone!

243
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,509
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

244
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,806
Hello?

245
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:31,229
- Is this Mrs. Soprano?
- Yes, it is.

246
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,857
I used to fuck your husband.

247
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,402
Hello...

248
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,877
A.J., I got it!

249
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,551
- Hello?
- Tony loves me, you know.

250
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,513
If it wasn't for his kids,
you would be out on the street.

251
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,099
- What do you want?
- I thought you'd want to know...

252
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,935
...we have some sadness in common.

253
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,397
He has been sleeping with
my cousin Svetlana.

254
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:19,026
That's right. While she was
taking care of his uncle.

255
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,114
- Hello?
- You piece of shit.

256
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,909
Yes, I'm a piece of shit.

257
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:32,415
I'm a piece of shit which the world
every morning pushes out of its butt.

258
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,961
So, if you can, imagine where
you are on the pecking order.

259
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,345
You call my house again, you ever
speak to one of my children again...

260
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,474
...I will track you down and I will
kill you. We have got guns here.

261
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,603
- I mean it.
- You remember my cousin.

262
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,606
She was also his mama's caregiver
with the one leg.

263
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,861
It is so absurd,
why would I make it up?

264
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,938
What the fuck?

265
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,446
Carmela!

266
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,201
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You fucking shitbag!

267
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,413
Don't come up here!
Get the fuck out of this house!

268
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,345
Carm?

269
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,347
What's the matter?

270
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,268
Carm, what did I do now, huh?

271
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,647
Carm?

272
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,317
What did I do?

273
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,986
What did I do?

274
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,615
Your mother told you what I said
to your father about her psoriasis?

275
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,410
I was just trying to be honest with him.

276
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:39,333
You have made a fool of me
for years with these whores.

277
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,210
Now it's come into our home?

278
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,713
- What are you talking about?
- The Russian called.

279
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,174
Your son answered the telephone.

280
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,635
Oh, Jesus.

281
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,721
She's insane. She's fucking certifiable.

282
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:56,058
I told you, you can't believe nothing
she says, whatever it is.

283
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,980
We haven't seen each other like that.
I swear to Christ. I told you!

284
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,608
- What about her cousin?
- What?

285
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,068
- No.
- The nurse...

286
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,488
...who took care of your mother?
Who I liked?

287
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,658
Who I talked to on the phone
about your mother's alopecia...

288
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,620
...and her bowel movements?
Who you told me came from an agency?

289
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,708
Who I shared vodka with the night
your mother died?

290
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,503
- You've been fucking her?
- There is not a shred of truth in that.

291
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,758
Why would the cousin make it up?
Because she's jealous! Why, you fuck!

292
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,220
Let go of me!

293
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,073
Carm.

294
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,037
Just get out, Tony.
Don't even say anything.

295
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,582
I'm not going anywhere,
and you know it.

296
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,837
- So let's just lie down, we'll calm down.
- Get your hands off of me!

297
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,133
Don't you touch me ever again.

298
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,803
Where's A.J?

299
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:19,141
So you've had a one-legged one
now, huh? That's nice.

300
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,686
You've had quite a time
on my watch.

301
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,981
The preschool assistant.

302
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,193
- The weight lifter.
- Least I never stole from you.

303
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,279
- Who stole, Tony? Who? Me?
- My own wife.

304
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,448
Forty grand from the bird feeder.

305
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,869
Bird feeder? Listen to yourself.
You sound demented.

306
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,665
You want to hit me, Tony?
Go ahead.

307
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:49,171
Just go away, please.
I can't stand it anymore.

308
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,468
- I didn't do any...
- I found her fingernail, Tony!

309
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,889
You saw it that day on your night table.
I found it and I put it there.

310
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,017
- I know you saw it.
- That...

311
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,646
What? "That" what?

312
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,691
Nothing.

313
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,694
Nothing.

314
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,993
I mean...

315
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,080
What?

316
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,625
You know what I don't
understand, Tony?

317
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,338
What does she have that I don't have?

318
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,016
I did not carry on an affair
with the cousin...

319
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,060
...and I will take a goddamn
polygraph to that effect.

320
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,940
I want you to leave this house, Tony.
Please.

321
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,860
I want you to leave me alone.

322
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,620
- What about the kids?
- Yeah, it's horrible.

323
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,788
God help them.

324
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,437
Irina!

325
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,233
Irina!

326
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,241
Open the fucking door, or I'll kick it in!

327
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,500
She's not there.
Probably she hides in Brighton Beach.

328
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,879
She blames you for Ronnie Zellman.
You beat him with belt.

329
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,966
He felt weak in front of her.
She told me he couldn't perform.

330
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,892
- They broke up not so long after.
- Fuck that!

331
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,276
Who told her about us?
Not you, please.

332
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,655
It was what's-her-name, right?
The fucking one who walked in on us.

333
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,741
Branca. We had bad argument
over FICA...

334
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,662
...and federal withholding
I take from her paycheck.

335
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:33,043
Jesus fucking Christ.
FICA and federal withholding?

336
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:45,889
I gotta go home tomorrow,
and I gotta tell my kids we're separating.

337
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,434
It's gonna rip them up.

338
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,438
Divorce is very hard for kids.

339
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,065
After this, they don't trust.

340
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,651
I'm child of divorce.

341
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,452
Shouldn't have been drinking
in the afternoon.

342
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,371
How about a little sympathy?

343
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,250
- You got ice in your veins?
- I had ice in my veins on your uncle couch?

344
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:19,339
- Most expensive piece of ass I ever had.
- Right. I know what you are thinking too.

345
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:30,017
Take care, Tony. You're a strong guy.
You'll be all right.

346
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:46,301
- What's up?
- So how's it going with Christopher home?

347
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:50,556
- Good. That place was a godsend.
- So the wedding's back on?

348
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,893
We haven't talked about it.

349
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,524
Except...

350
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,901
Except what?

351
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,320
Well...

352
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,533
He says he isn't sure anymore
he'd be a good father.

353
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,828
After killing my dog.

354
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,832
You have kids?

355
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,962
So how's Tony? He's been
house-hunting down the shore?

356
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,885
Beautiful place too.

357
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,429
What about Ralph?

358
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,849
Cifaretto? Heard anything there?

359
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,270
Chrissy says he has a pretty
serious drug problem too.

360
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,772
May have hit bottom somewheres.

361
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,691
Chrissy says he wants to...

362
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,612
...you know, help get him
in recovery when he resurfaces.

363
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,909
You know Ralph's
second-in-command, Vito?

364
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,911
Yeah, the fat guy.

365
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,623
When Christopher was away I had
that asshole calling every five minutes...

366
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,585
...to see if I "needed anything."
No!

367
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,714
- Does Christopher know?
- You kidding me? He'd kill him.

368
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,133
Not really, I mean...

369
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,344
You know, he'd be angry.

370
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,979
I'm supposed to meet my mom.

371
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,192
Go ahead.

372
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,742
Thank you.

373
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,775
I saw your car. Qué pasa?

374
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,904
Well...

375
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:15,784
Things aren't very good at home,
so I came down to sleep on my boat...

376
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:20,455
...and it was being refinished,
and the smell of the paint drove me out.

377
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:25,460
- Sorry, I've been up to bat three times.
- Yeah, I think she's...

378
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,921
...thinking of separating.

379
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,217
What you wanna do, you wanna
go around and meet perfunctorily...

380
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,594
...with the top divorce attorneys
in your area.

381
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,931
That way, if worst happens,
none of them can take her as a client.

382
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,100
Conflict of interest.

383
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,354
- That's pretty good.
- Just do it, fella.

384
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,566
But you gotta find a hotel until
you officially take possession.

385
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:53,405
- Something happens to you, I'm liable.
- All right. Let me just clean up a little.

386
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,592
- Hi, I'm Tony...
- I know who you are. Come in, please.

387
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,220
Tony.

388
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,598
What's up?

389
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,979
That thing we were talking about,
this thing with me and my wife...

390
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,732
Alan just told me.

391
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,319
The thing is, in light of it,
I was going over it in the shower...

392
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,572
...and I realized that as much
as I want this place...

393
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,034
...now is not the time for me
to be buying a house.

394
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:44,915
Sorry. I know it's a big disappointment.
You ought to see how I feel.

395
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,335
I just wanna get my deposit back,
and I'll get out of your life.

396
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:52,881
Tony, it's not that clear to me how your
marital situation negates the purchase.

397
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,094
I mean, most of this was for my kids.
For my wife.

398
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,096
- That is so sad.
- Excuse me, honey.

399
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,640
We had that place on the market
a year and a half.

400
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,017
We had two offers, you and the Kims.

401
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,353
- So, what about them?
- The Kims?

402
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,564
I can't go back to them.
I guess I could, but I'm not going to.

403
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,652
They'd hold my feet to the fire. I don't
wanna be insensitive with what you've...

404
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,279
...got on your plate
but we have a signed contract.

405
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,365
- Alan...
- No, baloney! I dumped a buyer...

406
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,410
...because they were in love with it.
It was the cash and the short escrow.

407
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,746
Look, who knows
what's gonna happen, Tony?

408
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,499
You and your wife could be back
together in a month...

409
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,876
...leaving A.S. here fucked in the ass.

410
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,673
Whatever.

411
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,842
Look...

412
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:40,428
What's the big deal? Why don't you
just let me out of this thing, okay?

413
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,305
I can't. I have partners.

414
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,017
Excuse me.

415
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,566
I gotta take this.
It was very nice to meet you.

416
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,902
But I'm not buying your house.

417
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,577
That guy's a mobster.

418
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,163
They buy houses from people,
they conduct business.

419
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,332
I dealt with them on that Neapolitan
copyright thing for Enya.

420
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:14,588
I'll probably let him walk. But that's
a negotiation, which he knows full well.

421
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,883
- You don't have any partners.
- Thank you, Rabbi.

422
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,512
I just talked to Carmine.
He's ready to settle.

423
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,974
Are you kidding me?
Everything's in motion.

424
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,726
Welcome to my world.

425
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:41,990
Now sit.

426
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,374
I'm sorry to learn about
the marital situation, Tony.

427
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,877
Our thing is more than a livelihood.

428
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:58,506
If one of us suffers a personal tragedy,
falls ill and whatnot...

429
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,550
...we all feel it deeply.

430
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,886
No matter what kind of acrimony
is in the air.

431
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,222
What's in the air is you're losing money.

432
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,724
We all agree we want to get back
to earning.

433
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,476
But I reiterate again...

434
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:14,356
...Zellman had a hand in HUD,
so I can't, as a matter of principle...

435
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,775
...relinquish my claim.

436
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,903
- So?
- I said 40...

437
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,406
...you said five and a half,
which was ridiculous.

438
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,867
Let's split the difference.

439
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,994
Twenty percent.

440
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,045
All right, 15.

441
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,672
You know what?

442
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:44,010
In the interest of putting this shit to
bed, if that's what it's gonna take...

443
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,513
...fifteen.

444
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,977
Good.

445
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:00,277
My son was a big help in all this.
I want you always to remember that.

446
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,779
Even after I'm gone.

447
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,451
- But I'm not going no place.
- Healthy as a fucking rhino, this guy.

448
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,578
You stay that way.

449
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,339
- Hi.
- Hi.

450
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,633
Did you get any sleep?

451
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,803
A little, I think.

452
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,267
Maybe it would be better
if you went back to school.

453
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,770
Got your head into your schoolwork.
Be with your friends.

454
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:39,274
I'd just be thinking about
what's going on here all the time.

455
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,571
I just keep thinking...

456
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,699
...I used to feel so superior
because so many of my friends...

457
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:52,579
...had these fucked-up divorced parents.
I guess I did too.

458
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,581
And like Finn...

459
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,543
I'm not saying I want kids,
but if we did...

460
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,546
...I used to imagine...

461
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:07,761
...we'd all be together on the holidays,
Christmas, all around this big fire.

462
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,765
You will have a wonderful future,
Meadow.

463
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:16,269
We had a lot of wonderful times
as a family.

464
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:23,109
- All predicated on bullshit.
- I don't want to fight with you, Meadow.

465
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,071
That's not true. I think you know it.

466
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,373
It was because of Furio, wasn't it?

467
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,586
Who said anything about Furio?

468
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,340
I have never been unfaithful
to your father.

469
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,053
Daddy was.

470
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,016
This is not something I want
to talk about. I'm sorry.

471
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,727
Not now, not ever.

472
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:04,317
Jesus, how could you eat shit
from him for all those years?

473
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,494
Fresh pepper?

474
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,913
Just a little.

475
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,339
About you and Carmela...

476
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,551
I'm sorry.

477
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,475
This is not al dente.

478
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,531
- Hello?
- Fucking amazing, huh?

479
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,076
Well, I guess that's that, huh?

480
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,292
Things have a momentum of their own.

481
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,423
More is lost by indecision
than wrong decision.

482
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,176
That's a good point.

483
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,973
Okay, then. You'll hear from me.

484
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,020
That was J.S.

485
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,731
We're not on for Tuesday
no more, right?

486
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,399
Wrong.

487
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,948
Johnny Sack.

488
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,952
I always worked very fucking hard
to make him think I liked him.

489
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,997
I'd try to feel him out about shit.

490
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,876
I think he and Ralphie were
in bed in some way.

491
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,756
It went bad with that joke shit.

492
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,510
So?

493
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,596
We reached an agreement.

494
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,849
When Tony gave him his final number,
Carmine's Depends blew out.

495
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,018
Oh, my fucking back!

496
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,063
That cot at the pork store,
not really good for sleeping, T.

497
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,149
With all due love and respect
to Carmela...

498
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,653
...I'd put her shit out on the curb
and let it rain on her.

499
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,321
You can't disrupt the kids.

500
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,575
- That shit traumatizes them for life.
- It's his house as much as it is hers.

501
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:22,664
- More. I paid for it.
- That's right, T. I'm on your side on this.

502
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,215
She talked me into
buying it in the first place.

503
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,675
Now I'm out in the streets?

504
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,011
These fucking phones.

505
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,556
We were better off years ago.

506
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,936
- Yeah?
- Tony? Alan Sapinsly.

507
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,272
- What?
- I hadn't heard from you.

508
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,567
My partners and I have decided
to let you out of your obligation.

509
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,236
I want my 200 grand
by the end of the week.

510
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,738
As to that,
I'm not rescinding the deposit.

511
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,825
That's what they're for,
to hold parties to agreements.

512
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,953
If you want to make me an offer...

513
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,331
No, I think I'll buy the house.

514
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,377
My family has parties
till 4, 5 in the morning.

515
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,256
I can show damages, and I'm being
generous in not enforcing the sale.

516
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,426
Damages? They haven't started yet.

517
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:21,055
Listen to me. There's a paper trail to our
dispute, and Virginia Lupo's a witness.

518
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,601
A hair on my head gets mussed,
the authorities know just where to go.

519
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,271
Alan, you misread me entirely.

520
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,482
- You must think I'm a fucking thug.
- Just be forewarned.

521
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,027
You're not getting your deposit back.

522
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,706
Jesus, you scared me to death.

523
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,344
This is my house, Carmela,
and I'm not leaving.

524
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:03,931
Get out of here, Tony.
I asked you once nicely.

525
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,645
All right, look.

526
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:13,024
I know what happened was wrong.
I was an asshole.

527
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:17,570
And I apologize. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

528
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,825
- I said, get out.
- Make me.

529
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:27,413
I have an appointment with a lawyer,
Tony. I will get a restraining order.

530
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,832
A lawyer? Go ahead.

531
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:35,171
Go on, call him.
Here. Use my phone.

532
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,383
- Fine, stay.
- Come here.

533
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,552
- You're not going anywhere.
- Let go! Your son'll be home.

534
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,806
- You want him to see his father like this?
- You'd love that.

535
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:48,393
- I'm not leaving here, Carmela.
- I don't love you anymore!

536
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:52,063
I don't want you! You are not
sleeping in my bed, Tony!

537
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,899
The thought of it now
makes me sick!

538
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,947
Jesus Christ almighty,
I'm going fucking crazy!

539
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:24,011
- Mom's gonna let you stay out here?
- Let? This is my house.

540
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,306
Ain't it better when I'm here?

541
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,101
- Well, sure.
- Come on.

542
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,395
We'll bring them down
to the garage tomorrow.

543
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,443
What time is it?

544
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,779
- You just getting home?
- We were studying.

545
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,491
Oh, yeah? From now on, I'm gonna
take a bigger hand in this shit.

546
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,829
I'm gonna be right out here.
Be extra respectful to your mother.

547
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,622
She's going through a hard time.

548
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,958
- Did she say something?
- I'm just saying.

549
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:00,131
All right. Go to bed.
It's a school night.

550
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,729
Audiences have been given
an abundance of programming...

551
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,981
...and they vote every hour,
every minute...

552
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,818
...every five minutes
with their remote...

553
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,489
Thanks, by the way,
for drinking wine in front of me.

554
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,743
- Hello?
- Call it off.

555
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,204
- The old guy.
- Yeah?

556
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,875
- Something don't make sense here.
- You think it's a setup?

557
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,503
Not necessarily, but...

558
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,798
...our friend is very anxious
to pass the ball, the prick.

559
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,009
But nobody can know this
was ever considered.

560
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,429
I'll offer my guys half of what
they'd have got. That should do it.

561
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,268
I just want you to make sure.
I told you that.

562
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,299
Hey.

563
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,092
It's all there.

564
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,053
You get the taste to chip
a little H again...

565
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,476
...don't forget to call us.
You're gonna keep this quiet.

566
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,688
- I got the mouth on a statue, nigga.
- Word.

567
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,149
See you around.

568
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:39,790
- He ain't quit. He's just freshening up.
- Don't say shit to Kaisha about this.

569
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,251
Or she be haunting my ass
for that child support.

570
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,100
Hey.

571
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,018
Hi.

572
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,070
What?

573
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,824
I was wondering when you were gonna
move those seats down to the garage.

574
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:03,290
Seriously? That's what you came
out here to talk to me about?

575
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,584
They're on the lawn.
They'll ruin the grass.

576
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:09,255
"Bad for the grass, bad for the grass."

577
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:15,261
I can't put the sprinklers on over there,
Tony, without the seats getting wet.

578
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,930
They're your seats,
I don't wanna wreck them.

579
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,016
I'll get right on it.

580
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,648
Why do you have to make
even this little thing so difficult?

581
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:31,235
What reason could you have for talking
to me about theater seats...

582
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:35,573
...except to bust my balls?
I wanted to water while I was out.

583
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,993
Yeah, right.

584
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,080
Fuck you.

585
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,208
That's gonna cost you $3.

586
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,842
You know what, Tony?
What's done is done.

587
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,762
We are where we are,
and it's for the best.

588
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,515
But just for the record, or it might
even interest you to know...

589
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:06,937
...that I might actually have gone on
with your cheating and your bullshit...

590
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,733
...if your attitude around here
had been even the least bit loving...

591
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,611
...cooperative, interested...

592
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,117
Whose idea was Whitecaps?

593
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,870
It's just a bigger version
of an emerald ring.

594
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,540
- So you can keep on with your other life.
- You don't know me at all.

595
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,336
I know you better than anybody, Tony.
Even your friends.

596
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,048
- Which is probably why you hate me.
- Hate you?

597
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,427
Well, don't worry,
I'm going to hell when I die.

598
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:43,224
Nice thing to say to a person
heading into an MRI.

599
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,160
You know, Tony...

600
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,248
...I have always been sorry I said that.

601
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,918
You were my guy.

602
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:16,257
You could be so sweet.
Nobody could make me laugh like you.

603
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,556
Carmela, who the fuck did you think
I was when you married me?

604
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:28,018
You knew my father. You grew up around
Dickie Moltisanti and your Uncle Eddie.

605
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,604
Where do you get off acting
surprised and miffed...

606
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,439
...when there are women
on the side?

607
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,692
- You knew the deal.
- Deal?

608
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,945
Your mother can talk all she wants
about what's-his-name.

609
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,532
You and I know that the other
boyfriend you were debating marrying...

610
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,994
...was Jerry Tufi with his father's
snowplow business.

611
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:49,081
And we now know that
that wouldn't have suited you at all.

612
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,084
You really don't hear me, do you?

613
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:57,381
- You think for me it's all about things.
- No, no, I forced all this shit on you.

614
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:02,261
What you really crave is a little Hyundai
and a simple gold heart on a chain.

615
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,139
You are so fucking hateful.

616
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,230
- Can I tell you something, Tony?
- Don't pretend like I got a choice.

617
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,610
The last year, I have been dreaming...

618
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:21,906
...and fantasizing and in love with Furio.

619
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,743
What?

620
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,662
When he'd come to pick you up...

621
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:33,792
...I would look forward to it
all night long in bed next to you.

622
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,170
Those nights when you were
actually in the bed.

623
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:42,676
And he would ring the doorbell, I felt like
my heart would come out of my chest.

624
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:49,016
He would smile and we'd talk, and then
you would come down the stairs.

625
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,436
And I felt probably like someone
who is terminally ill...

626
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,940
...and somehow they manage
to forget it for a minute.

627
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,109
And then it all comes back.

628
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:09,495
- He'd talk to you? Oh, poor you!
- He made me feel like I mattered!

629
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,706
You asked me what Irina's cousin
has that you don't have.

630
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,626
I thought about it,
because it's a pretty good question.

631
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:19,004
Yeah, she's sexy enough,
even with one pin gone, but that's not it.

632
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,757
I could converse with her
because she had something to say!

633
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,135
I am here! I have things to say!

634
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:28,555
Besides "Bring the chairs down"
and "Did you sign the living trust?"

635
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,141
She's a grown woman
who's been kicked around.

636
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,353
She's been on her own,
and she's had to fight and struggle.

637
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:38,899
Unlike me, is that it?
Who the fuck wanted it like this?

638
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,860
Who the fuck pissed and moaned
at just the idea...

639
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,113
...of me with a fucking
real-estate license?

640
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:48,325
Free to sit back for 20 fucking years
and fiddle with the air conditioning...

641
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,538
...and fucking bitch and complain
and fucking bitch, bitch, bitch!

642
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,790
To me! To your priest!

643
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,542
Fuck it!

644
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:08,053
Who knew all this time
you wanted Tracy and Hepburn?

645
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:15,185
Tony, what about the thousand other
fucking pigs you had your dick in?

646
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,063
The strippers, the cocktail waitresses.

647
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,108
Were you best friends
with all of them too?

648
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,154
You fucking hypocrite.

649
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,678
The judge is calling you all
into the courtroom.

650
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,641
Okay, thanks.

651
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,526
Hello?

652
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,531
Hello?

653
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,466
The number you are calling
was blocked...

654
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:31,804
...and cannot be called back using
your last-call return service.

655
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,650
"We are still hopelessly deadlocked.

656
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:49,446
One juror refuses to deliberate
and can't be reasoned with.

657
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,532
- What should we do now?"
- Your Honor.

658
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,909
Again, I must move for a mistrial.

659
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:58,372
Your Honor, the government asks that
you give them another Allen charge...

660
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,083
...to go back and try again.

661
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:04,128
As much as I'd like to,
this jury's been at it a long time.

662
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:08,382
I don't see where one or two more days
is going to change anything.

663
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,384
Bring in the jury.

664
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,694
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

665
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,363
...I see that you are hopelessly
deadlocked.

666
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,950
And I have no choice
but to declare a mistrial.

667
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,871
I know that you did the best you could.

668
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:43,750
You have performed a valuable service.
You may be excused.

669
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,094
- Hey.
- Well done.

670
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,852
Beth, stay in touch.

671
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,438
Call me when your grandson is born.

672
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:08,233
I wouldn't want to think of you
on that day.

673
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,032
Dad?

674
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,911
Battle of Tarawa.
Marines had no air cover.

675
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,079
It was a slaughter.

676
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:29,963
- War? I don't know.
- There's a Coke in there.

677
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,717
Can I move in here?

678
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:38,430
- What's wrong with your room?
- I can't take it anymore.

679
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:42,601
Mom's just on my case all the time.
My dinner got cold.

680
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:46,396
So I was on the phone with Devin.
We had to do an algebra problem.

681
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:56,615
Look, I told you she's having
a hard time right now.

682
00:58:56,783 --> 00:59:00,327
- She goes to a lot of trouble to cook.
- Well, I didn't ask her to.

683
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,913
It's not fair. Why do I have
to get stuck with her?

684
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,416
Hey, don't talk about
your mother like that.

685
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,044
You don't have to put up
with her shit anymore.

686
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,797
I heard you tell her off
out by the pool.

687
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,634
Well, you're not staying in here.

688
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,678
- Get that out of your head.
- Why not?

689
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,598
It would hurt her feelings, you don't
want to be in her part of the house.

690
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,020
Your old amp's hooked back up.

691
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,947
Be careful.
I heard you bang the other one.

692
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,950
What are you gonna do without
your speakers? I'll take them.

693
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:44,329
- They're just borrowing them.
- I'll come back for the amp.

694
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,417
You can come in here and watch TV
with me, but you can't stay here.

695
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,336
Fuck.

696
00:59:53,965 --> 01:00:00,637
Here. Go buy her one of those CDs
she likes and some flowers.

697
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:04,725
Tell her you're sorry, that you'll
try to be more considerate.

698
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,622
We should call everybody,
have a big party.

699
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:33,712
Call Volpe's, have them send
over a couple of pies. But that's it.

700
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:36,673
There's a hearty Burgundy
still in the fridge.

701
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,140
I don't suppose Tony would come.

702
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,853
With what's going on
up at that abattoir.

703
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,940
I don't think so, Uncle Jun.

704
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:04,201
Yeah, I want to get one large cheese
and tomato and then one with alig'.

705
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,495
Yeah, it's me.

706
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,181
Bobby.

707
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:30,644
Go down by the cellar door, see if Murf
left the envelope under the flagstone.

708
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,854
He wouldn't have been around today.

709
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,942
- I'll go look later.
- Do it now. Is that asking so much?

710
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,903
I just went through the trial
of my life.

711
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:28,952
To wonderful friends, to Alan's
shark-fin soup and to a wonderful day.

712
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,289
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

713
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:38,628
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the Sands Hotel proudly presents...

714
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:43,300
...the star of our show,
direct from the bar, Dean Martin!

715
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,343
What the hell?

716
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,521
It's that boat.

717
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,330
Stugots? Fucking goombah trash.

718
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,291
This whole shoreline's turning
into the Gulf of Sorrento.

719
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:20,086
Hey, buddy! Turn it down!

720
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:30,597
How long I been on?

721
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,764
Been waiting long?

722
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,560
Sorry, I was interviewing
divorce lawyers.

723
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:20,355
That's why I always ask myself,
is it worth it financially?

724
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,108
You and Ginny are
the old married couple.

725
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:27,112
Marriage can be very hard work
if both aren't pulling that load.

726
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,159
I was wondering, why the delay?

727
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,579
I was gonna call you.

728
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,998
You're not gonna be happy.

729
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,251
I'm out.

730
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,130
Come on, whacking a boss
is bad for business.

731
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,716
- And now that he's settled...
- We can weather it.

732
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,969
It's not just the internal upheaval.

733
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,763
Mr. and Mrs. John Q. America...

734
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:58,268
...they sit still for our shit. So people
get ripped off. They figure it's not them.

735
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:03,523
But if it's the fucking O.K. Corral
out there, the feds take heat.

736
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:08,862
- Tony, this is very disappointing.
- I know.

737
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,656
But he's old. You're gonna get
your chance soon enough.

738
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,201
Don't go into coaching, Tony.
It's not your long suit.

739
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:19,789
- What I was gonna say...
- Tomorrow I go into work.

740
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:25,337
Creeps on this petty pace.
And I take orders from him again?

741
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:30,383
Or that disgusting fucking
cocksucker idiot son of his?

742
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,889
- I shouldn't be hearing that.
- Oh, really?

743
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,563
What I was gonna say was...

744
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,691
...it's a major step.

745
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:50,028
But if you wanna do it
without me as a partner...

746
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,781
...you do what you gotta do.

747
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,909
I will never, ever reveal
any conversation we ever had.

748
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,994
The thing is, we had
those conversations.

749
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:00,455
Your mouth was moving
along with mine.

750
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:05,627
So now we go back about our business
at the Esplanade like it never happened?

751
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,964
- Yeah, that would be the healthy choice.
- Healthy for who?

752
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:12,634
Why would I trust somebody who would
leave me holding my cock like this?

753
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:17,180
- I shouldn't have heard that either.
- Well, there you go.

754
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,975
There's the fucking problem.

755
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,315
John.

756
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,486
I still consider you a dear, dear friend.

757
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:15,572
So they're actually moored about
21/2 centimeters away from the fire.

758
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,242
They're finally making a little bit
of an impact with their buckets...

759
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,082
I didn't know you were in the house.

760
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:31,921
- Stopped by to pick up a few things.
- Fine.

761
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:40,472
The geeks are really making
some progress now.

762
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,143
Turn that off and come here.

763
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,354
I got something to say to your mother,
I might as well tell you.

764
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:51,107
It's almost over.

765
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,859
Now.

766
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,957
I've been thinking about things,
me living out there.

767
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:12,337
And I've decided
it's probably not a good idea.

768
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,184
What's going on?

769
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:35,610
I was just telling everybody, it's probably
better if I don't live here anymore.

770
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:42,784
Because I wanted to stay in there
with you? I won't ask.

771
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:46,704
- I just got pissed off.
- He asked to live with you?

772
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,419
No, A.J.

773
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:55,171
Come here.

774
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,175
That's not why.

775
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:06,349
- Where are you gonna go?
- Don't worry about it.

776
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,898
You should go back to counseling.

777
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,610
It's better this way.

778
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,993
He's making the right decision.
He'll get a place, you'll go and visit.

779
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,911
It'll be better. You'll see.

780
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,873
Well, you guys could still get
back together maybe?

781
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,918
- Right?
- Yeah. Sure.

782
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,629
We're still close.

783
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,443
God, is there nothing to eat
in this house?

784
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,604
Be careful.

785
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:38,399
I'll be at the Plaza.

786
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:50,513
Well, I don't drink anymore. I freeze it
now, and I eat it like a Popsicle.

787
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,226
A drink never hurt nobody.
Remember the words of Joe E. Lewis:

788
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:58,730
"You're not drunk if you can lay
on the floor without holding on."

789
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:02,567
Fucking gangster asshole!

790
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:07,613
Call the police.

791
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:10,992
They'll just turn it down again
when the police boat comes.

792
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,417
- The Coast Guard...
- He can keep paying...

793
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:24,964
...those $200 fines forever, Alan!
You've gotta let it go, Alan!

794
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,384
Give him his money! God!
