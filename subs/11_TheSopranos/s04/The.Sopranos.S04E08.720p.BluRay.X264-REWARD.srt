1
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,857
Here, I made it with
a lot of milk and sugar.

2
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,276
It's more comforting that way.

3
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,116
You sure you don't want some eggs
or an English or something?

4
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,785
You're coming back?

5
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,621
I hope so. Immigration,
they make problems.

6
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,624
Well, maybe Tony can help with that.

7
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,626
Yeah.

8
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,796
Why are you still here?
I thought you were flying out to Naples.

9
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,257
I just drop off the shirts
from Patsy's guy.

10
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,968
But you should be on your way
to see your old man.

11
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,721
Cancer is everywhere in his body.
Cancer don't respect nothing.

12
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,641
- You know, it started in his guts.
- Do you need any money?

13
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,270
I'm good.

14
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,565
Please call. And let us know.

15
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,484
I'm sorry, Tony.

16
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,154
You're gonna have to get
somebody else to drive you.

17
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,072
It's not a problem. Go.

18
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,494
You think he wears a bag?

19
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,664
- Who wears what?
- You know, a colostomy bag.

20
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,624
Furio's old man.

21
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,169
- How the fuck would I know that?
- Because my ma...

22
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,088
...maybe, maybe not, has to get one.

23
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:57,301
- Could we not talk about this?
- We could talk about any topic you like.

24
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,344
Good.

25
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,639
It's just that with Ma
squared away to go to Green Grove...

26
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,186
For fuck's sake, Paulie,
everybody's gonna get old and die.

27
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,193
- Am I driving you tomorrow too?
- No, I'll drive myself.

28
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,779
- I got nothing else to do.
- I got an important meeting, that's all.

29
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,365
It's a delicate situation.

30
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,040
We lucked out with the weather, huh?

31
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,710
So how's the life of leisure?

32
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,087
I'm playing golf, ain't I?

33
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,466
Cocksucker.

34
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,183
Seriously, it's good you're pulling back
business-wise like we agreed.

35
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,810
My nephew, I told him.
I'm gonna be speaking...

36
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,146
...through him and
only him as time passes.

37
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,397
- Good.
- Plus Sil.

38
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,233
Good.

39
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,569
I don't wanna celebrate
my daughter's first kid in prison.

40
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,744
- Hey.
- All right, this sit-down in Perth Amboy.

41
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,039
- Get a pen and paper.
- Hold on.

42
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,629
I can't find a piece of paper.

43
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,925
- Shoot.
- All right, tell Paulie to let Patsy...

44
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,094
...run the car operation
while Furio's gone.

45
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,429
Tell Patsy he's got to kick
up 10 points.

46
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,182
Seven and a half to me,
two and a half to Paulie.

47
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,768
- Got it.
- All right, you and Sil, you figure out...

48
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:34,022
...who pays the Longshore Union and
how much. I'll back you up whichever.

49
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,442
What the fuck?

50
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,570
- I'm on it.
- All right.

51
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,980
- Carmela, a simple yes or no will do.
- Please.

52
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,610
- Artie. Hi, how are things?
- Fine.

53
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,946
They ever catch those muggers?

54
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,158
Did you leave room for dessert?

55
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:31,288
We'll have one zabaglione
and four spoons. Coffees all around.

56
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,667
Bri, can I ask you
a financial-related question?

57
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,128
The last thing the guy wants to do
is talk shop.

58
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,340
Go ahead and ask him anything.
It's all he likes to talk about.

59
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,593
No big thing. I was wondering
if you had any ideas what Tony...

60
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,471
...should do with the proceeds
from the property in Newark?

61
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,473
- A HUD?
- What?

62
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,602
Kid loves Paul Newman movies.
No more grappa for you.

63
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,356
You know what I'm talking about.
Uncle Junior's lot on Frelinghuysen Ave.

64
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,525
Oh, yeah, that.
It all went into the trust.

65
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,780
T-bills. I was able to lock you in
before the rates dropped.

66
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,783
What doesn't this kid
know about money?

67
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,536
You know, I trust him 1000%.

68
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,539
Thank you.

69
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,625
We have so many more
of the newborn size.

70
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,044
I think they're cheaper.

71
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,505
Next year we can put a notice
in the bulletin...

72
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,174
...that people whose last names
begin with A to K...

73
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:28,011
...bring the newborns and L to Z
bring the bigger ones. Or vice versa.

74
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,807
Whatever we give them, the girls
at our ladies' shelter should be grateful.

75
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:36,019
I mean, nobody told them to go
and have babies without husbands.

76
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,400
I remember his charity
toward my family when Jack died.

77
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,237
I didn't know how to pay the phone bill.
Jackie did everything.

78
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,572
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

79
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,911
Well, I pay bills, but other than that
it's the same with Tony.

80
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,415
Try to find out where the money is,
how much we have...

81
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,333
...and I get such resistance.

82
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,254
I didn't know what we had
until after I buried Jackie.

83
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,673
Well, was it enough?

84
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,300
Sort of.

85
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,053
Not really.

86
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,348
How much is enough, anyway?

87
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,686
I don't know, that's my point.
Doesn't anything ever change?

88
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,021
Women are supposed
to be partners nowadays.

89
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,859
I'm not a feminist,
I'm not saying 50-50, but Jesus.

90
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,529
You know, I put up with this
goomar shit. Pardon my French.

91
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,449
Well, I made my peace with it
best I could, anyway.

92
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,784
Isn't your cousin Brian
handling your money?

93
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,746
The big things, the investments.
He's doing well too.

94
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,124
You know, I do have
to give Tony credit there.

95
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,626
He did meet me halfway
with that, God bless him.

96
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,213
- Which was a big step for him.
- Maybe you have nothing to worry about.

97
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:49,968
I don't know. Tony pulls people into
his circle, I don't know what to think.

98
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,388
Good girl.

99
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,724
Titanium?

100
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,144
Track's freezing up.
It's too hard for aluminum.

101
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,274
Well, whatever she's got on
those feet, she's a winner.

102
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,610
A little colicky?

103
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,822
Yeah. You don't feel good,
big girl? You big girl.

104
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,159
Fuck this horse-whispering shit.

105
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,167
What is this costing us?
Oh, Tony, Valentina.

106
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,127
- Valentina, Tony Soprano.
- Hi.

107
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:29,007
She works in an art gallery.
Helping me to enlarge my collection.

108
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,678
And this, my Chiquita Banana,
is Pie-O-My.

109
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,015
- She's beautiful.
- There's no stopping this horse.

110
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,269
- She's gonna go to the Breeders'.
- We'll do the geldings next, Whitey.

111
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:45,982
Hon, can you come here a sec?
I think I have something in my eye.

112
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,194
Let Dr. Ralphie have a look.

113
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,451
- I don't see anything.
- Maybe you need more light.

114
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,957
The fuck?

115
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,669
- I can't believe you did this to me.
- It was a joke, hon.

116
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,713
- Nothing funny about it.
- There is from where I'm standing.

117
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,216
Besides, it's good luck.

118
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,511
- What?
- It's good luck to step in horse shit.

119
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,888
- Ask any horse person.
- It's true.

120
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,224
Then why aren't you
walking around all day...

121
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,560
...looking for horse shit
to stomp around in?

122
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,313
- It only works if it's an accident.
- Fucking sick, all of youse.

123
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,316
Fucko, where's the hose?

124
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,160
You know, it can be risky trusting him
to have a sense of humor.

125
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,913
- Did you think it was funny?
- What I think is funny...

126
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,249
...is what an 8-year-old boy
thinks is funny.

127
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,752
- Having any fun yourself?
- What, you taking a survey?

128
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,214
- Have any interest in art?
- Sure. The right thing, I do.

129
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,551
There's an artist down in New Hope,
specializes in horses.

130
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,262
Give him a photo,
he paints a beautiful portrait.

131
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,432
- It'd look great in your office.
- Have a look at my office...

132
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,019
...before you make that call.
Think about it. If you're interested...

133
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,354
...give me a call.

134
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,899
"La Paz."

135
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,027
- What's that, Puerto Rican?
- Cubana.

136
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,362
My mother was Italian.
My father Cuban.

137
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,240
You're a dangerous combination.

138
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,540
She gorgeous or what?

139
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,375
Sweet as sugar.

140
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,466
If there is anything you need,
anything at all, press this button.

141
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,218
- Which one?
- This one that I'm showing you.

142
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:41,222
- Safety first.
- A friend, Ms. Cirillo, might stop by.

143
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,600
She said she wanted
to see you before lunch.

144
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,061
Oh, Cookie.

145
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,736
Look, just like home. They're gonna
wait on you hand and foot around here.

146
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,449
Benny, put the boxes in the closet.
Oh, and go get the TV.

147
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,910
The both of youse carry it.

148
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,247
Come on, cowgirl.
Let's go down to the chuck wagon...

149
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,833
...and see what they're rustling up.

150
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:14,673
- Paulie, did they bring my bathmat?
- For the fifth time, Ma, yes.

151
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,300
Hey, look who's here
to make you feel at home.

152
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,346
- Cookie. Are you here too?
- Not yet, but it's all paid for.

153
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:25,100
- I'm gonna move in after my surgery.
- Minn comes twice a week for lunch.

154
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,520
And in the meantime
she's one of the girls.

155
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,941
- Look how you've grown up, Paulie.
- I know. I don't understand it.

156
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,652
When I was a kid,
you two were old ladies.

157
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,155
Now I'm old
and you two are still old.

158
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,866
So how's Chucky doing, anyway?
Still teaching?

159
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,537
He's been a high school principal
for the last 10 years or so.

160
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,498
- Bergen North.
- He must give you a lot of happiness.

161
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,711
- Except for that wife of his.
- All you ever been was nice to her.

162
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,047
- I know that.
- Come on, girls. I'll take you to lunch.

163
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,218
- I gotta use the WC.
- She just went 10 minutes ago.

164
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,805
Paulie, I don't want to embarrass
your mother in the dining room...

165
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,808
...so make sure that she knows
she can't sit with me...

166
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,894
...and Minn and our other girls.

167
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,522
- What are you talking about?
- We're a set group.

168
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,525
We eat together,
we play Scrabble for money...

169
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,236
...and there's really no room
at either table.

170
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,158
Come on now, Cookie.
I know you girls can work it out.

171
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,374
Fucking amazing.

172
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,419
This is how simple it is
to change inputs.

173
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,550
- Listen to that imaging in stereo mode.
- It's like Clapton's there at your house.

174
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,609
Tony.

175
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,361
Great, huh?

176
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,072
We can all watch movies
as a family now.

177
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,074
And listen to that.

178
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,118
I think it's great.

179
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,622
I'm going food shopping.
Maybe I'll get In the Bedroom.

180
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,209
- What time you want me to wake you?
- The movie.

181
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,629
Oh, yeah.

182
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,964
- Good.
- Have fun.

183
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,418
- Hello?
- Mr. Bolton, please?

184
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,921
- Chuck?
- Richard.

185
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,091
- Yeah, can you talk?
- Yeah, I'm on a hotel phone.

186
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,844
So how are you? What's going on?

187
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,764
I found him, Chuck.
I found the man who killed Helen.

188
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,767
- What?
- It was me they were after.

189
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,436
Who? Who are they?

190
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,857
Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.

191
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,943
Lentz was supervising
the protocol for RDU-90.

192
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,322
He knew I found out it was causing
liver damage. It was Lentz.

193
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,993
Richard, Lentz is dead.

194
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,954
What? How?

195
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,499
He died in a car accident last summer.

196
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,210
- Richard?
- Yeah.

197
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,963
Can you prove this about the drug?

198
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,631
Yeah, I think so.

199
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,969
I need your help, Chuck.
Call Bones at the hospital...

200
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,388
...tell him to give me
whatever help I need.

201
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,682
Beautiful-looking animal.

202
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,227
Great definition, carriage.

203
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,314
I'd love to paint her.

204
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,482
Good, good.

205
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,068
But what about this deadbeat?

206
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,237
There's no problem
cropping you both out.

207
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,240
We could set her in front
of the rail at the track...

208
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,202
...or if you'd prefer something more
pastoral, we can place her in a meadow.

209
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,915
I don't know about that, but can you
leave me in there and crop him out?

210
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,793
Easy. And frankly, it would be better.
Composition-wise.

211
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,796
Go for the pastoral,
much more dignified.

212
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,050
- And it comes framed?
- Exactly as you see that one.

213
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,595
Six thousand five hundred.

214
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,224
All right, you got a deal.

215
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,355
- To Pie-O-Mine.
- My.

216
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,943
- Your what?
- No, no, no, the name. It's "Pie-O-My."

217
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,908
I'll give you the whole thing now.

218
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,289
There.

219
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,210
I'd better get your receipt.
I'll just be a minute.

220
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,300
Let's not forget to drink
to the beautiful señorita...

221
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,552
...whose idea this was
in the first place.

222
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,305
I bet you say that to all the girls.

223
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,642
There's not that many. To tell
the truth, the ones that there are...

224
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,227
...they don't got many ideas.

225
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,398
We should probably start
heading back soon.

226
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,483
Yeah.

227
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,738
- On the way we could stop and eat.
- Yeah, we could definitely stop.

228
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,620
- Like that.
- Oh, yeah, so nice.

229
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,665
- Just like that.
- Yeah, that's so good.

230
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,444
Come on, let me up.

231
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,195
Let me up.

232
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,517
You can see cows from in there.

233
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,229
Sit down and eat
before it gets any colder.

234
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:59,368
- Looks good, doesn't it?
- Mine needed salt.

235
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,416
Jesus-fucking-Christ, these
fucking hicks can't even get this right.

236
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,090
You did this?

237
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,258
Oh, that's very mature.

238
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,011
It's not funny.

239
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,263
I thought you had an
8-year-old sense of humor.

240
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,766
Come here and give me a kiss.

241
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,353
I'm eating.

242
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,690
Not anymore, you're not.

243
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,782
What if I promise to be good?

244
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,909
How good?

245
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,121
Good.

246
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,385
Shit, I lost a nail.

247
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,894
We will not be mentioning
anything about any of this to Ralph.

248
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,440
I'll take it. Can you send it
to this person here?

249
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,068
Sure. You want to include
a card with this?

250
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,820
Yeah.

251
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,918
Let me have another one.

252
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,806
Round and round she goes.
Where she stops, nobody knows.

253
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,475
Place your bets. Be a winner.

254
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,316
- I'll take another card.
- Are you sure, dear?

255
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,198
For the love of God, Nucci,
how could you hit on 18?

256
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,868
Give me another one.

257
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,624
That should've been my card.
I could've had 21.

258
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,127
I was hoping for a three.

259
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,714
I'm not sure you understand
the fine points.

260
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,884
Maybe you ought to play roulette.
It's right over there.

261
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,560
Round and round she goes, where
she stops, nobody knows. Place your...

262
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,932
Goddamn it, Tony!

263
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,903
You did that to me
on our honeymoon.

264
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,073
I didn't like it and you promised
you'd never do it again.

265
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,118
- It's just cold water.
- Well, it's really unpleasant.

266
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,162
- Do you remember promising me?
- You could do it back to me.

267
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,040
- I don't wanna do it back to you.
- Why not? It's fun.

268
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,668
- Do you remember promising me?
- Yeah, so what?

269
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,964
So? This is one promise
I would like you to keep.

270
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,970
Whatever.

271
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,494
- This can't be Paulie.
- Chucky?

272
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,622
Come here, you pizza-face
son of a son of a gun, you.

273
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,251
Oh, God. Mr. Van Kowenberg,
what'd we say about those shoes?

274
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,005
The laces are in my locker.
I was gonna get them after study hall.

275
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,840
Get them now.

276
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,846
Come on, Paulie.

277
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,519
Hard to believe it's been so long.

278
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,022
This is for you.

279
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,109
That's a nice gesture, Paul.

280
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,321
- I really can't.
- Go on, I got lots of them.

281
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,531
You can't insult me.

282
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,038
- No more glasses.
- I had the LASIK.

283
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,541
- And your face cleared up pretty good.
- Cleared up in 10th grade.

284
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:01,379
See, there you go. Ninth was my last.

285
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,305
So did your mom tell you
I saw her over at Green Grove?

286
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,017
- She sees quite a bit of your mother.
- Well, that's just it, Chucky.

287
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,480
They're both residents,
but there seems to be an exclusion.

288
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,065
I don't blame your mother.

289
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,569
I blame that Minnie Matrone.
She's a malignant cunt.

290
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,489
Excuse me for saying so.

291
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,409
She eggs your mother on
and she don't even live there.

292
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,204
- I'm not sure I understand.
- I'm just asking you to talk to your ma.

293
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,915
See if she can include my ma
in more with the group.

294
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:43,337
It won't do much good.
Now, you know how these old gals are.

295
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,090
All I'm trying to do
is pay my ma back...

296
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,926
...for when I was a kid
and got into so much trouble.

297
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,929
She went to bat for me
how many times? With the nuns.

298
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,765
With the store owners
up and down 13th Street.

299
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,894
And let's face it, Chucky,
with the cops.

300
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,064
For all the bad I did...

301
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,109
Hell, I'm still capable
if I don't watch myself.

302
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,612
But with all of that
she always had my back.

303
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,536
I'll talk to my ma, see what
she says, but like I said...

304
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:20,124
- Whatever you can do.
- All right. Take care, all right?

305
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,163
Ale was always served
in pints and quarts...

306
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:04,502
...so "Mind your P's and Q's" means
watch your alcohol consumption.

307
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,337
I'll be right back.

308
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,965
Holy cow. So there's an origin
for everything?

309
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,470
- What's up?
- A little business.

310
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,349
- Like what?
- Why, you wanna hear this?

311
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,644
Well, we decided to give
a bigger percentage...

312
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,812
...to the union guys
than the customs guys.

313
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,483
You're shitting me, right?
That's what you guys came up with?

314
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,361
- Everybody seemed pleased.
- Goddamn it, I'm gonna have...

315
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,863
...to go there and do
a go-see with everybody...

316
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:37,201
...from the harbor master on down.
Which is what I was trying to avoid.

317
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,537
You want it renegotiated,
that's what we'll do.

318
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,288
Don't make me go to Perth Amboy.

319
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,543
I'm trying to free myself up
to do a little global thinking.

320
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,003
Right.

321
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,724
- So, girls, what's it gonna be?
- I'll have what I always have.

322
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,937
Chicken Mario?
Fifteen years of Chicken Mario.

323
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,939
Can't you try the veal chop for once?

324
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,525
Why are you giving me
a hard time? I like chicken.

325
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,361
- Hello, beautiful people.
- Oh, look who it is.

326
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,904
- Hey, Ton.
- Hi, how are you?

327
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,157
- Remember Valentina?
- Yeah, nice to see you again.

328
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,078
- Yeah, same here.
- You pulled that horse shit stunt?

329
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,666
We're gonna have some steaks.

330
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,752
- I'll have a steak.
- You don't need a steak.

331
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,839
- I know I don't need a steak.
- Do me a favor...

332
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,675
...don't fuck with the salt shaker.

333
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,263
- You like the sole?
- Scampi for me.

334
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,973
Chrissy.

335
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,684
Oh, I don't know, give me...

336
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,186
Come on, you're getting
anorexic over there.

337
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,440
I'm gonna go...
I gotta make a call. Okay?

338
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,442
You're wasting away, you know.

339
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,736
Come on, what are you gonna do?

340
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,573
Here.

341
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,620
- No, no, no, you keep it.
- I don't want your consolation prize.

342
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,788
Bet you have a standing order
at the store.

343
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,958
- I gotta be getting back to my table.
- What, to the blond?

344
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,962
Does she fuck you better than me?
Suck your dick better than me?

345
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,305
Come on.

346
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,773
Really, Tony, just tell me.
How come I can't see you again?

347
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,484
- You fuck Ralph.
- You got morals all of a sudden?

348
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,235
No morals, but I do got rules.

349
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,822
Some dago macho bullshit about,
"Don't fuck your friend's girlfriend"?

350
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,991
Yeah, that.

351
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,161
- But not just that.
- Then what?

352
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,669
Look, that day in the countryside,
that was...

353
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,631
- It was great.
- Did I do something wrong? I'll fix it.

354
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,134
No, you can't fix the shit
I'm talking about.

355
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,263
I just don't wanna be
where Ralph has been.

356
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,183
- You prick.
- A one-time thing is one thing...

357
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,646
...but to get into a relationship?
I gotta get back to my dinner.

358
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,358
You don't know anything.
Let me tell you what's really going on.

359
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:19,446
He doesn't fuck me. I swear to God,
he's some kind of freak or something.

360
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,283
- You two don't have sex?
- No. Well...

361
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,495
- Sort of, yeah, but not...
- All right, have a nice life.

362
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,124
Go ahead. Go ahead,
you go back first, I'll wait a minute.

363
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,626
We shouldn't go back together.

364
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,094
- Everything come out all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

365
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,638
How you doing?

366
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,183
- You want red, right?
- Right.

367
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,938
- Yeah.
- Tony. It's me, Valentina.

368
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,775
- You got no reason to be calling me.
- I have to tell you everything.

369
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,986
I mean, I didn't want to tell you
before because it's just so...

370
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,113
...embarrassing.
Where are you?

371
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,324
- I'm at Ralph's.
- Oh, Christ.

372
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,118
No, no, it's okay.

373
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,955
He left. Tony...

374
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,917
...Ralph does not have sex
like other people. Regular people.

375
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,170
It's all some kind of kinky shit.
Believe me, I am not hung up.

376
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,758
I've done a lot. I've done girls,
I've done threesomes and I've done...

377
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,511
- With him?
- No, Tony, please just listen.

378
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,180
Ralph is loco. For real, okay?

379
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,267
He just makes me do stuff,
not really even sexual.

380
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,812
Last night I just wanted him to fuck
me so I could get back at you...

381
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,274
...but all he wanted me to do
was drip candle wax on his balls.

382
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,818
Then he went into the bathroom
and jerked off.

383
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,237
Now, I don't call that having
sex with someone.

384
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,740
- Oh, Jesus H. Christ...
- Last week, I swear to God...

385
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,660
...he told me to rub his dick raw
with a cheese grater.

386
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,372
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I wouldn't do it. I told him to fuck off.

387
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,712
- My accountant is here.
- Will you call me?

388
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,714
I gotta go.

389
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,552
Mozzarella.

390
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:35,058
Let me ask you a question.
You think Ralph's a little...

391
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,061
...weird about women?
I don't know, Ton.

392
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,900
I mean, he beat one to death
just for...

393
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,570
I forget. Why was it again?

394
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,991
- Maybe you're feeling guilty.
- I don't see that.

395
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,245
- Why would I?
- Because he's a friend of yours...

396
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,290
...and you're cuckolding him.

397
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,501
Cuckolding is when a man
has an affair with another's wife.

398
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,795
She's not his wife anyway.
She's his goomar.

399
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:08,050
- And therefore has no status whatever.
- Goomars have status.

400
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,553
I mean, it's not like in the old days
when a man had a wife...

401
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,889
...and then sort of a second wife.

402
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,767
Used to be the men would
take out their wives on Fridays...

403
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,355
...and their goomars on Saturdays.
Or maybe it's the other way around.

404
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,943
Anyway, when I came up
it wasn't so formal.

405
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,737
A business associate of mine's
got two full families.

406
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,865
One up here, one down in Sea Girt.

407
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,952
And the second wife busts his balls
identical to the first.

408
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,372
Sounds like a complicated
arrangement.

409
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,792
- I'm afraid our time is up.
- Just give me another minute.

410
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,378
- I have a patient waiting.
- Well, let them wait.

411
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,255
You make me wait
out there all the time.

412
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,384
Just wanna ask you
if it's possible for a man...

413
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:54,096
...to go out with a woman
without really doing anything with them.

414
00:32:54,305 --> 00:33:00,102
- You'll have to be more specific.
- He likes them to hurt him. And that's it.

415
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,814
And then he goes and he...

416
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,484
...takes care of himself. His own needs.

417
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,154
- He sounds like a textbook masochist.
- Like S & M.

418
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,074
The "M" part, yes.

419
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,452
I thought all that stuff was just,
like, a run-up to the act.

420
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:22,624
That's the case for many people.
But not for people with paraphilias.

421
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,836
For them, receiving pain,
being humiliated...

422
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:30,340
...becomes in and of itself
the sexual release.

423
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:35,137
Like many other things,
we believe it's rooted in childhood.

424
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,265
- We can continue this next week.
- Just one more second.

425
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,268
I received regular beatings
when I was a kid...

426
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,353
...but I'm not looking
for some woman...

427
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,106
...to hook up jumper cables
to my private parts.

428
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,483
It's not a simple one-to-one.

429
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:52,279
More than likely he had
a controlling and punishing mother.

430
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,532
She loved him, but showed
it only in connection...

431
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,786
...with some sort of violent
or abusive act.

432
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:04,166
Is everything about everybody
really about their mothers?

433
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,671
All right, back to the other thing.

434
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,467
If a guy like that is going
out with a woman...

435
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,179
...he could technically not have penisary
contact with her vulva.

436
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,056
It sounds like you're asking me...

437
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:23,351
...for personal information
I really can't give you.

438
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,369
Good morning, Pickwick Framing.

439
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,207
Hello?

440
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,250
Hello?

441
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,219
It's heartbreaking
to hear those women talk...

442
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,097
...about what they were
and what they are going through.

443
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:05,060
The second woman, Joan,
her case is really not very unusual.

444
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,104
Her husband was the financial planner.

445
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,941
She really did not have much
involvement in the finances at the home.

446
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,528
- What are your thoughts?
- Women tend to have the feeling...

447
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:18,115
...that they're not confident.
Men tend to be overconfident, actually...

448
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,409
...in the financial area.
Women have to take responsibility...

449
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,538
...and have to accept the fact
that something like this...

450
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,715
You have to have a plan
if your husband doesn't come home...

451
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,425
...and you have
to do the finances.

452
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:20,010
You gotta get up, Ma.
You can't lie there day and night.

453
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,846
I wanna go home.

454
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,642
There is no more home, Ma.
We sold it. You know that.

455
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,022
They keep making me eat all alone.
That's that Cookie and Minn.

456
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,191
I tried to be so nice.

457
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,445
I bought Cookie a card
from the gift shop downstairs.

458
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,365
I cared enough and I sent the very best.

459
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,952
Don't you worry, Ma.
I'm gonna talk to the social director.

460
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,371
She's the one
to straighten this all out.

461
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,208
But in the meantime,
maybe you can make new friends.

462
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,211
But you gotta get up out of bed.
At least sit up.

463
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,359
You can't let it get to you.

464
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,736
My brother lived a full life,

465
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,155
he had lots of women.

466
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,075
That's the best you can hope for.

467
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,161
You gonna stay around awhile?

468
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,874
Since I left for America...

469
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,043
all I thought about...

470
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,544
was coming back here.

471
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,673
When I saw Naples from the airplane...

472
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,509
I got a hard on.

473
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,428
What do you expect? It's home.

474
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,348
I don't know, anymore.

475
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,768
Even the San Gennaro Cathedral.

476
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,062
I went to pray for my father.

477
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,232
There were hamburger wrappers
everywhere...

478
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,902
I don't think it's litter that's got you
turned around.

479
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,656
There's a woman.

480
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,201
So... go home to her.

481
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,412
You did the duties of a son.

482
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,623
She's the Don's wife.

483
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,543
Soprano?

484
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,919
He doesn't know.

485
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,504
You fucking her?

486
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,714
No.

487
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,258
I'm not even sure that she knows.

488
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,636
I never even kissed her.

489
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,972
Good, so you stay away.

490
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,141
No harm done.

491
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,976
I don't know if I can.

492
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,144
I love her.

493
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,062
You fucking crazy?

494
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,024
All the shit I pulled in my life,

495
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,651
I never fucked the boss's wife.

496
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,987
You know why? You know why?

497
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,072
Stop the rhetorical questions.

498
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,492
Because I know he would kill me
if he found out.

499
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,454
And they always find out everything,
these bosses.

500
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,002
Hello...

501
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,253
Hold on.

502
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,880
I have to take this.
My lawyer.

503
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,133
The only way you could have her

504
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,926
is if you killed the man.

505
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,595
I know this.

506
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,389
Eh, so? Don't be an idiot.

507
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,698
In my opinion, this is
one of the closest things...

508
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,284
...we're gonna find in Naples
to what you should open.

509
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:36,831
It's an all-day snack shop,
pizzeria, friggitoria and rosticceria.

510
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,209
Roast shop, fry shop, pizza shop.

511
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,045
Here are four examples...

512
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,132
...of the classic Neapolitan pride.

513
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,772
Dipped in a light batter,
fried till very, very crisp.

514
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,316
We've got those zucchini flowers.
Recognize those?

515
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,444
We're bringing her back
to the track in two weeks.

516
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,364
Lois says she's ready to race.

517
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,617
- Thanks.
- Thanks, hon.

518
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,370
I like my drink with extra olives.

519
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,832
You should know how
your regular customers like their drinks.

520
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,043
My regular customers
are the ones who pay.

521
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,879
I'll get you your olives.

522
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,177
- What do you have to give her shit for?
- She likes it. It's banter.

523
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,763
I don't think she likes it. Or you.

524
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:38,810
I don't give a flying fuck, my brother,
what any little slit thinks of me.

525
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,690
Does that include?

526
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,233
- What's her name?
- Who?

527
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,446
- You brought her to the stables.
- Oh, Valentina.

528
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,782
Her especially.
And her I'm crazy about.

529
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,368
I'm telling you,
this broad knows things.

530
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,956
I've never been fucked so long
or so good.

531
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,792
I may have to marry her.

532
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,259
- These enough?
- You know, no reason to be snotty.

533
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,387
My dear departed mother
used to say:

534
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:19,434
"You catch more flies with honey
than you can with vinegar."

535
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:26,191
Well, mine always told me not to let
myself be talked down to by losers.

536
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:30,403
She said you could tell everything about
a man by the way he treats women.

537
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,706
- You ever think about your mother?
- She's dead.

538
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,042
You two didn't get along
very well, right?

539
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,836
She had her demanding ways.

540
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,382
- When you were a kid did she ever...?
- No, I gotta go.

541
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,345
The mambo queen awaits.

542
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,101
I'm sorry your mom's having
a difficult adjustment period. Sit.

543
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,064
It's not her. It's the rest of them.
They single her out.

544
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:10,902
Sometimes I think this place
is like high school with wheelchairs.

545
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,239
Tell your mother to be patient.
Things will settle down.

546
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,200
All right, I'll talk to her again...

547
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,453
...but what the hell are you gonna
do for us? What we pay here.

548
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,789
I'm speaking from years of experience.

549
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,167
Your mother's going to have
to learn to accept responsibility...

550
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,212
...for her own behavior.
Like what?

551
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,297
Go ahead.

552
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,134
For one thing, she cries a lot.

553
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,220
She's always in tears.

554
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:41,349
At Mass, in the exercise room,
at music appreciation.

555
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,936
- She's got a big heart.
- Let me finish.

556
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,064
She doesn't always put her teeth in.

557
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,692
The girls don't like that.

558
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,904
- This is not good.
- Right. Also, she's a tattletale.

559
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,615
She tells on other girls
for the slightest infraction.

560
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,452
She's just not very adept
at making friends.

561
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,871
She's gonna have to make
more of an effort.

562
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,000
You might want
to talk to her about this.

563
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,315
- Hello?
- Hey, did Conny Contino...

564
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,025
...get those washing machines?

565
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,360
I don't understand.
You want to know this?

566
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,613
You go back on everything
Sil and me settle.

567
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,239
Oh, I don't got a right to be
concerned?

568
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,283
Hold on. Hold on.

569
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,873
- Go.
- Long time no see.

570
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,543
- Is this you?
- I am me.

571
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,962
- Yeah, well, I've been busy.
- I forgive you.

572
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,215
When can I see you?
I've got something to tell you.

573
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,885
- I told you the situation.
- Come on, Tony.

574
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,597
Just for a coffee or a drink
or something.

575
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:07,685
All right. You know the Coach House
on Route 21 in Passaic?

576
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,647
- No, but I can find it.
- Can you be there by noon?

577
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:15,151
- Nothing could keep me away.
- All right, I'll see you there.

578
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,575
All right, I want to see you
and Sil this afternoon.

579
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,244
Two o'clock, at the other place.

580
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,568
So sorry I'm late, I had to make up
this whole thing at work.

581
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,404
- All right.
- What can I get for you?

582
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,864
Evian or whatever.

583
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:08,246
So I'm here. What's this big thing
you have to tell me?

584
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,291
I broke up with Ralph.

585
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,920
- When?
- Last night. I just couldn't take it.

586
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:19,465
- He brought out this leather mask...
- All right, all right, all right.

587
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,347
This means we can be together.

588
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:36,232
Look, Valentina, I'm a married man.
I'm a happily married man with two kids.

589
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,527
I just wanna see you sometimes.
Couple nights a week.

590
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:44,824
I'm not gonna say I love you. I say that
too soon and I'm trying to work on that.

591
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,119
- But I really like you.
- I like you too, honey...

592
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,246
...but it's not gonna happen.

593
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,915
Why? Why not?

594
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,918
For one thing, I already took his horse.

595
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:18,441
- Nine thousand nine hundred.
- Interestingly, at $10,000...

596
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,277
...we're required to notify
the IRS of the transaction.

597
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,822
Oh, really?
I want it in something safe.

598
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,868
Something old economy,
maybe treasuries.

599
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,292
Don't you knock?

600
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,338
Listen, Jan, can we
shut this off a minute?

601
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,049
- I got something I gotta ask you.
- Sure.

602
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,850
It's a little awkward.

603
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,144
It's about Ralph.

604
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,064
- That scumbag?
- Yeah, well...

605
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,942
...I'm trying to find out
about his sex life.

606
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,610
And...

607
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:48,114
...who would know better?
He would. Ask him.

608
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,116
I can't.

609
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,535
I can only ask you.

610
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,706
I mean, is he weird about sex?

611
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:01,669
- Why are you interested in this?
- I got my reasons. Managerial.

612
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:05,798
You know, like the Army's got policies
about this shit on account of combat.

613
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,011
I have to tell you, Tony, I'm finding
this entire conversation insulting.

614
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:15,808
- Here we go.
- You're asking me to betray confidences.

615
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:21,522
I mean, no matter what either
one of us think of the guy...

616
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,453
Three thousand dollars.

617
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:41,000
- How'd you come up with that figure?
- It's a number I thought you'd say yes to.

618
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,793
You thought right.

619
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,754
So, what have you heard?

620
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,090
You pay me $3000,
I'll answer your questions.

621
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,551
He bottoms from the top.

622
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,428
I don't know what that means.

623
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:57,016
It means he has to control things,
but he pretends he doesn't.

624
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:01,103
Like, he'd make me fuck him
with a strap-on and call him my bitch.

625
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,356
- Shit like that.
- What about plain fucking?

626
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,067
I'm telling you,
he can't get hard that way.

627
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,779
And if he could, I don't think
that he'd want to.

628
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,045
Couldn't believe it when you called.

629
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,215
I was so happy.

630
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,302
I'm feeling pretty happy myself.

631
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:38,015
Why the big change of heart?

632
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,729
Well, I was never hesitating
because of you.

633
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:47,066
I just had to get my head
into a place...

634
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:51,696
...where I felt that I could
really commit, you know.

635
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:55,366
To lavish all the care on you
that you should have.

636
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:33,696
I don't see why I have to do
anything I don't want to.

637
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:39,076
Now, this is Green Grove.
Here the senior citizen is king and queen.

638
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,788
I know, but they told Charles
that this was just a warning.

639
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,916
These people don't fool around.

640
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:49,879
- You're afraid of them.
- Of course he is. And so am I.

641
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,798
This is a stupid thing
for your son to get hurt over.

642
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:58,554
I didn't live for 84 years to have
to be nice to somebody I don't like.

643
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,640
Haven't I earned that right?

644
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,437
Ma, I'm gonna have to say this. If you
can't get into the spirit of this thing...

645
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,982
...then we're gonna have to let
you live in a different home.

646
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:16,614
The Salvation Army has one in Irvington
that's supposed to be perfectly fine.

647
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,454
Coffee, Ton?

648
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,208
Got any decaf?

649
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,335
Decaf?

650
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,673
- No, forget it. Regular's fine.
- Well, I can make decaf.

651
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,884
Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks.

652
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,364
Is something wrong, Tony?

653
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:46,203
No. Why?

654
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,005
You out in the backyard
the last couple of days?

655
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,550
Me? It's freezing out there.

656
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,595
You sure?

657
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,847
- The pool guy come around?
- Why would he?

00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,391
Check up on stuff? Something?

659
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,895
All right, I'm going upstairs.

660
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,361
It'll only take a minute.

661
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:34,793
You sure, Tony, there's not something
you wanna talk about?

662
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,630
No.

663
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,633
Like what?
