1
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,351
When I look at the great pyramid...

2
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,396
...the marvel there for me
is not the stonework...

3
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:51,151
...as much as the level
of organization...

4
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,196
...that these ancient Egyptians had...

5
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,075
...getting this society
to pull together in such a way...

6
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:04,414
...that they not only had blocks
of stone, but bread on the table.

7
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,460
Stone-setters were all
fairly accomplished.

8
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,462
Very good craftsmen.

9
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,676
It shouldn't have come
as a surprise...

10
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:20,597
...they have such a long history
of thousands of years doing this.

11
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,392
Hello?

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,855
Meet me in 20 minutes at the
old Webendorfer factory parking lot.

13
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,276
Well, the real gigantic pyramids
were built...

14
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,530
...within the space of about three,
maybe four generations.

15
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,159
Jesus Christ.

16
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,749
It's true.
They're gonna start a draft.

17
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,419
There's no fucking way
I'm going in the Army.

18
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,089
Yeah, because his old man will put
a horse's head in some senator's bed.

19
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,885
- Insert foot in mouth, Jason.
- No big.

20
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,013
Ever get paranoid they'll shoot up
your house like in Godfather II?

21
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,142
- Probably got armed guards at night.
- That shit doesn't happen anymore.

22
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,686
You have attack dogs on the property?

23
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,605
No.

24
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,817
I mean, we did,
but she got hit by a car.

25
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,361
Jason said your old man's
mostly legit now anyway.

26
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,447
Yeah? Like what?

27
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,490
He's in waste management.

28
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,744
- Garbage?
- Recycling.

29
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,330
What about drugs and prostitution
and shit?

30
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,998
No.

31
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,918
- His dad owns a strip club though.
- Let's go.

32
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,545
- We'd get carded.
- We can just stop by.

33
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,924
Watch the strippers coming
in and out, right?

34
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,315
Okay.

35
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,157
What's going on?

36
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,578
Truckload the other night,
from Port Elizabeth?

37
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,164
Give the washing machines
to Frank Contino.

38
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,291
You got it.

39
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,461
Vacuum cleaners too?

40
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,632
No, Patsy's got a buyer for those.

41
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,260
You been drinking?

42
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,222
Me and Ade had some wine
at the house.

43
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,809
Been wanting to talk to you.

44
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,770
Yeah, been wanting to talk
to you too.

45
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,815
I'll go first.

46
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,443
I gotta make it my number one priority
to limit my exposure...

47
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,947
...to potentially damaging conversations
and wiretaps, shit like that.

48
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,574
Sure. A guy in your position.

49
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,704
So...

50
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,415
...over the next couple of years,
more and more...

51
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,293
...I'm gonna be giving my orders
through you.

52
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,170
And then finally, only through you.

53
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,508
What about Sil?
You got that with him. And Paulie.

54
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,053
Those other guys, Sil, Paulie...

55
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,640
...one thing they're not...

56
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,893
...they're not my blood.

57
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,939
You hear what I'm saying to you?
It's a matter of trust.

58
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,568
- It's very wise.
- Sil's a good consigliere.

59
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:24,448
He's gonna continue as such. But
he's no fucking spring chicken either.

60
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,617
But it's no reason to be giving him
a fucking attitude.

61
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,953
No. Of course not.

62
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,123
Now, there's gonna be
a period of transition.

63
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,500
Jesus Christ, T.

64
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,670
You're gonna take this family
into the 21 st century.

65
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,716
We're already
in the 21 st century though, T.

66
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,095
Whatever you say, T.
I'd follow you into the gates of hell.

67
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,930
That's what I was gonna say to you.

68
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,642
What you did for me,
that fuck who killed my father...

69
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,228
...I'll never forget that.

70
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,023
I only hope I'm worthy.

71
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:02,694
- Why wouldn't you be worthy?
- I'm just saying.

72
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,123
Yeah. This looks familiar.

73
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,626
The pizza parlor...
Pull over, Matt.

74
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,257
- This is it?
- It's closed.

75
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:28,762
Oh, shit. This place.
This is the pork store.

76
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,263
It's a gay strip club?

77
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,850
Dude, obviously it's not a strip club.
It's a fucking butcher shop.

78
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,852
I think I got it all messed up.

79
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,271
This is where my dad's office is.

80
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,857
Okay. It's a front.

81
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,319
- Like Genco Olive Oil.
- Yeah. It's like Genco.

82
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,029
It looks really clandestine.

83
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:50,242
- So where is the strip club, A.J?
- Maybe Route 17 or Route 4.

84
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,955
- Lodi or something.
- This is stupid, let's go.

85
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,003
I heard a car.
Your son's out past curfew again.

86
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,841
- Call his cell?
- Oh, my goodness.

87
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,636
I didn't know anybody else was here.

88
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,640
I just use the men's room.

89
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,161
Sometimes I worry about Furio.

90
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,165
Doesn't he seem lonely?

91
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,626
I was telling Jessica
about him this morning...

92
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,712
...the hygienist
in Dr. Mascera's office.

93
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,007
I know I shouldn't gossip, but...

94
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,469
...I think she was having an affair
with Dr. Mascera.

95
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,680
Here she is.

96
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,517
- Their office Christmas card.
- There's his hand on her ass.

97
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,480
Stop it. Anyway,
I think she's ready for somebody nice.

98
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,983
And she seemed very receptive
when I described Furio to her.

99
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,068
She's not his type.

100
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,988
What's his type?

101
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,699
Don't worry about him.

102
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,160
- Stay out of it.
- One date won't hurt.

103
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,331
Why do you wanna bother her,
my little Hello Dolly.

104
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,419
Speaking of gossip.

105
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,839
That noise in the Mercedes...

106
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,549
Yeah?

107
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,219
Brought it over to Globe Motors
to have it looked at.

108
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,764
And I was talking to Jerry
in the service department.

109
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,226
Now, remember that nice saleslady?

110
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,395
I don't think so.

111
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,941
Gloria Trillo, she gave me
a ride home that day.

112
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,318
You know what Jerry told me
about her?

113
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,570
She died.

114
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,574
She what?

115
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,411
She committed suicide.
Isn't that awful?

116
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,833
Mr. Empathy over there.

117
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:08,547
She hung herself from a chandelier.

118
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,968
Good evening. Vesuvio.

119
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,304
I'm sorry, we are not taking
any more reservations.

120
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,806
The kitchen is closing.

121
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,518
Fifty thousand dollars.
That's a lot of scarole.

122
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,354
- Did you try the bank?
- Scarole?

123
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:29,025
- Escarole? Money?
- Oh, escarole, money, good.

124
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:33,822
No, the bank, red tape.
I have only until the end of the week.

125
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,618
I told my brother you know people
who lend money.

126
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,204
Little pitchers have big ears, huh?

127
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,417
I need it for 10 days
and then, pas de problème.

128
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,253
- Do you mind if I ask what for?
- Business in France.

129
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,797
A group is purchasing
an Armagnac property.

130
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:55,760
I got the... The pre...
The dossier right here.

131
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,056
Jesus.

132
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:05,437
Domaine Vézelay. After Darroze,
one of the oldest, largest producers...

133
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,898
...of Bas Armagnac, which is on fire
right now in France and Europe.

134
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,443
It's the next vodka.

135
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,654
This is a $10 million worldwide launch.

136
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,743
I got 100,000 into it, and I need 50 more
to secure North American distribution.

137
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,036
Armagnac.

138
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,039
I'll bring you a bottle of Vézelay,
unbelievable.

139
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,082
And with cigars,
which are now very hot.

140
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,294
You only need the money for 10 days.
How's that?

141
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,381
Because when the deal is done,
the advertising money is released to me.

142
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:37,927
You understand, these people
that I might know, they don't know you.

143
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:43,099
So I wouldn't be just vouching for you.
I, in essence, would be the lender.

144
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,185
And it's gonna cost you.

145
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,605
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.

146
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,441
Merde, Artie.

147
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,527
- Five.
- Seven and a half.

148
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,032
Okay.

149
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,120
Charmaine, I don't think you know
Elodi's brother, Jean-Philippe.

150
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,582
Nice to meet you.
But, Elodi, please...

151
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,502
...can you clear off table four?

152
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,505
Thank you.

153
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,638
- Charmaine? She's French?
- Not remotely.

154
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,605
She's a hostess, not a busboy.

155
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,566
What was... about, Arthur, huh?

156
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,027
It's a venture-capital thing
with Jean-Philippe.

157
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,863
I'm sure it wouldn't pass your
Wharton School standards.

158
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,032
You wanna bring in some money...

159
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,035
...why don't you get your friend
Anthony to pay his tab?

160
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,204
It's close to $6000, Arthur.

161
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,374
I could have an empire
like Bobby Flay.

162
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,377
And it still wouldn't
be good enough for you.

163
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,254
Okay, I'll make you a deal, Artie.

164
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,381
We'll start working on your empire...

165
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,675
...right after we pay the $10,000...

166
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,303
...of orthodonture
Melissa's gonna need this year.

167
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,005
They're on allocation
from the factory.

168
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,507
I don't know when we're
going to get any more in.

169
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,844
But I'm free if you wanna take it
for a spin.

170
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,391
Actually, I was working with one
of your other salespeople last year.

171
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,270
She was really very helpful.
I ought to give her the business.

172
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,566
- Gloria Trillo.
- Oh, well, she's no longer with us.

173
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,860
Do you know where she went?

174
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,904
Actually, she died.

175
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,282
What happened?

176
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,618
Well...

177
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,703
...she committed suicide.

178
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,123
Why?

179
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:18,755
I mean, she was salesperson
of the year or something.

180
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,341
I didn't know her that well...

181
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,761
...but I got the impression
she wasn't very lucky with men.

182
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,138
That sort of thing.

183
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,266
- When was this?
- Month ago, maybe two.

184
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,227
What'd she say?

185
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:38,358
I mean, you know, in the papers,
you read they always leave a note.

186
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,485
She did leave a note on her desk.

187
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,862
The police took it.

188
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:47,158
Later they told us it was just
copy for a classified ad.

189
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,993
She was selling her wolf stole.

190
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,997
Anyway, let me give you my card.

191
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,887
Chef Osso Bucco.

192
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,349
This is a rare pleasure.

193
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,768
Or is it medium-well?

194
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,979
A little restaurant humor.

195
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,691
So, you know, if you brought
along a pair of dirty chef whites...

196
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,944
...my friend here will suck
out the stains for you.

197
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,948
Sit.

198
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,669
Okay. In a nutshell,
I'd like to borrow a little money.

199
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,129
How little?

200
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,548
Fifty thousand,
just for a couple of weeks.

201
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,343
- Upgrading the kitchen in the restaurant.
- Get the fuck out of here!

202
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:53,057
What you take out of that bar, you must
be sitting on money like King Cresus.

203
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,643
Hey, I wish.

204
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,855
I'm not gonna be able to lend money
for less than two points.

205
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,983
- It's not a problem.
- Just out of curiosity...

206
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,320
...what's gonna happen in two weeks?

207
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,657
The insurance check's gonna come.

208
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,499
I hate to do it, Artie...

209
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,711
...but I think I'm gonna pass. Sorry.

210
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,632
- Why not?
- Because if you don't pay me back...

211
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,343
...I ain't gonna be able to hurt you.

212
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,018
So how you doing?

213
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,814
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

214
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,108
How about you?

215
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,903
Fine, thank you.

216
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,863
Really?

217
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,450
Business okay?
Everybody hunky-dory?

218
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,037
Well, you know, onward and upward.

219
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,749
How's Gloria Trillo?
She still hanging around?

220
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,005
- It's a terrible tragedy.
- So you fucking knew.

221
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,717
You fucking lied!
You let me fucking sit there!

222
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,886
Please sit down.

223
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,889
How the fuck am I supposed
to trust you? You're my doctor.

224
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,184
Please sit down, you're scaring me.

225
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,269
You've been drinking.

226
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,524
- Why the fuck didn't you help her?
- Sometimes you can't.

227
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,609
I bet you charged her enough,
didn't you?

228
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,278
Bet you didn't cut her a deal
because you're incompetent.

229
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:33,950
I give my patients
everything I've got.

230
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,871
And when something like this happens,
I'm devastated.

231
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,656
She was a good kid.

232
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,660
But she was fucking crazy,
and I told you.

233
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,456
And I want you to know
that I was upfront with her.

234
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,792
- She knew I was married.
- I'm aware of that.

235
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,629
Suicide. Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

236
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,051
I have to respect confidentiality
even after a patient is dead.

237
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,304
But with something like this...

238
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,015
...there's no one cause.

239
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,520
You yourself just referred
to her emotional problems.

240
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,357
She slipped through everyone's grasp.

241
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,278
She did it after me.
I mean, admit it.

242
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,782
You know, she...

243
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,661
...reached out to me,
for me to care...

244
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,288
...and I wasn't there for her.

245
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,583
Why are you so quick
to blame yourself?

246
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,176
Capitano!

247
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,222
Come in.

248
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,102
- What's up? You want a coffee?
- No.

249
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,857
Artie, you...

250
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,485
You need a favor.

251
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,738
- Why don't you reach out to me?
- What are you talking about?

252
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:40,451
Ralph Cifaretto called me
and told me you came to him for money?

253
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,371
You need something,
you don't come to me?

254
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,415
- I'm your friend.
- Right.

255
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,876
So I didn't impinge
on our friendship.

256
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,879
But, Artie, this is me.

257
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,424
- Tony.
- Ton, if I was desperate...

258
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,010
...if Melissa had a tumor instead
of an overbite...

259
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,848
...Madonna santa, knock wood,
you'd be the first place I went to.

260
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,017
But this was a business venture.

261
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,644
What kind of deal?

262
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,897
Elodi's brother needs a bridge loan.
Fifty thousand dollars.

263
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,860
- And I get back 57 and a half in 10 days.
- Thought it was for the restaurant.

264
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,822
I told Ralphie that. I don't want him
going around me to the principals.

265
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,576
- What for, then?
- North American distribution rights...

266
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:26,247
...for Domaine Vézelay Armagnac.

267
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,587
Yeah.

268
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,883
It's the new vodka.
This stuff is sweeping Europe.

269
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,343
It's gonna be bigger
than Stoli, Goose.

270
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,431
Who ever heard of Goose before?
It's French vodka.

271
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,725
These guys, they're big players.

272
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,895
They're throwing millions
behind product introduction.

273
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,898
- All right, you got it.
- I told you, Tony, no.

274
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,692
What the fuck am I?
A toxic person or something?

275
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,611
No, Tony. Come on, please.

276
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,696
I'll charge you a point and a half.

277
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,034
And believe me, I know that's a lot
fucking better than Ralph would do.

278
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,538
I insist.

279
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,751
- Look, here's, like, $3000.
- Ton.

280
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,253
Somebody's gonna come by,
give you the rest.

281
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,383
You a great guy, Ton.

282
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,137
Come here.

283
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,650
It's a good idea.
Snifter, a nice cigar.

284
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,985
You'll see what I mean.

285
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,577
- Hey.
- Dinner's almost ready.

286
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,833
Oh, shit.

287
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,874
Tony?

288
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,834
Anthony.

289
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,211
Which you wanna see?

290
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,422
This...

291
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,674
...or this?

292
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:51,077
Tony! Cousin Brian's here!

293
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,420
Ton!

294
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,924
Be right down!

295
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,763
- Hey, Brian, how you doing?
- Good, Ton. Great to see you.

296
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,600
Brian brought the papers, Tony.

297
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,478
He said you called him last night
to hurry things along?

298
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,439
The Soprano Family Living Trust,
as discussed.

299
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,275
Now when I croak, it's her problem.

300
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:29,073
You have...
You have made me so happy, Tony.

301
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:34,286
And if I was, like, obnoxious
about this, I'm sorry.

302
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,331
Hey, come on.

303
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,959
That's my lava cookies
for the bake sale.

304
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,129
- Would you like a couple, Bri?
- Thanks, but I gotta get back.

305
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,338
New client lunch.

306
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,299
We're gonna see you and Janelle
at Billy Joel, right?

307
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,301
Wouldn't miss it.

308
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,889
You know what, Ton?
It's a shame you didn't get eight tickets.

309
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,392
That way Furio and Jessica
could've come with us.

310
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,438
- It takes the pressure off of a blind date.
- Well, Hesh's guy could only get six.

311
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,112
All right.
I'll get the originals back to you.

312
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,073
I'll have a copy,
get one to your lawyer.

313
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,200
All right.

314
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,376
You know, that's a...

315
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,880
That's a nice suit. What is it?
Oh, Boss.

316
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,799
- Yeah, I notice you like the good stuff.
- My only vice.

317
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,012
Call this number.

318
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,347
You ask for Patsy.

319
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:39,185
- Tell him I said to take care of you.
- Thanks, Tony.

320
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,354
Wow. You're a great guy.

321
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,356
All right.

322
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,973
Artie, don't forget to call in
that meat order.

323
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,017
No problem.

324
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,230
- Hi.
- Hi.

325
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,816
Hi, Ma. This is Devin.

326
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,902
- Hi, Devin, how are you?
- Really well. It's nice to meet you.

327
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,153
Thank you.

328
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:17,700
- Anthony, you wanna turn that down?
- Oh, yeah.

329
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,789
If you kids are hungry,
I can make a couple sandwiches.

330
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,917
No, we're fine, Ma.

331
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,628
Careful of my Lladró, please.

332
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,881
Yeah. Don't worry.

333
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,342
- What do you call it?
- Lladró.

334
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,637
I don't even wanna say
how much it costs.

335
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,726
Three thousand dollars.

336
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:49,023
I really wanted to be alone with you.

337
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,692
Your house is out, right?

338
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,028
My mom's boyfriend's using it
as an office...

339
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,072
...and I'm not at my dad's
till next week.

340
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,078
- My sister's dorm.
- At Columbia?

341
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,914
Sure. Sure, let's go.

342
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,168
The 33 bus goes into the city
every hour.

343
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,837
They're so smelly.
I'll call a car service.

344
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,215
- How much is that?
- Well, I'll put it on my Amex.

345
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,885
I'll call her cell.

346
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,435
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

347
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,687
I'm on my way into the city
with a friend...

348
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,731
...and I thought maybe
we could hook up?

349
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,401
Wow. Great. I'm not on campus,
but you could meet me.

350
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,572
Take the Cross Bronx Expressway to the
corner of Brook Ave. and 161 st Street.

351
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,992
- Brook Avenue and what?
- 161 st Street.

352
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,204
- Okay.
- All right. See you soon.

353
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,458
I pictured your house different.

354
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,211
I thought it'd be like
Don Corleone's compound...

355
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:56,465
...with gate, wall, big old Cadillacs.
Isn't that stupid?

356
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,259
Our place in Tahoe looks exactly
like Michael's in II.

357
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,303
Wow. Really?

358
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,683
No. We don't have a place in Tahoe.

359
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,309
We have a boat though.

360
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,270
I'm like a gangster dude's girlfriend.

361
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:27,538
- Are you sure this is it?
- Brook Avenue and 161 st Street.

362
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,375
- Columbia? This looks like Harlem.
- South Bronx.

363
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,848
Don't leave, okay?

364
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,112
Help you?

365
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,655
They're mine.

366
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,577
When did you get taller than me?

367
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:10,080
Cheokay, this is my brother.
Cheokay just got accepted at Yale Law.

368
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,082
What's happening?

369
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,794
I'm Meadow, Politeness Man's sister.

370
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,004
- I'm Devin.
- Hi.

371
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,173
Can I talk to you?

372
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,510
Is this what you do
on a Friday night?

373
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,345
The South Bronx Law Center.

374
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:29,266
It's a free criminal-defense service for
those who can't afford legal counsel.

375
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,476
I intern here.

376
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,978
- I need to use your room.
- What for?

377
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,315
You know.

378
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,280
You've gotta be kidding.
Anthony, no.

379
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,282
Just for a little while. Why not?

380
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,451
I don't wanna think about it.
It's my bed.

381
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,329
- How am I gonna go in there?
- We'll stay on the coverlet.

382
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,915
- No.
- We came all the way over here.

383
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,668
I thought you wanted to go into the city.
There's all this stuff going on.

384
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:00,714
I thought we'd go to the Alphabets.
A friend of mine's sister's reading.

385
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:12,059
The greatest cultural center in the world,
and you came over here for sex?

386
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,562
Probably just gonna cruise.

387
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,732
Is the tree up
at Rockefeller Center yet?

388
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,611
Look at the way these people
have to live.

389
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,446
Yeah.

390
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,866
I think they're overwhelmed.

391
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,787
I mean, they're in a cycle,
they keep having kids.

392
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,289
I know.

393
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,500
We're just so insulated from reality.

394
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,670
I mean, we have everything we want.

395
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,421
When you think about it...

396
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,091
They're on food stamps and welfare.

397
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,469
And my mom could go out
and buy a statue for $3000.

398
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,179
Three thousand dollars.

399
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,223
We have a housekeeper
three days a week.

400
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,016
We have one too.

401
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,689
I guess I just lucked out to be rich
and live in a big house.

402
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,940
Yeah.

403
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,484
Even somebody like Steve Mussel.

404
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,904
He's got all-right clothes,
but have you ever been to his house?

405
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,489
I don't think so.

406
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,950
His dad's a math teacher.

407
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,035
They don't even have a dining room.

408
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,331
There's five people living there.
It's just this little box.

409
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,713
Here.

410
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,174
Arthur, already 80 seats tonight.

411
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,720
- They come to see you.
- Hey, you.

412
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,680
You!

413
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,476
I eat so much of your gnocchi,
I'm gonna get a belly.

414
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,904
Elodi, is Jean-Philippe okay?

415
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,489
What do you mean?

416
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,743
He was gonna call me.
I left him a couple of messages.

417
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,913
Did you hear from him?
Does he call your mother?

418
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,707
Well, he always works strange hours.

419
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,834
The time difference.

420
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,544
By the time we're waking up...

421
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,173
...they're already at home eating dinner
in Toulouse.

422
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,760
I almost forget.

423
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,971
I bring you something.

424
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,642
Boulevard des Slows. It's for the P.A.

425
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,021
I have to put the flowers in the vases.

426
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,275
Problems with the investment, Arthur?

427
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,402
- What do you mean?
- Please.

428
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,820
What do you think?

429
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:33,033
She suddenly wants to play hide
the boudin blanc with you?

430
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,751
We don't see you here anymore.

431
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,214
Or up at the house either.

432
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,633
Christopher, he can't seem to shake
this flu.

433
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,427
Yeah, I noticed his skin
doesn't look so good.

434
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,181
He's just stressed out.

435
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,724
Which reminds me...

436
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,435
...Billy Joel,
maybe you shouldn't count on us.

437
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,397
You mean, you might not
be able to come?

438
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,900
Well, there's been all these problems
at the Crazy Horse and...

439
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,403
I don't know.

440
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,655
What a shame, that's awful.

441
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,367
What am I gonna do
with those tickets?

442
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,923
God, I love marrow.

443
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,468
Remember Ma with the bone?

444
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,263
Sounded like half-price day
at the liposuction center.

445
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,806
Please.

446
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,268
It's nice, us having dinner together.

447
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,478
Catching up.

448
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,899
I'm just glad I'm in a position
to do it.

449
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,280
Chocolate soufflé.

450
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,324
Gelato, sorbet sampler.

451
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,785
- On the house.
- Thank you.

452
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,872
Something for after dinner?
I got a nice Armagnac.

453
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,125
I used to drink that in France.
Histamines.

454
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,210
I think it's good.

455
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,338
I know, Tony.
Can I have a Nonino Picolit?

456
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,924
- I know it's expensive.
- Yeah, bring me one too.

457
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,516
- So you and Bobby Bacala, huh?
- So that's it.

458
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,352
What is so compelling to you
about my personal business?

459
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:29,816
Jesus Christ, am I such an ogre? I was
just gonna say he's a nice guy, a salute.

460
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:33,862
- I gotta have an agenda?
- No, Tony.

461
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,697
I'm sorry.

462
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,910
- What am I, a toxic person?
- You're a great brother.

463
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,330
We can go at it pretty good...

464
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,792
...but you always seem to reach out
when it counts.

465
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,919
Yeah?

466
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,842
Did you ever know anybody that...

467
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,846
...ever committed suicide?

468
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,391
Plenty. I used to live
in Seattle, Tony.

469
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,269
Anybody close?

470
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,021
Murray Furlong.

471
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,943
A good, good friend.
He lived upstairs.

472
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:17,114
People said he was in the CIA,
gone for long periods of time and...

473
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,282
I always thought he was gay.
I don't know.

474
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:25,122
Maybe that's not mutually exclusive...
Anyway, one day...

475
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,460
...he sucked on the end
of a deer rifle.

476
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,755
Did you feel responsible?

477
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,174
Well...

478
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,301
...yeah, I did.

479
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,763
You know, partly, we all did.

480
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,851
My last conversation with him
was an argument.

481
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,435
If you can call it that.

482
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:52,274
About him always asking me
to accept FedEx packages for him.

483
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,696
But you never really know why.

484
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,198
Probably it was his name.

485
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,708
You can leave the bottle.

486
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,504
And, Artie, put that on my tab, huh?

487
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,549
Of course.

488
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,685
Ton.

489
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,396
Can I talk to you?

490
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,732
Yeah.

491
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,692
What's going on?

492
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,153
I just wanna give you
a little heads-up.

493
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,406
I know the money's due
in a couple of days.

494
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:47,037
I'm concerned. I can't get ahold of
Jean-Philippe. He won't return my calls.

495
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:54,044
- Did you go over there?
- Well, not yet.

496
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,511
Well...

497
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,513
...Artie...

498
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,641
...you gotta go over there.

499
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,769
- The guy's not returning your calls.
- I know.

500
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,564
They miss a payment, they start acting
like they're doing you a favor...

501
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,107
...if they give you anything.

502
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,527
And then you gotta spend
all your time hounding them.

503
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,239
You gotta get your arms
around this thing.

504
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,908
Now.

505
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,287
You know what I'm saying?

506
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,008
Oh, Jean-Philippe, you're home.

507
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,887
I called you five times. Qu'est-ce que
c'est, message machine broken?

508
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,305
Nice crib.

509
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,141
What is that, Berber carpet?

510
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,310
Those...

511
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,772
...fucking shoes you wear,
what are they...

512
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,857
...designer?

513
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,152
You fucking avoiding me,
motherfucker?

514
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,654
Where's my money?

515
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,198
Oh, what, are you gonna cry now?

516
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,784
Stand up, you frog-eating
faccia di cazzo.

517
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,121
I will fuck you up, man.

518
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,443
Oh, Arthur, hello.

519
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,029
- Come in.
- Jean-Philippe, you're home.

520
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,866
Qu'est-ce que c'est, man,
message machine broken?

521
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,036
I'm sorry. I been wishing
to call you.

522
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,704
Nice crib.

523
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,415
You were supposed to give me
my money two days ago.

524
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,251
I know. But Credit Lyonnais,
they didn't come through...

525
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,380
...with the second round
of financing yet.

526
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,216
- My partners are sick about it.
- Well...

527
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,302
...that's not my problem,
Jean-Philippe.

528
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,097
- I want my money.
- I just told you, I don't have it.

529
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,932
Well...

530
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,143
...when are you gonna get it?
I don't know, okay?

531
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:01,064
I don't know.
It doesn't look too good.

532
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,525
What does that mean?

533
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,985
I mean...

534
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,780
...I don't know if it's going
to happen, all right?

535
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,658
They were not convinced
to our business model.

536
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,120
They didn't agree there was
as much potential for Armagnac.

537
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,705
The problem has been...

538
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:21,960
...it seems that people cannot figure
out how to market Armagnac.

539
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,548
The hip approach,
like with Stoli, fails.

540
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,716
Well, you said it was the next vodka!

541
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,219
Hey, so we are big boys,
we must move on.

542
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,848
Frog-eating, fucking faccia di cazzo.

543
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,559
- What did you say?
- I said, I want my money.

544
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,145
Are you stupid?
That money's spent.

545
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,940
- Operating expenses, notaires, travel...
- No.

546
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,611
- You have my $50,000.
- It's business. It's a risk.

547
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,407
- I have a daughter who needs braces!
- Listen to me, I don't have it now.

548
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,828
You fucking French
fucking lying cocksucker!

549
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,167
Fuck to your mother!

550
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,303
Get off me.

551
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,391
My earring!

552
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,562
You ripped my fucking ear!

553
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,693
- I want my money!
- Fuck you!

554
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,446
I see you again, I'll kill you.

555
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,664
Keep knocking on the door
without going in right away.

556
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,919
You gotta poke the perimeter until she's
out of her fucking mind and begging.

557
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,255
Then you own that shit.
That pussy's yours.

558
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,382
I think she's ready.

559
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,135
We shall know forsooth.

560
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,222
Liz has been to her house.
She says it's nice.

561
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,809
Doesn't look that great.

562
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,854
It's kind of Bo Peep-ish.

563
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,983
Can I help you?

564
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:14,948
- We're here to see Devin Pillsbury.
- Proceed on up. Park in the auto court.

565
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,715
- Help you guys?
- It's okay, Ted.

566
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,551
Hi, guys.

567
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,679
- You wanna pull it over here for me, sir?
- Hi, A.J.

568
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,522
Wow.

569
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,357
Nice place.

570
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,686
- Get out of here.
- No, it's true.

571
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:30,857
- Iceland is a volcano.
- Hawaii is a volcano.

572
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:40,325
Come here. Okay...

573
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,874
- Hello?
- I just want you to know that I tried...

574
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,376
...and I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

575
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:55,548
And I love you,
and I'm sorry I let you down.

576
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,508
Artie?

577
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,054
What's the matter?
What's wrong with you?

578
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,641
I'm a complete and total failure.

579
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,520
You take care of Charmaine.

580
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,439
What did you do, Artie?

581
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,567
- What did you do?
- I'm just gonna go to sleep.

582
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,278
Artie, did you take something?

583
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,821
Don't go to sleep!

584
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,324
Artie, you hear me?
Don't go to sleep!

585
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,955
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- What's wrong? You gotta go?

586
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,666
A friend of mine.

587
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,753
Fucking idiot took some pills or
something, he's trying to kill himself.

588
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,882
All right, what the fuck am I doing?

589
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,680
I'm gonna call 911.

590
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,099
It'll do him more good than I can.

591
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:55,024
- Are these real?
- Yeah.

592
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,987
- So this is, like, a real Picasso?
- Well, my dad collects his later stuff.

593
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,408
They're all cocks.

594
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,368
Well, Picasso was
an old man by then.

595
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,787
Shit, they must be worth millions
at least.

596
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,541
- Isn't your dad afraid we'll steal them?
- No.

597
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,463
What is that, a Sota turntable?

598
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:21,092
Patrick, little Mr. Consumer.

599
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,055
You don't like that?
Do you want something else?

600
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,349
No, just...

601
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,935
...I wish you would've said something.

602
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,146
It doesn't mean anything.

603
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,356
I feel so stupid.

604
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,734
My mother's stupid Lladró, and...

605
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,986
"We have a housekeeper
three days a week."

606
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,155
I don't care.

607
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,365
I like you.

608
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,952
Rubber Soul in mint condition.
This has gotta be worth what?

609
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,038
You should've told me.

610
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:54,250
- And what would you have done if I did?
- I don't know.

611
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,838
I mean, if it wasn't such a big deal,
why didn't you say something?

612
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:11,350
- Jesus.
- Artie, what happened?

613
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,936
It all went to shit.

614
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,147
The next vodka.

615
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,734
- So this is what you do?
- But you don't understand.

616
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,527
The money's gone.

617
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,491
Can't you come and talk to me?

618
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,327
Hey. Hey, I'm your friend.

619
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,832
Suppose you hadn't reached me and
I come to your house and I find you dead.

620
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,794
How am I supposed to feel?

621
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,509
Take the restaurant.

622
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,680
I don't want the fucking restaurant.

623
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,727
Then how am I gonna pay you back?

624
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,648
Fifty thousand dollars,
it'd take the rest of my life.

625
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,443
Well, it's 51,500, vig-wise,
Artie, and...

626
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,863
...technically,
you already missed a payment.

627
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,953
All right, look, let's just...

628
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,373
We'll wipe my tab at the restaurant.

629
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,542
Thank you.

630
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,883
But, Tony, that's what, $6000?

631
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,844
What about the rest of the money?

632
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,639
I'll assume the guy's debt,
collect the 50 G's.

633
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,474
Thank you.

634
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,823
The cobwebs are now removed.

635
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,660
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- You saw this whole thing, didn't you?

636
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:57,331
You knew exactly what
was gonna happen.

637
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,336
You can see 20 moves down the road.

638
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,631
Please, I don't blame you, I envy you.

639
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,841
It's like an instinct.

640
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,344
Like a hawk sees a mouse moving
around a corn field from a mile up.

641
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,389
You think it's my fault
you're fucking lying in here?

642
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,686
It's just that somebody mentions 50
grand to bankroll a French digestif...

643
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,814
...and your mind goes through
all the permutations...

644
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,483
...at, like, Internet speed,
and realizes:

645
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:28,279
"Worst-case scenario,
I eat for free."

646
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,077
You fucking suicide!
You're disgraceful!

647
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,664
- I'm sorry.
- No, fuck that!

648
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,421
Anybody else know
I loaned you the money?

649
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,256
- Like who?
- I don't give a fuck who.

650
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,508
Adriana, Father Intintola, my wife.

651
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,469
Anybody?

652
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,557
All right, you got mugged...

653
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,268
...outside of your house.
It was a street crime, kids.

654
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,896
They took your wallet and watch.
Where are they?

655
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,732
- Why?
- Come on.

656
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,614
Why?

657
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,158
You don't care what people think?

658
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,578
Well, I do. Enough people hate me.

659
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,706
You fought back.

660
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,542
They ripped your earring out,
you went inside...

661
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,503
...you took pills to kill the pain...

662
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,631
...because you knew you'd have
to wait at the emergency room.

663
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,926
Ton, they pumped my stomach.

664
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,303
They saw the Armagnac.

665
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,306
You got fucking mugged.
Do you understand me?

666
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,184
I didn't loan you shit.

667
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,590
That night, I had this dream.

668
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,886
My grandfather's at a table,
and in front of him is steak pizzaiola.

669
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,014
Standing next to him
is my grandmother.

670
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,183
She's wearing a blue dress
and pouring him a glass of wine.

671
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,186
And he says to me,
"You see this?

672
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,773
If you got a good wife,
you're a millionaire."

673
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:31,777
So the next day, I go over Carmela's
house for dinner with her family.

674
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,864
And in front of me is steak pizzaiola.

675
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,743
Before I could realize the
déjà vu that was going on...

676
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,245
...Carmela's standing next
to me in a blue dress.

677
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,165
Pouring me a glass of soda.

678
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,835
The next day, I bought the ring.

679
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,507
That is so incredible, so romantic.

680
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,387
She's a romantic one, this one.

681
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,598
- She gonna clean my teeth for me.
- Really?

682
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:04,143
I have to confess. You know,
sometimes, I find the dentist erotic.

683
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,854
Brian, all night I admire your suit.

684
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,231
My man, Mr. Soprano,
turned me on to it.

685
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,983
Nice. Patsy?

686
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,196
I'd like to propose a toast
to our host.

687
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,573
Hear, hear.

688
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:22,036
Tony, great tickets,
great meal, great wine...

689
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:27,083
...and for being a great guy
who I'm proud to call a new friend.

690
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,260
So he says I planned it all along.

691
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,889
That I could see 20 steps down
the road how it was gonna go...

692
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,308
...and how he was gonna get screwed.
Did you?

693
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,896
- See it?
- I don't know.

694
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:56,070
According to him,
it's subconscious, second nature.

695
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,780
But the accusation bothers you.

696
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,408
Is that the kind of person I am?
A hawk?

697
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,202
That's an animal.

698
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,540
Well, as I understand it, you make
a lot of your living through usury.

699
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,877
So why the pangs of conscience
this time?

700
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:16,257
Do you think your reaction would
have been the same if it all?

701
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,885
Your friend taking the pills,
all of it...

702
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:25,933
...hadn't happened a week or so
after you found out about Gloria?

703
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,936
I'll tell you one thing.

704
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,730
One suicide is bad enough,
but two?

705
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,817
They can both go fuck themselves.

706
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:39,738
I made a donation to the suicide hot line
in her name, and...

707
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,949
...that's it.

708
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:56,422
The projection screen in their media room
was as big as the small ones at AMC.

709
00:52:56,631 --> 00:53:00,759
I heard Mr. Pillsbury is some kind of
financial corporate whiz or something.

710
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:05,014
- Dude, you're the Pillsbury Doughboy.
- Shut up.

711
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:11,187
Hey, A.J., how come your dad doesn't
have that Don Corleone money?

712
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,774
I don't know.
