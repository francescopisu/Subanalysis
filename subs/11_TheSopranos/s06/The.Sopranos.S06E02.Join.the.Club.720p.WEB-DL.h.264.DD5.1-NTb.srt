1
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,760
Gentlemen,
can I get you anything?

2
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,740
Orange County firefighters

3
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,640
have called in extra help

4
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,340
from the California Department of
Forestry aircraft...

5
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,300
Hi, you've reached the Sopranos.
Leave a message. Bye!

6
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,460
Stop picking your nose!

7
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,730
I'm here.
Call me.

8
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
Love you.

9
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,610
Thanks.

10
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,030
Good morning.
Anthony Soprano.

11
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,570
Yup.
See some photo ID, please?

12
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,350
What the hell?

13
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
This isn't my wallet.

14
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,190
Oh, no.

15
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,360
And this isn't
my briefcase.

16
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,630
Last night...

17
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,610
I was at a bar across
the street from my hotel.

18
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,010
I must have picked up
the wrong stuff.

19
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,440
Well, I'll tell you what:
I'm here,

20
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,050
so I'll try
to call the bar.

21
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,980
But could you
let me in

22
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,550
so I don't miss
the morning session?

23
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,240
Gosh, I really can't.

24
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,510
Look, I just flew in
from New Jersey

25
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,120
and Colonel Colonna,
he speaks at 10:30.

26
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,780
I can't let you in
without photo ID, sir.

27
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,860
- Security.
- I'm on the list.

28
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,000
Sorry.

29
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,660
It's a whole new world.

30
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,200
Got a big $87 in cash
to my name.

31
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,640
So his briefcase
is a Bally too?

32
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,940
No. I didn't look at the brand
name when I picked it up.

33
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,240
It just looked like mine,
that's all.

34
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,850
I gave you that briefcase
for Christmas, Ton'.

35
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,610
I know, honey.
I know.

36
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,950
His license has a Kingman, Arizona,
address and no phone is listed.

37
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,560
What's in the briefcase?
Did you look?

38
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,630
Yeah, of course I looked.
There's a bunch of brochures

39
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,530
for solar heating systems.
No company name.

40
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,000
He'll get in touch.

41
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,270
That was
a great lecture.

42
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,315
Inget firmanamn.

43
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,256
<i>Han hÃ♪r av sig.</i>

44
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,310
My whole life's
in that case.

45
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,320
Thank you.

46
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,790
- Welcome to the Radisson.
- How you doing?

47
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,490
I checked out a couple hours ago but I'm
going to need the room back. Soprano.

48
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,870
I am sorry, but we're
completely booked.

49
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,520
- You're kidding.
- I'm afraid not.

50
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,330
There's six conventions in town.
You might try the Omni.

51
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,130
Trouble is
I lost my wallet,

52
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,470
so how the hell am I going to check
in there without a credit card?

53
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,080
You'd face the same
problem here.

54
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,270
Yeah, but I stayed here
as a guest just last night.

55
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,040
You couldn't sign on that bill,
you've already closed it out.

56
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,150
Thanks for being
so helpful.

57
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,500
Hi.

58
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,930
What can I get you?

59
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,270
Well, I don't know
if you remember me,

60
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,000
but I was in here
last night around 8:00.

61
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,200
I was sitting
right over there.

62
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,370
I ordered the blackened grouper
sandwich then I canceled.

63
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,580
- Said I had pains in my stomach.
- Vaguely, okay...

64
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,810
Well, when I was leaving,
I picked up a wallet and a briefcase

65
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,220
and I thought they were mine,

66
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,880
- but they weren't.
- Oh, Jesus.

67
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,320
You don't happen to remember
who was sitting next to me?

68
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,230
You know,
there was a guy.

69
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,160
He was
about your height.

70
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,860
You know the reason I remember
is he'd had that grouper sand too

71
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,300
and I was afraid we'd mess the orders
up. I think he left before you.

72
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,440
- And he never came back?
- No.

73
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,740
You know the name
Kevin Finnerty?

74
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,850
- He drives a Lexus.
- You know him?

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,540
It's a joke.
Infinity? Lexus?

76
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,750
I imagine you could use
one on the house.

77
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,890
Yeah, yeah.
You said a mouthful.

78
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,130
- Uh, Scotch rocks.
- All right.

79
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,390
- Glenlivet okay?
- Oh yeah, better than okay.

80
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,090
Well, might as well
hang out here

81
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,860
in case he shows or calls.

82
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,770
You realize I can't even get on a plane
without a picture ID?

83
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,840
Oh, God, that's right.

84
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,150
Well, tell me
about Costa Mesa.

85
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,750
Nice place to live?

86
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,910
Around here?
It's dead.

87
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,630
Give me
the grouper sandwich.

88
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,200
You got it.

89
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,430
Bag the sandwich.
Come eat with us.

90
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,440
A few of us are getting a table.
Dude lost his wallet and briefcase.

91
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,770
- Man. Oh, no.
- That's all right. Thanks anyway.

92
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,470
Come on. That tool who took your stuff
shows up, we'll all pound his ass.

93
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,940
Okay, thanks.

94
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,290
U. S. Drill Bit.
Aerospace and industrial equipment.

95
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,490
We just sold our gear
and coupling unit to Wheela-brator

96
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,290
- to focus on pumps and compressors.
- Interesting.

97
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,060
Tony, you never did tell us
how you made the jump

98
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,800
from selling patio furniture
to precision optics.

99
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,600
Well, like my wife says,
that's a good question.

100
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,080
Excuse me for one minute.

101
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,410
Hi, Daddy.
I made volleyball.

102
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,140
All right! I told you, didn't I?
You were worried over nothing.

103
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,650
How's your brother?

104
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,480
Mom put him to bed early.
He puked.

105
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,120
Oh, no.
ls she around?

106
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,660
Mom!
Bye, Dad.

107
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,990
Bye, baby.

108
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,690
Ton', how ya doing?

109
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,630
Finnerty didn't
call there, did he?

110
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,320
No. I'd have let you know
right away.

111
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,470
Where'd Jeff
and Kansas go?

112
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,110
To bed, and they
sucker-punched you, buddy.

113
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,610
They paid the check.

114
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,440
You guys all had a hand
in this, didn't you?

115
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,080
Listen, we're just impressed
to be in the presence of a man

116
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,410
whose sales team snatched
the brass ring

117
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,110
12 consecutive quarters.

118
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,120
It's not such a big deal.

119
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,190
There's always
a faster gun.

120
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,130
I'm 46 years old.

121
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,360
I mean, who am I?

122
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,090
Where am I going?

123
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,530
Join the club.

124
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,990
Now is the time you can
clearly hear His voice.

125
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,150
Let us rejoice
in His love.

126
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,240
This isn't
going to happen.

127
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,900
What are you talking about?

128
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,010
I saw your face when you got off
the phone with your wife.

129
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,240
So?

130
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,350
Don't sweat it.
It's sweet, actually.

131
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,550
But you talk about them
back there a lot.

132
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,250
I could even be
some other guy tonight

133
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,490
and get away with
the whole shebang.

134
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,600
But no,
I blow it.

135
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,810
They're looking
for a perp.

136
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,480
His eyes are open.
Two, three.

137
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,020
He's bucking the vent.
Give me the lights.

138
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,150
- I'll get some restraints.
- Four milligrams Ativan.

139
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,220
He was just lying there peacefully
just like he has been and then he just--

140
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,660
- He's still bucking.
- Room three! The gunshot.

141
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,700
He pulled his tubes out!

142
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,420
I have to retube him.

143
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,930
- Oh, God.
- Etomidate and sux and an airway box.

144
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,260
- Take the family out.
- Give us room to move.

145
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,530
- Please wait outside.
- Where's the Ativan, please?

146
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
I got him.

147
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,340
- Tony.
- Dad?

148
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,240
- Mr. Soprano.
- Tony?

149
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,980
- What, honey?
- Who am I? Where am I going?

150
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,620
We're right here with you.
Tony, who am I?

151
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,220
Get ready to retube him.
Sir, can you hear me?

152
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,620
Who am I?
Where am I going?

153
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,890
- Dad!
- Tony!

154
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,290
I'm going to have to insist
that you guys leave.

155
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,760
Getting this breathing tube back in is
something you're not gonna want to see.

156
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,270
- What's going on?
- You're just getting back?

157
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,310
Matt's car wouldn't start.

158
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,770
- Did you eat at least?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,970
Dad's not so good right now.
They made us leave.

160
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,900
I got to go.

161
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,690
- What's the latest?
- He came out of the coma for a minute.

162
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,770
They took
the breathing tube out.

163
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,910
That's good, right?
That means he's breathing on his own.

164
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,540
They had to put
the tube back in.

165
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,200
- Goddamn Junior.
- Anthony Soprano is not going to die.

166
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,610
I don't know what
everybody's talking about.

167
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,410
Nobody's saying
he's going to die.

168
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,850
Could one of you take
these guys home, please? 2:00 a. m.

169
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,580
You can't live in this ICU.
Two nights straight is too much.

170
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,620
I'm okay.
Mead spelled me last night.

171
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,960
- I'm staying tonight too.
- I want you to go back.

172
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay, people call the house.
I need somebody there.

173
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,160
Ma, you want some tea?

174
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,540
Van Helsing, let's go.

175
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,940
- I'll take him.
- I got it.

176
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,980
- He's on my way.
- Bullshit, you live in Bellevue.

177
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,670
- What do you care?
- You already brought the sfogliatelle!

178
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,540
Let's go.

179
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,990
Got him back on the ventilator,
mucus plug.

180
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,320
The bullet didn't just tear up the
pancreas, it impacted the gall bladder.

181
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,730
Sepsis is the big problem.
An infection in the blood.

182
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,890
I've got him sedated
and restrained

183
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,660
so he can't pull his
breathing tubes out.

184
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,140
- Okay, then what?
- As we discussed before,

185
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,270
we're probably not looking
at a very good outcome here.

186
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,430
Should we call Dr. Plepler?

187
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,170
I'll let him know.
And Taschlin too. He'll stop by.

188
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,970
Does he know
that he's dying?

189
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,280
We don't know.

190
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,900
Welcome to the Omni.
How may I help you?

191
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,010
Name is Finnerty.
I called and reserved a room.

192
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,250
Yes, Mr. Finnerty, we have you down
for a single room for the night.

193
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,720
Did you wish to keep
that on the Visa?

194
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,650
Uh, yeah.

195
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,290
I'll need to take
an imprint to cover incidentals.

196
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,590
Sure.

197
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,920
Room 728.
Elevators are on your left.

198
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,190
Have a good night.

199
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,120
Thank you.

200
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,160
- Good night.
- Night.

201
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,470
Kevin Finnerty?

202
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,480
We thought we heard
that man say your name.

203
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,580
How fortuitous we should
meet up with you again.

204
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,240
You know him?
This is important.

205
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,620
Months you have ignored
our letters and phone calls.

206
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,950
Well, we are now
filing suit against you.

207
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,180
No, okay, back up.

208
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,090
I'm not Kevin Finnerty.

209
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,890
I have his wallet
by mistake

210
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,830
and I guess I look
a little like him?

211
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,770
So he is from around here?

212
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,340
We had a horrible winter
at the monastery

213
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,740
because of your
heating system.

214
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,570
I'm not Kevin Finnerty.

215
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,680
- Lose your arrogance.
- Son of a bitch!

216
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,750
Hey!
Hey, come on guys.

217
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,820
Did you see?
He hit me!

218
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,450
Don't let him--
he hit me!

219
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,680
- You okay?
- Don't let him go!

220
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,420
I was just trying
to block your fall.

221
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,120
Did you see that?

222
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,260
Why would I be joking?

223
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,330
He slapped me in the mouth.

224
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,990
Did you file
a police report?

225
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,330
I'm staying here
under somebody else's credit card.

226
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,470
- You could've explained that.
- Oh, you're so sure?

227
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,910
It's fraud.

228
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,840
Does the hotel know if there's
a Buddhist temple or anything around?

229
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,640
They say there's
more than one.

230
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,050
If I could find the place
and I could get some words in edgewise,

231
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,880
they might point me
to Finnerty.

232
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,180
But who wants more complications?
I just want to come home.

233
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,260
I know. You never even wanted
to go to this conference.

234
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,860
I agree. You should just leave tomorrow
and not go on to Houston.

235
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,400
I'll wire you cash.

236
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,000
Can I claim the cash
without ID?

237
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,070
Shit.
That's a good question.

238
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,600
All right, I'll call Doenitz, see if the
company can help.

239
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,570
I miss you.

240
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,840
I miss you too, but you're
off in your own world.

241
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,040
You're too distracted
with work.

242
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,410
This is partly your fault.

243
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,710
Call me later
if you can't sleep.

244
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,220
Love you.

245
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,910
Love you.

246
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,420
Good morning.

247
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,940
Oh!

248
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,390
- Mead honey?
- How is he?

249
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,620
The same.

250
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,530
But another night has passed
and he is still with us.

251
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,800
He's not the same.

252
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,710
His fever dropped to 39.1. That's
102-point-something.

253
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,440
Oh, Dr. Plepler.
Good morning.

254
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,210
Hear we had a rumpus
last night, huh?

255
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,410
Oh, God.
It was awful.

256
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,320
How long since
he left my O.R.?

257
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,750
- His amylase is 41.
- Hematocrit still okay?

258
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,760
- Yup.
- Good.

259
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,560
Hi. How's my big brother
doing today?

260
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Everything's okay here.

261
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,440
You mean
just the surgery per se?

262
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,100
- Uh-hmm.
- Well what about the sepsis?

263
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,610
Yeah, well that's the concern.

264
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,770
What did Taschlin say
this morning?

265
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,180
Dr. Taschlin never came
in here this morning.

266
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,520
Well, no matter.
I'll be talking to him.

267
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,520
Go ahead and change
the dressing, huh.

268
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,120
Does this mean the chances
could be worse

269
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,730
my husband could not
come out of his coma?

270
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,660
Actually, now
we've induced coma.

271
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
- He's snowed with Ativan.
- What? Why?

272
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,990
Control the seizures while we try to
knock down the fever with antibiotics.

273
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,070
It says his temperature's
down some.

274
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,830
The problem here is not only

275
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,810
are we looking at the obvious
negative outcome,

276
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,040
but in these cases

277
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,210
we also contemplate
degrees of brain damage

278
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,220
in the event
he does survive.

279
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,320
- What antibiotic is he on?
- Zosyn.

280
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,890
Sorry, Doctor, she volunteered in
an ICU this summer.

281
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,800
Columbia Pres in New York. She's
thinking about a career in medicine.

282
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,940
- Oh, good.
- Or law, I don't know.

283
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,840
Good morning, Doctor.
I'm the sister. We met yesterday.

284
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,670
Look, you're all doing
the right thing.

285
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,070
You're staying with him,
keeping contact, but talk to him also.

286
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,510
Keep him engaged. You might want
to play some of his favorite music.

287
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,380
You know
fortunately for him,

288
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,010
he is at a level-one
trauma center.

289
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,420
Or with his injuries, believe me,
he would have been dead 12 hours ago.

290
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,820
Okay, I see.
Thank you, Doctor.

291
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,220
"Thank you, Doctor"?

292
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,890
"I'm sorry, she volunteered
at an ICU"?

293
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,930
You treat these guys
like rock stars.

294
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,930
- He's the doctor, Meadow.
- Well why bring up brain damage now?

295
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,700
We'll cross that bridge
if we have to.

296
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,970
I came by to help, guys.
Anything.

297
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,040
I left Nica
with Bobby's mother.

298
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,610
You both should get
some rest.

299
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,080
Come on in and see him.
Your sister's here too.

300
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,820
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

301
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,620
I can't get used to this.
Oh, my God.

302
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,690
- Oh, my God. I can't...
- I know, Janice. I know.

303
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,660
Get her some water.
Come here, sit down.

304
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
- It's okay, it's okay.
- That's my brother!

305
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,240
- What are these?
- A watch and a pencil.

306
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,210
Repeat the following
sentence,

307
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,180
"No ifs, ands or buts. "

308
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,720
I'll do it if I fucking
feel like it.

309
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,720
Take your ultimatums
and stick them in your ass.

310
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,450
No, repeat the sentence.

311
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,290
What is this person
talking about?!

312
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,900
These people are trying to establish
for the government,

313
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,460
that if you shot Anthony
Soprano, which we're not conceding,

314
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,330
that it certainly wasn't
intentional--

315
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,300
that you were confused
and disoriented.

316
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,630
- Don't coach him, please.
- My nephew Anthony?

317
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,640
- That's why you're here in custody.
- Where's Mel?

318
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,540
You dismissed Mr. Melvoin
as your attorney and hired me.

319
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,270
Because of his paralyzed hand from
his stroke, it made your nervous.

320
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,440
If somebody shot my nephew
it was him himself.

321
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,210
He's a depression case.

322
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,640
You got any beefs,
I'm the one you come to.

323
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,440
Likewise, weekly I'll
collect for the skip.

324
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,550
I'll keep it for him
until he's back on his feet,

325
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,420
taking out a portion
for Carmela

326
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,820
to run the house
and that shit there.

327
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,150
- Good.
- Absolutely.

328
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,890
Anybody got
any questions?

329
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,830
For now, not personal questions
relating to yourself,

330
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,430
but about the family.

331
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,230
- Yeah, Vito.
- The sports book in Roseville.

332
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,670
By rights, that should
go to me now.

333
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,310
- Eugene was with me.
- Yo, what'd I just say?

334
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,140
Not about yourself!

335
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,110
What do we do about Junior?

336
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,250
He's in jail.
That puts him out of our reach.

337
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,650
- Not necessarily.
- He's a demented old fuck.

338
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,480
I say we do nothing.
Let him rot, sever all ties.

339
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,180
End this embarrassment
right now.

340
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,880
He "Marvin Gayed"
his own nephew, the boss of this family.

341
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,030
What happens to Junior
is Tony's call.

342
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,060
- That's right.
- Bobby,

343
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,630
all due respect, where the fuck
were you that night?

344
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,500
Why was the skipper
babysitting Junior?

345
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,330
I had other
family obligations.

346
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,600
Ask my wife.
Tony volunteered.

347
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,340
Are we done?
I'm going back to the hospital.

348
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,890
He's gotta make an issue
out of everything lately.

349
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,760
Roseville's been Junior's
territory since the Big Bang,

350
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,800
which means it goes to Bobby
now that Junior's out of the picture.

351
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,900
Vito already pulls down
more scratch

352
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,770
than anybody,
from the unions.

353
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,370
Let him go
to the hospital first,

354
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,140
that fat fucking kiss-ass.

355
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,210
I'm buying Tony a nice little
stereo for the room.

356
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,850
He don't need that.

357
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,920
Look at this fucking mutt.

358
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,610
Who wouldn't like to take
the easy way out?

359
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,690
Maybe the poor fuck
was suffering

360
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,790
from inoperable
cancer or some shit.

361
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,790
Suicide runs in families.

362
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,020
Maybe it was his mother
or his old man

363
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,030
took the gas pipe
when Eugene was a kid.

364
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,190
His son,
the drugs maybe.

365
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,600
I knew him better
than anybody, but still...

366
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,280
Maybe he was a homo, felt there was
nobody he could talk to about it.

367
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,610
That happens too.

368
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,850
Good thing Tony never heard
about him killing himself, at least.

369
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,960
Got enough on his plate.

370
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,290
The nurse told me
she saw AJ.

371
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,860
She did?

372
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,000
I asked him to bring
Dad's Tony Bennett box set from home.

373
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,740
Yeah, it's been
kind of weird.

374
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,540
Would you call it
growing up Soprano?

375
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,040
I guess.
I don't know.

376
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,710
Come with me.

377
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,550
Hold on there.

378
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,620
What did I tell you?

379
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,320
We were just talking.

380
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,860
Don't talk to them.
Say nothing.

381
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,690
Where are your father's CDs?

382
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,800
- I forgot.
- Oh Jesus God, Anthony.

383
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,840
- Everybody is pitching in here but you.
- Thanks, Mom.

384
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,200
I wish you would go to class if this
is all you're gonna do.

385
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,040
With my father
in the hospital?

386
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,580
Go to the deli on Broad Street.
Get some bagels.

387
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,180
All right? Get enough
for everybody upstairs, an assortment.

388
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,940
And go this way.

389
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,260
Look. Chris just sent
this over.

390
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,090
A little stereo.

391
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,940
Mead, my God,
I'm telling you,

392
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,700
she seems like she's grown up so much.
What she knows.

393
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,210
She will make
a terrific doctor.

394
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,980
I got some CDs
from my car.

395
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,680
Oh, yes,
you like this one.

396
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,350
Anthony, Anthony.

397
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,820
Ho, Sheriff
of Nottingham.

398
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,190
My kingdom
for a mortadella, huh?

399
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,120
They make a great sandwich here.
No getting around it.

400
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,460
What about that disease
you picked up over there

401
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,890
in Diarrhea-stan
or wherever the fuck you were?

402
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,760
This might be the cure.

403
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,230
Yeah, we're sorry
to hear about Tony.

404
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,000
I got nothing to say
about what happened so--

405
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,730
That's not why I asked.
How's he doing?

406
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,640
He's fucked up.
You know what I think?

407
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,080
I think you don't come
here for the sandwiches.

408
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,910
I think you come
'cause you miss us.

409
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,320
Hey, I can't blame you.
That job you got now must be depressing.

410
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,260
- How goes the war on terror anyway?
- Working it.

411
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,020
I heard Fieldcrest reported
a truckload of towels missing.

412
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,190
We actually spend a little more of our
time trying to interdict

413
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,830
the financial networks
that fund the terror cells worldwide.

414
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,370
- No shit.
- Truck hijacking, narcotics.

415
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,840
In fact, if you ever heard
of anything going down,

416
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,740
Middle Easterners,
Pakistanis,

417
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
you'd be helping a lot
if you picked up a phone.

418
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,710
- And called you?
- It's your country too, isn't it?

419
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,410
Like I'd know one of these suicide
jerk-offs if he bit me on the ass.

420
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,680
You knew Matoush Zhia.
Hung out at your girlfriend's club.

421
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,620
He was a drug dealer,
her friend.

422
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,920
I didn't know shit about his politics
till one of your people told me.

423
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,580
Something to keep in mind.

424
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,860
I take that terrorism
shit seriously.

425
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,500
And Tony, don't even
get him started.

426
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,790
This song was playing
in your car

427
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,440
that entire weekend

428
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,430
we all went down
to Long Beach Island.

429
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,340
Remember Artie and Charmaine
broke up for the first time?

430
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,030
First of many.

431
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,680
She accused him of letting
her drown in the ocean. Remember that?

432
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,580
That wave picked her up

433
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,190
and slammed her down
on her head in the sand?

434
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,990
Oh, my God,
her around water.

435
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,230
And remember the time that she got
cramps from eating that huge calzone?

436
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,060
You had to go in after her.

437
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,970
She almost dragged
you down by your hair.

438
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,170
Oh...

439
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,440
Imagine that.

440
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,910
At one time
you had enough hair

441
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,640
that a woman could grab it
with both her hands.

442
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,630
You're going to be fine, Tony.
I know it.

443
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,990
The doctors say
you're going to be fine too.

444
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,310
They are very confident.

445
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,440
They know that you are really strong.

446
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,240
You're strong as a bull.

447
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,050
You know that
that's always gotten to me.

448
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,880
When you used to pick
me up and throw me over your shoulder--

449
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,860
Oh, my God, Tony.

450
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,430
You used to get me
so hot down there.

451
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,260
I can feel it right now
just thinking about it.

452
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,770
You are going to be
okay, Tony.

453
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,780
Your friends,
your kids all love you.

454
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,430
A long time ago I told you you were
going to go to hell when you died,

455
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,770
when you had that MRI.

456
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,180
And you threw my words back
at me when we got separated.

457
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,810
And you were right.
That was a horrible thing to say.

458
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,720
It's a sin,

459
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,080
and I will be
judged for it.

460
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,320
You're a good father.

461
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,860
You care about your friends.

462
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Yes, it's been
rough between us.

463
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,300
I don't know, our hearts
get so hardened

464
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,470
against each other.
I don't know why.

465
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,290
But you are not
going to hell.

466
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,690
You're coming back here.

467
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,970
I love you.

468
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,290
Mr. Finnerty,
sorry it took so long,

469
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,900
but I saw some things
on the CT scan I didn't like,

470
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,200
which is why I ordered
the MRI.

471
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,540
How long have I been here?

472
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,570
In looking at your MRI,

473
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,580
see these dark areas?

474
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,080
These are parts of your brain that have
been oxygen deprived.

475
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,080
- Uh-huh.
- Unfortunately, these are consistent

476
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,810
- with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's.
- What?

477
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,320
You're going to want to see
a neurologist when you get home,

478
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,020
but the radiologist here
has seen the studies and he concurs.

479
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,190
Alzheimer's?
I'm 46 years old.

480
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,800
- I know.
- What the hell?

481
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,540
This goddamn miserable trip.

482
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,470
The good news is
the treatment picture

483
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,240
isn't quite as bleak
as it would have been a while back.

484
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,250
It's a death sentence.

485
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,940
You're a smurf for 10 or 15 years and
then you die

486
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,060
shitting in your pajamas.

487
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,850
I know people
with Alzheimer's.

488
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,960
Mr. Finnerty, talk
to your own docs back home.

489
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,190
My name's not even Finnerty.

490
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,460
I lost my wallet and my briefcase,
and I picked his up.

491
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,330
So you guys took out
his insurance card from his wallet.

492
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,500
- How's that float your boat?
- Well, what is your name?

493
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,730
What does it matter?
I'm not going to know myself soon.

494
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,050
You can rest here a while.

495
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,380
You're fine other than
the minor concussion.

496
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,550
Fall like that could have
broken your neck.

497
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,430
I'm lost.

498
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,360
AJ wanted to come
but he got

499
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,870
a really bad stomach flu
from a burrito.

500
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,100
Law firm's being so understanding
about me taking time off

501
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,680
from my internship
to be here.

502
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,750
Finn's coming out.

503
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,220
He really likes you.

504
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,930
I was reading this morning
and I found this.

505
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,660
I want to share it with you.

506
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,140
By Jacques Prevert--

507
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,140
"Our Father which art

00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,710
in Heaven, stay there,

509
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,710
and we shall stay on Earth,

510
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,350
which is sometimes so pretty. "

511
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,740
Look, I took
some Pepto-Bismol.

512
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,910
How much do you know
about the Prius?

513
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,140
I could've been
naked in here.

514
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,080
You need to familiarize
yourself with hybrid cars, Meadow.

515
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,740
It's important.
This is the conversation of the future.

516
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,440
Why are you breaking my balls
about hybrid cars?

517
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,520
I don't give a shit.
I've been up all night.

518
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,520
Oh, you're tired?
Poor you.

519
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,520
You never give two fucks
about the environment.

520
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,290
ls that what's crawling
up your butt?

521
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,860
That I was at the hospital
last night when you told Mom you'd come?

522
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,590
I didn't say one word to you
about it and neither did anyone else.

523
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,860
We're all so glad you fucking
kicked your stomach flu, okay?

524
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,600
I saw how you looked
at my plate of food.

525
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,260
I can't eat
at my own house?

526
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:58,240
I wasn't looking at your plate.
It's all in your mind.

527
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,360
Don't you find this
completely embarrassing?

528
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,690
What?

529
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,100
This, our family.

530
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,030
Our father gets shot
by our goober fucking uncle?

531
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,800
- What is that?
- Yeah, it's embarrassing.

532
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,140
I don't want to think
about what Finn's parents are saying.

533
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,580
I mean, I don't really give
a shit about my friends.

534
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,550
They know what Dad does, but like,
some of them remember Uncle Junior.

535
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,350
He was always
a fucking mummy.

536
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,890
- Why did Dad hang out with him?
- You know Dad.

537
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,960
He takes those things
seriously, all the Italian family stuff.

538
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,290
Yeah, I got the big lecture.
Now look.

539
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,330
I know.

540
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,900
Look at these
fucking reporters.

541
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,970
Hey!
Fuck you!

542
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,010
I'll be glad
to sit with Tony.

543
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,110
Hospital rules, it's family
only for now, but thank you.

544
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,480
Angie phoned.

545
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,550
Guess she's very busy over there
with her body shop.

546
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,920
- You want some grits?
- Huh-uh.

547
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,690
Oh, look who's here.

548
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,520
Hey Fabio, I'm available.

549
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,960
So what? Now there's
an actual roster

550
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,030
of who stays with Dad
and when, and I'm not on it?

551
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,800
Frankly, AJ, I didn't think
you'd be interested.

552
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,340
I was sick and I've
been trying to study,

553
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,440
which is what everybody's usually
hassling me about 24/7.

554
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,770
I guess there always
has to be something, right?

555
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,210
Come here
and sit down, okay?

556
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,380
"Studying. "
He goes clubbing in New York.

557
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,420
Well you cut him too much slack.
You still protect him.

558
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,560
I know he avoids Tony because he
can't face seeing him like this.

559
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,960
- It frightens him.
- It frightens everybody.

560
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,070
He should get a pass?
You know kids his age

561
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,000
are getting blown up
in Iraq.

562
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,260
You know something
that's interesting? Janice noticed

563
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,900
that when AJ talks about Tony's
possibly not coming out of this,

564
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,370
he can't even use
the word "dad. "

565
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,010
He says "Anthony Soprano
is not going to die. "

566
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,640
Well, that's a fascinating
psychological nugget,

567
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,380
but it don't change the fact

568
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,710
that if that kid
don't pull his end in this,

569
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,450
he's never going to forgive
himself and nobody else should either.

570
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:30,560
It's just that Tony has
always loomed so large for AJ.

571
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,960
Well maybe it's just that AJ is a
selfish boy who doesn't give a shit.

572
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
I'm sorry your son
is no longer with us

573
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,400
but don't use mine as a guinea pig
for your ideas on parenting.

574
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,400
I never saw you
take a hard line.

575
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,130
Why do you think I'm talking
to you like this?

576
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,980
The thing is,
Tony has an open incision.

577
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,620
If you are there in the room
and they change the dressing,

578
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,390
it's very hard to take.

579
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,690
And I don't know
that AJ should see that.

580
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,070
Hey!

581
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,140
Get the fuck
off the property!

582
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,290
Hey! I warned you yesterday.
The curb line is your limit.

583
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,020
I know.
I know you hate it.

584
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,190
I'm not going to tell
you what to do, Finn.

585
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,030
How would you describe your husband's
relationship with his uncle?

586
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,130
Were they close?

587
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,240
You know of any issue
they might have been having?

588
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,930
I don't speak with Junior.
I haven't for years.

589
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,240
My husband knows how I feel
and he never brought him up.

590
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,280
What was
your conflict about?

591
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,680
It's not something
I'm going to discuss with you.

592
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,050
Your husband ever talk about
Junior Soprano's mental state?

593
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,250
You're flying
full-fare coach?

594
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,260
I did hear him
telling other people

595
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,090
how Junior was getting
more and more confused--

596
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,130
calling my husband Johnny,
which was his father's name;

597
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,320
resisting getting a haircut,
that kind of thing.

598
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,600
You spoke with your husband
what time of the night of the incident?

599
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,170
- I-- I don't know.
- I'm not bailing.

600
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,930
Meadow, could you?

601
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,080
- I'm just trying to understand.
- Understand what?

602
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,540
You're coming out from California
to support me with my father being shot

603
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,710
or because dental school
is just sucking for you.

604
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,440
Both.
ls that so awful?

605
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,390
If you have any more questions
you're going to have to call my lawyer.

606
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,020
When he was taken
into custody,

607
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,530
Junior made
pointed references

608
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,760
to the McGuire Sisters,
Sam Giancana.

609
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,870
- You mean the Kennedy assassination?
- Yeah.

610
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,440
You mean
as related to this?

611
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,940
- I had to ask.
- My husband was three years old.

612
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,890
Oh, I could sleep
right here.

613
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,320
It's all right.
He'll be okay.

614
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,600
The Shelby GT 500?
450 horsepower.

615
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,230
Oh baby, and this guy
on campus has one?

616
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,540
And the Mustang's not
as expensive as the M3

617
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,300
I used to talk about
getting all the time.

618
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,280
Jennifer, another round
when you get your chance.

619
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,890
Chris!

620
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,590
Oh, Ahmed.
You guys here again?

621
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,760
You ought to put up a tent
on this fucking bar.

622
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,570
How's Tony?
The girl said he was hurt pretty bad?

623
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,710
- He's keeping his dick up.
- His uncle did this to him?

624
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,570
I was saying to Muhammad,
why the hell--

625
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,210
Not something
we talk about.

626
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,110
Please, give Tony our best
when you talk to him.

627
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,650
I will.

628
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,960
Hey, Dad?

629
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm going to get
Uncle Junior for this.

630
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,140
Don't worry.

631
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,270
I watched since I was little
how nice you were to him.

632
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,250
And he doesn't just get
to do this to you,

633
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,510
put you in here
and get away with it.

634
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,990
You're my dad.

635
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,360
And I'm going to put a bullet
in his fucking mummy head.

636
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,630
I promise.

637
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,740
I can't believe
we're not going to like,

638
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,900
do stuff together again.

639
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,730
'Cause we will.

640
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,780
I'm positive.

641
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,940
Hey.

642
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,820
Hey.

643
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,360
How's he doing?

644
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,900
Hi, Dad.

645
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:56,370
The doctor knows.

646
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,510
The Chinese guy.

647
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,130
He's calling the other guy to get
permission to change the medications.

648
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,610
I'll stay if you want
to pee or anything.

649
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,690
Hi.
How's he doing?

650
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,090
They didn't come back
with the fever medicine yet.

651
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,630
I'm so proud of you, AJ.

652
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,530
You can't imagine how much
this means to your father.

653
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,230
Who knows what it means?
He just lies there.

654
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,900
Well, it means a lot to me then,
how about that?

655
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,340
Thank you for doing it.
You've helped your family tremendously.

656
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,680
I flunked out of school.

657
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,120
I ended up with a 1.4
for the quarter

658
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,020
and the freshman dean said
there was no point in coming back.

659
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,250
- With your father in a coma--
- I didn't tell Dad.

660
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,690
- Be positive, everybody said.
- My God.

661
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,360
I tried really hard
in philosophy,

662
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,760
- but that professor--
- With your father in a coma!

663
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,900
Go have breakfast.

664
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,710
Anthony.

665
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,150
Anthony, can you
hear us?
