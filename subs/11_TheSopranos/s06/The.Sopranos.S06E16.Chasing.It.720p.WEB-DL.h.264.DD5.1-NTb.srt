1
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:46,771
23, red and odd.

2
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:48,306
- No!
- Yes! Motherfucker!

3
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:50,242
Fucking nailed it, T!

4
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:53,011
Jesus, 23. Sophia's
birthday. I shoulda had that.

5
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,747
Got it like five ways there.

6
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,449
Six. He's on red, too.

7
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,252
- You cocksucking motherfucker.
- What happened?

8
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:01,554
- Tony hit one straight up.
- Finally.

9
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,190
66-10 going out.

10
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,058
Dot you spill those.

11
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,461
- You wanna take it or play it?
- Let's play it.

12
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,264
- All right.
- All right, my man.

13
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,299
23 and all around.

14
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,635
- Are you fucking kidding?
- You gotta ride that.

15
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,773
- All right, one more time.
- Come on.

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,341
- Do it again!
- Come on.

17
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,709
- 23.
- Come on, come on.

18
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,045
Come on, bounce.

19
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,047
- Do it again!
- Come on, 23.

20
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,283
- 11.

21
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,585
- Fucking Christ.
- Jeez.

22
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,354
Douchebags are taking
it all back tonight.

23
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,994
What the fuck, vito?
You almost hit me.

24
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:50,305
Timber,
motherfucker!

25
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,178
Stop right there!

26
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:06,688
10:1 odds... Poor boy's delight
and she fucking comes in.

27
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,157
Oof.

28
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:10,793
Look at this mezza-Mort.

29
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,028
Oh, hey.

30
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:15,564
- Sil.
- How are you, baby?

31
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:17,533
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,468
Sit down.

33
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:21,604
Can I get you something?
A coffee or a bun?

34
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,941
I'll let you two talk.

35
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:27,776
So.

36
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:30,312
I really appreciate
you letting me see you.

37
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:34,149
And you've been so decent about
everything since vito death.

38
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:39,189
I just don't know who else...

39
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,925
All right, all right.
Come on, Marie.

40
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,661
- What can I do?
- It's little v.

41
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:47,397
The social worker says
he's just acting out.

42
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:57,374
Although some of what he's being
accused of is just persecution.

43
00:03:57,441 --> 00:04:00,845
Ey claim that he hung the petruzzo's
cat on their garage door...

44
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,315
...but it's
totally unfounded.

45
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:06,217
- Well, you know, in a way,

46
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:08,519
It's to be expected,
with vito passing

47
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:10,488
And all that
that entrailed.

48
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:13,124
I think the only solution
is to move away

49
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:15,826
From that house
and the kids at school.

50
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:19,964
I figured it out,

51
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:22,066
And I know it's a lot,

52
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,970
But for $100,000,

53
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:28,874
We can be someplace where no
one knows him or what happened.

54
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:32,611
My friend cheryl lives
in orono, maine,

55
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:34,680
By the university.

56
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:37,049
And there is
this two-Story cape,

57
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,251
With solid schools.

58
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:42,855
You always said if there's
anything you could do...

59
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,525
Sure.

60
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,630
Have you talked
to his uncle?

61
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:52,465
- Who?
- Phil.

62
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:55,702
Phil's not his uncle.
Him and I are second cousins.

63
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:58,171
Before we get
too drastic here

64
00:04:58,238 --> 00:05:01,074
And uproot little vito
and all of you

65
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:03,309
From your friends
and your family,

66
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:06,446
- I should talk to him.
- He's impossible to talk to.

67
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:09,883
It's not easy
to substitute for a dad.

68
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:12,118
I know.

69
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,123
But maybe I can
fill in here.

70
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:21,128
Okay, but you'll
think about it?

71
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,899
Believe me, I'm gonna take care
of you, and he's gonna be okay.

72
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,170
Well...

73
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:32,973
Apparently vito jr.'S
a whack job.

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,976
No surprise there.
Family history?

75
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:39,580
She wants $100,000
for a change of scenery.

76
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:41,516
That never works.

77
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,151
She should get him a dog.

78
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:45,320
I don't think
that's a good idea.

79
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:53,828
The point is how the fuck
is this my problem?

80
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,831
Hmm? Because I'm the boss of the family?

81
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,101
Where the fuck
is phil leotardo?

82
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:03,672
He created the situation
by clipping vito to begin with.

83
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,042
My best fucking earner.

84
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:09,879
Now second time around
I'm getting my pocket picked.

85
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:13,950
Not to mention
he's his uncle

86
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:15,885
Or cousin
or whatever the fuck.

87
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:18,387
Not your problem.
I agree.

88
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,626
I agree, jim.

89
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:25,695
I argued against
the on-Side kick.

90
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,930
Let's face it,
they rarely work.

91
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:30,567
Yet here they are, the
overworked bucs d falling apart

92
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:32,169
As the bills,
with that play,

93
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:33,971
Are inside the 30
and loaded for goal.

94
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,772
- Let's go. Come on, come on.
- Just watch.

95
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:38,375
- Bills get another seven.
- You think?

96
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:41,712
- Nah, I say a quick field goal wins it.
- Absolutely.

97
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:45,315
They'll choke. That's what they
do. You got buffalo, right, t?

98
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:47,217
No, line is three.
I'll settle for a push.

99
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,453
Buffalo!
Fucking go for it!

100
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:54,359
Third and two, the snap.
Losman's back, he hands it off...

101
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:56,594
- Fumble! Ball is
with him.

102
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:58,997
Buffalo recovers.

103
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:02,033
- No!
- Fumbled again!

104
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,568
Get him!
Come on!

105
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:04,869
Oho.
Oh, boy.

106
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:06,571
Get him!

107
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,442
Buffalo scor
as time expires.

108
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,378
Un-Fucking-Believable.

109
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,446
Buffalo!
Fucking-A!

110
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,019
Listen to this fucking guy.
Probably won $35 down there.

111
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:22,121
Buffalo 28,

112
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:23,722
Tampa bay 24.

113
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,358
Skip, another beer?

114
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:31,630
No, I'm gonna
go take a snooze.

115
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,626
Beautiful, sweetheart.

116
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,531
Nancy sinatra,
everybody.

117
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:43,205
- Congratulations, philly.
- Thank you.

118
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,773
We were gonna go
the festival route,

119
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,242
But I think we found a guy who
wants to distribute it himself,

120
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:49,077
So, well, we'll see
what happens.

121
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:50,913
It's a good little movie.

122
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,749
- All right.
- I'll talk to you.

123
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:56,885
Jesus Christ,
it's 11:30.

124
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,755
Ready to call it?

125
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,924
An hour ago.

126
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,929
I saw him bring dean
and jerry back together.

127
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,964
I was there
at the telethon.

128
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:10,166
I cried.

129
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,535
You leaving already?

130
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:14,470
Yeah, it's late.

131
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:17,240
Got a long hike
to jersey from here.

132
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,475
Sure, I used
to drive it myself.

133
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,345
No more, though.

134
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,682
I'll be right back.

135
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,753
Congratulations again.

136
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,323
Listeni gotta
bring this up.

137
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:35,726
- A favor already?
- Excuse me?

138
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:38,829
Thony, you always have
business on your mind.

139
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,232
Take a night,
smell the cognac.

140
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,500
Marie Spatafore came
to see me.

141
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,502
She wants $100,000
to relocate

142
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:49,039
On account of vito jr. Already
has hiown social worker.

143
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,176
Patty told me
there was doings.

144
00:09:51,243 --> 00:09:54,012
I guess the turd doesn't
fall far from the faggot's ass.

145
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:55,847
That's beautifully put,

146
00:09:55,914 --> 00:09:59,417
But you're family, right?
Cousins?

147
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:01,686
What can you do?
Throw money at the problem?

148
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:03,855
Well, somebody's gonna.

149
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,226
I'll talk to the kid,

150
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:11,129
- Set him right.
- Good.

151
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:12,631
You two going
home together?

152
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,704
How the fuck are you?

153
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:21,173
Fucking prostate keeping
me pissing all night.

154
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,609
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

155
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:28,915
Nu?

156
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:38,858
I talked to phil about the
split on the mri centers.

157
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,661
Your cut is on the way.

158
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,296
So is Christmas.

159
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:45,232
You should have
heard him tonight.

160
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,135
- Comments, smug.
- Really?

161
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,370
Worries me.

162
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:52,839
I thought we were getting
along pretty good finally,

163
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:54,942
You know,
considering.

164
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:57,010
Could be t hubris,
making boss.

165
00:10:57,077 --> 00:10:59,813
But I still think it's what
went down with his brother Billy.

166
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,582
I thought all that
got buried with your cousin.

167
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,519
- Eh.
- You enjoy the dinner?

168
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:07,388
- I left right after.
- Oh yeah?

169
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:11,359
I don't know.

170
00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:13,194
I look at my key guys...

171
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:15,463
Paulie, Christopher,

172
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,533
My brother-In-Law... What's
number one on their agenda?

173
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:23,671
They're all fucking murderers,
for Christ's sake.

174
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:26,875
Lonely at the top,
boychik?

175
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:29,311
What I'm trying
to say is...

176
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:32,047
It's nice being here.

177
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:34,049
Always is.

178
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:39,588
Oh!

179
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:41,590
I brought you something.

180
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,930
Cover up that dome.

181
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:53,002
Actually, I was
expecting something else.

182
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:55,639
What, the fucking dvd?

183
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,674
Honestly, it's a very
unflattering portrait

184
00:11:57,741 --> 00:11:59,976
Of italian-Americans.

185
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:03,280
No, I was thinking maybe some
of the $200,000 I loaned you?

186
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:06,783
Oh, jesus.
Yeah, that's right.

187
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,419
I know it's covered. It's just
after a while with no vig...

188
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:11,421
You know,
I lost track.

189
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:14,457
I'm glad you didn't.

190
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,326
- I don't wanna be a stickler.
- No.

191
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:19,096
Anthony, come on. No,
it's okay. It's okay.

192
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,601
I got about $3,000 here.
Point and a half good?

193
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:25,770
- No, come on, fuck this.
- You gotta have it.

194
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:28,739
- Don't want you eating cat food.
- Come on, stop it.

195
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:31,609
I don't gotta have it. I
don't want a vig from you.

196
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:33,411
No, come on.

197
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,613
I should have been on it.

198
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,920
- You sure?
- Jesus Christ, are we good or what?

199
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:45,624
Well, it's late.

200
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:47,659
I should be getting back.

201
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,796
You should get back to
pissing, or whatever.

202
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,704
I lend the guy money.
Suddenly I'm the schmuck.

203
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,740
Why does he need
your money?

204
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,810
Why?
To cover his nut.

205
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:07,479
Between his gambling
and the lifestyle,

206
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,382
And that boat...

207
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:12,285
$3.2 mil.
I warned him.

208
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:15,221
It has absolutely
no resale value whatsoever.

209
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:17,223
Does he listen?
Heh.

210
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:23,463
I've lent lots of money.

211
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:26,332
Once the chiseling starts...
"ooh, I forgot."

212
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,334
Who forgets?
Fuck him.

213
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:31,938
This is why I don't like you seeing
him before bed. You're all upset.

214
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:35,142
Makes a big show
of giving me a vig.

215
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:38,512
$3,000 a week.

216
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:48,289
You got a lot of jews
in your business, right?

217
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,190
My business?

218
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:52,793
Yeah, this.

219
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,697
You gotta hand it to them,
when it comes to money...

220
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:59,100
In my experience,

221
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,871
- That's nothing more than an ugly stereotype.
- Really?

222
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,409
I got a friend, let me tell
you, you tie a krugerrand

223
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:09,978
To a fishing line,
you're gonna land him.

224
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:11,780
Right up on the dock.

225
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:15,183
Doesn't sound like you
think of him as a friend.

226
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,753
Come on.
We go way back.

227
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:24,226
But that didn't stop him from busting my
fucking balls because I owe him some money.

228
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,133
Anyway, I needed
a little bridge loan

229
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,436
To cover some of the gambling
losses we've been talking about.

230
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:36,672
- Still?
- You know, good money after bad.

231
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,876
- Why not just stop?
- Big part of my life.

232
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:42,311
I know, but you've been
talking about it a lot.

233
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:44,614
Well, you lose sometimes.

234
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,151
You gotta act like it hurts
a little more than it does,

235
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:49,987
Yoknow,
for your guys.

236
00:14:52,055 --> 00:14:54,758
But if you're gonna lose,
what's the fucking point, huh?

237
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:57,094
So you need the risk.

238
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,096
What are you chasing?

239
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:01,598
Money or a high
from winning?

240
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:09,273
Before we end,

241
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:11,542
There's something
I need to bring up.

242
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:16,347
You miss a lot
of appointments.

243
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:19,717
Excuse me, I always give you the
required notice or I pay forhe hour.

244
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:22,287
- That's not my point.
- Well, I get busy.

245
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:25,456
It's my fault. I've
condoned it for a long time.

246
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:28,560
I haven't had
a panic attack

247
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:30,728
Since my uncle shot me.

248
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,064
- Did you notice that?
- Yes.

249
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:37,435
Well, it must be nice
to know everything.

250
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,606
Is that the only reason
why you're here?

251
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,107
The panic attacks?

252
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,210
No.

253
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,148
This is an...

254
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:52,384
Oasis in my week.

255
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,653
So this is vacation?

256
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,423
No, I benefit
in many ways.

257
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,125
Decide if you wanna
keep coming,

258
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,462
But know there are protocols
that have to be followed

259
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,099
Or I won't be able
to continue.

260
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,337
Okay, I will.

261
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:21,581
Now, I know brian wants
the media room downstairs,

262
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,784
But I think it's better if
the gym has access to the pool.

263
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:28,022
That's the inspector.

264
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,324
I told the guy to run
cable for computers,

265
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:33,127
But I can't promise the damn
thing is not already obsolete.

266
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:35,763
- Hi, how are you?
- Ted yackinelli, yackinelli home inspections.

267
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,066
Yeah, come on in. These are
our cousins, hugh and Carmela.

268
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,768
- How are you doing?
- They're also the builders.

269
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,803
Oh great.

270
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,605
Wanna start over here?

271
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,574
Yeah.

272
00:17:04,593 --> 00:17:07,195
You know, I didn't come out here
just to buy you a couple of sundaes.

273
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:09,698
It's a silo.

274
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,567
I don't give a fuck
what it is.

275
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,635
What the hell
is wrong with you?

276
00:17:13,702 --> 00:17:16,638
You look like a puerto rican
whore. You make me sick.

277
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:18,908
So? What's it gotta do with you?

278
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:21,778
Listen, pally,
you need to be rebellious.

279
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:24,781
I raised kids.
I get it.

280
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,916
- Good for you.
- You want a smack too?

281
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:29,819
You ever tnk what this
is doing to your mother,

282
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:33,289
What she's been through,
how you're upsetting her?

283
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,891
She's just embarrassed.

284
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:37,427
She cries for you.

285
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:41,364
I'm gonna say this because
you're old enough to understan

286
00:17:41,432 --> 00:17:43,934
Your family's had
enough shame.

287
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:45,669
You should
set things right.

288
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:50,507
- You understand me?
- No.

289
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:53,510
Jesus Christ.
Be a man.

290
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:56,847
Be the kind of man she
needs... Strong, masculine.

291
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,687
I said my piece.

292
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:09,394
Finish that thing. There's
no eating in the car.

293
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:15,166
I would like to take a minute
for everybody to enjoy the fact

294
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,035
That your mother
has sold her house.

295
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:20,138
- Oh my God, that's fantastic.
- Congratulations, mom.

296
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:23,074
- That's so good.
- Well, actually, it just passed inspection.

297
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:25,243
Brian needs to get
loan approval before we can...

298
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,978
All right,
all right, enough.

299
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:30,215
Congratulations, Carm. It's not
an easy thing to do these days.

300
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:32,417
I had a lot of support.

301
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,957
- Brian and janine must be so happy.
- I hope so.

302
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:40,393
Just the two?
It's big, right?

303
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:41,928
It's a mansion.

304
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:43,930
Pass the salad.

305
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:46,666
They have a baby
on the way.

306
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:59,246
- Hello?
- Have you looked outside?

307
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:05,219
Oh, jesus, mellie.

308
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:07,187
We replaced 60%,

309
00:19:07,254 --> 00:19:10,357
50% of the bad lumber
with doug fir.

310
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:12,159
What about the studs?

311
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:15,195
And ose headers upstairs?
I'm nauseous.

312
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:17,231
Oh, for the 100th time,

313
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:20,367
I've done a ton of houses
using the same construction

314
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:23,770
Before these sob sisters took
over the building department

315
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:27,475
And I'm not
losing any sleep.

316
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,216
Lunch.

317
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:39,053
- Mortadell' and provolone.
- That's chrissy.

318
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:45,426
Ho, the sterious stranger.

319
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:47,362
- Hey.
- Long time.

320
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:51,066
- Sit.
- I had to drop eli off at physical therapy.

321
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,202
I thought I would check in
on the brain trust here.

322
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:56,538
- Asett', play a hand.
- Yeah, don't be shy, shylock.

323
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:59,842
I got a little time.
Why not?

324
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,744
"Vy not," he says.

325
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,480
Did you hear the one
about the jewish terrorist?

326
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:07,483
He was gonna hijack a plane, but
he didn't wanna use his miles.

327
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,754
- You want a sandwich?
- No, I just ate, thanks.

328
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,292
He's not here to eat.

329
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:19,429
He's here for the rent.
The rent, the rent.

330
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:22,198
What are you talking about?

331
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,867
You know what?
I'll have a beer.

332
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:26,670
- Here you go.
- Will you stop already?

333
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:28,471
That should get me through
another week, right?

334
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:32,876
I got some
spare change here too.

335
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:39,850
It's a joke.

336
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,118
Where's that sense
of humor?

337
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:45,056
You should put this
in the pot,

338
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:47,792
- Make things interesting.
- I'll taka shot at that.

339
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:51,028
- Let's play.
- Let's see it.

340
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:53,130
Are you sure
you did it right?

341
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:56,434
Yes, and it's normal.
Maybe it was the kung pao.

342
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,869
- Get me a drink.
- Sure, alcohol,

343
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:02,473
That's good for it.
Get one yourself.

344
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,410
It's not the fucking msg.
It's Tony Soprano.

345
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:09,248
You know, he really helped
when I was in the hoital.

346
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:11,883
- Never lend friends money, eli.
- He still won't pay?

347
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,119
That's the least of it.

348
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,154
He's all worked up
or something.

349
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:19,658
I don't like the way he
talks. Thathostile remarks.It.

350
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:23,395
It's not like him.
Makes me worry.

351
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:26,431
Yeah, I can see that.
What are you thinking?

352
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:29,369
- Hmm.
- Come on.

353
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:31,604
Tony's not gonna hurt you.

354
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:35,074
You've seen how
these italians work.

355
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,644
For the most part,
it's okay.

356
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:39,479
Get them cornered,

357
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:42,148
You're dealing with
nothing more than an animal.

358
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:44,350
What, you think he's
going to kill you now?

359
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:46,519
I don't fucking know.

360
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:50,690
He's the guy I call to
deal with people like him.

361
00:21:50,757 --> 00:21:52,191
He's a rich man.
He'll pay.

362
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:53,694
Minus assets?

363
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:56,030
I would say under six.

364
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,766
- Come on, he's a boss.
- I've known him for a long time.

365
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,801
Money goes in one hand
and right out the other.

366
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:02,536
The more he makes,
the more he spends.

367
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:05,506
That wife?

368
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:09,109
Eli, at what point
is it cheaper for him

369
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:11,445
To settle it
another way?

370
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:28,396
- That's three in a row, assholes.
- I'm bumping up here.

371
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:31,032
Thank you, gentlemen.

372
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:34,569
Roger will take care of you
from here on. Enjoy the borgata.

373
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,142
Yeah, right.
Time to go.

374
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:46,449
Yeah, we're up about... S.

375
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,818
18.

376
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:51,854
I could go for a rib eye,
flintstone size.

377
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:54,156
No kidding.
What, because I'm up?

378
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,679
- Holy shit.
- What?

379
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:17,848
Batavia in the fifth.
Two to one.

380
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:20,884
Meadow gold in the fifth.

381
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:24,154
We gotta do that.

382
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:26,189
Three minutes to post.

383
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,627
- Glenlivet rocks.
- Seven and seven.

384
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:32,195
What do you have on tap?

385
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:34,632
Give him a beer,
anything.

386
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:38,236
Fuck it,
I don't wanna miss this.

387
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:41,039
Batavia...
Here we go.

388
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:44,375
- Where's the Goddamn sound?
- The boss put $18,000 plus on this.

389
00:23:44,442 --> 00:23:47,645
- Maybe $25,000.
- Yeah?

390
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:50,715
What the fuck's
your problem?

391
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:53,585
Nothing, I'm excited.
What do you want?

392
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:55,653
All right,
they're running here.

393
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,221
Where's the fucking sound?

394
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:58,991
- It's on, ton'.

395
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,559
Go, girl!

396
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:01,927
- Go, you fucking nag.
- Go!

397
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:05,898
There you go.

398
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:07,766
- Come on, baby.
- She's in the lead!

399
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:10,436
- She's in the lead, come on.
- Come on, go, girl!

400
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:15,708
Go go go!

401
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:18,510
That a girl!
Go go go!

402
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:22,281
Rounding the turn,
swelligant, Meadow gold, mestizo...

403
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:25,685
Kir royale and smoosh
baby falling back.

404
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:27,821
It's swelligant
and Meadow gold.

405
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:30,023
- Come on, mead!
- Kir royale on the outside.

406
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,259
Swelligant
and Meadow gold...

407
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:33,693
- Swelligant and Meadow gold...
- Fucking go!

408
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,962
And it's swelligant
by a nose.

409
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:38,531
Meadow gold to place,

410
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:40,267
Kir royale
rounding out the top.

411
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:44,371
Mestizo, smoosh baby
in the five ot.

412
00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:57,184
- By a cunt hair, Tony.
- Heartbreaker.

413
00:24:57,251 --> 00:25:00,521
What are you
gonna do, huh?

414
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:03,124
Madam, your desert.

415
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,027
- I didn't order nothing.
- I ordered for you.

416
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:09,297
You know I'm trying
to watch my weight.

417
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:13,034
What is this?

418
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:16,805
Oh my God.
Anthony?

419
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:20,242
- You like it?
- It's gorgeous.

420
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:23,412
I don't know
what to say.

421
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:25,914
Look, I know you're
scared, okay?

422
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:29,818
All the problems you had with
hector's dad... I'm not like that.

423
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:32,554
I know.
It's not just that.

424
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:35,190
Well, what then?
I'm gonna work my ass off.

425
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:38,060
You know I'll always
take care of guys.

426
00:25:38,094 --> 00:25:40,430
In three months I made night
manager of the pizzeria.

427
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:42,999
In another three I'll be in
charge of the day shifts too.

428
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:46,703
A couple years, I'll own a
chain of restaurants, clubs.

429
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:48,972
You'll never
have to work again.

430
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,277
- Look, I love you.
- I love you too.

431
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,946
So marry me then.
And we'll have kids.

432
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:00,583
You always say you want hector
to have brothers and sisters.

433
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:07,725
Okay.

434
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:22,706
Can I get you some coffee?

435
00:26:22,806 --> 00:26:25,743
No, I think it's time
for our talk here.

436
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,816
So what happened
at school today?

437
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,585
I get blamed
for everything.

438
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:36,154
The girl was
developmentally disabled.

439
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,492
Uncle Phil said
he talked to you.

440
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:43,061
Is he just wasting
his breath?

441
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:45,096
Is that what
you're telling us?

442
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,835
This trouble you're causing...

443
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:53,471
M very disappointed, because
you always were a good kid.

444
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:56,576
- You don't even know me.
- What is that supposed to mean?

445
00:26:56,642 --> 00:26:58,678
Sometimes you call me
"carlo jr."

446
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:03,516
Look, all I know is that I couldn't shut
your dad up about what a good kid you were.

447
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:06,419
- We were friends, you know.
- Butt buddies?

448
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:09,355
Oh, you're being funny.

449
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:11,424
That's good.

450
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:18,431
'Cause I'm sure
you miss him a lot,

451
00:27:21,702 --> 00:27:23,770
Whatever he was.

452
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:31,211
And now I wanna
say some things.

453
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,815
- You're gonna look at me.
- I'm not moving to fucking maine!

454
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,554
You know how much that's
gonna cost... Y your mother?At?

455
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:42,222
- Whatever.
- Listen to me.

456
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:44,292
Okay, I'm not some
fucking social worker.

457
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,160
Now you knock
this weird shit off,

458
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:47,795
Or I'll introduce you
to a plate-Glass window.

459
00:27:47,862 --> 00:27:50,531
Somebody should have told my
dad to knock off the weird shit.

460
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:52,967
You go about
in pity for yourself.

461
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:54,903
What about your mother? What
about what she's been through?

462
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:57,272
What am I supposed
to do about it?

463
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:12,655
Look, your dad's gone, okay?
You're the man of the house now.

464
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:15,557
Start fucking
acting like it.

465
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:17,459
You get me?

466
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,887
Well, I just got back
from the closing.

467
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:45,922
Come here!

468
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:52,228
We should pop
the champagne,

469
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:54,731
- Or I don't know, go out or something.
- Maybe, I don't know.

470
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:56,933
- Why not?
- You know why not, Tony.

471
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,704
- It's upsetting, this whole thing.
- Jesus, the lumber again?

472
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,241
Carmela, your cousin brian has
fucked over a lot of people.

473
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:05,476
Trust me.

474
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:08,012
So how much in the end?
All in?

475
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,315
Well, after construction,

476
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,484
The purchase of the land,

477
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,053
Closing costs, it must be close to six.

478
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,289
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

479
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:20,992
You know what
you should do?

480
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,494
You should take a chunk of
that and put it on the jets.

481
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,731
Oh yes,
very funny.

482
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,634
- I'm serious. We can't get hurt.
- Oh, "we" now?

483
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,169
It's a sure thing.
Celia, she works at the bing,

484
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,839
She's got a sister
lives in san die,

485
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,175
She's an osteopath, and she
says that the charger's qb

486
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,812
Has a hairline fracture
in his right leg.

487
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:43,248
And even vegas
doesknow about it.

488
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,685
I didn't say all of it.

489
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,688
You know, just
a piece of my half.

490
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:54,294
You're rich, Tony. Use some
of those bundles to cover it.

491
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,930
That money's for emergencies
only, Carm, you know that.

492
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,265
And my other money's tied up
in asset allocation.

493
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:00,867
What is that?

494
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:04,771
Listen to me, okay?
This is the gravy.

495
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,639
Windfall cash.

496
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:10,176
This is the kind of
shit you play with.

497
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:13,813
I... I'm telling you.
We are golden here.

498
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,228
Ah, listen, listen.

499
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:31,465
Forget it.

500
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:33,834
I shouldn't
have mentioned it.

501
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:36,870
I mean it.

502
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:40,408
It's all right, it'st
I thought this was my money.

503
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,477
You're right.

504
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:43,745
You're right.

505
00:30:57,592 --> 00:30:58,860
Renata?

506
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:01,496
What?

507
00:31:01,564 --> 00:31:03,933
- Go to the bedroom and lock the door.
- What's going on?

508
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:06,168
Do as I ask.

509
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,912
What are you doing here?

510
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:17,346
Nice to see you, too.

511
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:20,516
Oh, I was watching cnn.
Fucking hezbollah.

512
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:23,085
Ah, we're running down
to the boat show in edison.

513
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:25,121
- Thought you might want to join?
- I'd love to.

514
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:28,257
Buenata's got
a migraine.

515
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:29,459
That's too bad.

516
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:35,732
The vig. Three grands.
Should put us up to date.

517
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,769
Listen, I can't take this. Give
it all to me whenever you can.

518
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:41,805
- You're gonna do thvery time?
- Whatever you say.

519
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,108
Sit down.
Have a drink.

520
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:46,276
We should get going,
probably.

521
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:48,412
Okay.
But next time.

522
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:49,646
For sure.

523
00:31:49,713 --> 00:31:53,383
Yeah, next time
I'll call first.

524
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:07,231
Did you see that
pissy attitude?

525
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:09,000
Come all the way out here
to pick him up...

526
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:13,838
Not to mention give him
his fucking vig in person.

527
00:32:14,872 --> 00:32:16,774
I mean, you believe
this fucking guy?

528
00:32:16,842 --> 00:32:19,912
Should tell him to go
fuck himself and his 200k.

529
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:24,350
What's he gonna do
about it?

530
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:31,724
To not pay my debts?
Head of the family?

531
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,092
How's that gonna look?

532
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:34,793
Who's gonna know?

533
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:38,731
It's like eddie valentine.

534
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:40,432
That guy from Philly?

535
00:32:40,532 --> 00:32:43,335
With the polio leg and
the built-Up shoe?

536
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:45,005
No, from the fuckin'
"twilight zone."

537
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:46,439
You must have
seen that one.

538
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,341
He's a small-Time hood,
he gets shot...

539
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,444
Maybe you should start suckin'
cock instead of watching tv land,

540
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,547
'Cause vito brought in three
times what you do on construction.

541
00:32:55,815 --> 00:32:56,883
Yeah.

542
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:02,889
And I didn't have
this fuckin' problem.

543
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:14,635
God fuckin' damn it!

544
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:16,671
What?

545
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:23,010
That's good, right?

546
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:25,680
No.
I only bet 10.

547
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:27,682
- But you won.
- What did I say?

548
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:29,684
Huh, what did I tell you?
It's a sure thing.

549
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,986
You talk about this crap
like it's science, Tony.

550
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:33,922
I lost a lot of
fuckin' money.

551
00:33:33,989 --> 00:33:36,058
You didn't lose.

552
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:39,428
We could have turned your bullshit
into a fuckin' million dollars.

553
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:40,829
My "bullshit"?

554
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,332
That spec house was
my investment.

555
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:45,834
- For my future!
- Here we go.

556
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,270
Ginny sack had to move in with
her fucking daughter, Tony

557
00:33:48,337 --> 00:33:50,272
Again with ginny sack, huh?

558
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:54,076
John provided.
She's a fuckin' hysteric.

559
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:56,979
Did you ever think I
might know what I'm doing?

560
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:01,784
You and the furniture
and the clothes and the cars.

561
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:04,120
You would have spent
everything I made! If I let you.

562
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:06,956
You know what? The next time
you win, I'll take a cut,

563
00:34:07,023 --> 00:34:08,558
And I'll roll
the fuckin' dice.

564
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:11,127
You already took your cut,
from the bird feeder.

565
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:14,163
And don't fuckin'
deny it again.

566
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,132
What? 40 grand in
the stock market?

567
00:34:17,634 --> 00:34:20,169
I'd ask for my piece,
but wait, there's nothing.

568
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,479
D that spec house?
I made the down payment.

569
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:31,148
I bought the materials. I
leaned on that building inspector

570
00:34:31,248 --> 00:34:32,783
When you had your
thumb up your ass!

571
00:34:32,816 --> 00:34:34,718
So stop talking about
your money!

572
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:36,720
Let go of me,
you piece of shit!

573
00:34:36,787 --> 00:34:39,523
Fact is you're a shitty businesswoman
who built a piece-Of-Shit house

574
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,226
That's gonna cave in and
kill that fucking unborn baby

575
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:44,094
Any day!

576
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:46,330
And now
you can't sleep.

577
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,835
Go fuck yourself!

578
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:54,172
When I'm gone, you can live in a
fuckin' dumpster for all I care.

579
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,455
I was so... I told you, dude.

580
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:13,425
At three-Point range, there's no
way the ball would hit the rim.

581
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:14,694
That was the worst pass.

582
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,195
Get lost.

583
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:25,504
Hey, nobody drop the soap.
Spaz-A-Fuckwit's in the house.

584
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:28,474
Hey, you can see
his pussy.

585
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:31,611
What the fuck you
lookin' at, fag?

586
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:45,592
- What the fuck?
- He st.

587
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:46,994
Oh!

588
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,730
- Oh God!
- Jesus, what's wrong with you?

589
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:50,897
He stepped in it!

590
00:35:50,964 --> 00:35:52,799
- Ah!
- Gross!

591
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:55,269
- He shit in the fucking shower!

592
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:57,070
Are you crazy?

593
00:35:57,137 --> 00:36:00,874
Cocksucker's corvair monza
is still in his garage,

594
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:02,342
So we boost
the piece of shit.

595
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,512
We're heading down
communipaw avenue,

596
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,347
And the fuckin' thing
starts to do-Si-Do...

597
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,982
You get word on
the power tools?

598
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:12,353
What? Yeah. Spics in florida
sending the first truck friday.

599
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,056
- How about alphonse at the hardware store?
- Ready for the whole load.

600
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:18,726
Speaking of loads...
Hear the latest on vito jr.?

601
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:20,795
- What?
- Marie called. He got expelled

602
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:22,897
'Cause he took a shit
in the shower in gym class.

603
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:25,900
- Oh.
- That sick little fuck.

604
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,769
You should see him...
The makeup.

605
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:31,040
And without school, Marie says
he's shut in his room all day.

606
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,342
Probably thinkin' about how
to pull a columbine.

607
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:34,543
Ha.

608
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:38,047
But the little girl...

609
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,715
Francesca.

610
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:42,184
Dad's gone.
Brother's a psycho,

611
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:44,920
Mother's a basket case.
She's nine years old.

612
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,755
What the fuck did
she ever do?

613
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:48,057
Tragedy.

614
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:51,293
Like a pebble in a lake.
Even the fish feel it.

615
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:56,299
It's not right.

616
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:59,736
Vito was one of us.

617
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,639
So he sucked a cock. Prior
to that, he was our friend.

618
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:04,474
Can't just cut
his family loose.

619
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:08,445
That piece of shit, Phil,
he's never gonna pony up.

620
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:12,248
I will never forget that he
didn't come through here.

621
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:14,651
- Never.
- Let it go, ton'.

622
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:18,656
This is good of you, ton',
helping Marie.

623
00:37:18,723 --> 00:37:21,359
I'll always
remember it.

624
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:25,263
All right, let's go.
I gotta swing by slava's,

625
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:28,099
Liquefy some
offshore monies.

626
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,487
Yeah, dude.
Vamos al latino day parade.

627
00:37:48,553 --> 00:37:50,922
- Padre.
- Yeah.

628
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:55,494
Hey, jesus,
you got outta work early.

629
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,930
I need to talk to you.

630
00:37:59,298 --> 00:38:00,933
What's the matter?

631
00:38:08,074 --> 00:38:10,376
- What's this?
- Your clothes.

632
00:38:10,443 --> 00:38:12,011
I just did laundry
a couple days ago.

633
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:13,546
Not laundry.

634
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:16,316
- Mami!
- No, papi, stay.

635
00:38:16,382 --> 00:38:17,817
What are we doing?
What about the parade?

636
00:38:17,884 --> 00:38:19,285
I'm going
with my brother.

637
00:38:19,352 --> 00:38:21,054
What?

638
00:38:21,154 --> 00:38:23,589
I need to give this
back to you.

639
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:25,325
I can't keep it.

640
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:28,328
Why? I mean,
I love you.

641
00:38:28,394 --> 00:38:31,831
I love you, too,
Anthony.

642
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:37,671
Look, I don't know.
Maybe I don't.

643
00:38:39,473 --> 00:38:42,343
All's I know is
I just don't feel it.

644
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:16,778
You hear about this thing
with the dolphins' kicker?

645
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:19,614
He went under
a whole truck.

646
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:24,453
Yeah, fuckin'
motorcycles, huh?

647
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:28,457
Helmet saved his life.

648
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:33,796
- He out for sunday?
- Maybe the whole season.

649
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:43,039
And the baup kicker?
He's right out of college.

650
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:45,408
- Against Philly.
- Too good to be true.

651
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,480
You know what? I'm gonna put the
whole 100k down on Philadelphia.

652
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:54,084
And if I win, Marie Spatafore
gets her free ride and then some.

653
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,155
Yeah, good for you.

654
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:02,159
'Cause Carlo said the kid went into
the litter box and ate some cat shit.

655
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,428
No, he took a shit,
in the shower.

656
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:07,064
Glad we got that straight.

657
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,432
Hell of a finish.

658
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:11,435
Even tragedy,
unable to stop miami.

659
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:15,006
Miami 21, Philadelphia 7.

660
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:16,874
When you get special-Team
support like that,

661
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:18,676
It makes all the difference.
And also, when you see...

662
00:40:35,026 --> 00:40:37,996
Hey, Marie.
How you holdin' up?

663
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:39,698
He snuck out again
last night.

664
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:41,500
Like I told you,
I want to help.

665
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:44,169
God bless you, Tony, because
I don't know what else to do.

666
00:40:44,203 --> 00:40:45,771
Well, I do.

667
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:48,540
There's this camp in idaho,
and they handle kids like him.

668
00:40:48,607 --> 00:40:49,775
Idaho?

669
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:51,310
You know,
like tough love?

670
00:40:51,377 --> 00:40:52,878
You know?

671
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:54,647
Saw it on tv,
and honestly,

672
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:58,250
I was moved to tears by
some of the success stories.

673
00:40:58,317 --> 00:41:00,953
- It's a camp?
- A school camp.

674
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,321
Tony,

675
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:05,191
They allow corporal
punishment.

676
00:41:05,258 --> 00:41:07,961
His guidance counselor
tolde about those places,

677
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:10,697
And they're in utah
and idaho

678
00:41:10,764 --> 00:41:13,800
Because state law allows
them to strike the kids.

679
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:15,602
But that's just for
the deterrent factor.

680
00:41:15,669 --> 00:41:18,438
Look, it's 18 grand, but I'm
gonna take care of it for you,

681
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:20,140
So don't worry.

682
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:27,447
There's no geographical solution
to an emotional problem, Marie.

683
00:41:27,515 --> 00:41:30,651
Maine, wherever.

684
00:41:33,754 --> 00:41:35,089
Marie?

685
00:41:35,156 --> 00:41:36,724
Yeah?

686
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:38,893
I know it's hard,

687
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,696
But it's the best
thing for him.

688
00:41:41,762 --> 00:41:43,864
Okay?

689
00:41:43,931 --> 00:41:45,333
Thank you, Tony.

690
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,964
Hey, ton', isn't that...
What's-Their-Names,

691
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,899
Used to hang out
at the bing?

692
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,413
- Wake up, vito.
- What?

693
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,416
Vito, my name is steve.
I'm here to help you.

694
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,785
You're gonna come
with us now, all right?

695
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,187
- Come on.
- What?

696
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,755
Come on.

697
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,424
No, let me go!

698
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,693
- Come on. Hey!
- It's all right.

699
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,761
- Let go! Mom, no!
- It's gonna be okay.

700
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:19,464
I'm so sorry, honey.

701
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:20,532
Stop, let me go!

702
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:22,667
It'll be okay!

703
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:25,937
Hey, you have e strong.
You're doing the right thing.

704
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,206
- Who are you?
- Franny, go back to bed.

705
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,208
Mrs. Spatafore, really,
he's gonna be fine.

706
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,344
- Mom!
- I'm sorry, honey.

707
00:43:32,378 --> 00:43:34,447
No! No.

708
00:43:34,513 --> 00:43:36,582
Oh God.

709
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,452
This one coming right
down to the buzzer.

710
00:43:39,518 --> 00:43:42,088
Stackhouse draining
a three-Pointer

711
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:46,058
As time ran out, leading
dallas to a 109 to 108 victory

712
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,160
Over the visiting
san antonio spurs.

713
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:50,830
A sterling effort for sure,
but you really can't...

714
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,572
So what?
We're not speaking now?

715
00:44:00,374 --> 00:44:03,877
Listen, come here.

716
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:08,682
What?

717
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:12,853
Sit down.

718
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:14,921
Come on.

719
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:25,533
I'm sorry.

720
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:29,971
I really am.

721
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:33,107
You did real good
with that house.

722
00:44:34,642 --> 00:44:36,811
And I should know.
I'm in construction.

723
00:44:36,878 --> 00:44:39,347
I'm glad to hear
you approve.

724
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:42,083
I have been losing.

725
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,519
I'm fuckin' losing
right now.

726
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,455
On a shitty streak.

727
00:44:47,523 --> 00:44:50,926
So your solution is to risk
more and make things even worse?

728
00:44:50,993 --> 00:44:53,696
You start chasing it.

729
00:44:53,762 --> 00:44:56,832
And every time you get
your hands around it...

730
00:44:58,233 --> 00:44:59,702
You fall further
backwards.

731
00:44:59,768 --> 00:45:03,038
So this is about money?
'Cause it didn't feel like it.

732
00:45:03,105 --> 00:45:06,575
Carm, I swear to you, you're
not gonna be like ginny.

733
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:08,077
I've been real good
about that,

734
00:45:08,143 --> 00:45:09,979
And frankly, it's not
gonna happen to us.

735
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:13,882
And I hate that you're going around
acting all the time like it will.

736
00:45:17,253 --> 00:45:19,556
I worry, Tony.
I do.

737
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,492
You already got shot.

738
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,328
Now you won't even go down and
get the paper. Who is out there?

739
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:27,297
- Come on...
- What is it?

740
00:45:27,364 --> 00:45:29,099
What are the million
other possibilits?

741
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:30,900
The fbi waiting
to take you away?

742
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:33,436
Right? You eat
and you play,

743
00:45:33,503 --> 00:45:36,072
And you pretend like there's not
a giant piano hanging by a rope

744
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:38,775
Just over the top of your
head every minute of every day.

745
00:45:38,843 --> 00:45:41,245
See, that's it, okay?
I've been thinking about this.

746
00:45:41,312 --> 00:45:45,516
Now, I survived a fuckin'
gunshot wound.

747
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:47,084
What are the odds
on that?

748
00:45:47,151 --> 00:45:48,619
Terrible.

749
00:45:48,686 --> 00:45:51,322
So if you think about it,
big-Picturewise,

750
00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:52,757
I'm up.

751
00:45:52,823 --> 00:45:54,458
What?

752
00:45:54,558 --> 00:45:56,694
Way up.

753
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:05,437
That was me,
not a fireboat.

754
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,240
10:30.

755
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,877
10:30. What would you
like for breakfast? Hmm?

756
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,949
Renata?

757
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:18,517
Renata?

758
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,819
Oh God, no.

759
00:46:20,886 --> 00:46:23,755
Wait wait,
Renata.

760
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:27,592
Renata.

761
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,796
Renata, please,
oh, wait.

762
00:46:29,862 --> 00:46:33,533
- Renata, Renata.
- 911. What is the emergency?

763
00:47:03,964 --> 00:47:06,166
She was a great girl.

764
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:07,701
Thanks.

765
00:47:07,768 --> 00:47:10,671
The best.

766
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:15,943
I...

767
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,444
I brought your money.

768
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:28,823
Sorry for your loss.
