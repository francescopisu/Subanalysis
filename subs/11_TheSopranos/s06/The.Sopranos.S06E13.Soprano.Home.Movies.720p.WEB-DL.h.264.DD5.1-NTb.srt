1
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,835
He's gonna win another 50,60K.

2
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,835
All right, let's not
go backwards, huh?

3
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:46,075
These people you run into wanna
be boss, huh? They should know.

4
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,845
I told you.
You don't listen, you nut.

5
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,786
You want a coffee?

6
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:54,816
I don't know--

7
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:02,056
FBI, get down!

8
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,166
FBI, down!

9
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:45,268
What is that?

10
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:47,608
What?

11
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,209
Is this it?

12
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,800
- What's going on?
- Go back to sleep.

13
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,500
Anthony Soprano,
Detective Gaudioso, Essex County.

14
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,140
I have a warrant for your arrest.

15
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,670
- For what?
- Are you Anthony Soprano?

16
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,410
What, did you bring
the whole county with you?

17
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,910
We don't take any chances
when it concerns an illegal firearm

18
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,680
containing hollow-point
ammunition.

19
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,120
What?

20
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:32,721
Where's the FBI?

21
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:37,061
Can I see a warrant?
We have the right.

22
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:42,191
Oh, thank God.

23
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,201
Will you tell them he's
got a medical condition?

24
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,701
This is his family doctor
right here. Ask him.

25
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:56,142
Hello, Janice.

26
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:58,782
Did you talk to Tony about
coming up to the lake for his birthday?

27
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,482
Tony was arrested
this morning.

28
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,552
- For what?
- Weapons charge.

29
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:05,122
They're booking him in North Caldwell
before they take him to Newark.

30
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:08,392
- I'm dropping off his clothes.
- It's a gun, no big deal.

31
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:10,122
Hollow-point ammunition,
they said.

32
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:11,793
Yeah, well,
he'll still make bail.

33
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,793
You know he's not wild
about the drive, Janice.

34
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:15,793
I really think it's
not the time right now.

35
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:18,003
Well, let him know
we're with him.

36
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:19,913
All right.

37
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:24,773
If you have hollow-point bullets
in anything, take 'em out today.

38
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:31,113
Oh, God damn it, AJ,
there is tomato sauce

39
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:32,644
all over these pants.

40
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:35,784
AJ, I asked
for the brown suit

41
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:37,654
from the
dry-cleaning bag.

42
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:44,494
That show of force,

43
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:48,344
was that all about
humiliating Dad?

44
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:24,436
Your Honor, the police
pulled over some kid

45
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:27,436
and found a baggie
with cocaine residue.

46
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:29,746
They also found a gun loaded

47
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:32,207
with hollow-point bullets
on the floor.

48
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,417
Now in order
to beat the rap,

49
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,887
this 16-year-old punk

50
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,687
claims he saw my client

51
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,857
drop that weapon.
And mind you, not yesterday,

52
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:44,057
but over two years ago,

53
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:47,197
using it in the meantime
to shoot at cans

54
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:50,337
and impress his friends.

55
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:59,678
I gotta tell you, Phil,
you look fantastic.

56
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:02,038
- As in science fiction?
- No. What? Come on.

57
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:05,708
Fucking empty compliments.
I had major fucking coronary disease.

58
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,978
- He's not shitting you, Phil.
- I broke my fucking gazz in Florida

59
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:12,318
on that goddamn recumbent
bike, I'll tell you that.

60
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,929
Would I shit you?
You're my favorite turd.

61
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,629
Fucking kid.

62
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,429
Why don't you get
a real bike,

63
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:25,469
have some beach pussy
to look at

64
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,869
while you're
working the heart?

65
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:31,709
Go over the handlebars, have some
fucking head trauma? That's all I need.

66
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,240
I'm 66 years old.

67
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,220
Anyway, Phil,
welcome home.

68
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,650
Thanks.

69
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,180
Don't listen to me.

70
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,950
I'm a cranky fuck lately.

71
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,490
- Lately?
- Ooh!

72
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,470
Why don't you get
a bike, you fat fuck?

73
00:06:56,731 --> 00:06:59,611
Ho...

74
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:06,141
- How are you, Doc?
- Let me get a drink. I'll be back.

75
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:07,811
All right.

76
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:11,251
Glad you're back, Phil.
This fucking guy.

77
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:13,422
How you doing?

78
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,952
I'm here to enjoy
my grandchildren,

79
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:18,162
my home.

80
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:25,792
Did you hear the news?
Pork Chop out in Jersey

81
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,962
got pinched on
a weapon charge.

82
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:31,102
Drops a gat in a field somewhere
three fucking years ago.

83
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:35,003
- What the fuck?
- Jersey. Fucking farmers, I don't know.

84
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:37,713
Yeah, he was probably going down
on some sheep or some shit.

85
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,913
Gun violence is a blight

86
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:48,823
on Essex County,
and Mr. Soprano will be prosecuted

87
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:51,023
to the fullest extent
of the law...

88
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:53,694
You know what
that says, Hector?

89
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:56,534
That's your mommy's
name-- Blanca.

90
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:58,864
Blanca Blanca Blanca.

91
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:00,404
That's Mommy's name.

92
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:02,934
AJ, can you
turn that off, please?

93
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:08,344
Tony.

94
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:11,544
Take the yellow ribbons down,
everybody. Our boy's come home.

95
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:14,685
- Dad.
- Hey. I'm fine.

96
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:22,055
They let him
out already?

97
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:25,555
What she means is, in our neighborhood
people don't get out right away.

98
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:30,995
- Hello.
- Where's Christopher?

99
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:33,166
I don't know.
I thought he was here.

100
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,066
Hold on.
It's Bobby.

101
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,606
- Yeah.
- You want me to come down?

102
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:39,946
No, nothing a hot shower
won't fix.

103
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:42,476
Carm told Jan you were
on the fence about the weekend.

104
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:46,416
I don't know.
Sit around, chew the fat.

105
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,046
We got the meeting
with the Canadians.

106
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:52,826
Ton', with these hassles, you should
make it up our way here.

107
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:59,327
You know, maybe that's
not such a bad idea.

108
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,637
Mr. Federal Attorney.

109
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:09,737
- What can I do for you?
- You had to have your cheap headline?

110
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:12,308
Can you really not be aware
we've been building a RICO case

111
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:16,308
against Tony Soprano
for five fucking years?

112
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:18,448
Then you blow this
popcorn fart.

113
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:27,588
Are you gonna relax?

114
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,188
It's just all this
little stuff,

115
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:31,858
like my phone has
one little bar up here.

116
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,929
I mean, what if the broker's
trying to contact me?

117
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:36,409
Caravan for my house is on Tuesday,
and the gas is still off.

118
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:40,279
Mine works.

119
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,739
- Hello.
- Essex County dropped the charges.

120
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,149
I told you it was
a piece-of-shit case.

121
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:50,249
Two years old,
no decent prints.

122
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,720
Santa Claus could have
dropped that gun in the snow.

123
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,660
They dropped the charges.
Well, I'd say I owe you one,

124
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,960
but I'm sure
it's more than one.

125
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,700
Neil, thanks again.

126
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,330
Thank God. I really didn't want it
hanging over your birthday.

127
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,830
Can we forget already
that it's my birthday?

128
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,540
You say that and then you get upset
if nobody makes a fuss.

129
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,911
- Hi.
- There you are.

130
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:19,711
I was starting
to get worried.

131
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:23,151
Traffic was horrible.

132
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:25,491
- I've had to pee since Glen Falls.
- Well, go.

133
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,751
Hey, Sis.

134
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:34,032
"National Lampoon's
Vacation."

135
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:36,132
How you doing?

136
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:38,572
How are you?

137
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:47,142
You know, I gotta
admit it-- every time,

138
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:49,472
once you're up here,

139
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:52,153
it's pretty great.

140
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:56,413
Aren't you adorable too

141
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:59,753
with your matching dress
just like Mommy's?

142
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:02,253
- Hi, Mercedes.
- Hello.

143
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,023
It's your favorite uncle.

144
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:06,223
There she is.
It's that little girl,

145
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:08,233
but I forget her name.

146
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,633
- Gladys?
- Nica.

147
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:13,574
- No, Murgatroyd.
- Nica.

148
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:15,074
Uh-oh.

149
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,704
Daddy.

150
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:21,174
- Oh, Daddy's girl.
- Daddy's little girl.

151
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:24,114
- Who's hungry?
- You know, a water would be perfect.

152
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,954
- Pellegrino?
- Sure.

153
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,554
He's gonna pass.
He's stuffed.

154
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:33,185
- ShopRite Sparkling?
- Sure.

155
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:36,155
If Frank Sinatra were coming here
to celebrate his birthday,

156
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,765
would you leave the lawn like that?
Looks like shit.

157
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,835
He has enough lawn maintenance
at the new house

158
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:42,565
since somebody let
the gardener go.

159
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:44,965
Oh, the house
wasn't enough.

160
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,675
I'm joking.

161
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,575
You know how
grateful we are.

162
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,845
Beer, Ton'?

163
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:53,116
Absolutely.

164
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,246
Madonn'.

165
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,916
800 rounds per.

166
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,286
He chromed out
the inner carrier.

167
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,586
And what I like, it's got the Panther
fluted barrel.

168
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:06,086
Is this how
you bagged that deer?

169
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:08,296
I wouldn't use a firearm
like this on a deer.

170
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:09,896
It's unsportsmanlike.

171
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,867
Oh, like the poor prick's
got a chance against a 30.06.

172
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:14,897
Actually,
last two seasons,

173
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:17,137
I've been using
a bow and arrow exclusively.

174
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,867
Get the fuck out
of here.

175
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,107
Seriously, it levels
the playing field.

176
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,807
The AR-10, that's my birthday
present to you.

177
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,347
Thanks, Bobby.

178
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:29,017
Don't say shit
to Carmela.

179
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,638
Me and Tony almost got
a summer place--

180
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,069
down the shore,
remember, Tony?

181
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:53,679
Any more
stuffed mushrooms?

182
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,749
My pop bought this place
'cause it was close to Canada.

183
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:59,229
He had ties in Montreal.
You know, Ton'.

184
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,849
His father, my grandpop,
come into the country

185
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,789
originally through
Montreal, illegally.

186
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:07,059
No kidding? He wasn't Ellis Island,
your grandfather?

187
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:10,859
Nah, got mixed up in some shenanigans
on the other side,

188
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,160
anti-government
or something.

189
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,230
Had a police record.

190
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,830
They oughta build
a wall now, though.

191
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,040
- I'm telling you.
- Amen.

192
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,570
Mommy!

193
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,710
When are
the kids back?

194
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,580
Sophia the 7th
and Robert the end of the month.

195
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,250
That's nice.

196
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:32,381
I'm very lucky
to be back

197
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:35,261
with my family
after all these years.

198
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:38,221
Look at you and me, Tony.

199
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:41,361
Who would have thought we'd have
the kind of relationship we have now?

200
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:43,631
The credit goes to you.

201
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,031
You really changed.

202
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:47,201
So I had to change?

203
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,031
It's a compliment.

204
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:51,601
You were fine.

205
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:53,272
You're different

206
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:55,072
since that stuff last year--

207
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,942
the shooting.

208
00:13:56,942 --> 00:14:00,182
- I'm sure Carm would agree.
- I would.

209
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:04,922
Oh, look,
the fish are jumping.

210
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,702
I'm different how?
How am I different?

211
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:22,363
Story you heard.

212
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:25,603
- The pool.
- Oh my God, please.

213
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:29,143
- What?
- You don't wanna know.

214
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:33,144
Pradeep,
our pharmacist,

215
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:34,914
was at a pool party.

216
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:37,154
All the kids were playing
in the water.

217
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:40,524
The adults were all around and having
drinks, barbecuing.

218
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:44,624
Somehow even with
all these people around,

219
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:48,224
this three-year-old child managed
to fall into the pool.

220
00:14:48,224 --> 00:14:51,034
Nobody even noticed till finally
they found him floating face down

221
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:53,135
in the water.

222
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:55,605
Brain dead.

223
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:58,375
Poor kid's in one of those padded
wheelchairs now.

224
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:01,675
Oh.

225
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:05,345
I can't get that story
out of my mind.

226
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:07,985
I don't know why.

227
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,977
Happy birthday.

228
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,787
It's supposed
to rain down there,

229
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:51,657
so make sure that all the cellar windows
are closed.

230
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:53,228
- Okay.
- And make sure

231
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,798
you check the one
by Dad's wine rack.

232
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:57,498
- Okay.
- Easy, big fella.

233
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,538
- That Jacuzzi's bitchin'.
- Who is that?

234
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:02,508
That's Fran the waitress.
We're really busy down here.

235
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:05,838
- You're at work?
- Yes, I'm at the pizzeria.

236
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,478
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

237
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:09,478
Bye.

238
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:13,549
The Jacuzzi
and the tub's fantastic.

239
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,489
There's everybody.

240
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:22,029
Don't let us forget
to wash the sheets, okay?

241
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:24,699
Yeah, ha ha!

242
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:27,729
Anthony Jereboam Soprano.

243
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:29,109
What's up?

244
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,570
Tony seem to hit the hooch
a little at lunch today?

245
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,370
I think he's feeling
his age.

246
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,110
What do you think
it's like for me?

247
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,040
When we were kids,

248
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,150
he'd do whatever I said.

249
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,930
He ate one of Tippy's Milk-Bones
because I told him it was a cookie.

250
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:55,861
My therapist Sandy,

251
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,731
she said my Ma
was a splitter.

252
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,701
She'd pit us three
against each other--

253
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,701
to toughen us up,
I guess.

254
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,971
I couldn't help hearing
you with AJ.

255
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:11,641
God, you gotta walk on eggshells
with these kids today, huh?

256
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:14,782
We're almost through that phase,
thank God.

257
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,652
You're good with them.

258
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:23,002
Really? I wish
he'd go back to college.

259
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:26,722
He sleeps most nights
at Blanca's.

260
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:29,632
Speaking of kids and Ma,

261
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,663
Sandy said something
interesting--

262
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:33,773
that when we were babies,

263
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:35,903
everything was fine,

264
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:38,343
but Ma couldn't stand
that as her babies got older,

265
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,173
they separated from her.

266
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:43,373
When they started
to talk and express ideas,

267
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:46,643
that's when
the trouble started.

268
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:49,153
It wasn't that
she didn't love us.

269
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:59,034
Mmm-mmm!

270
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:03,864
You've been a solid
performer for some time now.

271
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:06,144
Plus, you're my
brother-in-law.

272
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:13,305
You get older,
you think about things.

273
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:16,315
You're a young man.
We both are.

274
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:19,185
- World's still in front of us.
- Balls.

275
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:22,455
My estimate historically,

276
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:25,785
80% of the time it ends up
in the can like Johnny Sack

277
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:28,695
or on the embalming table
at Cozarelli's.

278
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:30,295
Don't even say it.

279
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:34,006
No risk, no reward.

280
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:50,856
I mean, yeah, our line of work,
it's always out there.

281
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:54,857
You probably don't even hear it
when it happens, right?

282
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:56,927
Ask your friend
in there on the wall.

283
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,897
Listen to us.
Morbid fucks.

284
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:06,167
Come to think of it, you never popped
your cherry in that regard, right?

285
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,697
No.

286
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:11,267
Yet your old man was
the fucking Terminator.

287
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:13,338
I come close.

288
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:17,248
I done other shit,
but no.

289
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:19,808
A salut'.

290
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:22,048
It's a big fat pain
in the balls.

291
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:24,188
Especially now
with DNA evidence.

292
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,718
My pop never
wanted it for me.

293
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:29,858
He said there were times
with all the worry

294
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:31,889
that he wished he could
have stayed in the shop full-time,

295
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,359
just cut hair.

296
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,309
To be honest, I'd rather
he fucking shot me than cut my hair.

297
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:46,439
There's somebody I've been
bringing along to insulate myself

298
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:49,979
from the stuff that
could bring down a boss,

299
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,610
and take care of Carmela
too, in case...

300
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,920
God forbid.

301
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,790
Now maybe

302
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,560
between me
and this person...

303
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,460
there's diverging agendas.

304
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,160
- Sorry to hear it.
- It happens.

305
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,500
Thing is, the Newark
facilities manager,

306
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,901
he's gonna fix it so we do all the
window replacements

307
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:15,971
in the projects.

308
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:19,611
I was thinking maybe
you should work that.

309
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:21,311
I'm honored just
to be considered.

310
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:25,311
Then we'll see what
happens after that, long-term.

311
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:39,762
- Time for presents.
- And grappa.

312
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:42,132
I told you people I didn't want
any presents, just...

313
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:45,002
Just a few kind words.

314
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:47,372
That was my father's line
every year.

315
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,282
I get the joke,
believe me.

316
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:55,843
"Soprano Home Movies."

317
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:58,483
I had all the Super 8s
from when we were kids transferred.

318
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,283
Oh, cool.

319
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:02,983
It's really
very thoughtful.

320
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:05,323
Thank you.

321
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:07,663
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, look at these.

322
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,863
Oh, look at this.

323
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,894
Taylor Made, wow!

324
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:19,574
"To my husband:
You're not just a funny, smart, lovable,

325
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:21,504
good-looking guy.

326
00:21:21,504 --> 00:21:24,514
- You're mine."
- Aww.

327
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:27,484
- Thank you, baby.
- Happy birthday.

328
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:29,744
Cent' ann', Anthony.

329
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:31,455
Oh, wait wait.

330
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:37,325
To have my health,

331
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:39,895
to be in this
beautiful spot

332
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:41,835
with people
that I love--

333
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:46,365
- I couldn't ask for more.
- Salut'.

334
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:20,167
Six.

335
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:23,307
Community Chest.

336
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:26,207
"Pay hospital $100."
Fuck me.

337
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:28,647
What are you doing?
It goes in the bank.

338
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,047
- We play the Free Parking rule.
- What Free Parking rule?

339
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,748
Money from Community Chest
and Chance goes into the middle.

340
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:35,918
Whoever lands on Free Parking
gets the money.

341
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:38,518
You show me that
in the rules.

342
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:41,458
Technically it isn't in the rules,
but a lot of people play it that way.

343
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,558
It adds a whole new level
of excitement to the game.

344
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:45,598
I don't agree with that.

345
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,468
When we were growing up
in our house, this is how we played.

346
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:50,428
You know, the Parker Brothers
took time to think this all out.

347
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,469
I think we should
respect that.

348
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:55,279
Fuck the Parker Brothers.
Just play the game.

349
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:58,679
Out of grappa.
How about some RÄÂ©my?

350
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,879
- 9, 10, 11...
- Yay!

351
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:06,619
- Fuck.
- Marvin Gardens

352
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,049
with two houses--

353
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:11,029
360 simoleons.

354
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,090
Don't throw the money
at me. Hand it to me.

355
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,760
I saw that.

356
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,770
- Saw what?
- You just kyped $500 from the bank.

357
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,300
God damn it, Tony!

358
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,200
I beg your pardon,
my sweet little potato.

359
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,700
You asshole.

360
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,751
- Free Parking, baby.
- This is bullshit.

361
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:37,721
You take a game of skill
and you make it just about luck.

362
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,721
Are you listening
to this fucking crybaby?

363
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:41,791
How about I make up
my own fucking rules?

364
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,221
How about every time
I land on one of my properties,

365
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:46,221
I get $100.
How about that?

366
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:47,561
How about that?
How about that?

367
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,431
Whose turn is it,
my turn?

368
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,662
It was mine.
Okay.

369
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:53,502
Here's $150.

370
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:55,832
I want to put a house
on Ventnor.

371
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:58,572
Daddy!

372
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:00,402
She wants to say
good night again.

373
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:03,542
- Aww.
- You gotta go to bed, baby.

374
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,882
Come here, my sweetie.

375
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:10,052
Yes, so if you go
to bed,

376
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:11,623
you know what?

377
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:15,523
Mommy will give you
a Willy Wonka Laffy Taffy.

378
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:19,163
- Laffy Taffy!
- Jan, we talked about this.

379
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:21,993
You tell me the difference
between bribery

380
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,203
and positive reinforcement.

381
00:24:24,203 --> 00:24:26,203
That looked like
a bribe to me.

382
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:29,103
You know what, Uncle Tony?
Butt the fuck out.

383
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:30,743
In front of the baby.

384
00:24:30,744 --> 00:24:34,274
They're in the kitchen.
Night-night.

385
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:41,284
I could tape you.
Send it to "Parents Magazine."

386
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:42,314
What's that supposed
to mean?

387
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,424
When we were kids,
remember?

388
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,454
You tape-recorded me
and Barb fighting.

389
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:48,724
You blackmailed us
for over a fucking month.

390
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:51,524
- I did no such thing.
- Oh! Yeah, you did.

391
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:54,895
- You fed him a Milk-Bone.
- You what?

392
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:57,835
You want to swap
family stories, Ton'?

393
00:24:57,835 --> 00:25:00,105
How about the time
that Mom and Dad

394
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:02,135
were coming back
from the Copa?

395
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:03,705
That's enough, Janice.

396
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:05,375
And Ma's hair...

397
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:09,315
That never even happened. And anyway,
it's not for public consumption.

398
00:25:09,316 --> 00:25:12,486
- Oh, my God, what?
- They're driving back from Manhattan

399
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:15,486
with Uncle Jun
and his goomar.

400
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:17,486
Oh, what was
her name, Tony?

401
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:19,656
- Your ass.
- That's how we heard the story--

402
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:23,596
through her. Rose Marie.
Anyway,

403
00:25:23,596 --> 00:25:25,266
my father's driving,

404
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:28,596
and she's ragging on his ass.
You know how she'd get.

405
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:32,166
He'd been drinking,
I guess.

406
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:35,237
- And he takes out his gun.
- Oh my God.

407
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:37,137
- Boom!
- Holy shit.

408
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,607
Fucking blew it

409
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:41,587
right through
her beehive hairdo.

410
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:47,217
I can't believe you
never told me that story.

411
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:49,287
Yeah,
what's the big deal?

412
00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:52,128
'Cause it makes us look
like a fucking dysfunctional family.

413
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,328
- Jesus Christ!
- My turn.

414
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:57,698
And don't you ever tell the kids that
about their grandfather.

415
00:25:57,698 --> 00:25:59,428
Of course not.

416
00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:02,038
So did you guys look at her hair?
Was there powder burns?

417
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,948
She had it bobbed
the next day.

418
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:09,078
- Play the game.
- Okay okay.

419
00:26:09,078 --> 00:26:10,878
Doubles.

420
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:13,679
Ah, one-two-three,
four-five-six...

421
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,149
Boardwalk--
I own it.

422
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:16,649
You blew guys
under it.

423
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:20,149
I roll again.

424
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:21,459
Okay.

425
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:24,389
"Second prize in
a beauty contest.

426
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,559
Collect $10."

427
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,229
Go ahead!

428
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:29,799
Make your stupid joke.

429
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,700
I got nothing to say.

430
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,130
Think I'll buy a railroad.

431
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,970
A German Shepherd's shaved
asshole won first prize.

432
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,370
Ho-- you're talking
about my wife.

433
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,740
- You married her.
- This is my home.

434
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,310
No more talking
like that.

435
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,810
- It's okay, Bobby.
- Stay outta this.

436
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,020
You Sopranos--

437
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,650
you go too far.

438
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:58,961
All right. You know,
Jan, he's right.

439
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:01,301
I'm sorry.

440
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:03,331
I crossed the line.

441
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,971
I apologize.
It won't happen again.

442
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:08,241
My turn--
oh fuck, Income Tax.

443
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:21,082
...with his schlong
in Jan's mouth...

444
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:24,232
- Oh, Tony!
- Bobby!

445
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:31,663
No, stop!

446
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,333
What are you doing?

447
00:27:39,503 --> 00:27:40,943
Stop that now!

448
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:49,483
You fuck!

449
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:50,784
Tony!

450
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:54,624
Tony!
Stop it!

451
00:27:57,124 --> 00:27:58,724
Ow!

452
00:28:04,534 --> 00:28:06,534
Bobby!

453
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:15,345
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop!

454
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:17,445
Stop!

455
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,045
Bobby!

456
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:22,185
Mommy! Mommy!

457
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:24,025
What do we pay you for?
Put her to bed.

458
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:29,085
Bobby!

459
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:31,955
Tony-- Tony,
are you all right?

460
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:33,736
Oh, Jesus.

461
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,036
Come on-- oh.

462
00:28:38,036 --> 00:28:40,536
Bobby-- stop.

463
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:42,336
Stop, you are
in no condition.

464
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:44,576
You'll kill yourself!

465
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:48,546
Fuck!

466
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:58,757
I'm okay.

467
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:00,517
Oh, my shoulder
is killing me.

468
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:03,227
Jesus-fucking-Christ,
Tony.

469
00:29:03,227 --> 00:29:05,327
Is he all right?

470
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,497
Hold it, everybody.

471
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:12,638
Look, Ton--
I'm really sorry.

472
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:13,998
Bobby,
just shut up.

473
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:16,478
Let's all just
go to bed.

474
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:33,119
I'll go get some ice.

475
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:37,459
What the fuck were
you thinking?

476
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:39,699
You're my wife.
He insulted you.

477
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:42,769
I'm a big girl.
I can take care of myself.

478
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:45,439
Oh, God, he is
head of the family.

479
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:48,709
Do you think he's just gonna wake up
tomorrow and forget about this?

480
00:31:11,924 --> 00:31:13,494
What the fuck
are you doing?

481
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:18,364
You beat me
fair and square.

482
00:31:18,364 --> 00:31:20,874
Come on,
let's just...

483
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:56,076
Well, I hope
you're proud of yourself.

484
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:06,316
How's your shoulder?

485
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:08,516
- Great.
- Maybe we should have it looked at.

486
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:10,426
I'm packed.
I would like to go.

487
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:17,437
You were right. You told me
to ease up on the drinking.

488
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:20,597
You shoulda' insisted.

489
00:32:20,597 --> 00:32:22,167
So now it's my fault?

490
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:26,837
Go wash your face
so we can leave.

491
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:39,358
I hope you're hungry.
I made a frittata.

492
00:32:41,188 --> 00:32:42,988
And Ramos fizzes.

493
00:32:42,988 --> 00:32:46,028
Well, thank you but we think
it'd be better if we left.

494
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:47,288
Not because of
last night?

495
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:48,958
It's for the best.

496
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:51,058
Come on,
we're family!

497
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:52,999
Jesus, these
things happen.

498
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:55,039
I really think we'd all
be more comfortable.

499
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,269
We had a little
too much to drink,

500
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:01,039
but no harm done.
The whole thing's already forgotten.

501
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,679
Besides, Tony, we have
that thing later. The Canucks.

502
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,149
It's a sin
to waste food.

503
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:09,579
Well, I don't know.

504
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,260
Here--
hair of the dog.

505
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:03,602
...suicide car bomber
kills two U.S. soldiers...

506
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:05,772
...west of Baghdad.

507
00:34:05,772 --> 00:34:08,912
That makes five Americans
killed in Iraq over the past two days.

508
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:10,742
There are
more Iraqi deaths,

509
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:13,613
at least 29 bodies found
scattered around Baghdad today...

510
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:15,783
Fucking look at him
out there.

511
00:34:15,783 --> 00:34:17,753
What?

512
00:34:17,753 --> 00:34:20,753
I've seen that
sitting in the chair thing.

513
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:23,333
Come on.
People sit in chairs.

514
00:34:31,474 --> 00:34:33,074
The couple from
Verona never came back

515
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:35,104
to take a second look
at the house.

516
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:41,184
Meadow's staying in
this weekend to study.

517
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:46,184
Pediatricians aren't
the highest-paid doctors--

518
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,754
that's radiologists.

519
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:52,254
But still, what
a wonderful thing to be.

520
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:57,225
That fucking throw rug
hadn't been there, would've been

521
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,735
- Bobby on his back, not me.
- What?

522
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:02,235
I wouldn't have slipped.
I would have kicked his ass.

523
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:05,405
Jesus Christ,
do you think I care?

524
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:07,935
Oh, you don't, huh?

525
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:09,475
You were there--

526
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:12,416
that night in the crowd
in the parking lot at Pizza World,

527
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:14,576
when I took
Dominic Tedesco.

528
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:16,846
I didn't even know your name,
but I remember

529
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:19,716
our eyes met, and you
were blown away.

530
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:21,996
I was in fucking
high school.

531
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:27,196
I'm supposed to be turned on
by you beating up your brother-in-law

532
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:28,996
at your 47th birthday?

533
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:30,766
How old is Bobby?
42, 43?

534
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:33,067
You think those four years
don't make a difference?

535
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:35,137
You had it coming.

536
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:37,407
You get away with murder
because you're his boss.

537
00:35:37,407 --> 00:35:39,037
Oh, really?

538
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,707
And how about the fact he wouldn't be
living in that fucking mansion

539
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,647
if it wasn't for me?

540
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:46,777
I had to sacrifice my entire
friendship with Johnny Sack

541
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,657
to get him and Janice
that house.

542
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,688
Funny how everybody
forgets that, huh?

543
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:53,718
They are grateful, Tony.

544
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,888
Jesus--!

545
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:58,528
You know, you and your sister,
you are emotionally blocked.

546
00:35:58,528 --> 00:36:01,668
I'm old, Carm.

547
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:04,028
And my body has
suffered a trauma

548
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,798
that it will probably
never fully recover from,

549
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:09,608
so why don't we just
face the facts?

550
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,649
- Yeah?
- Hey, T, it's me.

551
00:36:18,649 --> 00:36:20,749
Just wanted to wish you
a belated happy birthday.

552
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,580
We had a scare
last summer.

553
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,210
Guy down the road was fishing,
thought he caught a snakehead.

554
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,281
Yuck.

555
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:54,321
Thankfully, it was
only a bowfin.

556
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:56,451
- What's a snakehead?
- It's this horrible, ugly fish...

557
00:36:56,451 --> 00:36:58,151
Tell you something,
Bobby.

558
00:36:58,151 --> 00:36:59,821
We had this little tussle
a year ago,

559
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:01,391
before my injury--

560
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:02,601
This again?

561
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:06,461
Ton', I think
everyone here knows

562
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:07,861
you were at
a disadvantage.

563
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:09,701
I don't want to take
nothin' away from you,

564
00:37:09,702 --> 00:37:11,802
but...

565
00:37:11,802 --> 00:37:13,802
sucker punch is
a sucker punch.

566
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:15,312
So then it wasn't
fair and square?

567
00:37:15,312 --> 00:37:16,612
I mean, make up
your mind.

568
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:18,382
I think we both know
what's what.

569
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:22,552
But forget about it.
I have.

570
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:28,952
Come on, Bobby,
let's go.

571
00:37:28,952 --> 00:37:30,652
Where are
you two going?

572
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:32,593
Play some golf
with some people.

573
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:33,993
Oh, right.

574
00:37:33,993 --> 00:37:35,833
Why don't you just hit
a few into the lake?

575
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:37,673
Bobby, come on.

576
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,673
You okay?

577
00:37:48,673 --> 00:37:51,013
Could turn the air on.

578
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:52,914
I'm good.

579
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:56,124
Just I should have taken
a leak before we left.

580
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:12,165
Oh, honey,
look at you go!

581
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,305
Mercedes, you didn't tell me
that you were taking her in the lake.

582
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:16,575
I'm watching her,
Miss Janice.

583
00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:18,005
You're supposed
to tell me

584
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,545
whenever you take her
in the lake.

585
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:20,705
It's all right.
I'm here, too.

586
00:38:20,705 --> 00:38:22,275
I don't want Nica
going in the lake

587
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:23,945
without my knowing.

588
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:27,225
Come on, you've been
in there long enough.

589
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:31,555
Nica, did you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

590
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:32,686
No!

591
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,256
What did you say?

592
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:36,826
Nica, come over here.

593
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:38,796
- No.
- Don't tell me no.

594
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:41,396
Don't you ever
tell me no!

595
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:45,206
- Mad.
- You're not mad.

596
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,336
You have no right
to feel mad.

597
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:49,776
I'll give you something
to be mad about.

598
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:51,437
Take her to the house,

599
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:53,387
and put her to bed now.

600
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,717
She's never spoken to me
like that before-- never.

601
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:03,557
- Probably needs that nap.
- That fucking Bobby Jr,

602
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:05,687
he's going through his
goddamn adolescence.

603
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:07,187
He's nothing but
lip and attitude.

604
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:09,857
She's imitating.

605
00:39:09,858 --> 00:39:11,428
She's got
that pitch-perfect ear.

606
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:16,138
I'm a little hyper today.

607
00:39:16,138 --> 00:39:18,168
Maybe it's these
estrogen pills.

608
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:19,948
Well, if you're
as hungover as I am...

609
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:32,759
That was some story
you told, though.

610
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,459
My dad and the gun?

611
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:39,689
That alone was worth
the price of admission.

612
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:43,699
Oh, he was Nabolidan'
to his core, boy.

613
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,110
Mmm.

614
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,810
I had this boyfriend once--

615
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,850
one night he hit me.

616
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,980
Boy oh boy,
I blew my lid.

617
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,400
I completely exploded.

618
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,120
I'm more like my dad.

619
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:11,361
Than who?

620
00:40:11,361 --> 00:40:14,431
Tony, for example.

621
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:17,331
So, what are you saying?
He's more like your mother?

622
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,431
No.

623
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:21,381
Listen, he's got that
temper too.

624
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:29,681
In the end he went
his separate way.

625
00:40:29,682 --> 00:40:31,282
Who?

626
00:40:31,282 --> 00:40:33,452
My boyfriend.

627
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:36,652
I'm not proud
of it, though.

628
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,992
Sounds like he deserved it.

629
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:46,592
My mother, though,

630
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,202
she could lay out in
the weeds for days, years,

631
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:50,502
waiting to strike.

632
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:53,433
That verbal diarrhea,

633
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:55,743
when you got something in
that head of yours, Janice,

634
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:58,273
you give yourself away. What are you
saying about my husband?

635
00:40:58,273 --> 00:40:59,573
What-- what did I say?

636
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:01,613
I don't know what goes
on in your house,

637
00:41:01,613 --> 00:41:06,153
but for your information, Tony has
never raised his hand to his children.

638
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:07,783
Nothing goes on
in my house.

639
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:10,633
- Or to me.
- Fine.

640
00:41:14,524 --> 00:41:16,224
But you know what,
I take that back.

641
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:20,234
Once he slapped AJ,
and he felt horrible about it--

642
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:21,474
for days.

643
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:25,874
Bobby took advantage of him
last night

644
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:27,574
when Tony had had
too much to drink.

645
00:41:27,574 --> 00:41:30,344
There is no excuse for the way
Bobby blindsided him.

646
00:41:34,615 --> 00:41:37,785
Tony is not
a vindictive man.

647
00:41:42,185 --> 00:41:44,065
What did I say?

648
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:02,576
You had a pretty good success
with the Lipitor, right?

649
00:42:02,576 --> 00:42:06,546
Well, at this moment we could
also sell to you Fosamax.

650
00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:09,416
Medication for...

651
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:12,587
osteo-- osteporose, you know,
for the women, their bones.

652
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:15,457
Now, one month's
supply of Fosamax,

653
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:17,387
four pilules -- pills,

654
00:42:17,387 --> 00:42:20,827
sells for $70 U.S.
from the pharmacy.

655
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:25,097
We sell four pills
to you for $10 U.S.

656
00:42:25,097 --> 00:42:27,167
- What, are they counterfeit?
- No no no.

657
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,767
They're true. They're
from Assurance Maladie,

658
00:42:29,768 --> 00:42:33,408
but expiree,--
like, old.

659
00:42:33,408 --> 00:42:35,618
Change the date,
nobody knows.

660
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:42,988
How much... Fosamax
can you get?

661
00:42:42,988 --> 00:42:46,418
20,000 pills
every three months.

662
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:48,828
There some way we could
get you to lower your price?

663
00:42:48,828 --> 00:42:50,328
You already make
a big profit.

664
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:51,729
That's a good deal.

665
00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:54,229
And we'll give you the first pills
in one week, Monday.

666
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:00,499
What?

667
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:03,309
I cannot come
the week next

668
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:06,239
because ma soeur--
my sister,

669
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:08,139
she has problems
in the court.

670
00:43:08,139 --> 00:43:09,509
She got a good lawyer?

671
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,010
Makes all the difference.

672
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,120
Her old husband, he wants to take
the child they have together

673
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,590
to Winnipeg, because
he's some drummer over there.

674
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,990
- Can you believe this?
- She never see her son.

675
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,520
Separate a child
from his mother?

676
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,030
I mean, what kind
of person does this?

677
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,730
I would give anything to be, you know,
debarasse of this shit.

678
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,870
To have him gone
from her life--

679
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:31,801
That's tough
talk, bon ami.

680
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:34,441
I'm really serious.

681
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:37,941
I tell you what:

682
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:40,781
you knock your price
down to 35 grande

683
00:43:40,781 --> 00:43:44,381
and we'll see what we can do about
making your sister's custody problem...

684
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:45,821
go away.

685
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:49,891
And I'm not talking
about a lawyer, either.

686
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:51,852
Now, who does this?

687
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:54,092
You pay to some
drug addict?

688
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:56,472
No, somebody reliable.

689
00:43:59,162 --> 00:44:01,642
We got to talk.

690
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:08,082
You'll take care
of this, right?

691
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:13,683
Sure.

692
00:44:14,783 --> 00:44:16,593
No bow and arrows now.

693
00:44:23,853 --> 00:44:25,993
Ooh.

694
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:31,934
Nice, huh?

695
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:50,584
Bobby...

696
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:52,825
Hi, hi.

697
00:44:52,825 --> 00:44:54,855
Mwah!

698
00:44:54,855 --> 00:44:56,095
Oh, how was the game?

699
00:44:56,095 --> 00:44:57,895
Oh, you know,
he held his own, but...

700
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,365
Must have been
the new clubs.

701
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:01,295
- Yeah.
- Do you want to eat something?

702
00:45:01,295 --> 00:45:04,165
No no, I figure we
should hit the road,

703
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:05,905
beat the traffic.

704
00:45:05,905 --> 00:45:07,275
Okay.

705
00:45:13,106 --> 00:45:15,616
You let him win.
Smart.

706
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,656
Drive carefully.

707
00:45:25,116 --> 00:45:27,486
Here.

708
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:29,626
Thanks again
for my present.

709
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:32,867
Oh, wait till you see the shots
of Aunt Gemma from the '60s.

710
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:35,537
You forget what a beauty
she was before the steroids.

711
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:37,997
- Bobby, you're a wonderful host.
- It was our pleasure.

712
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:40,607
Goodbye. When Nica
wakes up from her nap,

713
00:45:40,607 --> 00:45:42,337
give her a belly
smooch from us.

714
00:45:42,337 --> 00:45:44,477
Okay. Bye.

715
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:01,328
He broke your balls
about the fight, didn't he?

716
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,068
No, he didn't.

717
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:12,739
Bobby?

718
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:14,109
Where are you going?

719
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:15,679
- It's business, Jan.
- Now?

720
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:17,809
- Yeah.
- Well, when are you coming back?

721
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,409
I'm not sure.
A couple days.

722
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,749
A couple of days?
The Salernos are coming tomorrow.

723
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:23,619
Stop fucking nagging me.

724
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:25,859
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

725
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,850
- Allo, Natalie.
- Salut.

726
00:47:52,074 --> 00:47:53,414
Yeah?

727
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:55,344
Some news about this
gun charge:

728
00:47:55,344 --> 00:47:57,844
- it's not going away.
- You said they dropped it.

729
00:47:57,844 --> 00:48:00,984
Essex County did, but now
looks like the feds took it over.

730
00:48:00,984 --> 00:48:02,284
Fuck.

731
00:48:02,284 --> 00:48:04,954
What happened to
"It's a piece-of-shit case"?

732
00:48:04,954 --> 00:48:07,254
It is.
Unwinnable.

733
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:10,324
But fold it into a RICO,
it adds a predicate.

734
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:12,895
Good news is if they
had what they needed

735
00:48:12,895 --> 00:48:15,635
we'd be having this
conversation through glass.

736
00:48:15,635 --> 00:48:17,705
I gotta go.

737
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:02,387
Girls, let's do
the tea now.

738
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:06,557
Pour a little
for Jamie too.

739
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:14,458
- Bobby, finally!
- Hey, Bobby.

740
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:15,998
Daddy!
