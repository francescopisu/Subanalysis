1
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,780
Tony, hey. I tented the bulbs.

2
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,410
Good.

3
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,000
I've been meaning to ask you...

4
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,460
The Sacrimonis.

5
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,750
I've been doing his yard
over there a year now.

6
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,460
And?

7
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,510
I guess what I'm asking is,

8
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,220
how much longer do I have
to keep doing this on the arm?

9
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,510
It was OK when we were getting you
out of your Feech La Manna problem,

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,560
but suddenly, short fucking memory?

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,810
I appreciate that, but...

12
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,810
You're a selfish prick, Sal.

13
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,980
Her husband's in jail. This is
when Mrs Sacrimoni needs you the most.

14
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,370
The federal prosecutors and myself
have been told to clear our calendars.

15
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,500
So trial is upon us.

16
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,840
And the feds have reached
a complete accounting of your worth.

17
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,590
"The vintage Wurlitzer"?
They go through my fucking sock drawer?

18
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,850
They shot a video the day of your arrest.

19
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,180
They even tracked down the 180 grand
under your father's name.

20
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,690
They estimate your net worth at five million.

21
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,440
While Ginny lives on scraps.

22
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,820
Between your cash and portfolios
with Fidelity and Vanguard,

23
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,070
your 401 K and severance parachute
from Essany Scaffolding,

24
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,990
condo in Deal Beach at 450,

25
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,990
Maserati, Ginny's Yukon,

26
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,620
and the house and contents
at a million two.

27
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,330
Is this all part of your plan, Ron?

28
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,290
Make me so depressed that I hang myself?

29
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,210
It's my obligation to raise the idea
again of cooperating.

30
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,680
Flip?

31
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,470
Let me explain something
to you again, Ron, but differently.

32
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,730
Being a rat, where I'm coming from,

33
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,020
is like asking a person where you're
coming from to become a fucking Nazi.

34
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,480
I don't wanna hear that shit again.

35
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,110
Good.

36
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,780
Because I don't represent turncoats.

37
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,370
Cos it would kill your practice.

38
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,640
What happened to my stuffed pork loin?

39
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,800
You ever hear of knocking?

40
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,680
I ordered it special.
You had them send it up to Carmela?

41
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,940
You get what you pay for.

42
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:36,002
Jag skojar, hon liknar dig bara.

43
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:40,967
Jag fattar inte varfÃ¶r du inte kan erkÃ¤nna
att du skyller din skottskada pÃ¥ oss.

44
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,070
You never miss a chance to shit on him.

45
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm joking. She looks like you, that's all.

46
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,790
Why can't you admit
that you blame us that you got shot?

47
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,170
Unfortunately, I have only myself to blame.

48
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,840
Unfortunately? So obviously
you'd like to blame somebody.

49
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,850
I have only myself to blame.

50
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,310
You don't blame me for the shooting?
You fucking blame me for something!

51
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,270
- Jan, the baby.
- Marrying the boss's sister,

52
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,690
usually it's a step up.

53
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,610
But you keep your goddamn foot on our necks.

54
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,110
You punish Bobby because he's my husband.

55
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,870
- Will you stop?
- To be his age and not to be a captain?

56
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,370
Now I see what this little visit's all about.

57
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,830
He works so hard for you,
and what does he get?

58
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,290
Merciless ridicule.
About his weight, his model railroading...

59
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,300
- He's a grown man!
- But it's OK for Neil Young.

60
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,670
He owns Lionel!

61
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,640
Domenica! Take care of your things.

62
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,180
I don't know where it comes from,

63
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,900
all your anger, your hate for me.

64
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,230
I'm your sister.

65
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,610
I know I'm not perfect.

66
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,950
I know I annoy people.

67
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,370
I think about you
lying in that hospital bed...

68
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,210
I cried for you. I sat with you.

69
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,180
I know it.

70
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,140
And I appreciated it.

71
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:38,030
But we both know,
no matter how much help I gave,

72
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,360
you'd still be here fucking complaining.

73
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,950
My God... there's nothing
holding us together but DNA.

74
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,180
I'm asking what else you got
besides slot machines?

75
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,140
That single-deck blackjack? OK, thanks.

76
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,320
I can't believe this.
Is this what you're doing all day?

77
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,410
I knew there was a reason
you wouldn't let me read your book.

78
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,160
- It's research.
- So Rocky Marciano liked the greyhounds?

79
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,670
Cos I found a fucking
trifecta box ticket in my trash!

80
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,470
Hold up. It's complicated shit.

81
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,510
Are you even a sports writer?

82
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,100
We're talking about taking
the next step in this relationship.

83
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,770
I ask you to share my home
and you can't even be straight with me.

84
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,360
- Fuck this. Nice knowing you.
- Jimbo, come on.

85
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,200
I'm not a writer, OK?

86
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,330
I'm not from Scottsdale...
and the car's not my sister's.

87
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,370
I'm actually from New Jersey.

88
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,590
- I knew it.
- Some shit went down. I had to leave.

89
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:28,220
My home, my contracting business...
my wife, my kids.

90
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,390
Are you drunk? It's not even 11 o'clock.

91
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,480
You think it's easy? I miss home
so bad my heart's a fucking lump.

92
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,270
I'm barely holding together,

93
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,360
stuck in the sticks,
running out of money and now this?

94
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,940
You think I was looking for you?

95
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,490
A wife and kids. Of course.

96
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,740
- I've been divorced for a few years.
- Where do they think you are?

97
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:57,580
You can never tell anybody, ever.
I'm not fucking around here.

98
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,580
I was married too, remember?

99
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,550
I was only gonna say, you need some money,

100
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,180
you worked construction,
maybe I can help you get work.

101
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,300
I know some people could always
use a good handyman.

102
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,480
Happy birthday!

103
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,190
- Stop blubbering. It's a party.
- You think we'd let you turn 50 alone?

104
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,400
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

105
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,030
Hi, Sal!

106
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,500
He's such a mope.

107
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,460
The girls come around and that helps.

108
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,130
Allegra's bitchy, but it's painful for her here.

109
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,050
- She thinks I resent her happiness.
- Newlyweds.

110
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,920
She's probably freaked out
that she's not happier.

111
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,640
Ginny, that kitchen... and this room, the light...

112
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,930
Not his decision.
I'm running that shop, not him.

113
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,020
My days are completely full.

114
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,650
- I shouldn't.
- It's your birthday.

115
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,950
I love this place. It reminds me
of the Palladian villas I saw in Italy.

116
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,950
Thank you. Sometimes I forget.
I spend most of my time upstairs.

117
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,370
- Wellbutrin.
- I wish there was a pill.

118
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,290
John in that place? Of course, I can't
say my pain's worse than anybody's.

119
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,050
Yeah. We're both grownups.
I'd rather go with my own instincts.

120
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,820
- Your feet are like fucking icicles.
- Hands too?

121
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,290
Dinner was good.

122
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,940
I found a woodland mountain.

123
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,360
27" peak, clump foliage and snow.

124
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,870
- Bobby.
- I'm listening, OK?

125
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,830
Where are you going?

126
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,540
Rafe's brother's making a music video.
They got dry ice.

127
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,790
Where's your helmet?

128
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,750
Check out the Moe and Joe action.

129
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,510
You know what? Let's do a race.

130
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,180
The Polar Express one. We could trash it.

131
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,020
I can't.

132
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,110
I see the grey cloud
hanging around your head.

133
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,450
Where's Prince Albert? Still sleeping?

134
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,450
Who knows?

135
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,960
I've been very patient with you
because you've been sick.

136
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,760
You were going to talk
to the building inspector.

137
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,970
- My spec house.
- Yeah.

138
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,720
I sent Little Paulie.

139
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,220
Now, he made headway
with the supervisor,

140
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,390
but the other guy,
the inspector, he's a piece of work.

141
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,390
Next I'll get Sil on it.

142
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,440
Gotta pay a visit
to the Montville Building Department.

143
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,740
To what end?

144
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,320
I promised Carm I'd lean on this inspector.

145
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,370
Completely went out of my head.

146
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,120
The guy's name is Ron Senkowski.

147
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,750
Ginny Sack's brother, Anthony.

148
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,470
The lord of the lenses.

149
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:25,060
Actually we just started carrying these.
The newest Cross pen.

150
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,900
A rollerball.

151
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,030
- You want a classic fountain?
- Nah. Have a seat.

152
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,870
- How's your brother-in-law?
- John's fucking made of steel.

153
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,790
I was told "your ears only".

154
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,590
- That's why he didn't get a pen?
- No...

155
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,800
He's fucking with you, Anthony.

156
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,980
Johnny's a silent partner in this
equipment leasing thing in New Orleans.

157
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,940
Good. FEMA's down there
handing out Krugerrands in buckets.

158
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,450
He said post-Katrina you had some
knowledge of business in the area.

159
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,740
Well, let me say this...

160
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,330
Dick Cheney for President...
of the fucking universe.

161
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,580
On account
of John's liquidity problems,

162
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,830
the asset freeze,

163
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,710
he'd love you to contact these brothers,
the owners, and turn it into cash.

164
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,970
- Me?
- Phil Leotardo shouldn't be involved.

165
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,100
Just know John's asking as a friend.

166
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,310
Obviously there's a finder's fee.

167
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,920
What the hell's this, a siesta?

168
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:26,970
What? I wasn't sleeping.
I was resting my hips.

169
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,810
I was supposed to have surgery.

170
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,770
Am I early?

171
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,150
- What do you mean?
- Dinner.

172
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,990
I am interviewing
a new contractor for my spec.

173
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,530
Bill DeGillio.

174
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,320
He built the Sacrimoni house.

175
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,830
He did decent workmanship.
Ginny says he works for a price.

176
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,870
- So?
- Your sister loves that house.

177
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,880
She said it reminded her of a villa in Italy.

178
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,010
- Is he coming here now?
- I picked up sandwiches from Italianissimo.

179
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,350
Your father did this house

180
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,350
and it was more than decent workmanship.

181
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,450
Think about replacing him before you rush into
something that could cost a lot more time.

182
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,250
Why do you suddenly care
so much about my dad?

183
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,630
I like that she has these little projects

184
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,220
and charities, what have you.

185
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,600
Makes her happy, keeps her busy.

186
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,480
But...

187
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,560
even in bed she's a million miles away.

188
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,940
Sounds like you want
to encourage her with this house

189
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,820
as long as it doesn't interfere with your life.

190
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,200
Carmela and me...
we came to an understanding

191
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,160
when we reconciled.

192
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,120
I would financially back her spec house

193
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,710
and she would have more
of a don't-ask-don't-tell policy

194
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:27,130
towards my work and my recreational
life outside of the home.

195
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,390
But you tell me there hasn't been
much recreating since the shooting.

196
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,520
No, and that's OK.

197
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,700
Fucking Janice came to visit me at work.

198
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,910
That doesn't happen often.

199
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, she shops for meat there.
We get it free.

200
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,960
By the way, if you ever need a roast
or any specialty kind of cut,

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,460
please just ask.

202
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,640
My dad used to drop us off there
when he had to run errands.

203
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,730
We'd go into the back and steal
cigarettes, play house, shit like that.

204
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:24,480
She was all upset. She said that
I was mean to her and her husband.

205
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,360
- What did you say?
- It doesn't matter, cos she's right.

206
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,700
I love it when I can take a shit on her
and her husband.

207
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,580
What's that about?

208
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,580
When they told me
Uncle Jun' might need diapers,

209
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,550
I thought about Bobby having to change
him... I still get a kick out of it.

210
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,720
It makes Bob seem weak?

211
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,550
Your sister too? These are acts of kindness.

212
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,810
Janice only does acts of Janice. Trust me.

213
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,020
You two have never really gotten along?

214
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,900
Not never. She was my older sister.
I thought she was pretty cool.

215
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,240
And she gave it back to my mother.
That was heroic shit.

216
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,990
Because she defended you.

217
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,080
Please. It was every man for himself.

218
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,120
I remember one time
my parents left her in charge.

219
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,500
Go ahead.

220
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,090
She stood in the hallway
and she tape-recorded...

221
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,510
me and Barb having a fight.

222
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:43,230
And she held that cassette tape
over my head for a month.

223
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,150
Fucking extortion.

224
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,360
Made me make her bed, get her shit.

225
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,990
- Did she do that to Barbara too?
- That's not the fucking point.

226
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,910
I've been coming here five years

227
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,580
and you still don't understand what it
means to tape somebody in my family?

228
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,710
You still don't fucking get this?

229
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,790
Listen, as far as that thing goes...

230
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,670
the coffee with the chicory?

231
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,050
- What the fuck is that?
- Shit.

232
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,760
I suck at talking like this, John. I'm sorry.

233
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,270
Our friend with the stomach.

234
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,150
- In town or near home?
- Your neighbour.

235
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,940
- AS.
- All right.

236
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,860
Just say, "The thing I asked you to do".
The coffee with the fucking chicory!

237
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,370
- Is he gonna get it for me?
- Yes.

238
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,040
Bad news is he wants ten cups
for himself. Not seven.

239
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,380
All right. Done.

240
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:59,050
Did you pick up the birthday cake
for Gin with the marzipan flowers?

241
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,390
- The stuff behind the pool?
- No, an actual fucking cake.

242
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,690
It's her birthday.

243
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,330
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

244
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,130
OK, but stand clear.

245
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,590
- What's going on?
- Pastor heard water running,

246
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,550
went down, basement's flooded.
But the pastor's trapped.

247
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,850
- You get him?
- An arcing wire's hanging.

248
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,890
These assholes skipped a conduit
when they remodelled.

249
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,440
I spent years as a contractor.
Electrical is where I started.

250
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,400
...few minutes. There's nothing to see here.

251
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,580
Way to go, Vince!

252
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,500
What the fuck did I tell you?

253
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,090
- The guy was gonna get cooked.
- You trying to be a big man?

254
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,260
- Back the fuck off!
- What the fuck, Jim?

255
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,470
Boys, calm down.

256
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,050
Let's cut the bullshit, get the water turned off

257
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,270
and pump out the damn basement.

258
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,860
I thought you guys
were morons for doing this shit,

259
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,480
but now I can see it's a fucking rush.

260
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,490
- You should join the department.
- We could use another moron.

261
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,820
It's a commitment, firefighting.

262
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,910
Every day it's there.
You have to have a passion.

263
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,870
I've got bad hips. Supposed to have surgery.

264
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,290
This is all bullshit talk anyway.

265
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,630
You're gonna forget this craphole
the minute you hear from your publisher.

266
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,010
Darts! Five bucks a point. Who's in?

267
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,600
Nah. It's almost midnight.

268
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,600
Where the fuck you guys going?

269
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,100
- Let's play some poker.
- You did great.

270
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,150
Where I come from, the night's just starting.

271
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,320
Good week,
even with the fucking Dolphins.

272
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,120
Night, boss.

273
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,250
Get his joint.

274
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,670
- You know who the fuck I am?
- You beat, nigga.

275
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,340
Come out the bookies?
You a winner or a loser?

276
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,130
You're making a big mistake.

277
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,850
Damn! Three Gs.

278
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,310
You got what you want.
Please don't. I got kids.

279
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,270
Look at his mouth.
Look at his fucking mouth!

280
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,860
- Do him now.
- Jesus, no. Please.

281
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,070
No, please.

282
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,030
What the fuck you doin'?
Why you pull that trigger?

283
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:14,250
According to John, the retail value
of Bayou Leasing is around six mil.

284
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,670
- Seem about right?
- Between five and six.

285
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,670
Let's do this again.

286
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,720
You're gonna have to find a buyer
and deliver John's half to me

287
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,260
in about 30 days,
give you a chance to get bidders.

288
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,970
- His half?
- Yeah.

289
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,390
I don't think that's up for debate.

290
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,690
Had you controlled your fucking football,
we wouldn't have no silent partner.

291
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,820
That man floated me 50 grand. 50.

292
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,780
Next thing I know he's
buying in for half a fucking million.

293
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,700
Look at him, like they don't
do this shit every day.

294
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,040
You took John's loan. He helped you expand.

295
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,450
Now it's time to cash in.

296
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,080
Mr Soprano, that's what
I've been saying all along.

297
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,220
- You two don't seem like brothers.
- In-laws. He married my little sis.

298
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,880
15 years of womanly company

299
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,260
but I had to come all the way
to New Jersey to get truly fucked.

300
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,810
I'm doing this as a favour to John.

301
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,440
I don't need another headache.
Do we got a problem here?

302
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,940
No, sir. I'm buying a boat.

303
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,700
You fancy yourself a businessman.

304
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,490
Would you sell with all that money
pouring into New Orleans?

305
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,120
John Sacrimoni asked me to.

306
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,910
Well, we're very different people.

307
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,100
- Thanks.
- North belligerents will kindly remain in Utah.

308
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,350
You, shake hands and come out fightin'.
I'll take you.

309
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,030
- Yeah?
- Heard about Bobby Bacala?

310
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,360
Yeah, my sister called
with the breaking news.

311
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,870
That fucking part of Newark.
Even the cops don't go there.

312
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,950
So you heard everything.

313
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,120
Doctor said the slug blew
bits of sidewalk into the eye.

314
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,630
- Yeah, I heard.
- But they're optimistic.

315
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,340
Right, doctors.
It's always good news till it ain't.

316
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,970
Speaking of that, whatever the fuck
happened to you with the prostate?

317
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:38,020
I've been dealing with some shit.
Cancer, to tell you the truth.

318
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,150
What the fuck, Paulie?

319
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,820
It was early. Maybe I caught a break.
Still encapsulated.

320
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,650
I'm taking a course of radiation

321
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,530
to knock the PSA back into single digits.

322
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,620
Are you all right? The hair and shit?

323
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,580
Knock wood... I must have
done good things in my life.

324
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,540
Yeah.

325
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,710
All right.

326
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,090
The cancer... your ears only.

327
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,760
Absolutely.

328
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,140
You hear about Bobby?

329
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,390
- Yeah.
- Should've seen him.

330
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,610
Put a patch over his eye like Hathaway.
He was really rattled.

331
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,570
It was kind of stupid
to be out there that late.

332
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,150
Cops don't even go there no more.

333
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,700
Anyway, Bobby's vision's fucked.

334
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,330
He could be a candidate
for a cornea transplant.

335
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,040
He should be a candidate
for a brain transplant.

336
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,040
To his credit, all he was thinking about
was straightening out for the week.

337
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,050
Fuck that honour and loyalty shit.

338
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,130
It was a manoeuvre, Carlo,

339
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,760
cos he knew it was his own fucking fault.

340
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,190
What? Don't give me that look.

341
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Including the wife's IRA and his pension...

342
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,330
we'd go for 240 months.

343
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,540
20 years and 90% of his assets?

344
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,290
Makes trial seem like
a risk worth taking.

345
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,460
- Have you seen the evidence?
- You came to us.

346
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,420
My client insists the house is off-limits.

347
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,590
- He wants his wife provided for.
- What do you have in mind?

348
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,850
Again, the shit that has nothing to do with him,

349
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,230
the house, her IRA, the Yukon,

350
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,650
the deed on the daughter's condo.

351
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,570
- And 12 years.
- For conspiracy to commit murder?

352
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,440
Get back to me when you're sober, Ron.

353
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,990
So Eagles absolutely no good here.
Not sure even seven will.

354
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,080
Eagles will go for McNab.

355
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,200
Back pass, he has this...

356
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,040
- It's broken.
- Wanna switch?

357
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,540
No. I'm good.

358
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,880
Carm called. She's still
getting her folks in the car.

359
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,590
Where's Barb and Tom?

360
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,720
I asked them to bring wine.
We'll see how long that takes.

361
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,890
Did you take the Vicodin?

362
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,990
Giants... Fucking blowing 'em out.

363
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,200
As long as they don't beat the spread.

364
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,530
- Where are you going?
- Out.

365
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,740
The Giants are kicking ass here.

366
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,040
- I'm going to watch the Chargers.
- What channel's that on?

367
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,920
Some people buy the satellite package.

368
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,250
Sit down. This is a Giants house.

369
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,970
- I hate the fucking Giants.
- What'd we say about that language?

370
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,760
AJ didn't come to Sunday dinner.

371
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,550
AJ has a job. Do you wanna go get a job?

372
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,470
Go ahead.

373
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,560
But first go get your last report card
and read it to everybody.

374
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,440
No? I thought so.

375
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,200
Go finish your Spanish report before dinner.

376
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,910
Set the table, honey.

377
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,880
My brother-in-law
almost got his fucking eye put out.

378
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,210
Some fucking crackhead animals.

379
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,470
- That is terrible.
- Yeah, it is, but...

380
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,260
it's one thing after another with her family.

381
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,260
You mean the bad luck?

382
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,430
Or do you feel like somehow they deserve it?

383
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,730
I don't know, but...

384
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,020
Fucking Janice attracts drama.

385
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:59,110
- She creams over the misery.
- Does she remind you of anyone?

386
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,830
When we were growing up,
she had something.

387
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,830
She had beautiful hair
and she was built and...

388
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,880
Guys were always buying me ice cream,
giving me baseball cards,

389
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,670
kissing my ass to get in good with her.

390
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,640
Sounds a little like jealousy.

391
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,220
No guy wants his sister to be the town pump.

392
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,350
You weren't sexually threatened?

393
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,810
Jesus Christ, will you make up
your fucking sick mind?

394
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,190
First it's my mother.
Now I wanna fuck my sister?

395
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,820
It's normal, not sick,

396
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,280
that she functioned as the focus
of your early sexual feelings.

397
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,330
In fact, it was probably mutual.

398
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,540
Jesus Christ.

399
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,540
You describe her as "built".

400
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,460
All those afternoons in your
father's office, "playing house".

401
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:04,680
Whatever your bond,
what happened between then and now?

402
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,310
She fought it out with my mother

403
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,980
and finally took off first minute she could.

404
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,900
What if you had taken off?

405
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,320
That never would have happened.
I wasn't like that.

406
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,700
- I did what I was told.
- Your father's son.

407
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,370
- Yeah, that's right.
- And all that went with it.

408
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,540
That's right. All the success and the money.

409
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,750
But beyond that, what else did you inherit?

410
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,960
I'll tell you what I inherited. My mother.

411
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,510
Janice got laid. She took off.

412
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,010
She laughed at all this shit.

413
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,100
Then the trip's over and she's back
and she wants her piece.

414
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,520
Well, she gets nothing!

415
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,140
Cos I got the scars! So it's mine!

416
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,920
What are you doing?

417
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,840
Cooking. How was the call?

418
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,300
It was nothing.
It was a laundromat on Webster.

419
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,270
Thought I'd make a little dinner
like we do back home.

420
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,530
We got pasta badan.

421
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,820
Macaroni and potatoes.

422
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,320
Real peasant food.

423
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,620
We got a little salad.

424
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,830
Then pork chops and vinegar peppers.

425
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,590
I fucking miss this shit, I gotta say.

426
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,720
I can see why.

427
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,980
You gotta wait for that.

428
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,200
- What?
- Nothing.

429
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,120
I just realised...

430
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,910
the other night when you cut
the power to the church...

431
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,130
- I was a real dick.
- Yeah.

432
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,670
But it was only because I was worried.

433
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,550
Something could've happened to you.

434
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,630
That's a nice thing.

435
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,100
You don't understand.

436
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,060
Vincent...

437
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,940
I love you.

438
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,570
I love you, johnnycakes.

439
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,370
10:30, gotta be.

440
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,090
Hour and a half, lunch.

441
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,970
The halfway fucking point.

442
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,390
Don't look at your watch. Not yet.

443
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,430
Save it. Treat yourself.

444
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,270
Ten to 11...

445
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,190
maybe five of.

446
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,530
Don't look.

447
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,860
Think of those sandwiches Jim made.

448
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,660
When you've eaten the last bite,
this fucking day is halfway gone.

449
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,880
11:30, has to be.

450
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,130
Look at the angle of the sun.

451
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,380
Maybe even a quarter to 12.

452
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,800
OK, look now.

453
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,310
Fuck me!

454
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,070
Vincent!

455
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,580
Jiggle the toilet after.

456
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,450
Moment of truth?

457
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,080
It's still up to the judge,

458
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:32,500
but they're gonna recommend 15 years...

459
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,420
and 4.1 million.

460
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:40,600
You keep the home, the 45k in equity
from the girls' variable life insurance,

461
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,140
and Ginny's IRA
which is worth about 110 grand.

462
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,820
- And?
- That's it. Or go to trial.

463
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,110
15 fucking years.

464
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:01,370
You're a young man.
In 15 years, you'll be 67.

465
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,250
The golden years. Grandkids.

466
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,300
Do I have to to do the allocution?

467
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,840
You know the allocution is always part of it,

468
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,800
practically the whole point.

469
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,270
I'll take it.

470
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,570
That IRA of Ginny's...

471
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,660
she worked the tie counter at Wanamaker's.

472
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,920
That's where we met.

473
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,480
No Mocha Mix?

474
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,030
I was looking forward to blueberries,
but Mom hasn't shopped.

475
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,080
What are you doing hanging around here?

476
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,330
Finn asked me to see a movie,
but I didn't want to go

477
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,830
and I told him he could go
if he wanted to and he went.

478
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,010
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

479
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,930
Don't give it to me, OK?

480
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,470
I know. I'm sorry. It's just...

481
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,140
he doesn't fucking get it.

482
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,400
I don't know what he's thinking.

483
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,610
He spends more time
at Jeffrey's apartment than with me.

484
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,880
You know who's really good
to talk to about stuff?

485
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,790
Your mother.

486
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,130
This whole year off together,
I've seen such a selfish side.

487
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,550
"I'll come back early."
He said that. He actually said that.

488
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,190
All right, well...

489
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:39,690
Maybe he thought you wanted him to go.
You did say it.

490
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,490
Yeah, or maybe subconsciously he's done.

491
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,870
We sleep together at Jeffrey's apartment

492
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,540
and Finn sleeps on the floor half the time
and I'm right there for him.

493
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,920
When you're living in sin, you can't expect...

494
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,090
Living in what? Jesus Christ.

495
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,470
You should talk to your mother
about this shit!

496
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,180
Did you go see that guy
at the building department?

497
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:15,980
I was going to go on Friday
when the schedules are looser.

498
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,610
Well, don't.

499
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,710
Fuck!

500
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,980
Jesus. Are you all right?

501
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,890
Why the fuck are you parked here?

502
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,360
Excuse me? I'm getting my mail.
You're driving like a maniac.

503
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,650
My God. How come your airbag
didn't go off?

504
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,740
- Somebody took it out. They sold it.
- Who would do such a thing?

505
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:15,290
Look, I'm really sorry. I was in a rush.

506
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,750
- So you admit it was your fault.
- Yeah, absolutely.

507
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,250
Let me get the damages here
and I'll be on my way.

508
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,670
We should file a police report.
You got a phone?

509
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,840
No, seriously.
What do you say, 500 bucks?

510
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,760
Look, I took the worst of it.

511
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,100
And then you call your insurance on me?
No thank you.

512
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,190
I'm not gonna do that. Six?

513
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:42,690
I don't want an argument here.
My place is just up the drive.

514
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,070
We'll call the police. They'll come right out.

515
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,570
Turn on your hazards.

516
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,790
Let me get my registration.

517
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,820
Motherfucker!

518
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,700
Fucking cocksucking cunt!

519
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,280
Fuck!

520
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,590
- I was just coming to see you.
- I'm on my way home.

521
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,380
- It's just I haven't heard from you.
- The fuckheads from fuckland?

522
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,510
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be too much effort.

523
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,520
John was really counting on this.

524
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,100
And Ginny needs the money,
for Allegra, for the family.

525
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,400
What?

526
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,830
- He changed the terms.
- A bigger piece for his fat mouth?

527
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,960
No, smaller, actually, but it's the house.

528
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,880
He wants you to unload it
to his sister at a reduced price.

529
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,970
Half, actually.

530
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,300
But the New Orleans thing,

531
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:42,230
he'll knock two per cent off his finder's fee
and he'll make sure those pricks sell.

532
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,860
I guess beggars can't be choosers.

533
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:54,320
The worst part is
I gotta sell the idea to Ginny somehow.

534
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,540
Gab took me to her Moroccan tile place.

535
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,620
By the way, I don't wanna pester you.

536
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,000
Did Sil make a visit?

537
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,250
Yeah, I meant to tell you.

538
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,250
He didn't have any luck with that inspector.

539
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,630
- Really? You're kidding.
- No. Sorry about that.

540
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,180
- Did he bring him a gift?
- Cash.

541
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,020
So how hard did he lean on the guy?

542
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,690
Carm, Sil knows his business.

543
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,900
I know you're disappointed but,
I gotta say this, just sell it.

544
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:35,280
You'll get a good price.
30 per cent return on your investment.

545
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,620
So that's it? You just give up?
I don't think I ever heard that before.

546
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:45,040
The guy said no.
How far do you wanna push this thing?

547
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:54,380
Those sons of bitches.
All my planning for a fucking year!

548
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:00,100
And they let people
build those fucking monstrosities!

549
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:10,270
You wanna go out to dinner tonight at least?

550
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,900
Why not put a runner here

551
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,530
or a large diameter round Oriental?

552
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,490
It could cut down
on the echo and warm it up.

553
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:25,330
I'd rather we spend where we have to
right now. Window treatments.

554
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,670
Mr Sacrimoni, during the time period

555
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:34,050
beginning approximately
January 1st 1996 through today,

556
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,090
were you employed by or associated with

557
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,970
the New York faction of an organised
crime family of La Cosa Nostra?

558
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,390
Yes.

559
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,100
Sacrimoni allocuted in federal court,

560
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,400
admitting a ten-year connection
with La Cosa Nostra.

561
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,900
Fucking nauseating!

562
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,610
Could have been worse. He could have flipped.

563
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,280
Are you fucking kidding me?

564
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,780
You don't ever admit the existence of this thing.

565
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,290
He should have stood trial like a man.

566
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,250
I did 20 fucking years.

567
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,380
What?

568
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:25,310
Johnny Sack pleaded guilty.
It was just on the radio.

569
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,680
He got 15 years.

570
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,190
Fuck!

571
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,450
Hold on. Wait a fucking minute.

572
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,490
- Are you the owner?
- Yeah.

573
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,910
I went in for a half an hour, tops.
Douchebags make that a red zone?

574
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,750
This is a seizure order for assets
belonging to John Sacrimoni.

575
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,340
No. I bought it from his wife.

576
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,720
If she sold it, she violated
a court order freezing his assets.

577
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,760
Of course she sold it.
I paid her fucking 25 grand cash.

578
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,680
It's going to be auctioned in May.
You like it so much, buy it again.

579
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,850
This is insane,
you cocksucking motherfucker!

580
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,560
Keep talking like that.
I'm gonna get a truck out here for you.

581
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,610
To think that piece of shit
was my friend once.

582
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,200
- I hope he dies in there.
- You know how this looks?

583
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,370
I wish I was at the courthouse
to throw acid in his face,

584
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,290
just to distance myself.

585
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,420
Excuse me, Tony?

586
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,550
I've been meaning to ask you...

587
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,970
I was just wondering
about the Sacrimoni place.

588
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:47,680
- What about it?
- Now that Mr Sacrimoni is guilty,

589
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,180
do you think I could maybe
take him off my route?

590
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,190
- What the fuck did you just say?
- I don't know.

591
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:01,650
The fucking Lawnmower Man
just said John was guilty.

592
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,240
- He pled guilty, Sal. OK?
- Yeah, OK.

593
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,240
With this government, no trial.

594
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,160
Maybe they stuck tasers on his balls
and beat him with a rubber hose.

595
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,420
- You ever think of that?
- No.

596
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,880
But of course, it makes sense.

597
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,090
Don't besmirch the man, Sal.

598
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:25,720
- So about the yard...
- Do you believe this fucking guy?

599
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,520
You're done with that.

600
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,690
Come on. Let's go check out these DVDs.

601
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,630
...to take about 35 to 40 of them.

602
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:08,050
No gain, second and ten...
he's on a roll to the nearest side...

603
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,800
Gets it away and has a completionl

604
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,390
Mead, put the cavatell' in.

605
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,940
- Hey there.
- Hi.

606
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,560
- Where's Christopher?
- AA meeting.

607
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,400
- Tony?
- Yeah.

608
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,670
I just wanted to say thank you.

609
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,630
You're welcome.

610
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,640
No one's ever done something so...

611
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,350
It's OK, Janice. Really.

612
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,650
Sorry.

613
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,740
You got the wine? We're almost ready.

614
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,950
What happened?

615
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,500
No one knows what goes on in my head.

616
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,840
What's the matter? What happened?

617
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,220
She's happy about the house.

618
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,430
Honey, it's OK. It's OK.

619
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,690
- Come on. You OK?
- Yeah.

620
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,190
- You all right?
- Yeah.
