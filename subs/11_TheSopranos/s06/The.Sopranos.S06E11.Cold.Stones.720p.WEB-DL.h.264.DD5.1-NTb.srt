1
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,160
So every time I asked
you "How's work?" and you said "Fine,"

2
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,590
you were having your own private
little joke on me?

3
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,930
What's going on?

4
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,730
I went to Blockbuster
today to rent "Cinderella Man"

5
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,370
- and guess what?
- ls it still a classic?

6
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,840
I found out
that our son-- the liar--

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,770
had been fired
three weeks ago.

8
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,880
From Blockbuster?
How the fuck do you do that?

9
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,680
They got Rhesus monkeys
working as managers over there.

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,010
He was taking promotional items
and selling them-- posters, standups.

11
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,160
Standees!
This whole thing's bullshit.

12
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,880
Most of that stuff
gets thrown out anyway.

13
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,030
The store's policy
was very clear.

14
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,560
Well maybe I care
about the environment.

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,060
Did that ever occur to you?
"Wallace and Gromit,"

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,570
I mean, that weighed like 50 lbs. How
many trees gave their lives for that?

17
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,140
It just goes to the dump.

18
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,040
Can I come home to a peaceful
house one goddamn night?

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,610
You tell me to think like
a businessman,

20
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,800
yet every time
I do there's something wrong.

21
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,710
I made money promoting parties
in high school, that was no good.

22
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,080
- Now this.
- You know what I think?

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,950
All those days you go in late, you call
in sick, you deserve to get canned.

24
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,380
The worst part is
you don't even give a shit.

25
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,050
What, I should care about Blockbuster?
Fucking religious fanatics!

26
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,130
I can't live on what
they pay me anyway.

27
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,530
Why not?!
You live at home! We feed you!

28
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,260
You have a social life
but I can't?

29
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,060
You have any idea what
it costs at a decent club in New York?

30
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,830
It's $500 for a bottle of Cristal,
and it's a two-bottle minimum.

31
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,670
You spend $ 1,000 a night
on champagne?

32
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,310
No, not every night.

33
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,010
All right, barely ever.
And Hernan, everybody--

34
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,980
we take turns
picking up the tab.

35
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,880
Hernan? Or the girl he crippled
when he flipped over the car?

36
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,890
ls she there, drinking champagne
with you... in her wheelchair?

37
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,960
It wasn't his fault.

38
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,060
Her parents are going
for a big payday

39
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,630
because his dad was
in "Forbes" magazine.

40
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,630
Oh God Almighty!

41
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,770
If it makes you feel any better
I've been looking for a new job--

42
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,307
SjÃ¤lvklart, raring.

43
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:36,304
Jag Ã¥ker till Kalifornien och jag
vet inte nÃ¤r jag kommer tillbaka.

44
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,370
Are you fucking kidding me?
You should be kissing her feet.

45
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,700
Because when you were growing up,
if it wasn't for her,

46
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,140
I would have knocked
all your baby teeth out with one shot.

47
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,350
I can't sleep.

48
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,620
- AJ.
- Somebody call?

49
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,030
It's not only that he's
a complete stranger to the truth,

50
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,660
he's got this dead streak in him.
It chills me to the bone.

51
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,210
He's fuckin' spoiled, that's all.
We gave him too much.

52
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,940
Come on, he went to school
with lots of privileged kids.

53
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,570
Most of them are off in Ivy League
universities now, doing very well.

54
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,410
No, this is something in him.

55
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,570
Deep down it's like this big
"Fuck you" to everything.

56
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,450
I don't know
what that's about.

57
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,680
Remember that whole God-is-dead
business on the day of his confirmation?

58
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,090
Maybe he'll surprise us.

59
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,890
Aren't you the sunny optimist
when you want to go to sleep?

60
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,630
- I saw the light was on. Can I come in?
- Sure, hon'.

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm going to California.
I don't know for how long.

62
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,940
California?
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,080
Finn took that year off.
And it was great

64
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,980
when Dad was hurt--
he was here for me.

65
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,050
But now he's going back to dental
school, I want to be with him.

66
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,520
I thought you two
were having problems.

67
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,090
I never said that.

68
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,830
I don't know if I want to go
to law school or med school.

69
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,300
Those are nice
options to have.

70
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
That's what we call
a high-class problem.

71
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,130
His dad said
that he can get me

72
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,330
a lab job at UCLA
where he teaches oral surgery.

73
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,100
I mean, if I decide
on med school

74
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,340
that will look really great
on my application.

75
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,070
What you're really saying is you're
following this man to California.

76
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,780
Meadow, you drop this bomb on us
at 1:30 in the morning--

77
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,420
forgive us if we need
some time to adjust.

78
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,720
- I have to make plane reservations--
- You'll be back for Christmas?

79
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,420
I don't know.
No pressure please, okay?

80
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,750
Tidelands project--
your slice of no-shows--

81
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,420
I spoke to the union
and we can't make five work no more.

82
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,260
Rollbacks, not to mention
my end's way down.

83
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,660
Now more than ever
I got captains looking to me

84
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,560
to deliver them
those no-show jobs

85
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,730
- on account of the medical insurance.
- Health care costs these days.

86
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,170
Bitch all you want
about John, he understood

87
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,810
that ours is
a mutually beneficial arrangement.

88
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,350
John's folding laundry
in fucking Danbury.

89
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,040
It's on my shoulders
to take care of the family,

90
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,450
even if he's
boss just in name.

91
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,290
Now I made a decision,
and with all due respect, it's final.

92
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,650
You see, this is what I get.

93
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,950
I never should have let
you slide on the vitamins.

94
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,060
Again with the vitamins.

95
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,100
You told me there were
1500 cases of Centrums on that truck.

96
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,760
When your nephew delivered it,
there were cartons ripped open,

97
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,840
pills all over the floor.
Anybody got shorted,

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,630
it was yours truly,
but you know what--

99
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,970
All right, all right, all right,
put it back in your pocket.

100
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,340
But I gotta get some relief
on this other situation.

101
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,920
For the Supreme Commanders,
control over the sworn enemy's

102
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,060
capital city is the epitome
of their power in Europe.

103
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,030
I need to talk to you. Remember I told
you about that trip to Paris?

104
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,070
I won it at the silent auction
at the feast.

105
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,540
Well, the date is here and I think
I would like to go.

106
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,050
You don't remember the first goddamn
thing about this, do you?

107
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,880
We stood right here talking
about it for 15 minutes.

108
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,680
- I know, you won a trip to Paris.
- Why do you have to lie?

109
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,020
I'm not! You're always
saying I'm lying.

110
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,260
Why Paris?

111
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,660
It is one of the great cities
of the world.

112
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,300
But the frogs hate us.

113
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,640
Go to Italy.

114
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,170
They weren't auctioning
a trip to Italy.

115
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,240
It's actually a good deal.
It's a week for two for $5, 000.

116
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,880
How's the euro doing?

117
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,110
I don't know, Tony.

118
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,080
I had three years
of high-school French.

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,750
- I can't get away for a week, Carm.
- I could go with Ro.

120
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,520
We've been talking
about taking a trip together for years--

121
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,720
ever since our Rome thing
went belly up.

122
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,590
Oh yeah... when Anthony walked
through the plate-glass door.

123
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,400
I could really use a vacation now--
Meadow leaving,

124
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,130
my spec house-- the thought of tearing
it down and starting over,

125
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,170
- it makes me nauseous.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,640
Plus him. I just don't
know what to do anymore.

127
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,380
You know what?
You should go.

128
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,250
You deserve it.

129
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,510
It'd be good for you too.
Do whatever it is

130
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,560
that boys do when
they're on their own.

131
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,560
Whatever.
I said go.

132
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,030
I'll be fine.

133
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,100
I'm so excited.
I'm gonna call Ro.

134
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,810
Oh, wait, wait!
Look.

135
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,650
Tony? Hey.

136
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,520
What the fuck?

137
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,190
My brother's over there.

138
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,800
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. He's just there, that's all.

139
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,530
You sandbag me, I cut
your fucking throat open.

140
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,840
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what else to do.

141
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
I want back in.

142
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,610
- Can I sit?
- No, you can't sit.

143
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,810
It was complicated.
I was working things out.

144
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,920
I'm sure it gets complicated when you're
taking it up your fag ass.

145
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm not a fag.
I never was.

146
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,230
- Excuse me?
- It was the medication I was on.

147
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,290
For my blood pressure.

148
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,460
It fucked with my head,
but I'm over that now.

149
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,430
I can probably get
a letter from my doctor.

150
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,870
A note from your doctor
saying you don't like to suck cock?

151
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,900
First off,

152
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,940
I pay my way back in.

153
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,980
I got 200K that goes directly
to you personally.

154
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,840
No one else
needs to know.

155
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,690
Long term, I know
construction's out.

156
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,450
Those guys--

157
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,490
but meth, running girls,

158
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,420
a lot more
tolerant atmosphere.

159
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,330
I got contacts in A. C.

160
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,330
With your support
I could set myself up there.

161
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,830
I'd be close
but not too close.

162
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,630
Ton'!

163
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,540
Please, don't turn
your back on me.

164
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,650
He was fucking
stalking you, T.

165
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,550
That's the thing
with the gays.

166
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,980
It's the living in the closet,
makes them devious.

167
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,020
Speaking of crystal meth,
look at this walyo.

168
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,360
Say what you will
about Richie Aprile,

169
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,430
but when he found out
his son was gay,

170
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,720
he did the right thing.
He disowned him.

171
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,060
I got an AA meeting.

172
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,410
Alcoholics-fucking-Anonymous
now too...

173
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,940
Salvatore Lucania must be looking
down on all of us with great pride.

174
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,410
There's gonna be a lot
of popular sentiment

175
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,240
to get rid of Vito.
Phil alone--

176
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,320
Fuck Phil!

177
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,550
You know what that's about? He's gotta
polish his rep as a tough prick

178
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,490
so he can make boss.
Vito in Atlantic City...

179
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,150
he's out there.
He's not part of us.

180
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,960
And we get, you know, a trickle
of cash coming in each month.

181
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,180
- You ready?
- Oh, there's so much going on here,

182
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,190
just the thought of flying,
the heightened security...

183
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,790
Come on.

184
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,200
I got something for you,
for your trip.

185
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,400
Now this is the real
Louis "Vitoon."

186
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,430
You had a rough year--
me in the hospital,

187
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,510
you there
around the clock--

188
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,050
I want you
to enjoy yourself.

189
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,780
Hmm?

190
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,260
When you were in that coma,
I told you I loved you.

191
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,920
- Do you remember?
- No.

192
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,500
- I should tell you more often.
- Well...

193
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,530
nobody's stopping ya.

194
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,910
Okay, listen up, kids.

195
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,670
Francesca,
look at me.

196
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,110
You can't tell anyone,
even your friends at school,

197
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,550
that Daddy's home
for a little while.

198
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,740
Are you gonna have to
go back to Afghanistan?

199
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,260
The CIA doesn't tell you
where they'll send you next.

200
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,450
ls it dangerous
to be a spy?

201
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,990
Not as long as nobody
knows who you are.

202
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,430
I'm what they call
"working deep cover."

203
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,070
That's why,
like I said,

204
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,640
- you gotta keep the secret.
- I won't tell.

205
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,740
- You better not!
- I won't!

206
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,910
I love you guys.

207
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,420
How long till you can
move back in with us?

208
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,750
Just until I straighten
this shit out with Tony.

209
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,820
It's looking good.

210
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,260
In a few days
I'll know.

211
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,360
What about counseling
for your problem?

212
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,560
- Have you talked to Father Macken?
- Marie,

213
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,270
I thought I made it clear--
I don't have a problem.

214
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,210
That's over with.

215
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,210
In fact,

216
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,680
I'm seriously thinking
we should have another kid.

217
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,220
Yo, Dad, check it!

218
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,090
Attaboy, V!

219
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,040
Hello?

220
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,640
Hi.

221
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,180
Fuck you.

222
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,320
- I know, look--
- Not a word, not a note.

223
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,580
- What kind of person are you?
- I'm sorry.

224
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,310
You need help.
You're seriously fucked-up.

225
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,490
I got kids.
I couldn't live without 'em.

226
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,720
Bullshit.

227
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,660
It was the fucking life
you couldn't live without--

228
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,990
the gambling, the money,
who knows what else.

229
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,730
You're right. I didn't want to drag you
down into this pit I'm in.

230
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,000
Hey, fuck that! Everybody else
is stupid to you, aren't they?

231
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,040
- No.
- You can throw your weight around

232
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,770
down there in fucking Jersey.
Everybody kisses your ass.

233
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,150
- I miss you.
- I don't want to know you.

234
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,080
I don't want to hear your voice.
Don't ever call me again.

235
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,440
Do your bowels just
jam up when you fly?

236
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,600
Hey-yyy!

237
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,170
Hopalong Che-se-dic'.

238
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,200
What do you know?
What do you say?

239
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,010
- How you been?
- Word is you reached out to Tony.

240
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,310
I appreciate you coming out to see me.
How you doin'?

241
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,620
Nicole is choking my balls
with this child support.

242
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,820
I could be looking at
six months in County.

243
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,260
I was wondering if you could
float me 20K at two points...

244
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,890
but maybe now is not
a good time for you.

245
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,560
No. No,
I could do that.

246
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,760
But I'm gonna have to say
two and a half.

247
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,870
Okay. You know
I'm good for it.

248
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,910
Would you stop?

249
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,090
Heard on 1010-WINS
the tunnel's a parking lot.

250
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,750
I hope you didn't
get caught in that.

251
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,460
You said you were gonna take care
of that fucking finook.

252
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,030
Oh, for Christ's sake. Fucking Vito
again? What the fuck is wrong with you?

253
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,140
He's in town, isn't he?
I was at Marie's the other night.

254
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,970
She played the innocent,
but I could tell she'd seen him.

255
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,200
You're fucking
"Carnac the Great" now too, huh?

256
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,540
I gotta tell you, Anthony,
if Vito was here

257
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,810
- and you knew about it...
- Fuck this.

258
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,480
I love they let you
smoke here.

259
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,960
I think I should have slept
in a while before hitting the stores.

260
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,150
I told you.

261
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,930
- ls your stomach still upset?
- I put in the fucking memory stick.

262
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,770
I love that sound--
French.

263
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,430
It's so elegant.

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,950
Isn't it?

265
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,180
Nobody fucking knows us here, Ro.
Can you believe that?

266
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,220
All the guidebooks say you should
try and get on the local schedule.

267
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,520
- Did you reset your watch?
- Yes, Napoleon. Jesus.

268
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,060
Eloise and Abelard,
my God!

269
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,100
What?

270
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,870
I would say today the first cultural
stop should be the Louvre.

271
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,700
Again, Remy!

272
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,670
- How do you say "please"?
- S'il vous plait.

273
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,500
- S'il vous plait.
- And the check please.

274
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,380
I don't know
what the fuck he said.

275
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,210
You keep talking English.
Why don't you try and use your French?

276
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,850
I don't know.
I feel strange.

277
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,550
Me and Tony went to Miami.
He knows like six words in Spanish,

278
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,320
but he was right out there with them

279
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,290
like he was fucking
Ricardo Montalban or something.

280
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,550
Mmm.

281
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,870
I told you we should have
gone towards Rue Dauphine.

282
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,500
God damn it, where's my other glove?
I had it when we went in there.

283
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,270
I'm all turned around.

284
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,170
You had to hurry me
out of that restaurant.

285
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,470
- We're miles from the Louvre.
- Fuck, damn it. I already lost a glove.

286
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,020
Oh my God.

287
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,320
Holy shit.

288
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,900
Look at those clouds.
Paris skies...

289
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,410
Who could have built this?

290
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,990
Look!
Just like "Charade"!

291
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,930
Make sure you clean
that shit off her tit!

292
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,710
Vito-- Atlantic City,
forget it.

293
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,870
Why the changeup?

294
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,610
I can't keep
fighting Phil on this.

295
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,720
Our businesses
are all entwined.

296
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,290
You gotta pick your battles. You want
your no-show jobs, Vito's gotta go.

297
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,320
It's the right move, T.

298
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,860
All those weeks
in the hospital,

299
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,300
surgeries, constant pain,
for what?

300
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Come out here and get shot
over something like this?

301
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,500
If Vito wanted to pursue
that lifestyle,

303
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,910
he should have
done so quietly.

304
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,670
He was, wasn't he?

305
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,610
Anyone in particular
you want to give this to?

306
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,550
Carlo had the biggest
problem with it, let him handle it.

307
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,890
It's Vito's own fault.
Why couldn't he stay

308
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,860
wherever
the fuck he was?

309
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,230
Don't beat yourself up
about this.

310
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,710
I'll tell Carlo
to be at the mall.

311
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,920
Hi, it's me.

312
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,720
I just wanted to let you know that
we got in safe and sound.

313
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,490
Call me back. Remember,
it's six hours ahead.

314
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,600
Miss you.

315
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,930
I notice all these little plaques
all over-- what do they say?

316
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,940
"August 20, 1944.

317
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,690
This man Francois Martine
fought in the Resistance

318
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,220
and the Germans shot him
right here on this spot."

319
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,260
Phil?

320
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,860
What the fuck did that tailor
do to my Zanella's?

321
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,430
- What?
- My slacks, what!

322
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,260
He's losing his eyesight,
poveret'. Diabetes.

323
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,410
I'll take them to the Korean on my way
to church tomorrow.

324
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,200
I've got a meeting
of Concerned Catholic Mothers.

325
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,000
Tell you the truth,

326
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,370
I almost want to not go
to the meeting.

327
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,210
- Here we go.
- A gay in our own family?

328
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,820
This Protestant minister from Denver
is coming to speak to us tomorrow.

329
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,620
An expert.

330
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,390
I'm so embarrassed
in front of Father.

331
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,400
Father told me Vito doesn't
renounce that lifestyle

332
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,540
- he's damned.
- I know.

333
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,760
- What?
- I know.

334
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,470
Father put it so well
last week.

335
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,700
"There's nothing gay
about hell," he said.

336
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,350
That's good. I'm sure he didn't
come up with that himself.

337
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,280
One thing I do know,

338
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,980
Vito has to be made to face
his problem squarely.

339
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,610
Thanks for the ride.

340
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,510
New York's only
classic rock station :

341
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,490
- Q104.3
- Here.

342
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,890
You don't need to do that,
but you're sweet.

343
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,120
Okay.

344
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,980
Yeah?

345
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,060
I was just wondering if
you thought about my offer.

346
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,590
Yeah, I thought, and I need to know
who these Atlantic City contacts are.

347
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,790
Meet me in the mall, 11:00.
Don't be late.

348
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,220
- Get him up.
- No!

349
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,860
- Come here, come here.
- Shut up.

350
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,020
Don't be moving.
Stop.

351
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,710
You're a fucking disgrace.

352
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,620
... husband comes home
with a duck under his arm, he says,

353
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,690
"This is the pig
I've been fucking."

354
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,490
The wife says,
"It's not a pig, it's a duck."

355
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,390
He says, "I wasn't
talking to you."

356
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,870
Vito... he was found
beat to death this morning

357
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,600
in a motel in Fort Lee.

358
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,440
- My cop up there told me.
- Minchia.

359
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,640
Plus the homicide detectives told him

360
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,750
Vito had a pool cue
rammed up his ass.

361
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,630
- Lover's quarrel maybe?
- Look, we all know who did it.

362
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,400
Phil! The fucking balls
on that prick!

363
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,570
What did I always
say about him?

364
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,320
I see you
heard the news.

365
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,550
- That must have been Phil, right?
- Jimmy Olsen over here.

366
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,630
I know he's out of line, but still,
you kind of have to admire the guy.

367
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,700
It's not all talk
with him.

368
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,530
I'm just saying he saved us
all a lot of trouble, right?

369
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,780
Can't have been an easy decision,
killing a made guy, huh?

370
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,320
Naturally Phil won't brag
about it 'cause he can't.

371
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,920
Phil was in a tough situation,
his family honor was stained.

372
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,420
If I got to Vito first,
net result would have been the same.

373
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,120
Fucking-A.

374
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,860
I wish I'd have
borrowed money from Vito.

375
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,550
You know what
this is, right?

376
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,080
It's not about Vito,
it's about me.

377
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,550
Phil's saying he can do whatever
the fuck he wants,

378
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,740
including kill a captain
in my own family

379
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,080
and I can't do
a fucking thing about it.

380
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,120
It's always been
partly about that.

381
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,520
Believe me, the vitamins
are just the beginning.

382
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,160
It's Carmela.

383
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,130
- ls Paris burning?
- Hi, you busy?

384
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,610
No, no, just
bullshitting with Sil.

385
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,370
How's it goin'?

386
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,570
Actually it's cold,
raining.

387
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,050
- When it drizzles, huh?
- You're worse than Ro.

388
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,850
I'm going out of my mind
with these pop references.

389
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,220
I am seeing some
incredible things, Tony.

390
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,090
Talk about the History Channel,
you would love it here.

391
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,420
- How's the toast?
- The what?

392
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,190
The French toast?

393
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,800
Actually they call it
something else.

394
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,130
- How's the French fries?
- Pommes allumettes.

395
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,270
- Fuck it.
- Have you heard from Meadow?

396
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,960
More than I
thought.

397
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,670
You realize this kid knows
how to do absolutely nothing?

398
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,640
She was asking if she needed
to get the car serviced regularly

399
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,080
'cause there's no snow
out there.

400
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,840
- How's Prince Albert?
- He'd fit right in over in France.

401
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,080
None of those dipshits
want to work either.

402
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,310
I did get him to hose down
the trash cans though.

403
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,960
That's something.

404
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,930
You're probably busy.
I'll let you go.

405
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,260
I just wanted to say hello.
I miss you.

406
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,400
I miss you too.
Be careful, eh?

407
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,110
People are gonna
expect a response.

408
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,440
See, this is what the fuck
I was talking about.

409
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,280
- We hit one of Phil's guys?
- Joe Bananas went after Carlo Gambino.

410
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,750
Made guys got killed,
the war went seven years.

411
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,450
How many times
do I gotta say this?

412
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,220
When guys are on the mattresses,
they're not out earning.

413
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,920
So? What?

414
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,270
All Phil cares about
is fucking money.

415
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,440
He's got that wire room
in Sheepshead Bay, right?

416
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,810
- Our guys have seen it.
- Yeah.

417
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,300
I live in Las Vegas
six months.

418
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,970
My friend has a restaurant.
I work there.

419
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,740
- I like U. S.A.
- And I like France.

420
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,980
Ro, are you coming
or what?

421
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,680
- Okay, you call me, yeah?
- D'accord.

422
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,900
He lives
in Belleville.

423
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,970
They've got a Belleville
in France.

424
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,230
You're not really gonna
go out with him, are you?

425
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,670
- I mean he's like 26 years old.
- Duh!

426
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,880
God, isn't this pretty?

427
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,040
"1350 A.D."

428
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,880
You realize some woman
just like us wore this?

429
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,420
She was probably married,
had children.

430
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,660
"Gallo Roman baths,

431
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,420
third century."

432
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
I wonder what they
got up to there, huh?

433
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,770
This city is so old.

434
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,240
You think about
all the people who have lived here,

435
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,470
generation
after generation,

436
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,280
hundreds and hundreds of years,
all those lives.

437
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,920
God, it's so sad.

438
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,360
I mean, it isn't sad,
I don't know. It just makes you think,

439
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,820
just makes you look
at yourself differently.

440
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,670
There was this one night in the hospital
when it was very touch-and-go with Tony.

441
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,100
- Mm-hmm.
- He came out of the coma for a minute

442
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,140
and he said, "Who am I?
Where am I going?"

443
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,450
At the time I didn't know
what he meant.

444
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,990
But coming here,

445
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,620
I feel the same way.
Isn't that odd?

446
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,620
Let me get a picture.

447
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,890
Oh, honey, what?

448
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,930
We worry so much.

449
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,570
Sometimes it feels
like that's all we do,

450
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,430
but in the end it just
gets washed away.

451
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,300
All of it just--
just gets washed away.

452
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,850
Come here. Oh.

453
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,920
I know what
the papers are saying,

454
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,030
but the police think it might've
not have been a gay thing.

455
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,790
Marie, honey,

456
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,130
they pick up strangers
in bars and truck stops.

457
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,570
The way they beat him--
oh God, his face.

458
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,300
He didn't even look like
a person anymore.

459
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,710
You can't let
your mind dwell on--

460
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,610
Turn that off!

461
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,480
Aunt Cel' hasn't called.
Not even to talk to the kids.

462
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,630
How could people
be so cruel?

463
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,350
It is a sin
after all, Marie.

464
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,430
The Church is
very clear on that.

465
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,760
But you're here.
You came.

466
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,460
Father always says
"Hate the sin,

467
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,300
love the sinner."

468
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,700
I wish I was dead.

469
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,670
I mean it,
I wish I was dead!

470
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,010
You know what?
I'll make the funeral arrangements.

471
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,710
You're in no condition.
Given the circumstances,

472
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,180
a small private service,
just the immediate family.

473
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,310
He was a good man,
wasn't he, Phil?

474
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,930
He was. I loved him like
a brother-in-law.

475
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,020
But God moves
in strange ways.

476
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,030
Our tailor, he's going blind,
47 years old.

477
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,260
Walk in those shoes.

478
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,670
And I gotta think, Marie,
Vito on some level--

479
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,280
maybe it's better for the kids
not to have that role model.

480
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,230
So...

481
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,300
all the women
in your house are gone.

482
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,270
How do you feel about Carmela
taking a trip without you?

483
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,710
Do we really have
to fucking talk about this?

484
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,210
Of course not.

485
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,710
Before we end,
is there anything you'd like to discuss?

486
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,790
Okay.

487
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,470
How about the fact
that I hate my son?

488
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,730
I come home and he's sitting
on the computer

489
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,500
in his fucking
underwear.

490
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,730
Wasting his time
in some chitchat room,

491
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,400
going back and forth
with some other fucking jerkoff,

492
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,410
giggling like
a little schoolgirl.

493
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,880
I want to fucking smash
his fucking face in.

494
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,280
My son.

495
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,750
What do you think
about that?

496
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,920
Anthony, I think
your anger towards AJ

497
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,750
has been building
for some time.

498
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,260
We have to deal
with this.

499
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,560
All I know is it's a good thing
my father's not alive,

500
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,360
because he'd find
this fucking hilarious.

501
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,030
Find what hilarious?

502
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,900
The kind of...
son I produced.

503
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,730
You mean because Anthony
doesn't conform

504
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,400
to your father's idea
of what a man should be?

505
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,070
His, mine or anybody's.

506
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,080
Let me tell you--

507
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,820
if Carmela let me kick AJ's ass like
my father kicked my ass,

508
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,650
he might have grown up
with some balls.

509
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,420
- Like you.
- Yeah, like me.

510
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,530
He might have
also grown up

511
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,460
taking out his anger

512
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,500
at his father's brutality
towards him on others.

513
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,040
He might have grown up
with a desperate need

514
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,870
to dominate and control.

515
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,840
Anthony, we've been
dancing around this for years--

516
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,380
how you live.

517
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,220
What is it you want
from your life?

518
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,030
I couldn't even hit him
if I wanted to,

519
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,790
he's so fucking little.
It's Carmela's side of the family,

520
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,800
they're small people.
Her father-- you could

521
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,770
knock him over
with a fucking feather.

522
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,840
Okay.

523
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,710
But I have to point out

524
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,010
what you resent Carmela
doing for AJ--

525
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,670
protecting him
from his father--

526
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,580
is the very thing
you had often wished

527
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,410
your mother
had done for you.

528
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,920
I love this fois gras.
I can't get enough.

529
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,730
The presentation alone
gives you calories, but who cares?

530
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,960
We should feel guilty?
We walked our asses off.

531
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,370
Man, you know
what's strange, Ro?

532
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,070
When you go to a place
you've never been before, it's like...

533
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,950
all the people were imaginary
till you got there.

534
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,320
It's like until you saw them,
they never existed,

535
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
and you never
existed to them.

536
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,060
I don't know, maybe you're
more a philosophical person than I am.

537
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,890
No, no, it just made me think,
that's all.

538
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,720
You know, it's the same as
when you die--

539
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,890
life goes on
without you.

540
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,760
Like it does in Paris
when we're not here.

541
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,000
Tomorrow we hit
the stores.

542
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,670
- Chloe, Dior.
- A Kelly bag pour moi.

543
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,010
Bordeaux
is so delicious.

544
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,170
When we were
in St. Eustache's

545
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,150
I noticed that
you lit two candles,

546
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,220
for Jackie
and Jackie Jr., right?

547
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,830
You know, we never really
talked about that.

548
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,960
- About what?
- About Jackie Jr.

549
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,830
What's there
to talk about?

550
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,290
Madame.

551
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,240
- Oof, Madonn'.
- Pour madame...

552
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,920
- Merci.
- Oh boy!

553
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,990
I didn't mean
to invade, Ro.

554
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,820
It's just--
I mean, we're friends.

555
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,160
If there was anything
you wanted to share...

556
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,130
I mean, I cannot

557
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,770
begin to imagine
losing a son.

558
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,210
Jesus, Carm.

559
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,870
We're on vacation.
We're having a beautiful dinner.

560
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,350
Why would you
bring this up?

561
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,380
I didn't mean
to upset you, Ro.

562
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,490
I thought because we had
this time together--

563
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,250
It's fucking morbid,
that's what it is.

564
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,150
I'm sorry, Ro.

565
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,690
He's dead. He's gone.

566
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,700
What can I do about it?

567
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,960
Light a candle.

568
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,340
I picture him
with his dad,

569
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,670
and with his grandma
who he loved,

570
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,710
and with Jesus.

571
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,610
What's the matter
with you?

572
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,710
Why would you bring
New Jersey here?

573
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,220
- Why can't we just have a good time?
- You're right, I apologize.

574
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,990
I'm going out
with Michel tonight.

575
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,460
Okay.

576
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,800
You know, you're welcome
to come, Carm.

577
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,240
- I mean that.
- Thank you, but no. You go.

578
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,280
I want to walk along
the Seine one more time.

579
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,090
We gotta call the exterminator.
These are rat turds.

580
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,920
What time did Patsy
and them say?

581
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,720
There they are!
The pirates of prosciutt',

582
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,160
- the brigands of bracioll'.
- Hey, Dom.

583
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,400
Game out in Canarsie.
I appreciate the rollers you sent.

584
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,140
Linguini fra diav',
you want to stay?

585
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,370
Naw, I gotta stop by
my daughter's in Metuchen.

586
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,250
Hey... sorry to hear
about your boy.

587
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,590
Uh-huh.

588
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,050
Terrible thing.

589
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,990
Son 13, daughter
nine years old.

590
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,990
Syracuse--
tanked again.

591
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,730
That pool cue--
I wonder if it was chalked.

592
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,100
Very funny, Dom.
Very cute.

593
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,240
I don't quite get it,
but cute.

594
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,140
Hey, you know the autopsy
found a three ball in his side pocket?

595
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,440
- You're on a run.
- They found a hankie

596
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,450
with Carlo's lipstick
in his other pocket.

597
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,210
I'm just breaking balls.

598
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,450
You're right though--
shouldn't laugh about a tragedy.

599
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,930
That old homo actor--
Ramon Navarro?

600
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,500
He had an ivory dildo
stuck up his ass when they found him.

601
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,540
Pretty up on all this shit,
huh, Dom?

602
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,510
Come to think of it,
he was from Jersey too.

603
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,040
What'd they find
up your mother's cunt?

604
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,440
Time to hit the trail
for Metuchen, huh, what do you say?

605
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,170
My mistake.

606
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,940
Carlo's lipstick
was on Vito's cock.

607
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,040
Hit him!
Hit that prick!

608
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,550
No, Carlo!

609
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,420
Carlo!

610
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,390
Get him off me!

611
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,820
How's that, you fuck?

612
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,760
OlÄÂ©!

613
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,450
Fuck!

614
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,560
Call Patsy and them,

615
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,500
say we had to leave...
a pipe broke.

616
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,200
We wait till the store closes,
we get him out.

617
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,040
Cut him up
in the work area?

618
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,310
No more of that.

619
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,540
Uh, DNA.

620
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,380
Ditch his car,

621
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,320
get some biangaleen.

622
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,280
Sil!

623
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,280
Come on, open the door!

624
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,050
- Shit.
- Hello, anybody in there?

625
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,990
Ton', you don't want
to come in here.

626
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,250
- Get back in your car, go for a ride.
- What?

627
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,240
Fat Dom Gamiello
came over,

628
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:19,270
you know, just to break balls
re Vito,

629
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,910
Carlo...

630
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,310
Sil hit him
first.

631
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,980
Tony,
let me just--

632
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,620
That's right, Ton', you go.
You don't know nothin'.

633
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,990
You were right. They kill a made guy,
this is what happens.

634
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,760
Say hello to Gab.
Tell her I hope she's over the flu.

635
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,660
Goddamn Vito!

636
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,270
What's the hardest thing
about skateboarding?

637
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,430
I give up. What's the hardest thing
about skateboarding?

638
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,770
Telling your parents
you're gay.

639
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,380
Signore.

640
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,880
I thought you were
going out for dinner.

641
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,180
See you in the garage
a minute?

642
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,920
What now?

643
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:52,160
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.
You go to this address.

644
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,460
You ask for
a Mr. Caravalho.

645
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,430
- I just got off the phone with him.
- At 7:00 in the morning?!

646
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,700
- For what?
- You're gonna be working construction.

647
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,140
- What?
- Ferrying cement in a wheelbarrow.

648
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,440
- So, it's outdoors?
- Yeah.

649
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,580
Well, it's wintertime.

650
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,980
You've got a lot of those hooded
sweatshirts--

651
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,910
like the mulignans wear
that you watch on MTV.

652
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,520
- You can double up.
- Come on, this is bullshit.

653
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,380
Every penny you make, you keep.
We won't charge you any rent.

654
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,790
And believe me, the pay is good.
It's a union job.

655
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,270
I just want
to see you do good.

656
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,930
You're my son
and I love you.

657
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,780
Look, I 'm just gonna
have to leave your friend

658
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:40,410
in the lurch
when I go back to school.

659
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,600
That's okay, he deals
with that all the time.

660
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,840
I'd just as soon
keep searching online.

661
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,110
I'm sure you would,

662
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,550
but if you're not at that site
tomorrow morning,

663
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,520
I'm gonna
take away your car.

664
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,660
And then I'm gonna
take away your clothes.

665
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,660
And then I'm gonna
take away your room

666
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,060
and then I'm gonna take away your
mother's cooking.

667
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,700
And pretty soon you're gonna
be out in the fucking street.

668
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,610
What the hell
are you doing?

669
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:19,310
It might get a little drafty
driving down there tomorrow.

670
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,480
But I will have this fucking
thing towed out of here

671
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,150
and ground up
into fucking Brillo pads.

672
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,050
I mean, look at it.
You don't take care of it.

673
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,260
Don't put me
to the test.

674
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,830
Look, I found Cosette.

675
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,840
Your friend-- someone
needs to tell her she's dead.

676
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,670
Your taxi
is coming.

677
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,800
Bonsoir, madame.

678
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,940
Shit! The Toulouse-Lautrec
placemats.

679
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,180
I got the other one.

680
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:42,990
There she is!
The world traveler.

681
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,190
- Mmm.
- Hey!

682
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,260
- How was your trip?
- Oh my God, Tony.

683
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,930
Welcome home.

684
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,770
How was the trip?

685
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:56,670
Oh my God, Ma, Paris!

686
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:01,870
"Police are withholding
specific details of the murder.

687
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,740
A Brooklyn relative
of Spatafore

688
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,580
who spoke on conditions
of anonymity--"

689
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,550
What does that mean?

690
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,820
It means...

691
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,320
when you don't know
who the person is.

692
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,520
"--told reporters that
Spatafore and his wife

693
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,760
had recently separated.

694
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,200
Relatives say
that the victim

695
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,860
had surprised
his friends and family

696
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,840
by declaring
himself a homosexual

697
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,500
and saying he wished to lead
an openly gay lifestyle."

698
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,080
I don't understand.

699
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,780
Dad wasn't a spy?

700
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,950
No.

701
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,700
With this jet lag,
I can't sleep.

702
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,170
I'm doing darks
if you have any.

703
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,370
Have a great day at work.

704
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,520
- Hey, I knew this guy.
- What?

705
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,000
He was in the mob?

706
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,220
I shot him
for The Thin Club. Here.
