1
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
Whoa whoa
whoa whoa!

2
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,500
Stop dumping.
Stop dumping.

3
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,090
- What is matter?
- Lower your bed.

4
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,830
You can't dump here no more.
You need to talk to your boss.

5
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,710
Always we are
dumping here.

6
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,640
Caballero, put the shit
back in your truck.

7
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,480
What?
That is huge job!

8
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,350
Where I am supposed
to be dumping this now?

9
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,870
Asbestos.

10
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,640
I just now find out it's asbestos
you've been dumping over there.

11
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,810
What did you
think it was?

12
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,540
I never asked.

13
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,950
Tampax-- what the fuck
do I know?

14
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,580
Well, now you know.

15
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,680
You and your friend there Stefano
have been pocketing how much

16
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,880
on this cowboys-and-Indians
asbestos removal?

17
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,390
Billing the townships

18
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,520
like you're following
all the EPA regulations.

19
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,000
You got the same scam, Phil, so why
don't we cut through the bullshit?

20
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,090
How much you figure
you're owed on this?

21
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,430
- 25%.
- Don't be an asshole.

22
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,230
You know, there's close monitoring
at every fucking landfill.

23
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,530
Maybe if somebody had been upfront
with me from the beginning.

24
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,410
Nobody's been hiding nothing. I had the
same dumping deal with what's-his-name,

25
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,070
the operation's manager since I've been
there at Barone Sanitation.

26
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,510
You're not there
no more. I am.

27
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,450
You're enjoying your generous
severance package.

28
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,680
25%-- that's not
gonna happen.

29
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,850
You've got a backyard,
a pool, dump it there.

30
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,260
That's my only
other suggestion.

31
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,360
He's got us by the gazz'.
I'll tell you that.

32
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,030
Unless that guy at the Pennsy landfill
decides to play ball.

33
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,230
That asshole's shitting his pants
he'll get pinched by the EPA.

34
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,470
Frankly, Ton',

35
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,270
I'm thinking maybe
we should meet Phil's number.

36
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,250
Why? I think that would set
a terrible precedent right now.

37
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,180
Just bend over...

38
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,410
when he just became boss
of the family over there?

39
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,180
Yeah, well,
that's the flying ointment.

40
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,980
Even still,
I say let him have it.

41
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,790
Life's too short.

42
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,660
What is this,
"Make-Believe Ballroom"?

43
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,300
How many times you gonna
change the stations?

44
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,210
This "Departed" soundtrack's
fucking killer.

45
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,220
- You got it?
- Yeah, it's good.

46
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,790
Regarding, Phil,
I gotta ask:

47
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,850
whatever happened to
"stop and smell the roses"?

48
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,730
You're right.

49
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,250
You're right.

50
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,460
You can't fight every
fucking battle, right?

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,170
Asbestos...

52
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,450
Each day's a gift.

53
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,180
Every time I look at my kid,
that's what I realize.

54
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,950
And that shit
with Junior, please.

55
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,770
Just that people
like Phil,

56
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,530
they're not
on that page--

57
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,540
take those roses and stick 'em up
your ass, thorns first.

58
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,040
This system's
got no balls.

59
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,140
So how was your party
that day at the house?

60
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,580
Slow the fuck down,
will ya?!

61
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,030
Maybe you should
go back, Heidi.

62
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,340
Kennedy, I'm on my learner's
permit after dark.

63
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,550
Ton'...

64
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,720
you gotta... help me.

65
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,130
I'm coming.

66
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,340
I'll never pass
the drug test.

67
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,930
What?

68
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,070
You gotta get me out.

69
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,200
I'll lose my license.

70
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,320
Never pass a drug test.

71
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,990
Call me a taxi.

72
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,710
911.

73
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,450
We've been
in an accident.

74
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,510
Old Pumping Station Road...

75
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,250
past the reservoir.

76
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,270
Sorry about that.

77
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,150
My friend...

78
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,950
guy I came with,
how is he?

79
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,750
Your friend is dead.
Paramedics called it in the ambulance.

80
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,260
Breathe in, please.
Hold it.

81
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,950
Do you know a contact number
for his next of kin?

82
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,000
His wife.

83
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,000
- Hello.
- May I speak with Carmela Soprano?

84
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,480
- Who is this?
- Nurse Alma Rosario,

85
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,920
St. Clare's Hospital, Denville.
Is Mrs. Soprano there?

86
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,920
Yes, this is
Mrs. Soprano.

87
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,790
I'm here with your husband.
He'd like to speak with you.

88
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,960
- Carm.
- Tony, is everything okay?

89
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,470
Are you sitting down?

90
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,830
- I'm serious.
- Yes, I'm in bed.

91
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,670
All right, listen.

92
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,830
Sweetheart,
there's been an accident.

93
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,600
We were coming back
from the city and...

94
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,580
- Christopher's dead.
- Oh my God!

95
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,710
All right.

96
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,080
- Carm.
- What happened?

97
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,750
He drove off the road
and the car flipped over.

98
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,380
- I'll tell you in detail.
- Are you okay?

99
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,390
I just banged my knee,
the one from high school.

100
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
I'm fine, but...

101
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,660
he wasn't wearing
a belt.

102
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,560
Where are you,
St. Clare's?

103
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,470
Listen, they're gonna call Kelli
if they haven't already...

104
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,600
Just get AI and Rita
on the phone

105
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,440
and get 'em started
over there.

106
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,280
All right, all right.
Oh my God, Tony, he's dead?

107
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,440
Yeah.

108
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,880
All right.
L-let me get dressed.

109
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Thank you.

110
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,150
Mr. Tony, Mr. Sil is here.

111
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,950
Okay.

112
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,580
Mrs. Carmela say
you should stay in bed.

113
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,150
Have him come up.

114
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,920
We're right here, Ton'.

115
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,950
We came as soon
as we heard.

116
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,060
- Ton'.
- Patsy went to Chrissy's mom's house.

117
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,570
- Yeah, that's where Carmela is.
- Carlo's coming up.

118
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,200
Yeah.

119
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,410
- How you doing, Ton'?
- My knee got banged up.

120
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
They said it's
probably gonna be okay.

121
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,780
Last thing
I remember was...

122
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,790
we pulled away
from Phil.

123
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,350
Skid marks all over the place,
the cops told Carm.

124
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,420
He had a heavy foot,
that kid, always.

125
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,430
Almost put me through
a billboard one time.

126
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,460
- Hey, Ton'.
- Come on in.

127
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,830
I'm so sorry, Ton'.

128
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,840
I still can't
believe it.

129
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,340
Thanks. I know
you two were close.

130
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,000
I was making
my collections

131
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,500
and Anthony Maffei
called me. Jesus.

132
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,150
It's Carlo, I bet.

133
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,390
Fucking idiot didn't even have
his seat belt on.

134
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,490
His chest filled up.

135
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,490
Suffocated on his own blood.

136
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,360
- Oh, Jesus.
- Jesus Christ.

137
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,630
Seems like that's
the cause of death.

138
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,000
It's not Carlo.
I heard AJ.

139
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,100
Carlo's coming up?

140
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,340
What's with you
and Carlo's fucking arrival?

141
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,350
- I'm just saying.
- They're gonna do

142
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,480
a full blood test on him.
See, you know,

143
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,780
if alcohol,

144
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,280
- drugs or...
- It did occur to me.

145
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,820
He didn't seem high, did he?

146
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,760
Are you kidding?
I would have been furious.

147
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,850
I would have fucking
strangled him.

148
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,330
He'd been working the program
ever since he threw Little Paulie

149
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,230
- out that window.
- Let's not go there.

150
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,640
Even before that
he was battling that shit.

151
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,640
He gave it his all.

152
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,040
Well, anyway,
he's gone now,

153
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,070
our Chrissy.

154
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,070
Crazy fucking maniac.

155
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,280
The thing to take to heart, T,

156
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,380
you're here. You're all right.

157
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,480
You could have been killed,
for fuck's sake.

158
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,820
What are you gonna do?

159
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,730
Thanks.

160
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,100
Whoa.
What are you doing?

161
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,570
No no no, I gotta
try and get up.

162
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,160
I gotta go and meet Carm
over at Chrissy's.

163
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Kelli and all that.

164
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,780
I'll make you
a plate.

165
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,410
- Get me a Scotch.
- Are you serious?

166
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,140
Yeah, and have
one yourself.

167
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,150
They were close,
the two cousins.

168
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,890
You all right?

169
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,100
I know I had my differences
with that kid,

170
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,570
but maybe I didn't
do right by him, neither.

171
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,070
If you were his dad,
I was his Dutch uncle,

172
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,540
and what the fuck
did I do but get pissed off,

173
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,380
fight with him over
cocksucking fucking money?

174
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,350
I'd break his balls when he tried
not to have a drink

175
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,440
or a little taste of snow.

176
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,120
It's over, Paulie.

177
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,050
Did anybody ever hear
from the hospital?

178
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,330
I was waiting
till Kelli woke up.

179
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,770
They found cocaine
in his blood.

180
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,900
- Madonn'.
- 'Cause of death was a hemothorax.

181
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,070
Yeah, airbags can crush the ribs
when there's no other restraint.

182
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,080
They said he might
have made it,

183
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,340
but he didn't.

184
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,250
Couldn't have worn
his goddamn seat belt?

185
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,680
- No wonder. He was whack-a-doo.
- Al, just stop it.

186
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,780
Aw, baloney. He leaves
our granddaughter fatherless.

187
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,390
My only child!

188
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,690
Drinking won't help,
honey.

189
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,700
Jesus Christ.

190
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,230
Look at this.
Syracuse is losing.

191
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,180
I don't know
what to say.

192
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,680
- What?
- I just got a call from Little Paulie.

193
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,510
Nucci Gualtieri died.

194
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,010
Stroke on the bus back
to the home.

195
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,550
They had gone
to see "Jersey Boys."

196
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,030
This is difficult.

197
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,930
This is pain

198
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,730
like I'm not used to.

199
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,200
We've said before
he was like a son in some ways.

200
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,330
To see him die
like that...

201
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,140
practically
in my arms.

202
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,840
He was just starting
his life.

203
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,710
Yeah.

204
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,520
You know what?

205
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,690
- This is bullshit.
- What?

206
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,390
I haven't been able
to tell anybody this, but...

207
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,360
I'm fucking relieved.

208
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,270
Really?

209
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,360
He was a tremendous drag
on my emotions,

210
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,900
on my... thoughts
about the future.

211
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,240
Every morning
I wake up thinking,

212
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,440
"ls today the day that
one of my best friends

213
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,680
is gonna dime me
to the FBI?"

214
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,020
And a weak,
fucking sniveling,

215
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,580
lying drug addict?
That's the worst kind of bet.

216
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,610
The biggest blunder
of my career

217
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,890
is now gone.

218
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,420
And I don't have to be confronted
by that fact no more.

219
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,760
And as a relative, a friend,

220
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,740
someone you can count on...

221
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,100
I see.

222
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,940
Let me tell you something:

223
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,310
I've murdered friends before,
even relatives--

224
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,790
my cousin Tony,

225
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,290
my best friend-- Puss.

226
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,020
But this...

227
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,870
Was I talking
in my sleep?

228
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,230
Snoring.

229
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm gonna put on the TV
if you don't mind.

230
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,800
I can't stay asleep
either. I'm all...

231
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,780
I mean, I can laugh and cry,
and I could always get the part.

232
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,650
- First time?
- First time. Never can keep it.

233
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,920
They got onto me
after a while.

234
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,650
I'd lose my voice,
fall down, get red in the face,

235
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,320
talk too fast
and couldn't act.

236
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,150
Can you make me
a cappuccino?

237
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,190
That fucking machine from Paulie,
you need a pilot's license.

238
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,940
It's so hard not to think
of Christopher as a child, isn't it?

239
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,410
Caity kind of looks like him,
which makes it doubly hard.

240
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,310
Of course that's not
gonna do her any favors

241
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,970
when she hits puberty--
that schnoz.

242
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,540
A lot of women
found him very attractive.

243
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,720
I think to myself,

244
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,590
how could I have ever said
those things about him,

245
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,390
about him and Adriana,
what her mother said he did to her?

246
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,770
Obviously he was violent
as an adult.

247
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,570
His upbringing,
but he adored Ade.

248
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,100
He could never let
himself take her life.

249
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,770
Why are we
so quick to blame?

250
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,480
What is
the attraction in that?

251
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,400
It's good.

252
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,420
Thank you.

253
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,600
When I called you...

254
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,330
the night after
the accident,

255
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,210
and you asked me,

256
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,080
"Oh my God, Tony,
he's dead?"

257
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,270
Yeah.

258
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,580
And I thought--

259
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,520
well, I thought
I picked up a twinge of...

260
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,980
- relief.
- What?

261
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,650
It just seemed like--
I don't know--

262
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,090
How could you say that? You don't
know what you're talking about.

263
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,490
Okay, good, I'm wrong.

264
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,500
Maybe if you did pick up
something like that,

265
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,760
maybe it's because
I was relieved...

266
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,770
that it was him
and not you.

267
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,700
Well, don't feel bad about that.
That makes sense.

268
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,540
To be going down
to the hospital again

269
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,570
at 2:00 in the morning?

270
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,020
And you know what?
When you were shot,

271
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,320
it was Christopher
who held me.

272
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,060
You know
the baby's car seat?

273
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,260
A giant tree branch
came through the window

274
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,290
and demolished it.

275
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,740
She would have
been dead, Caitlin,

276
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,870
mangled beyond
recognition.

277
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,690
I told her about
the baby seat

278
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,700
so she wouldn't
feel so rotten.

279
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,430
I mean, he was high as a fucking kite.
I didn't tell her that.

280
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,990
In retrospect,
maybe not the best approach.

281
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,730
Right,
I'm the asshole... again.

282
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,800
What?

283
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,380
No, go ahead.

284
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,080
It's amazing
how things work.

285
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,680
His mother,
my cousin Joanne,

286
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,450
a lush.

287
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,390
Totally abandoned him
as a parent,

288
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,160
but now she's reaping
all the sympathy

289
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,390
and the tears.

290
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,060
How are you doing,
Anthony?

291
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,570
There have been
some hard moments.

292
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,980
But a weak,
lying drug addict

293
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
who fantasized
about my downfall,

294
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,450
who even showed people
his filthy thoughts

295
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,510
on a movie screen...?

296
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,510
Let me tell you something:
I've seen friends die before,

297
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,180
accidents,

298
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,350
even murder.

299
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,490
My cousin Tony,
they shot his face away.

300
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,900
And I was fucking
prostate with grief.

301
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,460
But this?

302
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,730
I see.

303
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,000
And it occurs to me,
I hand-carried this kid

304
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,530
through the worst crisis
he ever had.

305
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,880
I can't go
into particulars, but...

306
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,180
wives, girlfriends,

307
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,120
they can complicate life
in a major way.

308
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,310
I don't have to
tell you that.

309
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,630
Anyway, huge problem
of his own making.

310
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,700
And he cried.
He couldn't deal with it.

311
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,430
So...

312
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,370
I took up the slack.
I handled it.

313
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,390
I felt sorry for him.

314
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,670
Now he talked gratitude...

315
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,070
but guess what pity
produces in the recipient.

316
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,240
They shit
on your pity.

317
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,940
That's what broke
the camel's back.

318
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,650
How are you
handling all this?

319
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,180
The worst part,
truthfully,

320
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,450
is I gotta sit there

321
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,950
with people
who are hurting... bad.

322
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,360
And I gotta have
the long face

323
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,370
and the sighing
and the platitudes.

324
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,910
But I don't feel it.

325
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,840
Then that makes me feel
like a hypocrite.

326
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,380
And that makes me
mad at them.

327
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,670
Oh, hi.

328
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,300
How are you?

329
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,810
Julianna Skiffle,

330
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,650
this is my wife
Carmela Soprano.

331
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,160
Skiff.

332
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,350
Oh, yeah, right.

333
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,090
Julianna's a real estate agent
in the old neighborhood.

334
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,100
And you knew
Christopher?

335
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,790
I used to buy my meat
at Satriale's.

336
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,770
I'm a recovering addict.

337
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,770
- I owe him a lot.
- That's nice to hear.

338
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,410
- Well, what are you gonna do, huh?
- Nothing you can do.

339
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,920
That's my point.

340
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,580
He was too young.

341
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,210
Good-looking woman.

342
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,580
They did
a beautiful job on him.

343
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,850
Oh, I'm gonna go up.

344
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,090
I'll go up later,

345
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,030
give my seat to someone
in the meantime.

346
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,830
How are you doing?

347
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,630
- It's tough.
- Yeah.

348
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,770
He loved you so much.

349
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,710
- Yeah?
- Well, you know he did.

350
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,750
I'll go up later.

351
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,870
There she is.
3 to 5, 7 to 9.

352
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,500
Why do they call her that?

353
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,070
She never
misses a wake.

354
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,850
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord!

355
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,910
Fucking
James Brown now.

356
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,320
I'm serious.
I can't take it.

357
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,890
It's all right.
We're here for you.

358
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,420
Oh my God.
Look at this.

359
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,870
- Like a movie star.
- Jackie Kennedy.

360
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,690
- I'm sorry for the loss of your cousin.
- Thanks.

361
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,860
Me too, bro, me too.

362
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,060
He was a good guy.

363
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,540
Hey, don't let
this linger

364
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,940
on your head now.

365
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,170
You know what
I'm talking about.

366
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,710
You know that night,

367
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,020
a tree limb came in
through the car window,

368
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,460
completely destroyed
the baby seat.

369
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,720
Tony.

370
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,730
You guys are gonna
hang in a while, right?

371
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,430
We really should make an appearance
at the other wake.

372
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,180
Are we that late?

373
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,050
Glad you came.

374
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,250
- He'll appreciate it.
- Oh, please.

375
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,140
I gotta get out of here.

376
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,280
- Paul.
- Ton'.

377
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,340
Thanks for coming.

378
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,120
We are so sorry
for your loss, Paulie.

379
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,250
How you hangin' in, Paolucc'?

380
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,820
As well as can be expected.

381
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,560
Must be very
hard for you.

382
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,560
I know how close
the two of you had become again.

383
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,120
Yeah.

384
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,860
Not much
of a sendoff here.

385
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,170
- The room is beautiful, Paulie.
- Nobody's in it.

386
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,970
What kind
of testament is this

387
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,770
to the spirit and generosity
of the woman?

388
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,500
We're here for you, Paulie.

389
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,170
You know that.

390
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,700
Okay.

391
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,680
It's a fundamental
lack of respect

392
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,650
and I'm never gonna
fuckin' forget it, neither.

393
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Jesus, Paulie, people your mother's age,
their friends die off.

394
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,520
What, she outlived
Sil? Carlo?

395
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,260
They're all over there
at your nephew's.

396
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,130
- Yeah, but--
- Councilman Carillo

397
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,560
was here three minutes. I
clocked him.

398
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,830
He told Gerry he was going
to the Moltisanti wake.

399
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,740
People are comin'
and if they don't, fuck 'em.

400
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,210
I got 500 prayer cards.

401
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,500
Well, Carm and I are here.

402
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,700
What the fuck
is that? Nothin'?

403
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,570
No, Ton', of course not.

404
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,210
- Means the world.
- Okay.

405
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,710
She suffered too,
you know.

406
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,450
Yeah, well, this isn't
the time or the place.

407
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,320
You're right.

408
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,420
How have you been
dealing with it?

409
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,360
It's really sad but it's kinda
the same as with Blanca.

410
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,590
I mean, I don't really just keep
thinking about things the way I did--

411
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,760
over and over,
you know?

412
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,770
Well, for one thing,
perhaps the meds are working.

413
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,070
Did you finally enroll?

414
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,130
I'm in a few classes

415
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,650
unofficially, until my transcript
clears from Ramapo.

416
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,740
Beginning English.

417
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,340
Oh, and I went
to a class on the history

418
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,180
of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.

419
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,490
- Wow.
- It's hard to pick up in the middle.

420
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,720
I might take it
next semester.

421
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,090
I mean, it's so
dicked-up over there

422
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,490
and no one knows
who started it.

423
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,260
- Are you sleeping?
- What? In class?

424
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,500
No. You were having
trouble, remember?

425
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,870
Wellbutrin XL
kicks ass.

426
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,340
I'm hearing good things
about the Lexapro.

427
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,440
Check it, paisan.
Long John shithead.

428
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,610
That kid's in my
South American Lit class.

429
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,740
He had his toes amputated.

430
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,520
He said it was an accident
with his car battery.

431
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,250
Acid burned right
through his shoe.

432
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,740
Oh, you little
shfooyadell.

433
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,440
She should nurse.

434
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,210
At least somebody
feels like eating.

435
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,020
She doesn't know.

436
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,180
Isn't God wonderful
that way?

437
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,390
- Hello?
- Alan, it's Tony. You busy?

438
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,130
Usual shit--
some Japanese guy

439
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,500
got his suit ruined
at Cirque du Soleil.

440
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,370
- Listen, I need a suite.
- So all the guys coming out?

441
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,310
No no. I'm solo.

442
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,280
Oh. We'll see what
we can do about that.

443
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,510
Look, I just want to be alone--
peace and quiet...

444
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,110
-...chill out.
- You set for transpo?

445
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,620
I'll be happy
to send a plane.

446
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,020
No more bets.

447
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,390
33 black odd.

448
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,770
No more bets.

449
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,250
Five red odd.

450
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,580
It's hard to imagine
for a poet,

451
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,080
but Wordsworth was
as rich and popular

452
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,880
as, say, someone like

453
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,360
John Grisham nowadays.

454
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,520
But Wordsworth writes

455
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,220
"The world is too much with us."

456
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,560
Later, he invokes
nature again.

457
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,690
Why such strong words
against the material world?

458
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,810
That was fast.

459
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,680
The gatehouse
usually gives

460
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,710
shitty directions to
the east tower. Come in.

461
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,060
So...

462
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,390
You're a friend
of Chris.

463
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,800
Yeah...
Tony, by the way.

464
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,630
No, I know.

465
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,300
He's mentioned you,
actually.

466
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,900
Well, I heard nothing
but nice things about you.

467
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,940
Except... you're more
beautiful than he let on.

468
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,110
- Really?
- Talked about ya...

469
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,080
a few times, told me more than
once to look you up.

470
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,410
Did he?

471
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,650
Well well well.

472
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,550
You want a drink
or something?

473
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,360
I got some pinot grigio
in the fridge.

474
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,860
I got some, uh...

475
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,070
serious news.

476
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,400
- Uh-oh.
- It's about Christopher.

477
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,040
- He's dead.
- What?

478
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,970
It was a car accident,

479
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,140
happened
a couple days ago.

480
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,220
Oh my God.

481
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,520
That's fucking awful.

482
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,420
I'm sorry.

483
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,830
- What happened?
- Bad wreck...

484
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,990
high-speed...

485
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,200
He was killed instantly.

486
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,230
Somehow, I walked away.

487
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,300
Jesus, that must
have been scary.

488
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,640
The fuckin' sound alone...

489
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,370
Did he ever...

490
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,970
marry that one girl--
the one who left him--

491
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,710
No.

492
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,690
Found a real sweetheart,
though-- Kelli--

493
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,690
and...

494
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,450
they just had
a baby girl.

495
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Maybe that's good,
you know?

496
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,190
I mean,
bad that he left her,

497
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,030
but good that he--
he left something.

498
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,000
I thought
you should know.

499
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,010
Well, um...

500
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,650
Extremely cool, you coming over here.
I appreciate that.

501
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,120
- How long you here for?
- I don't know.

502
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,180
Just play it as I go.

503
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,680
- What's up?
- It's Stefano.

504
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,690
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm here at the school.

505
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,520
The asbestos,
it's backing up.

506
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,460
I've gotta dump
this shit.

507
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,650
It's not wrapped to code
and all the other violations--

508
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,560
- Yeah?
- I could get nailed big time.

509
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,590
We're workin' on it, John.

510
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,160
I'm trying
to negotiate it out,

511
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,790
but the asshole's
taking a hard line for now.

512
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,430
Just hang in there,
let me do my thing.

513
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,270
All right.

514
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,740
- Whoa.
- Jeff'll clean it up.

515
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,610
Make him clean it
in his bare feet.

516
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,770
I got the venison steaks!

517
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,850
Oh!

518
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,950
Oh!

519
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,650
What the fuck?
You blind?

520
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,390
Me?! You open the door,
you don't look at all.

521
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,460
Aw, shit, you wrecked
my fuckin' door.

522
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,800
- You did that to your own door!
- Whoa whoa whoa.

523
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,430
What the fuck
did you say?

524
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,730
I said he opened the door,
he don't look at all.

525
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,470
Look at my fuckin' bike!

526
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,410
- Do you hear this guy?
- You saw it!

527
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,970
Fuck you, nigger.

528
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,570
I am not a nigger!

529
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,080
I am from Somalia!
I go to school and I work!

530
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,640
Do not call me a nigger!

531
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,710
So you're some
terrorist piece of shit.

532
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,450
Either way, motherfucker,
you're in the wrong neighborhood.

533
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,320
Get the fuck away!

534
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,890
You a tough nigger now?!

535
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,830
You got something to say?

536
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,100
Cocksucker!

537
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,640
Do you mind?

538
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,710
No, knock yourself out.

539
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,790
This is the--

540
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,420
this is the new shit--

541
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,050
medical-grade, mellow,

542
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,090
paranoia-free.

543
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,060
Oh, well, that's good.

544
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,870
Oh, Chris loved to party.

545
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,350
What's your point?

546
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,350
Nothing.
You just...

547
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,110
remind me
of him, obviously.

548
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,520
What's that mean?
I fuck like him?

549
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,420
So much
for paranoia-free.

550
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,990
No, you were his
friend, that's all.

551
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,520
Why would you
bring him up?

552
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,400
All I'm saying

553
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,030
is that there's
a certain kind of guy

554
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,370
that I don't run into
on campus.

555
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,810
But where I dance--

556
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,610
that accent, the clothes.

557
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,270
I'm a type?

558
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,110
This coming from the girl who's
stripping her way through college?

559
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,920
Actually,
you're a surprise.

560
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,150
Chris sometimes talked
about some sad shit,

561
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,390
but you seem--
I don't know--

562
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,550
actually sad.

563
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,560
Not right now I'm not.

564
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,230
Jesus, this is some
pretty fucking amazing dope.

565
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,040
Chris said you two...

566
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,800
took peyote together.

567
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,870
Yeah.

568
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,470
I mean, I haven't done buttons
in a while, though.

569
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,310
You know, I've been thinking
why the fuck I'm here.

570
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,250
You can get
to that place.

571
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,280
No. No, I mean Vegas.

572
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,350
Truth is I always wanted
to try that shit...

573
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,190
but I always had

574
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,130
all the responsibilities.

575
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:08,270
You're a hard man
to reach.

576
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,240
Nobody's seen hide
nor hair.

577
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,180
Yeah, I'm away.
What do you want?

578
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,150
What do I want?
I'm returning your call.

579
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,940
I think this got nothing
to do with asbestos.

580
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,680
Why don't you let go of the old shit
and be a businessman?

581
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,350
- You got everything you want.
- Not everything.

582
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,020
But listen, allow me
to express my condolences

583
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,990
regarding your nephew.

584
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,520
This is me hanging up.

585
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,830
- I can tell you're upset.
- Big fucking deal.

586
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,830
- What exactly happened this week?
- Nothing.

587
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,310
You know, people walk around
like this is all something.

588
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,680
They're fucking laughing

589
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,620
and nobody takes
even one second

590
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,450
to think about
what's really going on.

591
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
You sound
depressed again.

592
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,820
How can anybody not be?
You'd have to be fucking nuts

593
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,730
not to be.

594
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,700
I mean, you'd have to have
your head wedged so far

595
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,670
up your ass that all
you could see

596
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,970
is your own stupid face.

597
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,870
What specifically
are you talking about?

598
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,470
I mean, everything
is so fucked up.

599
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,280
Why can't we all
just get along?

600
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,120
You don't have to
chew it.

601
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,760
You just wash it down
like a pill.

602
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,780
It's the same principle
as the solar system.

603
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:56,830
No more bets.

604
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,440
- 24.
- Yes.

605
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,070
Nice.

606
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,240
Press it all.

607
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,130
No more bets.

608
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,240
20.

609
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,040
Holy fucking shit.

610
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,280
Here.

611
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,310
Much appreciated.

612
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,230
No more bets.

613
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,480
24 again.

614
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,920
- He's dead.
- What?

615
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,950
What?

616
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,600
What?

617
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,490
I get it.

618
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,370
I get it!
