1
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,647
You have to be 110%
sure this is who you saw.

2
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,482
This is definitely him.

3
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,235
- Had you ever seen him before?
- No.

4
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,988
- And the other man?
- I didn't get a good look at him.

5
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,492
The light reflected off the car.
But he was heavyset.

6
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,370
It was really dark.
I didn't want to be seen.

7
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,540
I heard shots but I thought
they were firecrackers.

8
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,626
When the two men drove out,
I hid in the ragweed.

9
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,004
- Sure.
- What happened began to dawn on me.

10
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,215
But like I told the officers...

11
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,051
...I left the flat tire
and walked to a phone.

12
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,511
Thank you, Mr. Arthur.

13
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,013
I'm so goddamn fed up with crime.

14
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,433
I had to come forward
to help you find them.

15
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,396
Thanks to people like you,
we may just do that.

16
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,481
May I ask who the dead man was?

17
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,859
Just a poor kid in the wrong crowd.

18
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,735
- Crack?
- Something like that.

19
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,903
Uh-huh.

20
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,844
Mommy!

21
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,679
Mommy!

22
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,849
Mommy! Mommy! No!

23
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,521
Mommy!

24
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,152
Hey...

25
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,530
- What's the matter, you lost?
- Uh-huh.

26
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,743
You scared me half to death!
I can't turn my back for a minute!

27
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:27,247
I know what that's like. My little
guy was a real cadet at his age.

28
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,712
- Tony!
- Yeah?

29
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,380
It's good you could meet me.

30
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,717
No problem. I went
to Brookstone and got a scale.

31
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,386
- What's it about?
- Fucking Dick Barone.

32
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,764
As long as the two of you are happy.

33
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,432
I'm in no mood.

34
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,436
This garbage business. I found out
that bow-tied motherfucker...

35
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,482
...is charging me double
to tip my trucks at his place.

36
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:58,737
So pay the tonnage, and charge your
townships extra for the pickups.

37
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,034
I got the smallest amount of routes
of anybody in the association.

38
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:09,122
You're like the old woman with ham
under her arm, crying for bread.

39
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,918
- What the fuck?
- Never mind. The point is...

40
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,213
...your brother, Jack, never
concentrated on sanitation...

41
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,008
...so what do you want Dick to do?
I want a rate.

42
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,635
I'll see what he says.

43
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:26,014
Yeah. You see. Since you own
part of the company.

44
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,775
- Did you shut all the lights?
- Yeah.

45
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,653
- In the kitchen?
- Yeah.

46
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,782
I want to spend more time with AJ.

47
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,327
It's the other one who's almost
out of the house.

48
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,707
I'm not worried about Meadow.
Meadow can take care of herself.

49
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:59,715
- Why the sudden burst of fatherhood?
- Can you say anything without sarcasm?

50
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,719
You're right. I'm sorry.

51
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,976
It's a good idea. He adores you.
He never spends enough time with you.

52
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,561
Yeah, well...

53
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,523
I was reading in Time,
this study at Harvard.

54
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,735
"A father's support is
absolutely linked...

55
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,696
...to a boy's later capacity
to manage frustrations...

56
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,991
...to explore new circumstances...

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,660
...and do well."
Kid needs to toughen up.

58
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,371
No, I'm talking about opening up.

59
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,540
He needs some street smarts.

60
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,502
Not to be a sucker, or get
involved with the wrong people.

61
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,381
I don't want another Christopher
on my hands. Look at him.

62
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,425
He's lucky to be alive.

63
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,387
That other poor prick they found dead.

64
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,350
Kid was 23 or something.

65
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,527
Hey, pal, with the Ramlösa...

66
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,530
...put three cases of that in my car.
You got it.

67
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,616
That's not a mistake.

68
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,203
I want another 14 gross
of model number 4784.

69
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,041
Plastic picnic coolers. Ship them,
I'll worry about selling them.

70
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,209
Red.

71
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,753
Fuck blue, red sells.

72
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,297
- Put it here.
- Put that on the store tab.

73
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,260
He says take three gross of the blue,
he'll give us a price on the red.

74
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,222
Fuck that. He's never
getting paid anyway.

75
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,059
They gotta be all red.
Just do it, please.

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,311
Thank you. Goodbye.

77
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,522
Who gets chicken and peppers?

78
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:43,151
- A lot of work to move picnic coolers.
- Coolers are like scissors...

79
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,863
...everybody wants one, nobody
has any idea how much they cost.

80
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,742
You put a Nigerian on the street,
have him sell these...

81
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:55,872
...for a couple bucks apiece, who's
not gonna say, "Fuck it, give me one"?

82
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,708
How we doing with them
airline tickets?

83
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,628
Won't it raise a flag
with the travel agency?

84
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,297
A sports store charges
tickets in bulk?

85
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:09,344
Say it's for promotion. Customer of
the Year, Salesman of the Month...

86
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,804
...that kind of thing.

87
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,932
Don't worry. You put it
on different credit lines.

88
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,351
Suddenly I'm ordering
all this shit.

89
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,396
I mean, picnic coolers,
Ramlösa water...

90
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,859
When do they realize
I'm not paying and call the cops?

91
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,487
When your fucking credit
runs out, Diamond Jim.

92
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,115
Until then, get on the horn
and order.

93
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,993
Unless you can pay us
the principal you owe.

94
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,872
Hey!

95
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,625
Put the heat up.

96
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,753
Today!

97
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,842
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

98
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,719
- What's the matter?
- Spider.

99
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,347
So kill it.

100
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,183
You do it.

101
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,643
Come here and kill the thing.

102
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,569
- Come here.
- No way.

103
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,778
Come on.

104
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,783
It was a leaf, you frigging idiot!

105
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,119
- Mister!
- Yeah.

106
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,122
- There's a man here to see you.
- Who?

107
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,749
A police.

108
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,045
Be right back.

109
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,552
Did you let them in the house?

110
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:38,391
Warrant, warrant.
How do you say it in fucking Polish?

111
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,399
Agent Harris!
Who's your friend?

112
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,612
I'm Detective Harold Giardina.
From the Essex County Task Force.

113
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:54,366
Pleased to meet you. But if you
don't have a warrant, get out.

114
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,576
- I'm busy.
- I can see that.

115
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,037
A comedian. Is that how you
broke your nose?

116
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,165
We could've phoned.
We paid the courtesy of a visit.

117
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,042
Let's talk at the station.

118
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,753
- Talk?
- About Matthew Bevilaqua.

119
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,214
Dad?

120
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,300
Take the backboard out.
I'll be down in a second.

121
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,975
Lawyer up, whatever, it's your call.
Just name the time.

122
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:24,229
On your way out, can you roll the
garbage down? Tomorrow's pickup day.

123
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,315
Let's go, Harry.

124
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,575
Those are the FBI guys from before.
What did they want?

125
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,159
Nothing.

126
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,205
Keep this between us.
You know how your mother gets.

127
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,268
What do you got for me?

128
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,940
A partial list of the major
investors in Webistics.

129
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,318
I haven't seen Tony in a while.

130
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,112
Besides the night he capped Bevilaqua?

131
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,073
- What do you mean?
- Did you fuck me?!

132
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,492
- Did you fuck me?!
- Take it easy.

133
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,413
How about I put a bullet in
your stupid boar's head?

134
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,083
He was spotted, Sal.
So don't go pulling my taffy.

135
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,711
As of this second,
if you lie to me...

136
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,548
...you will never see the streets
for 50 fucking years!

137
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,469
- Did you know about this?
- No.

138
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,014
If you knew Soprano
was planning something...

139
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,351
...and didn't wear a wire...
I told you no!

140
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,317
There was someone else
there that night.

141
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,154
A quote, unquote: "Husky accomplice."

142
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,990
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,368
- But the witness couldn't I.D. him.
- Oh.

144
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:06,873
- Were you the perp he couldn't I.D?
- What, are you fucking crazy?

145
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,085
What did I tell you, huh?
No fucking violence!

146
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,505
I ought to burn you and let
the judge throw away the key!

147
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,177
I'm deciding to believe you.
But here's what you're gonna do.

148
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,473
I want Tony's voice on tape, saying,
"I killed Matthew Bevilaqua."

149
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,102
No distortion. No throat
clearings. No nose-blowing.

150
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,729
I get it.
But let me ask you something.

151
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,941
If I did ride with Tony
on something like that...

152
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,611
...wouldn't that get me tighter
with him, raise my coinage?

153
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,740
- Make Tony forget all his suspicions?
- You're a cute prick, Puss.

154
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,411
Get me Tony on tape
talking about this murder.

155
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,871
Who's the witness?

156
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,876
No joke, Sal. You don't want
to see my darker side.

157
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,510
- Go.
- If they had enough to pinch you...

158
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,221
...there'd be bars
between us as we speak.

159
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,808
- Why do they want me to go there?
- Lock you into a story.

160
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,103
So later at trial, any contradiction
will sink you.

161
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,315
- We going?
- Did you say you'd go?

162
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,153
- Please.
- All right, procrastinate.

163
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,490
Let me get our ducks in a row.
Keep your cool and go the speed limit.

164
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,242
Don't give them an in.

165
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,245
What'd I just say?

166
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,792
- Don't give them an in.
- Are you all right, Tony?

167
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,131
This is some bad shit here.

168
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,760
What's up, Anthony?
How did this happen?

169
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,095
Midlife crisis?
You can talk to me.

170
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,478
The mothers last year said we should
end senior night at Long Beach Island.

171
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,440
They'll dance, scavenger hunt and
the liquor stores will be closed.

172
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,442
- And we count noses.
- Okay.

173
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,945
Is that the time? I'm gonna
barely get Natalie to tap.

174
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,865
- Chris, need a ride?
- No, my brother's coming.

175
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,202
- Eric took my car to a meet.
- Next week, my house.

176
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,078
We'll tie up the loose ends.

177
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,643
- Christine, I'm so glad you stayed.
- I kind of wanted to.

178
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,814
When I found out about Eric's car,
I told Tony to give it back...

179
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,026
I wish I could say this is
a first for David, but...

180
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:49,118
Eric is going to college,
and maybe it's better for his grades.

181
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,958
- So April 1, huh? How I dread it.
- So long as Eric gets into Georgetown.

182
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:59,546
- It's his first choice.
- Meadow wants to go to Berkeley.

183
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:07,804
- Hi. We just finished.
- Sorry I'm late. I was bidding a job.

184
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,641
My brother, the wallpaper artist.
The one you can trust...

185
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:15,728
...with your Brunswick & Fields.
Vic, Carmela Soprano. Victor Musto.

186
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,689
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

187
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,358
- You have a beautiful house.
- Thank you.

188
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,571
- Could use a little freshening up.
- Vic does amazing border work too.

189
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:29,617
I was thinking of wallpapering
the dining room. Do you have a card?

190
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,619
Yeah, sure.

191
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:36,249
I'm bonded and state certified,
but I'm still dangerous.

192
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,213
- Well, bye, Carmela. Thanks.
- Let's get together and have lunch.

193
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,549
- Have you tried the new Vesuvio?
- No.

194
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,093
- Okay, lunch. Promise.
- Yes.

195
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,766
- Nice meeting you.
- I'll call about the wallpaper.

196
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,025
Nice lady.

197
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,862
Don't even think about it.
She's married to Tony Soprano.

198
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:11,868
Married's good enough. The husband
doesn't matter, I respect the ring.

199
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,246
Especially that ring.
Probably came off a dead finger.

200
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,266
- David? Are you down there?
- Be right up!

201
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,403
- What are you doing?
- Fixing the fucking light bulb!

202
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,907
- It glares off the ball when I rack!
- Jesus, okay.

203
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,661
You're always worried
about ruining the felt.

204
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,718
Richie, baby, you're the best one!

205
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,846
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're the best one ever.

206
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,144
Oh, baby, you're the best!
Oh, baby, you're the best.

207
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,273
Oh, Richie. Oh, Richie.
Oh, you're the boss.

208
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,402
Oh, you're the boss!
Oh, you're the boss!

209
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,363
Oh, baby! Oh, you're the best!

210
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,743
It should be you.
Oh, it should be you.

211
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,331
What?

212
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,417
- Where'd that come from?
- What?

213
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:46,170
"It should be you"?
What are you trying to say, Janice?

214
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,757
- What?
- Don't "what" me!

215
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:57,015
- Why'd you say that?
- I was making love to you, baby.

216
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,685
You know what you said.

217
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,939
I was in the heat of passion.
I'm doing it like you like.

218
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,736
"Boss" this, "boss" that...

219
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,821
"It should be you."

220
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,407
That's not part of it.

221
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,745
How can you think of that during sex?
You're not in the moment.

222
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,382
I find powerful men erotic.

223
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:36,345
- Was that another dig in me?
- Oh, Jesus, Richie.

224
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,230
I gotta be loyal.

225
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,358
Without that, we crumble.

226
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,406
Tell that to Paul Castallano.

227
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,499
I'm old school, Janice.

228
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,086
All I mean is, my brother needs help.

229
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:14,425
- Teaching him manners is one thing.
- My Uncle Junior still has friends...

230
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,470
...and he thinks the world of you.

231
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,731
"When your opponent
gives you an opening...

232
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,110
...be swift as a hare." Sun Tzu.

233
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:37,115
When I think of that jacket
I gave your brother...

234
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,200
...and he spit on it...

235
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,831
...I could slice an ear off his head.

236
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,541
Richie, wait.

237
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,504
Ma, if you need something,
call. I'll bring it up.

238
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:56,717
Are you smoking marijuana?
I want to watch the TV.

239
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,679
- We should get one for your room.
- Listen to her.

240
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,892
Like Rose Kennedy, with all
her money to throw around.

241
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,779
It's giving me agita.
Want me to go downtown.

242
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,198
Lock you into a story.

243
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,867
Why the fuck ain't they
talking to you?

244
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,786
Give them time. They will.

245
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,753
- Murder in aid of racketeering.
- Twenty to life.

246
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,802
There they are.
The Flying Cafone Brothers.

247
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,433
Not good. Not good.

248
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,062
On my kids, I will fucking cut you!
Just tell me!

249
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,397
Take it easy, Ton. It's fixable.

250
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,109
- First off, it's not a rat.
- Thank God.

251
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,822
Don't thank Him yet.
There's an eyeball witness.

252
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,951
What are you talking about?

253
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,121
Jesus Christ! Shit!

254
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,833
- Did you see anybody, any living soul?
- Fuck, no!

255
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,294
Don't worry.
A bump in the road.

256
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,963
Oh, you're beautiful.

257
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:01,175
- Who? Do we know him?
- All we know is that he's a civilian.

258
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,053
A flag-saluting motherfucker.

259
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,847
Maybe you should lamb chop it
for a while.

260
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,643
- I keep a suitcase in my trunk.
- Tell us about it.

261
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,521
Fuck all youse.
Bygones are never bygones.

262
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,108
This is a nightmare.
I'm gonna have to move some cash.

263
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,403
If I go, I'm going with a package.
Not like Massucco.

264
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,613
He had five minutes to run...

265
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,950
...and ended up in a rat motel
down in Elvis country.

266
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:31,372
- What is that?
- Where there are no Jews or Italians.

267
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,874
- I don't get it.
- It's starting!

268
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,003
- It's starting!
- Get back in your office, David!

269
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:41,590
I open my mail and it's a lawsuit!
It's a fucking lien on the building!

270
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,927
- Not fucking now, okay?
- They're gonna know it's fraud!

271
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:49,181
- I'm gonna go to jail for this!
- Get the fuck back in your hole!

272
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,850
Now!

273
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,651
Davey...

274
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,362
You're doing a good job.

275
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,251
Don't worry about this witness.

276
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,545
That's true. We'll find him.

277
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,922
Exactly.

278
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,675
- You don't know what he said.
- I did too.

279
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,427
- What, then?
- I understood.

280
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,928
What's it mean?

281
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,848
It means, "Sit on this, cocksucker!"

282
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,148
Five minutes away from life
in prison and I'm fucking laughing.

283
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,442
You gotta, skip, you gotta.

284
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,611
Davey never takes me to dinner.

285
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,698
Yeah, when you're dating
it's all candles and wine and...

286
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,035
Dave's been even more preoccupied
than usual lately.

287
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,206
- Well, he's busy.
- Carmela, my husband has a disease.

288
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,042
- A serious gambling problem.
- I am so sorry.

289
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,836
Thank God the store's in my name.

290
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,924
He can't sell it without me, or
he would have gambled it all away.

291
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,802
But I'm gonna make sure
we get through this.

292
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,304
Give me those.

293
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:16,268
I'm gonna make you two beautiful
women a special-tasting menu.

294
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,270
I was hoping he'd say that.

295
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,817
I know you ordered the Pellegrino,
but I want you to try this.

296
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,237
I got such a deal on this Ramlösa.

297
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:31,367
It was nice to meet your brother.
He seems very interesting.

298
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:36,205
He's a doll. When his wife was
dying, he waited on her hand and foot.

299
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:40,000
- A widower? So young.
- Breast cancer.

300
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,127
Ugh.

301
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,505
I thought there was
a sadness about him.

302
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,759
- And the children?
- Childless. She had a hostile womb.

303
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,304
- I had a dream about him.
- You did?

304
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,807
- Christine.
- He asked me about you too.

305
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,143
He was wallpapering my dining room.

306
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:02,356
It was your subconscious telling you
you want him to wallpaper the room.

307
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,867
Hey, cucuzza!

308
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,830
- I got something for you.
- What?

309
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,624
A Fenwick Rod and a Penn
International Reel.

310
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,544
- Thanks.
- Wanted it for Christmas, remember?

311
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,964
But it was back-ordered?
Well, I got a great deal on it.

312
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,050
- We'll take the boat and go fishing.
- Okay.

313
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,512
- What are you doing now?
- You want to go fishing now?

314
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,308
No, I figured we'd see a movie
or something...

315
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,143
...get some pizza.
I can't.

316
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,812
- What do you mean?
- I'm going to the mall.

317
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,692
- You gotta go to the mall?
- Not just me.

318
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,988
- Brad, Allen, Heidi, her sister maybe.
- Like a double date.

319
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:57,036
No, Dad. We're just going
to the mall. We go there sometimes.

320
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:01,457
- And do what?
- Get something to eat. Mrs. Fields.

321
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,793
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm meeting them there.

322
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,922
All right. Go ahead.

323
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,383
See you later.

324
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,555
Yeah, my girl did the same thing...

325
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,226
...at his age. Boys and girls,
always in a group.

326
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,395
- What's that about?
- What's it about for you?

327
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,524
In my day, a boy and girl
went on a date.

328
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,236
Your father hoped you wouldn't get
too far or you'd knock her up...

329
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,696
...and her parents would
break your legs.

330
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,451
I don't think it's about him
going to the mall with a group...

331
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,245
...that bothered you.

332
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:43,290
Wasn't it that he went to the mall
instead of going with you?

333
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,796
- He's starting to get his own life.
- One that doesn't include you.

334
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,425
It was always, "We'll do this."
"We're gonna do that."

335
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,555
I've heard you talk many times
about being with your son.

336
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,141
Well, that's over now. Gone. Done.

337
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,602
It's bittersweet, this period.

338
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,898
You're glad that they're growing up,
but you're sad to lose them.

339
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,413
I could be going away.

340
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,499
For a very long time.

341
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,836
For something I didn't do.

342
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,427
How about, "That's too bad"?
Or, "What a shame, Tony"?

343
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,514
- We can't go into specifics on this.
- Here's something specific.

344
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,684
I didn't do anything wrong.
We can't talk about it?

345
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:47,021
I could be going to the can
for the rest of my life...

346
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,608
...and I'm not supposed to
discuss it with my psychiatrist?

347
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,193
What the fuck are you for anyway?

348
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,365
How does that feel?

349
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,285
The idea that you might
be sent to prison?

350
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,838
I gotta stay around a little
while longer for the kids.

351
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,800
Especially my boy.

352
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:22,348
Once he's out of the house,
the government can do what they want.

353
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,144
- Give me life, the chair, whatever.
- I've never seen you like this.

354
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,979
- Like what?
- Scared.

355
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,485
I wouldn't use that word.

356
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:39,198
But sometimes I feel...
I don't know, I don't know.

357
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,910
You motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!

358
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,499
I don't fucking deserve this!

359
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,759
How's your medication?

360
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,515
Maybe we should stop.

361
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,115
- What?
- Don't have the witness yet.

362
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,537
- Nothing?
- This is the FBI, Ton.

363
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,958
Local cops, buy them a Christmas tree,
they'll give up their grandmother.

364
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,877
You know how tight these feds
can keep it.

365
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,800
Go home, get some sleep.

366
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,554
You don't want to stop by the Bing,
get something to eat?

367
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,391
Tell me, T, what do you want me to do?

368
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,644
Just let me think. Come on.

369
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,981
All right.

370
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,976
Tony! What are you doing here?

371
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,772
- Could ask you the same question.
- It's my store.

372
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,400
Congratulations,
it's a fucking disaster.

373
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,199
The airline tickets came in. You want
me to split them with you guys?

374
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,284
They're mine. It was my idea.

375
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,749
- This is where you sleep?
- Yeah, sometimes.

376
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,251
It's easier than going home.

377
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,003
I know what you mean.

378
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,558
I remember when you transferred
into 10th grade from...

379
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,644
...Baden-Baden.

380
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,313
Fucking Army brat.

381
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:24,947
Remember when those Paterson Guidos
caught you up at Garret Mountain...

382
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,907
...and you were in your dad's car...

383
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,410
...and I threw a rock at that guy?
Don't reminisce on me.

384
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,626
You told me not to get in the game.

385
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,420
Why'd you let me do it?

386
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,552
I knew you had this business, Davey.

387
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,348
It's my nature.
Frog and the scorpion, you know?

388
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,186
Besides, if you would've won,
I'd be crying the blues.

389
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,565
- Right?
- What's the end?

390
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,277
The end? It's planned bankruptcy.

391
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,413
You're not the first guy
to get busted out.

392
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,875
This is how I make a living.
It's my bread and butter.

393
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,462
When this is over, you're free to go.

394
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,384
Oh, for chrissake.

395
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,616
Anthony!

396
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,492
Dig!

397
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,915
Anthony! Anthony, dig!

398
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,294
Come on!

399
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,171
Anthony!

400
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,971
Oh, my God, that was so exciting!

401
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,766
I banged my foot.
I would've came in second.

402
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,352
You were like a fish out there.

403
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,688
- Where's Dad?
- He couldn't make it.

404
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,275
He had a meeting.
He'll be here next time.

405
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,862
- This is the last meet of the season.
- Next year, I mean.

406
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:29,488
Oh.

407
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,823
Okay.

408
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,464
- Got a safe?
- Yeah, why?

409
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,184
- You want to pay in advance?
- There's over 400K there.

410
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,397
I want you to hold it for me.
This goes down, I'm out of the area.

411
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,316
My wife will come
for a weekly allowance.

412
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:11,321
You don't ask her any questions
and you never, ever refuse her.

413
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,824
If she wants it all...

414
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,575
...you give it to her.

415
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,620
She won't do that.
She's smarter than that.

416
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,831
And if the money doesn't last?

417
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,917
Don't worry, you won't
go into your own kick.

418
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,753
This witness can't remain
nameless forever.

419
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,464
I didn't hear that!

420
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,891
- Don't you got school tomorrow?
- So?

421
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,227
So it's late. Go to bed.

422
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,731
Did you hear me?

423
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,617
- I hope you apologized to him.
- For what?

424
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,456
- You promised to be at his swim meet.
- Oh, shit, I forgot.

425
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,585
- How could you forget?
- There was something I had to do.

426
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,130
He almost came in second.
You should've seen his face.

427
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,841
I saw his face when
he went to the mall...

428
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,553
...and I wanted to go to the movies.
Are you 6 years old?

429
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,974
- I said I'd try to be there.
- What is with you, Tony?

430
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,642
This whole week...

431
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,438
...you're like an alien life form.
There's nothing wrong.

432
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,567
Thank you for sharing.

433
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:37,157
Know what, leave me the fuck alone.
I'll make up for the swim meet.

434
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,077
Where were you?
Did you see Chris at the hospital?

435
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,497
Yeah, I went to see
Christopher at the hospital.

436
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:48,502
Wherever you were, it's more important
to let your son know you care!

437
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:52,089
No, only you care. Fuck you.

438
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,924
No, fuck you!

439
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,260
Fuck you! You fucking...!

440
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,597
What's wrong with you?

441
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,100
Hey.

442
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,687
My God, you scared
the shit out of me.

443
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,814
No. Shut them off.

444
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,737
- Why are you sitting in the dark?
- I don't know.

445
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,656
I like the dark.

446
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,908
- Sit.
- I gotta go online.

447
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,704
Oh, come on. Sit for a minute.
Come on.

448
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,049
- What's going on?
- With what?

449
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,261
Whatever, I don't know.
What's going on?

450
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,473
I just told you. The chat room.

451
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:26,933
Is that it?

452
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,354
You know I love you, right, Med?

453
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,610
- Dad...
- No, don't "Dad" me, come on.

454
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,279
I want to know.

455
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:44,451
- Do you know that I love you?
- Yes.

456
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,453
I know that you love me.

457
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,791
Your mother doesn't think
I love you enough.

458
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,211
And you listen to her?

459
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,968
Everything I do...

460
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,139
...and everything I've done,
and everything I will do...

461
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:11,561
...it's all for you and your brother.
I think you should go to bed.

462
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,063
I tell people...

463
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,650
...you're like your mother, but...

464
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,986
...you're all me.
Nothing gets by you.

465
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,323
- I know you think I'm a hypocrite...
- I'm going to bed.

466
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,662
Yeah, all right. Go ahead.

467
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,832
Dad?

468
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,585
Why don't you go to bed?

469
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,089
No, I'm gonna finish my drink.

470
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,590
Okay.

471
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,636
- Good night.
- Good night, baby.

472
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,770
Sometimes...

473
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,689
...we're all hypocrites.

474
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,161
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.

475
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,688
How are you guys doing?
Ready for another sandwich?

476
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,441
- You ought to go into business.
- Oh, stop it.

477
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,651
Thank you, no, Mrs. Carmela.

478
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:48,366
I thought you might want this.
You said Ramone backed over yours.

479
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,659
I lied.

480
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,538
I smelled those sausages
and I wanted you to make me lunch.

481
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,292
Guess I'm hungry
for a home-cooked meal.

482
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,962
My wife was a gourmet cook.

483
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,840
Christine told me about her.
I'm so sorry.

484
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,843
Thank you.

485
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,933
We were talking
about the powder room?

486
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:18,355
- Do you have a minute to look at it?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

487
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,238
The paper here now...

488
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,867
...I think it kind of
closes the room in.

489
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,163
I see what you mean.
It's the vertical striping.

490
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:39,125
Somebody even talked me into
papering the back of the door here.

491
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,128
I must have been out of my mind.

492
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:48,802
It's a lot for the eye to handle
in such a confined space.

493
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:55,266
So, what do you think? Should I
just paint or do something plain-ish?

494
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:59,229
Just grass cloth, maybe, or...

495
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,314
Oh, Jesus.

496
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,826
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
I never did anything like this before.

497
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,621
- I couldn't help it.
- I never felt like this before.

498
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,040
- It won't happen again.
- Of course not.

499
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,500
- I apologize.
- Okay.

500
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,628
- You should, maybe, get back to work.
- Yeah.

501
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,394
What about little Eric?

502
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:44,274
He has been ripped from the arms
of the only mother he has ever known.

503
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,943
You know how that boy loves you.

504
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,822
We cannot let her do this.

505
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,950
Hey, Uncle Junior.

506
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,663
I thought you guys might like
some salami and eggs.

507
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:03,460
- Always thinking.
- My mother says to send her love.

508
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,715
Put that stuff in the bedroom.
Leave the sneakers.

509
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,009
You want to try them on?

510
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,552
I don't wear that shit.

511
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,263
They're for the black kid
who washes my car.

512
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,892
Poor prick wears a pair
that's wrapped with duct tape.

513
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,479
You're too good, Junior.
That's your problem.

514
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,901
- Did she say she was knocked up?
- Who?

515
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:32,197
Fuck, I turn my head one second
and they slip one in on you.

516
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:37,035
She's a puttana, this one. Fucked
an arson investigator last week.

517
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,664
- Thank my nephew for the stuff.
- Your nephew?

518
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:46,419
This shit comes from my end.
Wait a minute. I take it back.

519
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,547
- The sneakers are from Tony.
- Cock.

520
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:54,552
You know, Uncle Jun, it kills me
to sit back and watch...

521
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,429
Forget it.

522
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,599
- Finish what you were gonna say.
- I forgot already.

523
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,187
- Then un-forget.
- I notice that he's fucking you.

524
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:09,150
This bust-out is a license to steal.
What's he throwing your way?

525
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:13,112
This garbage thing?
He's already taking your townships.

526
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,241
- Now he's fucking with mine?
- What should I do?

527
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:20,119
- I'm under indictment.
- I don't want to open old wounds...

528
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:25,041
- You're in no shape for disharmony.
- You and I both know he's gotta go.

529
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,794
That's my nephew.
How dare you, in my home.

530
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:32,757
This fucking guy was supposed to be
laid out on Midland Avenue a year ago.

531
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,885
I know it and you know it.

532
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,057
Let me tell you who's not a good kid.

533
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:48,064
My niece. I left my brother's
house one night...

534
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:53,361
...and my wallet was light. I'm
talking a 10-year-old girl, Richie.

535
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,992
Word to the wise,
that's all I'm saying.

536
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:41,159
Now you can make homemade
sausage and homemade pasta...

537
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,913
- Hi, Grandma.
- Your aunt forgot to lock that door.

538
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,042
I told her, I don't trust
that new mailman.

539
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,879
Guess what? I got my answers
from colleges today.

540
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,632
Oh, yeah? How'd you do?

541
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,885
Accepted at Berkeley,
accepted at NYU...

542
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,180
...wait list, Columbia,
Penn I didn't make it...

543
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:05,683
...Bowdoin I didn't make it,
BU accepted.

544
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,480
What about that other place,
Georgetown?

545
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,857
Wait list.

546
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,361
You don't owe them anything.

547
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,451
Thanks, Grandma.

548
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,622
Lock that door, will you?

549
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:31,751
And for dessert, the kids
can make their own chocolate pasta.

550
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,061
- Hello?
- Carmela, Vic Musto.

551
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,938
Hi, how are you?

552
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,149
I'm good. I'm fine. I...

553
00:44:55,567 --> 00:45:00,530
I was just thinking about you
and what happened this morning.

554
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:05,368
- I just wanted to say again...
- No, please, it was a crazy thing.

555
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,124
But if it's a problem,
I've got another job in Wyckoff.

556
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,211
Yours is far enough along
that Ramone can finish up.

557
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,879
There's no charge...

558
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,842
...except for materials.
No, I wouldn't think of it.

559
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,677
It's just that...

560
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,930
...since Jill, there hasn't been
anyone to talk to.

561
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,140
Oh, I know.

562
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,435
- In fact...
- What?

563
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,938
Maybe you could send Ramone
to the other job tomorrow.

564
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:38,317
That way you and I would have
a chance to talk, on your lunch break.

565
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,157
- That would be so great.
- And I could make a lunch for us.

566
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,784
Maybe a galantine de poulet...

567
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,830
...mesclun salad,
nice bottle of Barolo.

568
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,374
- That sounds incredible.
- Okay.

569
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:57,336
Okay, then, thanks for calling.
That's terrific.

570
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:01,674
- See you tomorrow.
- I will talk to you tomorrow, bye.

571
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:08,514
- Who was that?
- It was nobody, the wallpaper man.

572
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,340
Oh, my God.

573
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,178
- Oh, my God. Please, no.
- What the hell is it?

574
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,807
"The victim has been identified
as Matthew Bevilaqua...

575
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,976
...a Soprano family associate."

576
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,895
Fuck, give me that.

577
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,235
"Officials are keeping tight-lipped...

578
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:05,738
...as it may involve
a high-ranking Mafia member."

579
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,573
- Where's that number?
- Fridge.

580
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,076
Those lying cocksuckers!

581
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,204
- Where is it?
- On the fridge!

582
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,123
- Where on the fucking fridge?
- I knew it!

583
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,668
But you had to be the big man!

584
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,674
Jesus Christ, David.
Where the hell have you been?

585
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,594
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.

586
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,473
I'm glad you called.
My sister's been worried sick.

587
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:37,186
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I should've called her.

588
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:41,023
Why don't I say "sorry" to the
whole fucking world with a blimp.

589
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,401
Christine knows you're gambling again.

590
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,029
I'm not gambling anymore.
I'm broke.

591
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,574
Jesus Christ!

592
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,576
I screwed up, Vic.

593
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:55,955
- I screwed up really bad this time.
- It's gonna be all right.

594
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,792
You'll go to Gamblers Anonymous
and we'll get you on your feet.

595
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,921
- Gamblers Anonymous.
- No joke, you're going back there.

596
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:08,092
Is that right? Where were you when
I dropped out in the first place?

597
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,387
- I was twisting in the wind out there.
- What?

598
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:15,433
You and your broom-up-her-ass sister,
you didn't give a fuck!

599
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,144
- You looked the other way!
- It's our fault?

600
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,479
Don't ever talk about her like that.

601
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,732
Oh, fuck her! Fuck you!

602
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,903
How much did you lose? How much?

603
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,488
How much did you lose?

604
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,325
- Everything.
- What do you mean?

605
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,661
Everything. For chrissake,
Vic, everything.

606
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,497
The savings, the business, everything!

607
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,088
You disgust me.

608
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,550
I have to go Chapter 11...

609
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,178
...then the liquidators will come in.

610
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,971
This is it, David.

611
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,766
You have fucking had it. This is it.

612
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:01,979
As soon as Eric goes to college...
He got into Georgetown today...

613
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,148
When he's out, you're packing up...

614
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,276
...and you're keeping
the fuck away from my sister!

615
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,282
Don't tell me you blew
his college fund.

616
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,751
Jesus Christ!

617
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,633
You fucking asshole!
How could you do that?

618
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,970
Jesus!

619
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:41,060
- I'm paying for Eric's education.
- Thank you. Thank you.

620
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,397
You're a great man, Vic.

621
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,610
Wait a minute.

622
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:56,075
How could you lose the business?
It's in my sister's name.

623
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,412
- I didn't gamble it away, exactly.
- What happened?

624
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,459
I got involved with some bad people,
and I got in debt to them.

625
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,005
Fucking Tony Soprano, all right?

626
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,341
Yeah. Tony-fucking-Soprano.

627
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,095
It's a bust-out.
When you can't pay them...

628
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:21,225
...they become your partners and eat
through everything, like termites!

629
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,688
- What about the cops?
- They're animals, Vic!

630
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,025
They started a fire
in my dumpster and then...

631
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,944
...these two guys came
to see me one night.

632
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:35,531
You got no idea what "dead eyes"
means until you face them...

633
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,617
...in your fucking bathrobe
and your flip-flops.

634
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,163
God damn it.

635
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,710
France, 1944.

636
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,964
General George Patton leads
his Third Army into battle.

637
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:57,428
He knows that the controversies around
him have tarnished his reputation.

638
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,974
He desperately wants to vindicate
himself in the only way he knows how:

639
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:02,725
In battle.

640
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,064
- Hello?
- It's over, skip.

641
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,357
- What?
- You know that other party...

642
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,070
...who said he saw something
that we know didn't happen?

643
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,574
- Yeah.
- He realizes now he didn't see...

644
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,242
...what didn't happen.

645
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,544
- Yeah.
- Sleep well, my friend.

646
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,506
Major strategy is the attack.

647
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:38,886
"The more Germans we kill, the fewer
of our men will be killed," he said.

648
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,763
His hatred for the enemy...

649
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:44,433
...is matched only by his fierce
concern for his men.

650
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,174
- You seem relieved.
- Yeah.

651
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,343
Yeah.

652
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,557
So this person, the witness...

653
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,394
...simply changed his or her mind?
I don't know what happened.

654
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,148
- You don't?
- What's that supposed to mean?

655
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,363
You know, when I was in Italy...

656
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,825
...I met somebody like you.

657
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,995
A woman. And it's not what you think.

658
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,497
Like me in what way?

659
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,833
Smart.

660
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,878
- Know what she said to me?
- What did she say?

661
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:58,382
- That I'm my own worst enemy.
- Kind of a cliché, isn't it?

662
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,051
You had to be there.
She's one of them...

663
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,930
...witchy broads, you know?

664
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:09,101
- Not like a psychic, but...
- I didn't mean to sound disparaging.

665
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,937
Well, it's an ancient culture
over there.

666
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,692
They believe all this weird shit.

667
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,862
- Like sibyls.
- Sibyls?

668
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,740
Like I said, you had to be there.

669
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:28,037
Okay, so I wanted to fuck her.
But she was right, wasn't she?

670
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:32,333
I mean, I bring all this on myself.

671
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,043
That's what you tell me.

672
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,796
Yes, I suppose it is. At root.

673
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,886
The question is, how do you stop?

674
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,227
You know what?

675
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:56,523
I dodged a very big bullet. And I'm
feeling pretty fucking good about it.

676
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,486
So I don't need anymore
psychiatry today.

677
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:19,088
- License and registration, pal.
- Hey, Tony, what are you doing here?

678
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,136
I got something for you.

679
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,265
- What is that?
- Fifty grand.

680
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,060
Get the fuck out of here with that.

681
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:37,231
- Why, because I'm a paraplegic?
- My idea was for you to donate it...

682
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:41,694
...to the spinal injury foundation.
I'm gonna walk again, Tony.

683
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,239
I know you are, Beans.

684
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,535
In the meantime, you donate, get
your picture up, you inspire people.

685
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,372
You mean, be like a fucking
poster boy? Is that what you mean?

686
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:57,209
Take the money. You can whack
it up with the foundation.

687
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,920
Fuck you, Tony.

688
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,799
Take the money, Beans.

689
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,636
You gotta take it.

690
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,638
Beansie.

691
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,187
Thank you! Thank you!

692
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,608
Thank you, Beans.

693
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,714
Lilliana, can you get that?

694
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,407
- Ramone!
- Good morning, missus.

695
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,204
Mr. Musto no is come.

696
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,707
- Is he okay?
- He has to go to the other job.

697
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,210
Oh, okay.

698
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,712
- Want to steer?
- Yeah.

699
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,882
- No, you don't.
- I do.

700
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,970
I'd let you, but if the harbor
master sees, we'll get in trouble.

701
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,055
Nobody's gonna see.

702
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,016
I don't know.

703
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,477
- Come on.
- Go ahead.

704
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:26,733
A boat's not like a car. You've got
no breaks and can't make quick turns.

705
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:30,070
So you've gotta anticipate
your turns a lot sooner.

706
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,156
This is so cool.

707
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,451
Six hundred and twenty horsepower.

708
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:53,343
Look out, stop!
On your starboard! Look out!
