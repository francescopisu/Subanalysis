1
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,193
- Have some eggplant.
- I told you, I'm not hungry.

2
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,987
You won't even accept food
from your mother!

3
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,323
Will you please stick to the topic?

4
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,077
Oh, sure, sure.
You believe that uncle of yours.

5
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,954
I never conspired with him.

6
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,165
I wish you'd tell me
what you're talking about.

7
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,334
- Ask your brother.
- I'm here...

8
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,254
...to get you settled
now with Janice gone.

9
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,258
Barbara asked me here. Beyond that,
I got nothing to say to you!

10
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,553
You can't come live with us.
I'm sorry...

11
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,764
...but Tom won't allow it.
Janice was right.

12
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,975
I won't go back to that place!

13
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,436
You're right. They won't
have you back at Green Grove.

14
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,274
- She was abusive to the staff!
- Maybe Tom and I should just...

15
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,610
No, no, no, no.
Don't listen to the manipulation.

16
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,571
You got your own life.

17
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,491
If you had a mother that had
one shred of gratitude in her.

18
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,953
- But you don't.
- She's learning from your wife.

19
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,496
That is outrageous!

20
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,417
Carmela asked you how many fucking
times to come live with us!

21
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,963
Well, he's gone.

22
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,631
Nice work, Ma.

23
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,550
Carmela's been so sweet to you.

24
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,639
I gotta hear this shit
all the fucking time!

25
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,060
What are you doing?

26
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,230
You're not gonna live with her.
There's two tickets.

27
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,027
Stay with Aunt Gemma in Tucson.
Take Aunt Quinn, the other miserabile.

28
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,029
That's all you get from me.

29
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:21,491
- My sister Quintina won't fly.
- Throw her out on the fucking tarmac!

30
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,086
How much you paying
for your call?

31
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,339
I can sell you
a thousand hours.

32
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,466
See this card?

33
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,176
Sells for twenty dollars.

34
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,761
I'll give it to you for...

35
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,762
...seven.

36
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,838
To business.

37
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,997
- How we doing?
- All right.

38
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,332
Madonna.

39
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,669
- Missed a great meal too.
- Fantastic. Indian food.

40
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,423
- That envelope's just the first week.
- I love it!

41
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,508
- Patsy in?
- He's looking for you.

42
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,261
Fuck, they got
the fried zucchini flowers.

43
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,307
It's fantastic. It's stuffed
with the melted dry ricotta.

44
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,767
- Help yourself, you fat fuck.
- They good?

45
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:11,935
Mmm.

46
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,606
You too? Anybody else?
How about you?

47
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,150
Want some?

48
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,361
Tell Arthur to send out
two more plates.

49
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,823
- And some zuppa di mussels.
- You got it.

50
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,161
So telecommunications, once again,
fails to disappoint?

51
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,873
- What's this thing?
- Telephone calling cards.

52
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,667
You find a front man
to get a line of credit.

53
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,879
You buy a couple
of million units of time.

54
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,631
You become Acme Telephone
Card Company.

55
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:43,800
"Acme."

56
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,845
The business of selling
prepaid calling cards.

57
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:51,391
Immigrants especially, no offense,
always call home to wherever the fuck.

58
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,809
And it's expensive.

59
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,146
You sell thousands of these cards
to the greedy pricks.

60
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,858
Cards at a cut rate. But you bought
the bulk time on credit.

61
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,904
The carrier gets stiffed. He cuts off
service to the cardholders.

62
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,699
- But you already sold all your cards.
- That's fucking beautiful!

63
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,119
That's a good one.

64
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,705
Oh, Prince Rogaine!

65
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:21,505
There you go, some zuppa di mussels.
And Tony? The last dozen flowers.

66
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,341
Have these for
Meadow's graduation party.

67
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,677
Hey, those are some colleges
she got into, your kid.

68
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,721
Yeah, you must be very proud.

69
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:34,309
Holy Cross! I mean, Heather didn't
exactly walk away with lo cazzo.

70
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,936
Excuse me.

71
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,856
- I give Carmela all the credit.
- You had a hand in it too.

72
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:40,899
Cheers.

73
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:41,775
Salute.

74
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,616
Things are good. What the fuck?

75
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,828
Richie Aprile is
in the Bermuda Triangle.

76
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,038
All my enemies are smoked.

77
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,415
Oh, Oh, Oh!

78
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,708
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Hey, Patsy!

79
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,918
What the fuck?

80
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,463
Don't bring that in here.
Wait outside in the car.

81
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,716
What did I say? In the car.

82
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,981
You're still up.

83
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,942
Gifts for grad night. What's that?

84
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,863
Oh, it's a Vestimenta suit.

85
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,948
I got a price.

86
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,076
It looks fatter than a suit.

87
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,789
I hate how air gets trapped inside
the suit bag when you zip it up.

88
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:38,832
Yeah.

89
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,670
- Don't you hate that?
- What? What do you want?

90
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,922
Air in the bag.

91
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,760
The only thing to do
is unzip it a little.

92
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,679
Let the air out.

93
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,850
Holy shit!

94
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,104
- My suit's growing a fucking beard!
- Will you let me work?

95
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,275
Growing a beard
or a merkin or something.

96
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,447
- It's fucking alive! It's alive!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

97
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,908
Tony, what did you do?

98
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,326
It's for you.

99
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,453
Oh, my God!

100
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,331
Yeah. We're having a good week.

101
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:20,832
Ah, Ah, Ah.

102
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,222
You look beautiful, Carm.

103
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,975
Come here.

104
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,612
You believe this shit? Fucking June.
My daughter graduates in a week.

105
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,241
Spring snow. Happened when
my parents got married. Won't last.

106
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,084
- So they here yet?
- Not yet.

107
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,586
Ton.

108
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,337
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,091
- When they make the diagnosis?
- About a month ago.

110
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,552
- The wife and kids know?
- No.

111
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,221
And there's nothing
they can do for you?

112
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,558
The various protocols
to date are ineffective.

113
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,061
What could I say?
You have my sympathy.

114
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,732
September 5th. That's how long
they've given him to live.

115
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,028
But instead of waiting until then,
he's gonna light himself on fire.

116
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,115
- Yeah.
- Is that balls of concrete or what?

117
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,994
- Very considerate.
- How many guys will do that for you?

118
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,496
Spare you all those fucking visits
to the hospital.

119
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,920
By the way, Patsy,
coat went over big. She loved it.

120
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,839
I'm Philly.

121
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,092
Sorry. Right.

122
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,927
Philly, yeah.

123
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,432
Thought you were your brother.
I just bought a sable off him.

124
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,685
I'm sorry I had to do that.

125
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,068
Fuck this.

126
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,903
They're never coming.

127
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,544
Where's Pussy?

128
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,889
Hey, Ton.

129
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,017
What if these doctors are wrong?

130
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,147
Carm.

131
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,856
What?

132
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,947
Why don't I just fucking kill myself?

133
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,616
I never been so fucking depressed.

134
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,118
Tony?

135
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,788
It's all right. Go back to bed.

136
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,165
No, no, no, what? What now?

137
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,587
- It's all a big nothing.
- What is?

138
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,673
Life.

139
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,384
That is your mother talking.

140
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,678
Everything's black.

141
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,517
Well, you have a tendency
towards depression. Yes.

142
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:13,273
But listen to me, everything's gonna
be all right. I'm here, I'm with you.

143
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,651
The kids are safe in their beds.
They love you.

144
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,987
- Wait.
- What?

145
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,827
Wait, it's coming from here.

146
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,622
It's not my fucking head.

147
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,040
It's my stomach.

148
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,294
I'm nauseous! Oh, Jesus! Oh, fuck!

149
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,926
Oh, fuck, it's the chicken vindaloo!

150
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,680
Fucking motherfucking wogs!

151
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,726
- Mom, what's going on?
- Your father is sick.

152
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,772
- Oh, my God, Daddy! What happened?
- He went to an Indian restaurant.

153
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,523
That is so racist!

154
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,152
Who's letting those big ones?

155
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,781
There better be Coke left
in that fridge is all I can say.

156
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,666
How'd it go?

157
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,303
- Was Sundeep there?
- Yeah.

158
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,564
My whole cut.

159
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,862
Here.

160
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,826
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

161
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,119
I know. Tony's your best friend.

162
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,873
President Franklin is my best friend,
and he's in there.

163
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,545
Look, some cooperators,
when they get their new identity...

164
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,463
...they do pretty fucking good.

165
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,801
One snitch became
garbage commissioner...

166
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,594
...of a good-sized city in Florida.

167
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:19,315
- You all right?
- Yeah. It's all out of there.

168
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,443
Here.

169
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,197
Here. Small sips.

170
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,162
Wondered about that chicken.
Probably a fucking cocker spaniel.

171
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,999
Stop it, Tony. Here, lie back.

172
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,710
Well, you feel a little hot.

173
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,423
Fucking goddess with the six arms.
No wonder.

174
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,757
Here.

175
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,137
Sip. I said sip, Tony.

176
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,232
What?

177
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,612
So do you still like your coat?

178
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,531
I love my coat.

179
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,111
Where are you going?

180
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,780
I don't know.

181
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,325
- What are you looking for?
- Somebody's looking for me.

182
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,826
Who?

183
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,080
I don't know.

184
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,254
"Our true enemy has yet
to reveal himself."

185
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,186
Three hearts and a seven. Queen bets.

186
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,523
- Here.
- Make it a dime.

187
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,500
Tony, are you up yet?

188
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,885
How are you feeling?

189
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,478
Had fucked-up dreams last night.

190
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,563
Fever dreams.

191
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,942
I shot this guy.
He's a friend of mine.

192
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,530
Now in real life, he does
some things that annoy me.

193
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,619
Every Christmas, he sends reports of
what his nieces and nephews have done.

194
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,872
Who got into West Point.
Who got a hole in one.

195
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,417
And he hums.

196
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,920
TV commercials.

197
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,048
Drives me fucking crazy.

198
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,887
But he's one of my best guys.
A terrific earner.

199
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,598
So why the fuck would I do that?

200
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,688
I was filled with...

201
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,566
- Anger.
- Yeah, right. You know everything.

202
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,945
You've never dealt with your anger.
Look at the cost.

203
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,739
You are the biggest threat
to yourself.

204
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,158
But that's what being human is.

205
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,703
But some people are more
self-destructive than others.

206
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,585
- You gonna make me eat something now?
- Maybe.

207
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,964
- If you keep this up.
- No.

208
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,558
I'm dying!

209
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,354
I'm gonna cover you
with this blanket, okay?

210
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,525
- I don't want you to see me like this.
- Oh, please.

211
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,236
I'm fucking freezing!

212
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,865
Your teeth are chattering.
Want to go back into bed?

213
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,284
You might as well just leave me here.

214
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,036
Motherfucking fucking...

215
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,706
I think you have food poisoning.

216
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:33,379
- Fucking dreams. Jesus Christ!
- Oh, it's all right. It's all right.

217
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,014
- Where is he?
- Who?

218
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,056
Pussy.

219
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,457
Hey! What are you doing here?

220
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,751
Finalize the menu.

221
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,630
Oh, shit! I completely forgot!

222
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,841
Tony had food poisoning all night,
the poor guy.

223
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,093
Oh, hey! It's not from my place!

224
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,054
Was he at Vesuvio last night?

225
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,932
Yeah, but I got an "A" rating. It's...

226
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,059
Of course. Nobody's saying.

227
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,186
- Is that Artie?
- Hey, Ton!

228
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,437
Send him up!

229
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:35,191
Go to sleep. You don't make
any sense when you talk.

230
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,525
Send him up!

231
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,417
Oh, jeez! You picked up
a bad one somewhere, huh?

232
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,919
Somewhere?

233
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,715
Out of consideration, I should dump
those fucking mussels you gave me...

234
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,301
...before you cause an outbreak!
Whoa!

235
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,804
I handpick all the shellfish myself!

236
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,350
You smelling them as you pick them
or are you staring off into space?

237
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,562
Worrying about paying your fucking
rent or whatever you worry about!

238
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,233
- That's a serious allegation.
- Nobody's gonna fucking sue you!

239
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,776
This is what I'm saying!

240
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,737
- Tony, you ate mussels?
- Prince Edward Island.

241
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,532
- Top of the line!
- After a whole Indian dinner?

242
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,451
You ate at an Indian restaurant?
There you go.

243
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,122
No, it was the mussels!
They came up undigested!

244
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,416
Then how could they be the cause?

245
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,585
It's where my body shut down!
Self-protection!

246
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,214
You know what they cook with
in Indian restaurants? Ghee.

247
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,384
It's clarified butter.
You get a rancid hit of that...

248
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,553
God! I mean, you can imagine.

249
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,180
When Indira Gandhi got assassinated...

250
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,600
...I was watching when they
broadcast the cremation.

251
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,603
They doused the body
and the funeral pyre...

252
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,024
...in clarified butter
just to get it burning.

253
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:08,159
- You call Pussy? He had mussels too.
- "Call Pussy." Some concern, maybe?

254
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,869
I am! I feel very bad for him!

255
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,748
Sal!

256
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,043
It's Arthur Bucco.

257
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,170
What the fuck?

258
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,885
- Hello.
- Hey, man, it's Artie.

259
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,678
Yeah, I know. What's up?

260
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,348
Listen, I'm at the Sopranos' house.

261
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,184
Tony's green around the gills.
Flu, I think.

262
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,479
But maybe he ate something
didn't agree with him.

263
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,815
- What, food poisoning?
- No. What, salmonella?

264
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,233
No!

265
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:45,029
But he had a reaction.
You guys ate at an Indian restaurant.

266
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,990
It would help if we knew.
You have any symptoms?

267
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,408
No.

268
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:54,163
Well, once during the night,
I did have a slight touch of diarrhea.

269
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,916
- But that's all. It passed.
- Nothing.

270
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,043
Touch of diarrhea.

271
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,838
- You motherfucker.
- A touch! Nothing! Right, Puss?

272
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,384
Not what Tony has.
Like from bad shellfish or anything.

273
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,052
Am I gonna get sick now?

274
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,512
No!

275
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,015
Did you guys eat the same thing
at the Indian restaurant?

276
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,186
Well, we both had the pappadams,
but different courses.

277
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,730
Both had the pappadams,
different entrees.

278
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,399
Stop talking about food.

279
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,402
Okay, Puss.
Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you.

280
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,946
Okay, thanks a lot. Okay.

281
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,368
I'm sorry, Tony,
but I feel vindicated.

282
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,703
I can't get off the boardwalk.

283
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,207
I'm gonna call Dr. Cusamano.
This is worrying me now.

284
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,918
Poor son of a bitch.

285
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,588
- Oh, what, you gotta go again?
- Oh, just let me die!

286
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,841
Come on.

287
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,051
Come on, up, up, up!

288
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,388
- Where we headed?
- This way.

289
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,518
Ladies and
gentlemen, soon we'll begin...

290
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,313
...general boarding of Flight 129
with nonstop service to Tucson.

291
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,733
We'd like to board
our first-class passengers...

292
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,446
...and those with young children
and those requiring assistance.

293
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,907
- You can't understand a word they say.
- Aw, go on!

294
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,243
Livia Soprano?

295
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,508
Oh, Pussy.

296
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,219
Oh.

297
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,975
Come on in.

298
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,197
So.

299
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,531
Who's your friend?

300
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,661
Pussy?

301
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,831
- I'm confused.
- Isn't Pussy your friend?

302
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,463
But that's the friend that was almost
carried off by the ducks, right?

303
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:15,638
The worst part of this is, it's one
of those times I know I'm dreaming.

304
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,306
Let's look at it.

305
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,935
When you say "Pussy,"
you mean my friend Pussy...

306
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,854
...or, you know, pussy?

307
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,066
Whatever seems to be
dominating your thoughts.

308
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,860
I got pussy on the brain.
I always do.

309
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,573
I want to fuck you.

310
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,409
I always did. "Do."

311
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,411
I said that the first time we met.

312
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,249
- I find you immensely attractive.
- Thought I repulsed you.

313
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,459
You make an effort to repulse me.

314
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,004
But you like that.
You just said you find me attractive.

315
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,215
You're the one that's fucked up.

316
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,175
Anthony, Anthony.

317
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,887
What are we gonna do with you?

318
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,032
What's he smiling at?

319
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,035
No, he's gritting his teeth.
He's freezing.

320
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,163
Tony.

321
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,378
Hey, guy. Not feeling too good, huh?

322
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,090
- I'm dying!
- Oh, no.

323
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,886
You got a case of E. coli or
campylobacter. But you'll be fine.

324
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,181
- Let me die!
- Should we maybe go to the hospital?

325
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,809
- Nothing we'd do.
- Pump his stomach?

326
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,144
Not with this.

327
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:50,107
He should suck ice chips. It's good
for the fever. Keeps him hydrated.

328
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,611
- Anyhoo...
- Fucking ragheads!

329
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,946
I don't think so, Tony.

330
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,907
Those spices kill microbial agents.
Very smart.

331
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,827
That fucking Artie Bucco then!

332
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,912
Meadow's graduation is tomorrow.

333
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:04,872
Ah.

334
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,481
Hey, Ton!

335
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:39,865
How's it going?

336
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,118
- You didn't get sick?
- Nah.

337
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,829
- How much you weigh?
- Eight pounds.

338
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,040
- Lost a lot of weight.
- Swimming.

339
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,959
The best exercise.
Works every muscle group.

340
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,505
Get the fuck out of here.
You never exercised once.

341
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,883
Anyway, I'm $4 a pound.

342
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,264
You know I've been working
with the government, right?

343
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,477
Don't say it.

344
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,647
Come on, Ton.
Sooner or later, you gotta face facts.

345
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,108
- I don't want to hear it.
- You're gonna hear it.

346
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,614
- Fuck.
- You passed me over for promotion.

347
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,448
You knew.

348
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,495
- How much shit you give them?
- A lot.

349
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,165
Jesus, Puss.

350
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,382
- Fuck of a way for it all to end, huh?
- Yeah.

351
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,009
Yeah.

352
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,096
These guys, on either side of me?

353
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,849
- They're asleep.
- Don't say that.

354
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,392
It's not fucking funny.

355
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,276
I want to see you flopping
around down there!

356
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,376
No way, Tony!

357
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:18,756
- Get your ass back in bed!
- Cramps are gone. I gotta go out.

358
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:22,384
- Help me with this.
- Tony, you are out of your mind!

359
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,345
I brought consommé. I wasn't
even sure you could handle it.

360
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,479
God help you if your head is in that
bowl for graduation. I won't!

361
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,570
- Tony!
- Hi, Ang. How you doing?

362
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,573
- Good, good. How are you?
- Madonna, my poor ass.

363
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:49,620
- Is the man at home?
- He's still sleeping. I'll get him.

364
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,999
Give me a minute, Ang!

365
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,254
Hey, Tony! How you feeling?

366
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,465
- Better.
- Good. You look better.

367
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,301
Than I thought you would.
Artie called.

368
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,928
Hopalong, how you doing?

369
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,515
- Can't complain.
- Want some coffee?

370
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:13,894
I got a call about a boat, Sea Ray 50.
I want you guys' opinion on it.

371
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,354
What, now?

372
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:19,942
The owner's got two offers. I gotta
decide this morning. Cuban guy.

373
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,695
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Just throw some clothes on. Come on.

374
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,072
Okay.

375
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,741
Oh, Jesus.

376
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,660
Round 12.

377
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,208
You know, I could use
that cup of coffee.

378
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,878
Yeah, right.
We don't need to see this.

379
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,799
I promised Gab I'd get
10 bags of garden mulch...

380
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,717
...before I did anything today.

381
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,054
See? And you're sitting there?
Shame on you.

382
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,848
How long's he taking?

383
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,527
I'm looking forward
to the graduation party.

384
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,690
Who's ready to go buy a boat?

385
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,697
Might as well tell you now.

386
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,410
I bought the most
beautiful boat today.

387
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,663
- Cool. The 50-footer?
- The very same.

388
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,667
I might as well tell you.
I decided on Columbia.

389
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,544
Oh!

390
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,511
You want?

391
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,889
It's a little early in the day, no?

392
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,807
Sea legs.

393
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,768
Yeah, what the fuck.

394
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:25,484
Sure you want to go out today, T?
Just getting over the trots.

395
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,403
Time and tide wait for no man, right?

396
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,782
Got a decent displacement
for its size.

397
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,660
- Puts out about 700 horsepower.
- Beautiful.

398
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,538
I've been waiting 40 minutes.
The Cuban's with the harbor master.

399
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,750
But we're free to give it a spin.

400
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,712
Come on, Puss.

401
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,810
Rides nice.

402
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,940
Let's go down below,
check out the mahogany.

403
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,775
Come on.

404
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,510
Look at this.

405
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,186
Take a seat, Puss.

406
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,443
Should we test the anchor?
See how she holds?

407
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,153
Later.

408
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,574
Yeah, right.

409
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,624
Why you making me do this, you fat
fucking miserable piece of shit?

410
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,876
What, Tony?

411
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,764
When did they flip you?
Tell me. Don't lie.

412
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,599
Flip?

413
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,309
Who? What?

414
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,551
They had me, Tony.

415
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,765
I was going away for pushing H.

416
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,563
- How long?
- Thirty to life. I had no choice.

417
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,900
How long? How much do they know?

418
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,363
A year and a half. No. Less.

419
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,282
A year and a fucking half
you been gossiping?

420
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,867
Motherfucker!

421
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,121
Let me explain.

422
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,210
I fed them bullshit. Nothing!

423
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,588
Whatchamacallit, disinformation.
So I could live!

424
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,591
Keep earning on any
subsistence level whatsoever.

425
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,720
I would do nothing, Tony,
to put you in harm's way! All of you!

426
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,473
That how they heard
about the Bevilaqua hit?

427
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:47,561
- Because you did nothing.
- On my mother's eyes, that wasn't me!

428
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,400
- Little things! Picayune shit!
- Be specific.

429
00:35:56,362 --> 00:36:00,657
- They know about the calling cards.
- I'm not in that. But what else?

430
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,243
That's it. That is, recently.

431
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,495
What, not recently?

432
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:07,998
I'm thinking.

433
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,792
That fucking noise!

434
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,586
Where are you going?

435
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,755
The other shit amounted to nothing.

436
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,257
I've been careful!

437
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,719
I'm mind-fucking these donkeys
like you wouldn't believe!

438
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,597
Webistics?

439
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,602
Oh, Jesus Christ.

440
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,106
But mostly I talked up
the Scatino bust-out.

441
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,400
Nothing federal that'll link you.

442
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,028
They need serial numbers.

443
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:42,407
I'm telling you. This disinformation
shit is an effective technique!

444
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,783
It's a frigging ace!

445
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,769
What's the matter with you?

446
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,690
It's this fucking swell.

447
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,318
I'm sick.
You don't see me all fucked up.

448
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,196
- Don't yell at me!
- I'll fucking yell at you!

449
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,474
We got any good tequila?

450
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,175
You know that acupuncturist
down in Puerto Rico?

451
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,138
Twenty-six.

452
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,892
I tell you, this broad's ass
was the second coming.

453
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,645
Never wore panties.

454
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,276
Brushed her teeth with this.

455
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,654
Every night she'd drink me
under the fucking table.

456
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,782
I'd eat her out
while I was down there.

457
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,791
Hey, Puss.

458
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,756
She even really exist?

459
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,055
Fucked up.

460
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,743
Not in the face, okay?

461
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,705
You'll give me that? Huh?

462
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,876
- Keep my eyes?
- You were like a brother to me.

463
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,047
To all of us.

464
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,052
Yeah.

465
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,811
I'm starting to feel it now too.

466
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,981
My inner ear balance is off.

467
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,913
What?

468
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,086
Jesus Christ.

469
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,007
I gotta sit down.

470
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,927
I feel like I can't stand.

471
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,347
Is that okay, Tony? That I sit?

472
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,698
Get the weights.

473
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,019
You won't forget to go
to CompWorld to get the gift?

474
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:49,649
I could've got her one
with a smaller screen for free.

475
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,235
Don't snap at me, okay?

476
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,862
Don't press your luck
with this diarrhea.

477
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,451
- Can't shake it.
- Well, whose fault is that?

478
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,333
- Hello.
- Put Anthony on.

479
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,669
Don't call here.

480
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,589
I am at Newark Airport.

481
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,508
We've been held here...

482
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,595
...since 9:00 this morning.

483
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,388
She's still at the airport.

484
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,435
- Tough shit.
- Go get Anthony. I need a lawyer.

485
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,605
I'm in airport security.

486
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,857
She's at airport security.

487
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:36,029
I can't do it. I can't call.
I don't know what to do.

488
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:41,200
They say that Anthony gave me
a stolen ticket.

489
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,953
They're gonna call the FBI.

490
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,539
Here. You better... I don't know.

491
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,292
The fun never stops.

492
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,588
- What?
- Anthony, the tickets are stolen.

493
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,132
What the fuck? What did you say?

494
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,383
Did you?

495
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,596
Someone will pick you up, but I
don't know what you're talking about.

496
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,056
Okay?

497
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:08,770
Jesus Christ. How fucking hard
is it to get on an airplane?

498
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,987
- What do you want?
- Agent Harris.

499
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,407
Anthony Soprano, we have a warrant
to search your house...

500
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,451
...property and family vehicle.

501
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,621
- What are you looking for?
- Stolen airline tickets...

502
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:31,417
...constituting mail fraud, wire
fraud and any other federal violation.

503
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,421
- Let's see your warrant.
- You can also see the tickets.

504
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,340
We found them in your Suburban.

505
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,677
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Talk to my lawyer.

506
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:44,639
- You have the right to an attorney.
- What are you, a fucking parrot?

507
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,684
We're entitled to search
the rest of the domicile.

508
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:48,685
Let's go.

509
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,608
Michael, over here.

510
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,445
Our daughter
is graduating high school.

511
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:03,282
You can't wait a few days
to persecute him? To persecute us?

512
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,159
Jerry, get the door.

513
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:12,125
I'm gonna keep trying Mink, all right?
I don't trust that secretary.

514
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,965
- Oh, my God!
- Med, it's all right.

515
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:23,469
- I'll be home soon. Don't worry.
- I'm graduating tomorrow!

516
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,562
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah, we should go.

517
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,985
You guys need another picture
of me for your wallets?

518
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,445
Other hand.

519
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:48,161
Tony Soprano, weak in the knees.
Can't stand the heat?

520
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,037
I got food poisoning.

521
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,081
You think this bothers me,
you fuckhead?

522
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,542
This way.

523
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,098
I gotta tell you, Frank.

524
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,852
I'd forget about any deli trays
coming your way in the future.

525
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,704
Meadow, are you sleeping?

526
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,623
Yes.

527
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,917
I want to talk to you.

528
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,882
God, am I so not going to miss this.

529
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,771
You have to see
that your father means well.

530
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:01,150
He's given his life for you,
for your brother...

531
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,819
...for us.

532
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,449
All I'm saying...

533
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:13,830
How you reacted downstairs, and now
you're sitting up here by yourself?

534
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,582
I know it embarrassed you but...

535
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,003
If you ever want to talk...

536
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,339
This is who Dad is.

537
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,258
My friends don't judge me.

538
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,513
And fuck them if they do.
I'll cut them off.

539
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,560
I knew I was giving her a bad ticket.

540
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,355
That voice... That voice...

541
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:43,526
It's done, Tony. Over.
My advice now is to put it behind you.

542
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,570
If 23 tickets is all they have...

543
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,698
...they don't have bupkes.
And they know it.

544
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:54,328
I know it's a small thing, but see,
that's the fucking point.

545
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,039
One more minute.
If I could've just said:

546
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,750
"Yes, Ma. Okay, Ma. I hear you, Ma."

547
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,962
One more fucking minute,
I wouldn't be in this spot.

548
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,673
I beat a homicide
and now I fucked up, Neal.

549
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,384
I blew an easy one.
I blew everything!

550
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,136
- Tony...
- No fucking "Tony."

551
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:13,514
We got fucking federal charges.
We got the FAA.

552
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:18,102
Before this is over, they'll pin that
Egypt Air thing on me and you know it!

553
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,316
We got predicates up the ass.

554
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,651
The fucking RICO case.
Thirty to life.

555
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,571
Don't think about that now, Anthony.

556
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:33,951
You'll make bail.
There's no capital crimes.

557
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,578
Get on with life.

558
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:03,439
My mother. My fucking,
goddamn idiot of a mother.

559
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,900
It's like she was never married
to Johnny Soprano.

560
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,905
Is there something else
bothering you, Anthony?

561
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,740
That's not enough?

562
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,242
Fucking demented old bat!

563
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,788
You're so angry with your mother
and the airline tickets.

564
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,083
And I'm not saying
that it's not serious.

565
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,920
But a year ago your mother
colluded to have you killed.

566
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:30,091
Yet you never say "boo" about that.
Even when I try to elicit.

567
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,556
If she tried to have you
killed a year ago...

568
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,558
...believe me, in your childhood...

569
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:45,272
...she's inflicted serious psychic
injuries that are still there.

570
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,984
Poor me.

571
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,576
And your father:
the gangster, tough guy.

572
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:01,122
But did he protect you kids
from this borderline mother?

573
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,874
What the hell was going on there?

574
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,876
What is this?

575
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,754
Little snacks for thought
for me to take home?

576
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:12,299
I haven't pushed you enough
to confront these things.

577
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,845
Somewhere along the line,
I became frightened of you.

578
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,307
Frightened?

579
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,644
Maybe I should've seen that
in the beginning.

580
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,441
Maybe, baby.

581
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,655
Rage, Anthony...

582
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:39,452
...is a big, loud, flaming
self-distraction...

583
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,288
...from feelings that are
even more frightening.

584
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,540
What feelings might those be?

585
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,834
Sadness.

586
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:51,464
You go off on a racist rant
about Indian food...

587
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,717
...your "demented old bat" of a mother.

588
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,056
- What else has happened?
- Nothing.

589
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,020
After two years treating you,
I've learned things.

590
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,647
And I pick up sorrow coming from you.

591
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,828
I had a dream I fucked
your brains out. Right on that desk.

592
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,540
- You loved it.
- You threw that at me like a rock.

593
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,003
Sadness, Anthony, stay with that.

594
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:35,549
Mommy tried to kill you
and you gave her airline tickets.

595
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,347
- Fuck you.
- Now you're really in trouble.

596
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,933
I'm gonna beat this shit,
you kidding me?

597
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,435
And with that...

598
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,276
Anthony?

599
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,835
Scott Richard Sipronowski.

600
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,684
Meadow Mariangela Soprano.

601
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,737
Jonathan Tiffin.

602
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,164
Anthony Tomasello.

603
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,714
It's fucking graduation day, so I
might as well take this opportunity.

604
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,592
I'm proposing to you
to get your button.

605
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,431
I fucking deserve it.

606
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,141
Got no spleen, Gene.

607
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,643
Congratulations.

608
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,354
Thank you, thank you.

609
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:14,857
Yeah.

610
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,192
Oh.

611
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,320
You look beautiful.

612
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,697
What the fuck?

613
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,577
That's right. Get an education.
That's what I always said.

614
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:30,497
Excuse us. Carmela sees you,
she's gonna cut you a new asshole.

615
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,166
I'm leaving.

616
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,931
It's great to see
your kid graduate, huh?

617
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,767
The youth. That's what's important.

618
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:53,812
- What we do is small potatoes.
- And Eric. State College, right?

619
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,524
He got accepted at Georgetown.
It's a little money pinch.

620
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:02,404
- I heard you and Charlene split up...
- Christine.

621
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:08,452
I'm getting the fuck out of here.
I got a job on a ranch out West.

622
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,413
What? Don't make me fucking laugh!

623
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,875
Hey, I lived in New Mexico
until I was 11.

624
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,254
- Hey, you ever try riding?
- No.

625
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,548
The airlines are running specials
nonstop into Nevada.

626
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:25,135
Fly right into Vegas.
Half-hour's drive.

627
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,180
You should come hang out. New day.

628
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,723
Vegas, huh?

629
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,520
All right, Davey.

630
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,939
Take care of yourself. Drive safe.

631
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:46,824
I'm so proud of you. My little baby.

632
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:55,124
Sal knew it was today. I told him.
He's so self-centered.

633
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:08,512
There you go, sweetheart.
Give me that face.
