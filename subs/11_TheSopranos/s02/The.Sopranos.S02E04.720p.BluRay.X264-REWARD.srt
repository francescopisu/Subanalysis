1
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,522
Get out of the way.

2
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,650
Remember
to say please.

3
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,529
I can't
watch this again.

4
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,697
This is the DVD.
This is the advanced bootleg.

5
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,157
These are
the alternate takes.

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,701
What, are you gonna call Coppola
with ideas on how to fix it?

7
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,871
I do not
believe this.

8
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,123
Ho!

9
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,208
Oh, c'mon.

10
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,630
The disc
is in there!

11
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,048
You know what scene
I love most?

12
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,801
"It was you, Fredo."

13
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,637
Ton', you gonna
go see your uncle first

14
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,847
if you decide
to go over there?

15
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,597
Yeah.

16
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,723
That would be smart.

17
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,683
Fucking disc!

18
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,476
Somebody should tell
Paramount Pictures

19
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,727
to get their
shit together.

20
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,105
We're gonna be stealing
thousands more of these things.

21
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,275
So, how was junior
last time you saw him?

22
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,152
His life is about
Motrin these days.

23
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,822
Ton', what's your
favorite scene?

24
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,158
I can't have this
conversation again.

25
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,868
Hit eject!

26
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,916
Don Ciccio's villa,

27
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,210
when Vito goes
back to Sicily.

28
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,006
The crickets,
the great old house.

29
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,175
Oh, it's
fucking beautiful.

30
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,634
Maybe 'cause I'm going
over there, you know?

31
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,138
I was in the Army
Signal Corp.

32
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,642
What this thing needs is what we call
a "brogan adjustment."

33
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,935
What's that,
you know how?

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,811
Yep.

35
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,028
This is "1010 wins".

36
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,198
You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.

37
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,366
Temperatures are expected
to drop tomorrow

38
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,619
after another scorching
day in the city.

39
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,829
Right now it's 96 degrees
at Caldwell,

40
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,372
LaGuardia's 94,

41
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:32,461
and it's 98 in Central Park
and on the Upper East Side...

42
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,670
Great.

43
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,090
It's like this
every Sunday

44
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,384
and every Sunday
you say "Great,"

45
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,719
like it's
the first time.

46
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,429
Could we please lower
the air conditioning?

47
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,348
I'm doing it
for godsake!

48
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,099
I just got this car.

49
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,685
I'm not familiar
with the instrument panel.

50
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,687
Get up out
the fucking car!

51
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,481
Take the car,
take the car!

52
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,107
Get the fuck
out the car!

53
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,235
You nasty bitch,
get the fuck out of here!

54
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,861
Smack the shit
out of you.

55
00:03:59,197 --> 00:03:59,863
Go!

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,907
Okay, okay, okay!

57
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,290
Churchill,
Churchill!

58
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,125
Dammit, man.

59
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,543
Sic 'em,
Churchill!

60
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,795
Evan, no!

61
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,964
Sic 'em,
Churchill!

62
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,466
C'mon,
Churchill.

63
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:24,846
Churchill.

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,313
Fucking niggers.

65
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,231
Barry!

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,649
Who else, huh?

67
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,733
Who else?!

68
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,572
West Essex
Orthopedic Group.

69
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,457
Mr. Soprano?

70
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,918
Okay if
my nephew comes in?

71
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,629
He's got some questions for the doc
about my hip and all.

72
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:58,839
Of course.

73
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,299
The doctor will be
right with you.

74
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,051
Perhaps your nephew can
help you with your clothes.

75
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,352
You want
some help?

76
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,896
I'm not gonna
take my pants off

77
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,232
until I know this prick
is gonna X-ray me again.

78
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,652
Hurts like the fucking
Pit and the Pendulum

79
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,820
just to
wipe myself.

80
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,283
So what do you
want to talk about?

81
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,200
Going over
to the other side.

82
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,785
See that friend of ours
over there.

83
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,329
My car operation.

84
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,414
Lose the miserable puss,
it's mine now.

85
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,374
What's
your question?

86
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,293
Our friend, what's
he like to deal with?

87
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,669
What's he like?

88
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,046
Yeah.

89
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,380
I only met him
one time.

90
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,383
He came over on
The Michelangelo, 1961.

91
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,386
Now, that
was traveling.

92
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,680
The fucking
Italian line.

93
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,016
The food, the service,
are you kidding me?

94
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,226
We had some bon voyage
parties on that boat.

95
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,146
He's a serious man,
Zi Vittorio.

96
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,647
Serious how?

97
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,857
You know
what I mean.

98
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,693
Heads up, sonny boy.

99
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,696
He don't listen to opera,
Vittorio,

100
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,698
which is
a fucking break.

101
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,325
Isn't he like
a distant cousin of ours?

102
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,661
It's so far removed by now,
Tonto's a closer cousin to you.

103
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,207
We deal with him through
a guy named Furio Giunta,

104
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,792
he speaks English.

105
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,254
Going to Italy, huh?

106
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,381
Yeah.

107
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,133
Nice,
I never went.

108
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,806
It's not over yet.

109
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,271
And we don't
get to go?

110
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,399
You got school.

111
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,775
What about mom?

112
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,693
She knows
it's a business trip.

113
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,696
Don't you think she might
like a little interlude,

114
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,989
just the
two of you?

115
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,283
You know when we'd like
a little interlude, just the two of us?

116
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,243
Right now.

117
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,412
Not my idea to have me
set the table.

118
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,665
Carm, you want me
to help with the roast?

119
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,251
It's right there
on the counter.

120
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,837
Carm, it's
a business trip.

121
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,589
Okay? It is,
it's not worth the jet lag.

122
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,757
Did I
say anything?

123
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,842
God!

124
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,427
Naples,

125
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,430
Ischia and Capri.

126
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,640
And, oh,
the food.

127
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,059
Shit.

128
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,815
Look, I know last year, Tom and Barb,
the trip to the Bahamas,

129
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,733
I said I didn't
have time.

130
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,526
You didn't.

131
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,903
It was football season.

132
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,738
Meadow, can you tell
your brother dinner's ready?

133
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,615
It's our
busiest months.

134
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,332
Junior's last shipment went
to Naples two months ago.

135
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,627
Thirty containers,
two cars to a container.

136
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,213
Junior had to give the operation
over to who, specifically?

137
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,257
Ray Curto.

138
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,259
Okay,
good work, Sal.

139
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,219
There's something else
you should know.

140
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,638
They're talking like the Moltisanti
kid might get his button.

141
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,682
Tony, where's he at
with Junior these days?

142
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,267
They ain't
spoke in months.

143
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,268
Are you bein'
straight with me?

144
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,644
Oh, Pussy!

145
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,564
What the fuck?

146
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,941
How's it going,
colonel?

147
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,526
How you doing,
Jimmy?

148
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,069
What'd I hear,
you were in Puerto Rico?

149
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,198
I was playing there once
during the hurricanes,

150
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,325
never again,
I said.

151
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,207
Jimmy, let me introduce you
to a friend of ours.

152
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,334
This is Joey
from Dover,

153
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,293
Delaware.

154
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,669
No shit!

155
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,755
I live in Dover,
here, Jersey.

156
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,964
That's right,
I forgot.

157
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,300
Joey, know where they got
the name Dover from?

158
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,011
The cliffs,
I'm assuming.

159
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,930
That's right,
very good.

160
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,473
Jimmy, does it
fucking matter?

161
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,769
Joey, I knew this guy
when he had social graces.

162
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,357
It's for Marisa's oldest's
sixth birthday.

163
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,029
The kids are all grown, aren't they, Puss,
what are ya doin' here?

164
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,614
It's my daughter's
birthday.

165
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,242
I'm picking up some shit
for a bachelor party.

166
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,118
I'm trying to think.

167
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,248
Did I ever meet any connected guys
from Delaware?

168
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,499
That fucking box
looks heavy.

169
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,210
The answer is...

170
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,715
No, no, no.

171
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,969
Alright look,
I got to go, fellows.

172
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,220
Joey.

173
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,304
Nice to meet you.

174
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,057
You, Mr. Rude Cocksucker,
see you around, baby.

175
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,768
Motherfucker,
motherfucker!

176
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,978
Take it easy,
that went fine.

177
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,354
He saw me with you.

178
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,897
You come all the way
to a fucking party store

179
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,190
and still somebody's
got to see you?

180
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,276
Sal, listen,
that went fine.

181
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,821
Just know this,
you're doing a good job.

182
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,333
You must be so relieved
Pussy is back.

183
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,752
You must
be so happy.

184
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,087
Was a long time.

185
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,422
Did he ever tell you
where he was?

186
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,881
Oh, he don't like
to worry me.

187
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,174
Not even
a card?

188
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,260
That's got
to be a worry.

189
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,511
It's horrible.

190
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,054
Anyway, you must
be so happy.

191
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,806
We're back
to our old routine.

192
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,768
Ah, I love
this song.

193
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,270
Mmm.

194
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,069
Oh honey, I know,
your Jackie.

195
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,158
Listen to me, going on about
how happy I am and you a widow.

196
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,826
Que sera sera.

197
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,704
What will be
will be.

198
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,959
God, he's so handsome,
this guy too.

199
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,133
He's blind,
you know.

200
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,760
Jesus Christ!

201
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,011
Angie.

202
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,014
My god. I'm sure
he's adjusted to it.

203
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,516
Christ, you fucking idiot,
Rosalie!

204
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,479
I'm not happy
Sal is back.

205
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,521
Angie!

206
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,565
I'm sad
and depressed.

207
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,486
I've thought
of killing myself.

208
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,408
Fucking nosy?
Eat your monigott'.

209
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,536
God forgive me.

210
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,374
When he did come home that day,
I was upstairs,

211
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,086
I heard the door
and then his voice, "I'm home."

212
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,546
I fucking wanted
to vomit.

213
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,175
After all that worrying
he might be dead,

214
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,843
praying
he was okay.

215
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,222
My heart just sank,
and I wished...

216
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,973
he had died.

217
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,142
Oh.

218
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,731
To just come and go
year after year like that.

219
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,316
How dare he!

220
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,485
Have you reached
out to him?

221
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,029
That's a good one.

222
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
Listen,

223
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,868
and I don't want
my kids to know this.

224
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,247
They found a lump
under my arm.

225
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,123
Oh my god.

226
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,250
They biopsed it, I get
the results in a couple days.

227
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,044
Anyway,
I told Sal,

228
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,548
he said, "Jesus Christ",
kind of alarmed a little.

229
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,301
Then he went back to doin'
whatever the fuck he was doin'.

230
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,846
Spraying WD-40
on his pocket knife.

231
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,724
Hasn't asked me
how I am.

232
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,894
Touch my face, or something
when he comes in.

233
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,938
So Angie, what
are you gonna do?

234
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:16,192
Benign, malignant,
I'm getting a divorce.

235
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,976
Look at this place.

236
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,436
The mother country.

237
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,189
Here, they
make it real.

238
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,361
Vesuvius, Jesus, who's gonna tell Artie
that mural he spent that money on

239
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,405
looks like a used Trojan
compared to this?

240
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,448
You notice
the women?

241
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,325
Know what I realized
on the plane?

242
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,410
Even the skanks
are worth fucking!

243
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,454
Those were
my feelings too.

244
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,957
Paison, tutto gli
whaddya call it...

245
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,752
Are all the women
good-looking like this?

246
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,630
Hey, you
did alright.

247
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,425
Two definite agendas I got,
hit the topless beaches

248
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,177
and see
that fucking crater.

249
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,929
I don't care what
anybody says, I'm there.

250
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,309
Look at
this fucking place.

251
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,436
It's been here
a thousand years.

252
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,564
Hey T, check out the bank.

253
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,066
Anthony Soprano.

254
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,067
Yeah.

255
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,568
I'm Furio Giunta.

256
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,403
Hey, how are you?

257
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,656
Pleased to meet you.

258
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,283
This is the friend of ours
Sil and me been talking to.

259
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,079
This is Paulie,
this is Christopher.

260
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,165
This is Tanno.

261
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,550
Welcome.

262
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,135
My boss Nino say
you can fresh up,

263
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,554
maybe little sleep,

264
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,681
then we will
pick you up at eight.

265
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,766
And he will meet us
for fare la business.

266
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,351
Whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

267
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,229
Nino? I mean,
I never heard of...

268
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,273
I'm sure he's a nice guy
and everything.

269
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,691
But Vittorio
will be there, right?

270
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,067
Maybe no.

271
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,862
Commendatori, you are
already checked in.

272
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,239
Commendatori,
like a commander,

273
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,700
I like that,
that's respect.

274
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,831
So did you hear?

275
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,583
You're talking about
the Bonpenseiros, right?

276
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,168
Hang on, Gab, call waiting.
It may be Tony from Italy.

277
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:40,879
Hello?

278
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,380
I didn't sleep
a wink last night,

279
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,216
my god,
isn't this awful?

280
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,509
Did you tell
Franny Altieri?

281
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,847
Ooh no, she's gonna shit
when she hears this.

282
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,988
What time Christopher
say he'd get here?

283
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,073
He's got that titanium club
I wanted to give to Don V.

284
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,158
Any time now.

285
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,869
He was just going down
to Corso to buy a gift for Adrianna.

286
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,514
Nino say we always ask
your Uncle for more cars,

287
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,350
but he was
no supplier.

288
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,643
That why
I'm here.

289
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,147
Tell him we can
fill any orders.

290
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,484
And also mention,
no offense,

291
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,861
we were hoping
Zi Vittorio would be here.

292
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,616
Anything you want to talk to Vittorio
about that I don't know?

293
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,450
No.

294
00:15:54,662 --> 00:16:00,583
Nino is a little disappointed
in your attitude of him.

295
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,878
I'm sorry Nino.

296
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,256
I'm sure that I'll learn much,
doing business with a man like you.

297
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,009
It's an honor.

298
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,348
He said...

299
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,227
Why is he busting my balls?
Tell him to get to the fucking point.

300
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,980
Nino is happy to be
at your disposal.

301
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,569
My uncle's problem was he went
to the Russians in Brooklyn,

302
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,029
too much
for the cars.

303
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,489
Now, they kept the best stuff
for themself,

304
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,949
shipped it off
to St. Petersburg.

305
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,159
Slovenia
and Montenegro,

306
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,037
they got people over there that
profited from those conflicts.

307
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,957
They got fuckin'
bails of liquid cash.

308
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,626
You got contacts
in the markets over there.

309
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,338
Ton', you try
this octopus yet?

310
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,798
I'm talking
here.

311
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,386
You're like
a fucking child.

312
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,763
With the food and the pussy,
what's going on here, Paulie?

313
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,557
This is a big
thing to me, T.

314
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,308
I was never
over here, okay?

315
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,602
My brother was and my other
brother the doctor was,

316
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,937
with all
his bullshit.

317
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,028
How mucha you
charge-a un car?

318
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,867
Mercedes ML series,
very popular.

319
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,369
In Eastern Europe
you can sell this car for 110,

320
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,579
120 thousand.

321
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,541
My price to you,
90 grand.

322
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,379
It's manufactured
in America.

323
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,885
What did
he fucking say?

324
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,016
That's Don Vittorio.

325
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,397
You didn't have to leave
your house tonight.

326
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,401
Annalisa, sweetheart,
how are you?

327
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:58,618
Don Vittorio, allow me to
present our friend from America.

328
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,245
Anthony Soprano.

329
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,376
Don Vittorio, it's an honor.

330
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:21,057
Wheelchair,
aboolebarda!

331
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,522
Think... something's wrong
with the wheelchair.

332
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,108
He say
"Wilshire boulevard".

333
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,486
My name
is Annalisa.

334
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,821
I am his daughter.

335
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,696
Piacere.

336
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,115
Piacere, Tony.

337
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,284
Psst.

338
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:48,584
George-a Washington-a,
Bridge-a.

339
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,756
Right, very good,
George Washington Bridge.

340
00:18:55,884 --> 00:19:00,054
Let's talk about something else,
and later we'll talk about the streets.

341
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,232
Ton', you give
this guy a golf club,

342
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,151
he'll probably
try to fuck it.

343
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,511
I come three thousand
fucking miles,

344
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,263
you never said nothing
about this guy Nino,

345
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,432
all of a sudden
he's my blind date?

346
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,311
Nino was in hide from the
police until two day ago.

347
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,564
I don't even think
Mauro Zucca now he's here.

348
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,108
Who the fuck
is Mauro Zucca?

349
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,320
Mauro Zucca
run this family.

350
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,405
Obviously,
Zi Vittorio.

351
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,657
Then I should be talking
to Mauro Zucca.

352
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,535
Mauro Zucca is serving
a life sentence.

353
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,746
Hey you,
come here.

354
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,789
Yes, signore.

355
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,334
Can I just get some
macaroni and gravy?

356
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,257
Paulo, he doesn't
know what you says,

357
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,927
you mean grapes?
Uva?

358
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,638
Gravy, gravy,
tomato sauce.

359
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,685
He wants spaghetti and tomato sauce.
He doesn't like this.

360
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,023
And you thought the Germans
were classless pieces of shit.

361
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,319
Nino,
he's insecure.

362
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,656
It effects everything
he says, capice?

363
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,786
I will talk on the side
to the ear of Annalisa.

364
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,413
What the fuck good
is that gonna do?

365
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,668
She is the wife
of Mauro Zucca.

366
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,380
Camillo, where's
the pisciadood?

367
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,757
Down the stairs,
go left.

368
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:10,059
Ma-jor-digan
expressa-way.

369
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,771
Right, Major Deegan
Expressway.

370
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,232
I'm sorry
if he's hassle you.

371
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,234
You spend a lot
of time in the states?

372
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:23,030
Papa went, I never been,
English from school,

373
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,658
e filmsa.

374
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,460
When could we get
a chance to talk?

375
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,400
Come to our house,
stay a while.

376
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:06,782
I will personally give you
a tour of the... Surroundings area.

377
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:07,700
Avellino?

378
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,951
Where your
family's from.

379
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,786
I don't want
to put you out.

380
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,665
No, you should have
been guest to our house.

381
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,251
But with my father
condition now.

382
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,754
I send you
the car at nine?

383
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,546
Fine.

384
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,547
Ton'.

385
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,758
I look forward to it,
excuse me.

386
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,970
I'm gonna hoof it back
to the excelsior.

387
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,764
I got to take
a wicked shit.

388
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,850
Can you stop fucking
interrupting me?

389
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,101
We've been offered
a ride here,

390
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,604
you know how these people
are about formalities,

391
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,230
why didn't you use
the one in there?

392
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,774
I didn't have
to go then.

393
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,865
He's all right
It's only firecrackers.

394
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,243
It's just
a kid.

395
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,205
No, please, he's my son!

396
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,581
Please don't hurt him!

397
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,212
The kid only got
firecrackers on him.

398
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,055
I want to work with you guys!

399
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,849
Who told you this was the
way to go about it?

400
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,353
Don't worry.

401
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,230
This is Naples University.

402
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,412
We're gettin'
ready to eat.

403
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,206
Oh yeah, forgot
it was dinner time for you.

404
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,332
How's Italy?

405
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,460
The time change
and everything, I forgot, sorry.

406
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,378
How's Italy?

407
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,587
Got to be honest
with you.

408
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,256
Pretty freaking good.

409
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,049
We'll have
to come back here.

410
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:47,925
Yeah, right.

411
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,051
So how's the food?

412
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,971
It's okay,
lots of fish.

413
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,724
Sounds like you're
working too hard.

414
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,059
Why don't you
take the kids

415
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,145
down to Great Wall,
get some Chinese?

416
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,730
You know Tony, don't tell me
how to spend my time.

417
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,524
If I want the excitement
of Chinese food,

418
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,984
I don't need
your permission.

419
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,153
It's not permission,
it's just an idea.

420
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,405
You know what?
Fine, I'll hang up.

421
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,491
Well if the trip is as bland
as this phone call.

422
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,160
There's nothing
going on.

423
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,954
What do you want me
to say to you, seriously?

424
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,924
You better not say
what you saw, Jimmy.

425
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,596
I'll shove that Elvis shit
right up your ass.

426
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,057
I'll shove a rutabaga
in your mouth Jimmy.

427
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,517
Keep you quiet.

428
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,562
A turnip in there.

429
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,646
Sal!

430
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,774
You're having
a nightmare.

431
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,835
I think it was the fuckin' shrimp
hors d'oeuvres on the plane.

432
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,587
Get some Immodium.

433
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,089
You want to get made,
this is no fucking way.

434
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,841
Tony wants us
to hang with Nino,

435
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,384
work out
the dock facilities.

436
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,261
I hope we get
some spare time.

437
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,096
I'm gonna see
that fuckin' volcano.

438
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,741
Oh, ho, gratzie.

439
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,164
Vincenzo, turn off that radio!

440
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,588
Did you hear me?

441
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,410
Hey.

442
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,037
Hey.

443
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,000
This song, Jesus.

444
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,794
Listen, I've been
to Italy many times

445
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,005
and really, you're not
missing all that much.

446
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,467
The amount of sexual harassment
that I was subjected to.

447
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,761
I went one time
with my friend Zane.

448
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,512
Her, they
didn't bother,

449
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,681
me, they couldn't keep
their hands to themselves.

450
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,225
Much less the whistling
and the fucking hooting.

451
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,518
It's not Italy.

452
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,480
Do you remember
Angie Bonpensiero?

453
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,149
Angie Belfiore
married Sal Bonpensiero.

454
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,568
Right, she's thinking
of divorcing him.

455
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,028
Halle-fucking-lujeh!

456
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,154
Do you
know them?

457
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,115
No I don't know them, but to be
married to a man like that.

458
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,033
A man like what?

459
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,535
The 'tude and the fucking
medieval outlook.

460
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,663
He is such an adoring
father though.

461
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,956
Three beautiful kids
they raised,

462
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,875
who are now from
a broken home.

463
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,127
No sons I hope,
three more of his ilk

464
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,253
we don't need.

465
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,838
He's very macho.

466
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,050
Macho, no, try
swaggering mama's boy,

467
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,510
fucking hypocrites,
shall we?

468
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,678
Hypocrites?

469
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,138
Carm, come on stop.
Just stop.

470
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,224
Is that how you
see your brother?

471
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,685
I thought we were
talking about Angie.

472
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,396
I mean these OC
pricks especially,

473
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,732
with their goomahs and their
prostitutes, emotional cripples.

474
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,653
And they expect
their wives to live

475
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,322
like the fucking nuns
at Mt. Carmel college.

476
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,615
It's not
that simple.

477
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,950
Of course not.

478
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,079
Madonna/whores is the full
equation I believe.

479
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:32,000
Clothes,
appliances, houses.

480
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,877
You are
talking about me.

481
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:34,962
About us.

482
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,213
Carmella, no.

483
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,592
I don't know.

484
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,597
That a woman
of your intelligence,

485
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,017
is content to ask so little
from life and from herself.

486
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,564
I don't know, it's none
of my business.

487
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,816
Marriage is
a holy sacrament.

488
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,734
Okay.

489
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,278
Family is
a sacred institution.

490
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:00,779
Roger.

491
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,656
And you trying
to fan the flames

492
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,575
with Richie Aprile,
of all people?

493
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,452
Talk about
old school.

494
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,997
Carm, Richie, because of his
life experience in prison,

495
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,458
he has a sensitivity
to the plight of women.

496
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,084
Oh my god!

497
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,255
I am not even
gonna touch that one.

498
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,549
But you had me going
for a while there, you really did.

499
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,093
Oh Janice honey,
I got to love ya.

500
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,280
Collect the toenails...

501
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,427
Nice shot.

502
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,555
I shank him.

503
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,558
It's a man's club.

504
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,061
I'll send you
one your size.

505
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,021
Whole set.

506
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:23,070
So Tony, you don't mind
me calling you Tony?

507
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,032
What can
I do for you?

508
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,035
Well you can introduce
me to the boss.

509
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,411
You can
talk to me.

510
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,165
A fuckin'
woman boss?

511
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,459
So what
do you want?

512
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,920
Never happen
in the States.

513
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:40,963
Never.

514
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,631
Our men kill
each other.

515
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,638
All my brothers, for example,
they all got murdered.

516
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,098
Or they go
to prison.

517
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,183
Rome has a war
against us.

518
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,228
But our men are
in love to their mama.

519
00:30:56,563 --> 00:31:00,065
So being a woman is not...
come se dic',

520
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:01,984
comes natural.

521
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,361
We'll I'll
be dipped in shit.

522
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,950
You go around like your
father's nursemaid.

523
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,994
I am my father's
nursemaid.

524
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,747
Well if an old man carries
the respect of troops,

525
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,915
you keep
him around.

526
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,501
I did something
like that myself.

527
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,752
We're cousins.

528
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,757
You hungry?

529
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,052
I could eat.

530
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,609
So, you wanted
to talk about business.

531
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,572
Can I ask
you a question?

532
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,575
We not gonna pay
the price on the Mercedes.

533
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,286
Why do you save your
toenail clippings?

534
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,999
Why, you
want them?

535
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,633
If your enemy comes
into possession of your nail,

536
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,594
or your hair clippings,
they can make the evil on you.

537
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,348
I'm flattered you wouldn't
trust me with your toenails,

538
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,391
but can I pass without
ruining the moment?

539
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,478
I already
burned them.

540
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,188
Nobody gets them.

541
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,505
Commendatori.

542
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,174
Bon giorno.

543
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,263
Cocksuckers.

544
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,815
A lot of guys today, they become
soft living in America.

545
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,317
One in five guys,
they're a fucking rat.

546
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,530
You can't find anybody over there
that believes in the old ways,

547
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,366
keeping silent,
putting the family first.

548
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,576
So you want
Naples guys.

549
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,539
Fucking clairvoyant
over here.

550
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,084
That way I get guys with
no ties to anybody over there,

551
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,503
they belong only to me,
110 percent.

552
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,548
What?

553
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,924
What do I get?

554
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,262
Well, you get an obvious advantage
to havin' your guys in that end.

555
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,097
How much you
pay me for this man?

556
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,181
Pay you?

557
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,601
Your profitability
is gonna go way up.

558
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,896
What are
you thinking?

559
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,482
Furio to start.

560
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,027
Furio!

561
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,695
Back up, take it easy.

562
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,196
I'm going to give you
one of my best men.

563
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,781
And all I get is a bunch
of numbers in air.

564
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,451
With all due
respect, hon,

565
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,827
I think you're being
a little short-sighted on this.

566
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,121
He's my cousin,
he's one of my best men.

567
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,748
Forget about it,
it's not going to happen.

568
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,832
I'm asking
you nice.

569
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:04,708
Or what?

570
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,170
Hey look, I don't even
think you understand.

571
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,213
I want you to talk
to your husband about this.

572
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,715
My husband, fuck you!

573
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,383
He is never coming back.

574
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,302
So you have to fucking
deal with me!

575
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,595
Up your ass.

576
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,328
Oh, you're up.

577
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,579
Where's my other belt?

578
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,663
Did you look
under the bed?

579
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,664
Fuck, yeah.

580
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,917
I just came from
the doctor's office.

581
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:47,876
Yeah.

582
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,212
The biopsy
came back negative.

583
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,547
Yeah good, I'll
be back later.

584
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:20,659
: The 3:32 to Mt. Vesuvius
is now leaving at the side entrance.

585
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,069
Pussy.

586
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:56,945
Yeah.

587
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,113
What the fuck
you doing here?

588
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,447
I was
in the neighborhood.

589
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,075
That bachelor party, they're looking
for some entertainment.

590
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,411
A sett',
you want coffee?

591
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,245
Nah,
I'm good.

592
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,454
C'mon, it's
on the boil.

593
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,016
Yeah.

594
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,812
Boss say to tell you one hour,
manigamo, dinner.

595
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,773
Manigamo, I want to get
the fuck out of here.

596
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,442
You drive me to the city?

597
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,235
Sure, absolutely.

598
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,154
I have to ask.

599
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,825
What's it like,
working for a woman?

600
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,952
Whaddya
gonna do?

601
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,704
A woman boss!

602
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,873
In America
you don't have?

603
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,624
No.

604
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,918
What?

605
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,836
Ayy! Tony!

606
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,463
Tony!

607
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,758
Yeah, come
down to eat.

608
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,593
Jesus Christ, is that
all your people do?

609
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,887
The lunch we had
would jam a wood chipper.

610
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,680
We need to finish
our business.

611
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,265
I said all
I'm gonna say.

612
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,604
Alright,
I'm coming down.

613
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,430
Vincenzo!

614
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,897
Have some Amaro.

615
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,026
Indigestion, right?

616
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:12,956
Cheers.

617
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,341
So what is this place?

618
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,471
My father was born
in this house.

619
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,891
Later we make
the new one.

620
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,773
You're born here, and your
kids are raised next door.

621
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,902
That's a nice thing.

622
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,951
You take good care
of your father.

623
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,582
What are
you going do,

624
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,376
send him
to a ospizio?

625
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:14,392
Hey, listen...

626
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,490
This one has to stay
with until he goes to sleep.

627
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,201
I'll take you
back in the morning.

628
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:41,961
Goodnight.

629
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,690
It was horrible
what he did.

630
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,484
I might as well
have fucking cancer.

631
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,322
So what did
the lawyer say today?

632
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,866
He said I have a good case,
we're filing Tuesday.

633
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,035
So your gonna take Monday
to think, that's good.

634
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,578
Monday's
a Jewish holiday.

635
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:16,538
Oh.

636
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,914
I'm finished thinking.

637
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,375
Hell, I thought myself
into fuckin' nonexistence.

638
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,293
Well, you are
not nonexistent,

639
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,212
and Pussy doesn't
see you that way.

640
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,505
Fuck what he sees!

641
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,674
Not anymore,
it's what I see.

642
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,718
God gave me
more years, Carmela.

643
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,680
This very morning
God gave me a gift,

644
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,682
and I will
use that gift.

645
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,891
I won't
waste it,

646
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,311
like I wasted 24 fucking
years with this man.

647
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,647
You know what the church
says about divorce.

648
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,483
Oh please, let
the Pope live with him.

649
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,288
Well, what about
the kids?

650
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,249
They're 19, 21, and 24,
it's time we all grew up.

651
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,378
Kevin is just starting his
sophomore year at college.

652
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,255
Aren't you worried
he's gonna realize,

653
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,466
the two stayed together
waiting for him to leave?

654
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,884
Long as he don't
loose his privileges

655
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,051
at our house down
the shore,

656
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,428
that's all Kevin
cares about.

657
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,473
He's so fond of his father,
that's all I'm saying.

658
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,144
And Terry and Scott
with the money problems,

659
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,353
and the pregnancy,

660
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,190
this is really the example
you want to set,

661
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,900
when your daughter
is struggling very hard

662
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,651
to keep her new marriage
in one piece?

663
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,737
Why you workin'
this hard, Carmela?

664
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:31,696
Why?

665
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,073
For all of the reasons
I just said.

666
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:38,536
Because you're my friend,
I'm not even sayin' don't.

667
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,455
I'm just sayin'
at the very least,

668
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,415
you got to ask
yourself these questions.

669
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,002
Terri, they're not even sure
she's gonna be able

670
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,754
to have children
of her own.

671
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,008
Sal began to cry
when he heard that.

672
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,471
Oh, honey.

673
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,145
In the end, I know
you're not gonna leave him.

674
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,149
I know you
won't do that.

675
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,203
Commanders, Good Morning.

676
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,163
Who are you?

677
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,082
I'm from america.

678
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,500
Are you with NATO?

679
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,794
You cut our ski-lift cable.

680
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,557
Hey Cara Mia,
on the way back

681
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,309

from the breakfast tray.

682
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,978
Cosa?

683
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,729
Never mind.

684
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,987
I got to hand
it to ya.

685
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,655
Great fruit

686
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,867
Che bella fruti.

687
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,414
None of them
fucking steroids.

688
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,876
Come se dic', steroids?

689
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,461
Steroide.

690
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,005
There ya go.

691
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,632
Who said you're not
a great conversationalist?

692
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,884
Ya fuckin' twat.

693
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,183
There's my little
fragolin'.

694
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,852
Ah-ah.

695
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,771
Ah.

696
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,326
Hey, the customer
is always right.

697
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,162
Did I say you
should leave?

698
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:55,006
You know my grandfather was
Napoletan', gran-pappa mio.

699
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,717
He went to America
in 1910.

700
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,552
Three thousand miles.

701
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,139
Just a little boy.

702
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,432
All by himself.

703
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,102
Yep, I'm Napoletan'.

704
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,646
Me and Tony both.

705
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,066
Some of the guys
are Sigilian'.

706
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,109
Sigilian', se.

707
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,029
Hard-headed bastards,
am I right?

708
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,575
So, what part
of Naples you from?

709
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,580
It's right over there.

710
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,541
Ariani el pino?
Your shitting me!

711
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:34,837
That's where
my grandfather's from!

712
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,423
It's right over there.

713
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,635
We come from
the same town.

714
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,262
Our families probably
knew each other.

715
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,659
The island back there
is called Progeda.

716
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,957
Madonn', look at this.

717
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,045
Got to bring
my kids back here.

718
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,423
Show 'em all this.

719
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,429
In the olden time
the Sibylla of Cumae

720
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,932
was the second most
important oracle after Delphi.

721
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,810
I thought Delphi was in Greece.

722
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,603
The Greeks were here.

723
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:36,190
Way before the Romans,
and before the Greeks

724
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,902
there were somebody else,
and before them somebody else.

725
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,449
"The rulers would come from
across the ancient world,

726
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,868
"to hear the Sibyl's
predictions of their future.

727
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,538
She would sit inside
the cave inhaling gases."

728
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,249
I think
I dated this broad.

729
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,043
"Possibly volcanic
though no longer active,

730
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,795
"and would speak
in a voice not her own,

731
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,923
delivering unto them
their fates."

732
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,054
Let's go into the cave.

733
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,656
The Sibyl sat way back there,
see that shaft of light?

734
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,452
Some fucking trip.

735
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:35,666
The Sibyl were very beautiful,
in most case.

736
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,045
Oh yeah, got
a premonition for me?

737
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,801
You, you're no
problem to read.

738
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,386
You are your
own worst enemy.

739
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,554
Oh, is that right?

740
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,725
Tell you right now
you remind me

741
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,352
of somebody
from back home.

742
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,189
Not your wife,
your girlfriend?

743
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,108
Oh, I got one,
to answer your question.

744
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,738
But no, not her.

745
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,490
But, she's someone
you want to fuck.

746
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,869
I can tell.

747
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,664
Oh really.

748
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,710
You know, everybody's
their own worst enemy.

749
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,714
So maybe your psychic power
has been overrated a little bit.

750
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,716
You don't want
to fuck her?

751
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,351
You don't want
to fuck me?

752
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,144
Yeah, I do.

753
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,315
But I don't shit
where I eat.

754
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,987
Que cosa?

755
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:50,533
Non fare la merdo dove...

756
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,663
It's bad business,
we're in business.

757
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,043
Not at those price.

758
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,461
Alright.

759
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,424
You give me Furio

760
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,595
and I'll work down
the price of the cars to 85.

761
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,229
Posto, okay.

762
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:29,238
I get more guys,
on my timetable.

763
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,832
75 thousand.

764
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,543
Okay.

765
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,600
Hey, thanks!

766
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,810
So, how the
fuck was it?

767
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,979
Fabulous, I felt
right at home.

768
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:02,939
That's great.

769
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,440
Real good
business-wise.

770
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,776
I feel sorry for anyone
who hasn't been.

771
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,736
Especially
any Italians.

772
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,612
Someday.

773
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,822
Don't put it off
another second, Pus.

774
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,658
Alright, I fucking
heard you.

775
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,326
Where the fuck
is Christopher?

776
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,954
He's in the duty free
buying a gift for Ade.

777
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,499
Four days, he's a block away from the
greatest shopping district in the world.

778
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,875
Why the fuck didn't
he think of it then?

779
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,960
A broad.

780
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,963
He found out who got eight great
tomatoes in that little bitty can.

781
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,422
Oh fuck him,
leave him here.

782
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,924
Go, let's drive.

783
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,258
What's the matter, Tony?

784
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:32,802
Nothin'.

785
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,890
I tell you we do
real good business-wise?

786
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,768
I got fuckin'
double on those cars.

787
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,479
Here he comes.

788
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,647
Hey, c'mon!

789
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,981
Hello, I'm home!
