1
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,278
Don't miss your first session.

2
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,406
I forgot, I gotta take care
of this first.

3
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,431
There he is.

4
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,521
How's it going, buddy?

5
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,481
Don't you own a fucking mirror?

6
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,110
Looks like you've been
kissing the Pillsbury Doughboy.

7
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,575
All right, come on.
What do you got for me?

8
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,837
- What the fuck, Dominic?
- That's half.

9
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,340
- Three weeks in a row?
- Business slow! We tell you!

10
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,805
We pay, what for? Kid break
window, you do nothing.

11
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,016
- We pay no more!
- What'd she say?

12
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,852
Don't listen to her.
Come on, let's go.

13
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,690
Honey, out front. Come on! Now!

14
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,027
Goddamn whore bitch.

15
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,446
You got money for blow, but not us?

16
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,033
Chris, please. I'm sorry.

17
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,704
"Business slow." Half the block
is out there waiting for blowjobs!

18
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,581
You drug addict motherfucker!

19
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,004
This shit's unacceptable!

20
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,848
How you doing, hon?

21
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,563
The third time this week, Artie.

22
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,233
They can't turn down a four-top.

23
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,113
You're done already?

24
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,574
About time.
I was gonna start on your drapes.

25
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,785
- What the fuck is that?
- Quail.

26
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,580
À la Bucco. Baby quail stuffed
with fennel sausage.

27
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,124
Can I get AIDS from eating this?

28
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,672
Hey, Artie, didn't I see this guy
shit on a statue in the park?

29
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:21,343
Jesus Christ. I'm trying
something new.

30
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,012
- Broaden your horizons.
- Forget the fancy shit.

31
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,182
You know what you need?
A top-notch mozzarella maker.

32
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,143
Like that kid from the other side.
Best cheese ever.

33
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,396
- The best.
- They get the real milk.

34
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,441
Seriously, all he does 24 hours a day,
he makes mozzarella.

35
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,360
He's a master cheese maker.

36
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,737
So's Paulie.

37
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,573
Oh, yeah? All right.

38
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,370
- Arthur, the bank.
- Enjoy, I'll catch you later.

39
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,330
You better run.

40
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,040
Why isn't she going?

41
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,793
After she takes her broom
for an oil change.

42
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,586
I'll be right back.

43
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,714
- Good wine, huh?
- Delicious.

44
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,179
Artie.

45
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,142
That guy we spoke about?

46
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,895
- The cheese? It's my cousin.
- Oh, yeah?

47
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,481
I haven't told anybody,
but he's coming over.

48
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,985
Maybe you could hire him,
help me out with immigration.

49
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,905
Kitchen's packed.
I can barely pay myself.

50
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,991
I'll take care of the money.

51
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,201
Why's he coming
if he has a job there?

52
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,246
You know what? Either do me
the favor, or not.

53
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,209
Third grade on up, you needed
something, I was there.

54
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,545
Does he at least know his ass
from a schmutz?

55
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,139
The actor is the instrument for
conveying ideas. During the next...

56
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,686
Is this Acting for Writers?

57
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,982
Your first assignment is to act
like one who gets here on time!

58
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,443
Sorry. Tunnel...

59
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,448
As writers, you'll find it
enormously helpful...

60
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,785
...to walk a mile
in the actor's shoes.

61
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,789
Imagine being an architect
who's never lifted a stone.

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,959
Over the next few weeks we'll
focus on improv and scene study.

63
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,879
Why don't we begin
by introducing ourselves...

64
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,214
...where you're from?

65
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,137
Mitch McDermott. Raised in Hartsdale,
but don't hold that against me.

66
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,557
B.A. in English Lit from Ithaca.

67
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,103
I've written a few specs,
haven't sold anything yet.

68
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,273
Right now I'm on the sales team
at Chick Brauer Porsche/Audi.

69
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,317
Great. Welcome.

70
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,535
My name is Chris MacEveety.

71
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:56,915
I work on Wall Street. Not on
Wall Street, but you know, stocks.

72
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,625
You write?

73
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:02,379
Yeah. I wanna write for the movies.
Like GoodFellas.

74
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,090
Any special reason you chose
this class?

75
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,593
I didn't. It was a birthday present
from my girlfriend.

76
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,973
I had some problems with my
screenplay so I bought...

77
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,435
...How to Write a Movie in 21 Days.
That was a year ago.

78
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,816
I can't guarantee you'll write faster,
but hopefully you learn a few things.

79
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,573
My name is Cynthia Weller,
I was born in Savanna...

80
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,784
...but we moved to Hempstead
when I was 5.

81
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,080
Despite Corrado Soprano's
medical furlough from jail...

82
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:41,251
...sources in the Attorney's Office
say nephew Anthony Soprano...

83
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,671
...remains the de facto boss of
the North Jersey mob.

84
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,467
Soprano, seen here in an FBI
surveillance photo with...

85
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,636
...family associate
"Big Pussy" Bompensiero...

86
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,889
...was the target of
a murder attempt...

87
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,643
Jesus Christ! How come every
piss I take is a fucking news story?

88
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,730
OH.

89
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,367
Let's walk.

90
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,828
I had coffee with your friend
from the railroad.

91
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,749
Sounds like mag and custom wheels.
Could be sweet.

92
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,170
- I need you to go to Newark for me.
- Airport?

93
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,715
Al Italia. A friend of ours
is coming in.

94
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:33,094
- Who? Mauro Zucca's wife?
- No, Furio.

95
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,555
Furio? Coming here?

96
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,683
What, to see what indoor plumbing
looks like?

97
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,480
I'm making some changes.

98
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,942
Thanks for fucking telling me.
When was this decided?

99
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,610
I do something wrong?

100
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:53,949
Sunday. My house.
Box of Mallomars on the counter.

101
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,286
Fucking empty.
You think I don't know it was you?

102
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,373
I'm kidding, you fuck.

103
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,462
Listen, him coming over is good.
You're getting a bump.

104
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,216
Fucking Mallomars.
I thought you lost your mind.

105
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,052
The way things are,
I got to step back.

106
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,555
Feds find an excuse, I do time
for jaywalking.

107
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,889
Not like the old days.

108
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,519
Furio being here frees you up,
frees me up.

109
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,356
It's me, then you and Sil together.
That's the pecking order.

110
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:31,194
- What about Puss?
- Pussy reports to you guys. Directly.

111
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,654
Same with Furio.

112
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,494
This means a lot to me, T.

113
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,080
It was a downpour.

114
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,834
He couldn't see anything.
It was impossible.

115
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,545
Where are you in the dream?

116
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,966
I'm there.
I could observe everything.

117
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:57,345
He's driving, and he starts
to hyperventilate.

118
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,640
He grabs for a bottle of Prozac,
but it's empty.

119
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,851
And while this is happening...

120
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,605
...that song from The Wizard of Oz
is playing.

121
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:10,650
- "Over the Rainbow."
- No, that other one.

122
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,201
They're in the poppy field.

123
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,205
That one.

124
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:29,169
Anyway, he goes into a full-blown
panic attack, and he passes out.

125
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,803
He crashes into this huge truck.

126
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,557
"Out of the woods."

127
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:47,187
The fact that he can't see the road
ahead suggests my abandoning him.

128
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,315
Who in Wizard would your patient be?

129
00:10:55,696 --> 00:11:00,659
Given the fact that he's a powerful,
dominating male?

130
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,160
Oz himself?

131
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,664
What, Elliot,
with the eyebrow already?

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,544
The Wizard of Oz, what memories
does it conjure up?

133
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,594
My parents' house. Watching it on TV.

134
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,517
Hiding under the blanket
with my sister.

135
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,105
I'm gaining weight.

136
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:41,157
Why do we love roller coasters,
Jennifer? Scary movies?

137
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,954
To experience the thrill
of being terrified...

138
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,457
...without the consequences.
That's very good, Elliot.

139
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,919
Great film, but some
terrifying moments.

140
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,087
That's very perceptive.

141
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,883
I'm concerned that treating
a mobster provides you some...

142
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,385
...vicarious thrill.

143
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,888
It wasn't exactly vicarious.

144
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,307
I had to go into hiding, remember?

145
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,977
- And wasn't that thrilling?
- Fuck you!

146
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,730
You think this is funny.

147
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,401
You smug cocksucker! Fuck you!

148
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,343
Hello?

149
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,763
Who is this?

150
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,932
She's not here right now.

151
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,101
It's her brother.

152
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,687
- Hey, Mom, do we have any jam?
- No.

153
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,938
Get dressed. You're late.

154
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,901
Yeah, that's my mother's house.
On the what?

155
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,611
I'll give her the message.

156
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,076
- Bitch.
- What's the matter?

157
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,163
The bank. She's trying to get
a loan on Mom's house.

158
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,790
- Parvati?
- Janice.

159
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,875
Her name is Janice, okay?

160
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,960
She gave the wrong
social security number.

161
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,379
All right, Tony. Calm down.

162
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,131
She's living rent-free.

163
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,509
She's gotta squeeze money
out of the house too?

164
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,059
Fucking goddamn fucking bitch.

165
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,977
Goddamn it, Tony!

166
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,363
What did I say, AJ? Go get dressed.

167
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,082
- I'm sorry.
- Why don't you grow the fuck up?

168
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,269
I forgot to tell you,
I got a job at RadioShack.

169
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,439
Product Testing. Giving that
phone an F for durability.

170
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,513
Janice, it's me. Open the door!

171
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,770
What are you doing here?

172
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,399
- Where's my sister?
- The store.

173
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,154
I'm making breakfast.
You want some eggs?

174
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,576
Do I want some eggs?

175
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,747
Why don't you put your
fucking pants on?

176
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,500
Let's have some coffee. Come on.

177
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,681
What the fuck, Rich? Mattress
at the shelter a little lumpy?

178
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,685
We're adults, Tony.
And we got history together.

179
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,147
- Israel and Palestine.
- People change.

180
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:45,068
I was away a long time.
I thought a lot about her.

181
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,613
Ten years?
Some men look better than her.

182
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,327
Each his own, Tony. Each his own.

183
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,831
Don't think about moving in.

184
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,173
It was late. I slept over.
We're taking it slow, okay?

185
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,176
- Picking up where we left off.
- High school.

186
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,303
Blowjobs on my mother's couch.

187
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,561
Crossed the line on me once, Anthony.

188
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,022
And I held my tongue.

189
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,901
She may be your sister.
But back the fuck off.

190
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,155
- All due respect.
- Respect?

191
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,032
What do you know about respect?

192
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,076
I put you back in business, sucker.

193
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,871
Did you go see Beansie?
Fucking paraplegic?

194
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,500
- Why don't you make him some eggs?
- Hello!

195
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,044
Hey, I thought that was...

196
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,338
Why did you take out a loan?

197
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,757
- What?
- You heard me.

198
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,927
What is it, his idea?
Like you could pay it back?

199
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,596
I'm quite capable of getting a job,
Tony.

200
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,349
With carpal tunnel syndrome?
You'll hold a beggar's cup?

201
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,268
I never begged a day in my life.

202
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,562
Right.
Fake disabilities don't count.

203
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:07,900
I applied for the loan because I'm
trying to make this habitable for Ma.

204
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:15,241
I'll take care of the loan.
Don't worry. I'll give you the money.

205
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,537
Look at this.
Ozzie and fucking Harriet here.

206
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,207
That's beautiful.
Stay as long as you like, Rich.

207
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,752
She's your fucking problem now.

208
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,301
This is a no-stopping zone, ma'am.
The sign's right there.

209
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,930
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it.
I left my glasses at home.

210
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,267
You need to wear them for driving.

211
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:46,606
Now, into this mix comes
Brenda's husband, Omar...

212
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,485
...who's just leaving the market
with a bag of oranges.

213
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,783
What's the trouble here, officer?

214
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,996
- Your wife's getting a ticket.
- Maybe I can change your mind.

215
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,500
What are you doing?
You're dropping your oranges.

216
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,588
Very good, Chris. Great improv.

217
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,592
There we have it. Listen.
Any questions?

218
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:19,514
Okay, then. Let's see what the pros
have to teach us.

219
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,974
For next time...

220
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,685
Phil and Joanne.

221
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,898
Scene two, Barefoot in the Park.

222
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,819
Chris, Mitch and Cynthia.

223
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,780
Scenes six and seven...

224
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,325
...The Glass Menagerie.
You are the Gentleman Caller.

225
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,994
Bob and Amy...

226
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,347
The breast milk.
Un poco poco, little each eye.

227
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,143
He tells me nothing.
Who's the zip, anyway?

228
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:11,190
He's a friend of ours.
We'll talk later.

229
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,954
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

230
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,547
Come here.

231
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,135
You having a good time?
Food's good, right?

232
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,723
Your home is spectacular.
The television.

233
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,101
- The...
- Satellite.

234
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:52,523
The AMC, Two Women is on. La Loren.

235
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:57,278
We don't even show this in Italy.
Nobody care.

236
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,240
Tell them what your favorite TV
program is.

237
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,661
- PD Blue.
- Garden State's a parking lot.

238
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,582
- Oh, look who it is.
- Christopher, how you doing, man!

239
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,586
- What are you doing here?
- I come. Tony make a party for me.

240
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,297
Furio, come here.
I want you to meet somebody.

241
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,548
Scusa.

242
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,302
What the fuck? Is he on vacation?

243
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,388
Yeah, he saw a travel poster
for sunny New Jersey.

244
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,848
He's with us now?

245
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,807
Mmm.

246
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,602
Guess I didn't get the memo.

247
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,104
Would you have read it if you got one?

248
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,484
Where the fuck you been?
Did you talk to the tanning salon guy?

249
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,737
- He only had half.
- Again?

250
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,157
If you ask me, it's that Chinese cunt
he's married to.

251
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,285
- Bad influence.
- She's a Filipino.

252
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,455
I wasn't sure what you wanted.

253
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,916
Send him a past-due note.
What do you think?

254
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,418
All right, I'll take care of it.

255
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,632
You know...

256
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,717
You know what?

257
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,928
Leave it alone.

258
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,889
- You sure?
- Yeah.

259
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,145
- Carmela.
- What do you want?

260
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,607
I brought some cookies, pignolis.

261
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,695
Our relative from the other side
is here, I should pay respect.

262
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,618
What did you say about glass?

263
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,955
Collection, I said. I have one.

264
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:35,084
Know what I judge
to be the trouble with you?

265
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:39,714
Inferiority complex.
Know what that is?

266
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,634
That's what they call it when
someone low-rates himself.

267
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:48,973
For instance, that clumping you
thought was so awful in high school.

268
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,809
You gave up your education
for a clump.

269
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,104
A little physical defect
is what you have.

270
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,859
A little physical defect?

271
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,736
She's a gimp, for chrissake!

272
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,072
- You were doing so good.
- It doesn't make any sense!

273
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,408
The guy's a player
and he wants to fuck her?

274
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,910
Where does it say he's trying
to fuck her?

275
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,664
- Please.
- Maybe he is not.

276
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,251
You ever think that's why he's
the "Gentleman Caller"?

277
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,338
- Maybe he's a gentleman.
- He's a douche bag.

278
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,926
- So quit.
- I'm not gonna quit.

279
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,262
Just get a different scene.

280
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,434
- I like you as an actor.
- Joe Pesci or something.

281
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,854
"This is Jericho, cell leader
of the SOS.

282
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:42,234
Let it be known from this day forth,
lawlessness will not be tolerated."

283
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,739
Jimmy Hollywood. Come on!

284
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,533
Hey, Tony.

285
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,704
I'll be a few minutes.
Fix something to drink.

286
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,666
What's up?

287
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:05,216
Guy named Danny Greco called
for a loan. Said you'll vouch.

288
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,427
For Danny? Yeah.
I told you Danny was good.

289
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,805
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, at the steak house.

290
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:11,889
- Yeah.
- A few minutes.

291
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,896
Since I'm here.
Can I talk to you about something?

292
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,483
And it absolutely has to stay
between the two of us.

293
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,745
On any fucking scale you
wanna use, things are going good.

294
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:40,084
I'm firmly in charge, no trouble
there. My family is healthy. Right?

295
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,505
So why am I ripping phones
out of the wall in front of my kid?

296
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,967
And screaming at my sister,
although she's unimportant to me.

297
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,427
Got a lot on your mind.

298
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,887
- Because I'm the boss?
- Yeah.

299
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,472
Herman, want a drink too?

300
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,974
That's the point.

301
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,936
You never saw Carlo or Lucky,
or Douglas MacArthur...

302
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,480
...going around punching walls!

303
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,985
What if I said I saw a shrink?

304
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,362
I had an inkling.

305
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:22,960
Every once in a while,
I get anxious...

306
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,005
...you know, just in general.
No reason.

307
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,758
I'm in my kitchen.
All of a sudden I can't breathe, right?

308
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,304
I'm suffocating. I get
to the point where I pass out.

309
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,388
Hmph.

310
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,682
- Just like your father.
- What is?

311
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,518
- He had the same thing.
- He had anxiety attacks?

312
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,396
Well, in those days we called it
a "condition."

313
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,398
Didn't happen often, once a year.

314
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,150
Holy shit.

315
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,153
He cracked his head open
on a cigarette machine.

316
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,406
- Did he go to a doctor?
- Your father? Are you kidding?

317
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,035
Wouldn't have mattered.
They didn't know how to treat it.

318
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,661
They're not much better now.

319
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:01,207
There's an article in the Times.
They got this machine.

320
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,335
It can see images of the brain
and how it...

321
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,920
...responds to fear.
Fear?

322
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,507
A person, listening to a
tape of a parent criticizing...

323
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,509
...I'm talking about an adult...

324
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:16,013
...their fear center kicks right in.
You can actually see it in an MRI.

325
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,899
I had this weird dream
the other night...

326
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,776
With the polyps,
they gave me an MRI.

327
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,404
I'm telling you, they used
my ass to invent some new tests.

328
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:37,201
I was at the beach.
But I had a suit on, and shoes too.

329
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,787
Camera up your ass
the size of a garden hose.

330
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,206
- Want to hear this dream?
- All right.

331
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,549
- Got a sec?
- Sure, what's up?

332
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:58,013
It's my scene. Gentleman Caller guy.
It's not me.

333
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,058
It's not supposed to be.
That's why they call it acting.

334
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:05,771
I know, it's just...
I'd rather do something else.

335
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,107
I spoke to, what's his name? Mitch.

336
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,943
- Cynthia too. They're cool with it.
- All right.

337
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:15,823
Alan's partner dropped out,
so I gotta find something for him.

338
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,786
Rebel Without A Cause.

339
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,205
- James Dean.
- Copy it for the others.

340
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,540
Get comfortable with it.

341
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,419
- It's great. Cool.
- I don't want a James Dean impression.

342
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,796
Yeah. No.

343
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,596
Poor ducks. Poor, poor creatures.

344
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:43,976
Poor creatures. You are such
poor creatures. Yes.

345
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,815
Don't give them that shit!

346
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,735
They like it.

347
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,779
What'd I tell you? He's gonna choke!

348
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,407
Little pieces. They're hungry.

349
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,868
For fucking cheese doodles
they're not!

350
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,454
They eat bread, corn,
and shit like that.

351
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,873
- You know everything!
- Yeah, I do.

352
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,626
Family of mallards lived in
my pool for months!

353
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,885
You too.

354
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,138
Date an American,
that's what you get.

355
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,141
I should introduce you
to my brother.

356
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:28,312
If I wanted a factory worker, I
would've stayed in Kazakhstan.

357
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,025
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

358
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,319
Lot of fucking words for nothing.

359
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,448
He said, if I don't like to fight,
I should find myself a Russian.

360
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,328
Tony, no!

361
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,747
Got a problem, besides those pants?!

362
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,458
- You shouldn't yell.
- Oh, yeah?

363
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:50,959
Mind your business.

364
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,962
- I make business. She's nice.
- Are you a counselor?

365
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,756
Want to get involved in problems?

366
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,008
- My testicles!
- Now you're involved.

367
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,762
- These are balls, right?
- Yes.

368
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,265
Do something! You wanted to be
involved, now you are!

369
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,851
You let go! We'll call police.

370
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,520
Mind your business!

371
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,357
- You. We call police!
- Fuck you!

372
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,669
Fuck!

373
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:38,257
Get your shit, we're going.
Come on.

374
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,096
Move your ass!

375
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,478
Why do you always
have to ruin everything?

376
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,312
Huh?

377
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,400
Just move your ass.

378
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,238
Help me, Daddy. Daddy.

379
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:06,410
You can depend on me, trust me.
Whatever comes, we'll face together.

380
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,794
Fuck this shit!
You said you weren't gonna laugh!

381
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:22,718
I didn't laugh.
Baby, you were doing so good.

382
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:27,055
- Yeah, fuck this.
- Christopher!

383
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,440
Absolutely not.
Do the work you were assigned.

384
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,150
How about where I'm scared...

385
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,779
...and dive out of the car before
Buzz goes off the cliff?

386
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:45,157
- There's no dialogue in that scene.
- The knife fight?

387
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,326
No. I already changed it once.

388
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,496
I gave you the scene
because it's challenging.

389
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,165
This Russian fuck!

390
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,334
Lucky I didn't get hauled in.

391
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,670
It would've played great with Junior,
and everybody else!

392
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,299
I have to run from my own
leisure-time activities.

393
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,092
Mmm.

394
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,553
Carmela would've known who
was on the boat.

395
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:11,809
- That's nothing new. Or my kids.
- It happens, okay?

396
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,981
- What's wrong with me?
- You got some kind of complex.

397
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,526
- What kind?
- You know, sleep always helps.

398
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,653
- You wanna go to sleep? Go!
- Hey!

399
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,156
- Jesus Christ!
- Easy does it, laddie buck.

400
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,746
I was never good with my fist,
but there was one guy.

401
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,917
- Almost drove me to murder.
- Lately, I feel this...

402
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,546
...aversion to my swimming pool.
Depresses me.

403
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,215
The sucker was a sound engineer
at my studio.

404
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,175
Talked about Germany all the time.

405
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,927
I find myself avoiding the yard.

406
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,180
He wasn't a Nazi, he just rubbed
me the wrong way.

407
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,140
One time I pulled into a parking lot...

408
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,684
...and he was two spots over...

409
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:58,021
...rotating his tires.
Like it was a goddamn service station.

410
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,691
So, I said to him...

411
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:06,613
Straight back. Back as far as
they could take me.

412
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,743
And then, it all dissolved.

413
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,080
Everything dissolved.

414
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,209
- That's it. That's the end.
- Very good, Omar.

415
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,256
Just say "scene" when
you're done, okay?

416
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,466
Chris, Mitch, Cynthia and...

417
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:30,304
...Alan. Our "rebels without causes."

418
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,058
Okay, so we are at the planetarium.

419
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,102
Alan is Jim's friend...

420
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:41,398
...Plato, who is about to get
mistakenly shot by the police.

421
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,733
Mitch is his father.

422
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,069
And Cynthia is his troubled friend,
Judy.

423
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,160
Shut the lights!

424
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,373
Make them go away! Keep away from
me! I don't believe you anymore!

425
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,959
- Gunshot!
- Jim!

426
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,423
- I got the bullets! Look!
- Oh, God!

427
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,926
And the cops swarm in.

428
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:14,514
Let him alone! That's my son. When
I saw the red jacket, I thought...

429
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,102
Hey, jerkpot,
what'd you do that for?

430
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:23,273
You can't help it, son.
You did everything a man could.

431
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,032
Help me, Daddy!

432
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,870
Dad, help me. Daddy!

433
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,499
You can depend on me. Trust me.

434
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,502
Whatever comes,
we'll face it together.

435
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,673
It's okay, Jim. Stand up.

436
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,802
I'll stand up with you.

437
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,137
And I'll try to be as strong
as you want me to be.

438
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,892
Poor baby got nobody. Just nobody.

439
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,450
He was always cold.

440
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,176
Dad. This is Judy.
She's my friend.

441
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,347
Scene.

442
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,184
Un-freaking-believable!

443
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,728
God, you were really good.

444
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,440
Great job, Chris.

445
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,609
How'd you cry like that?

446
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,926
You wanna watch your ashes, please?

447
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,976
I'll be outside.

448
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,023
We should hit a Devil's game
some night.

449
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,067
Still get tickets from the Greek?

450
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,944
- Right on the ice.
- I'll bring my sweater.

451
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,573
Hey, chef of the future.

452
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,408
Have a seat.

453
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,746
- How you doing, Foodio?
- "Furio."

454
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,587
You didn't
stomp those grapes yourself?

455
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,592
Look at this group.

456
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,222
Hey, Mr. New York. What did you do,
swim across that river?

457
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:04,142
- Come over here. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

458
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,438
- Hey, don't get up.
- I wasn't gonna.

459
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,483
- Piece of shit.
- Say hello to Furio.

460
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,944
Friend of ours, from the other side.

461
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,867
- Oh, hey. I heard a lot about you.
- Nice to meet you.

462
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,496
Yeah, me too. My pleasure. Sit down.

463
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,129
So, what's up?

464
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,008
Puss...

465
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,718
Wanna give us a minute?

466
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,979
- I'm in the middle of eating.
- I know.

467
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,483
- Do me a favor, will you, sweetie?
- Yes?

468
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,820
Keep this warm. Thank you.

469
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,738
Five minutes. All right?

470
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,830
I gotta make a call anyway.

471
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,839
- All these years were for nothing.
- What'd I say?

472
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,008
You think Tony gives a fuck about you?

473
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,344
"This thing of ours."
More like, "This thing of mine."

474
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,388
Same all over.
Look out for number one.

475
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,890
You don't understand.

476
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,351
We go back. I mean, Silvio I get.
But fucking Paulie?

477
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,811
He's dizzy from hair spray.

478
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,939
And this other one, the geep.
Foolio. Foodio.

479
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,193
If ever there's a guy in desperate
need of a nickname.

480
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,196
At least he's Italian.
Try getting passed for a Samoan.

481
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,532
Sesaga. Three years out of Quantico,
he's in charge.

482
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,784
You're kidding. What about Peterno?

483
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,661
Kansas City.

484
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,248
- Eleven years of this shit.
- Like Tony says...

485
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,585
...most of the guys in this life,
there's no honor.

486
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,629
You can't even depend on friends.

487
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,216
- Whole society's fucked.
- No one's coming up.

488
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,136
Half of them are on drugs,
the other half are psychos!

489
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,056
World full of scumbags.

490
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,103
I'm thinking about taking
my patient back.

491
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,402
- It's a serious decision.
- He's my responsibility.

492
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,239
Elliot, I abandoned him.

493
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,408
We've been over this.
Your life was in danger.

494
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,787
Not anymore.

495
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,374
Do you realize what I did last week?

496
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:37,337
I stormed out of here like a child.
Cursing, threatening, acting out.

497
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,006
That's exactly what he does to me.

498
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,138
I'm feeling so...

499
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,195
I don't know where this
is coming from.

500
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:10,495
You mentioned you've put on
a little weight...

501
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:14,165
...lately. Do you think...

502
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,377
...the overeating has to do
with your patient?

503
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,093
- What is it you're not telling me?
- I don't know.

504
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,640
I don't know what you mean.

505
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,811
- Okay.
- I don't.

506
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,605
What are you driving at?

507
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,818
Just, watch your intake of sugar.

508
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:45,155
And sugar substitutes.

509
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,118
Okay.

510
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:55,498
You know, we spoke last time about
childhood fascinations with danger.

511
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:01,004
I think seeing him again will be
very therapeutic for me.

512
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:05,008
It's not supposed to be therapeutic
for you. This is your therapy.

513
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,640
Do you have sexual feelings for him?

514
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,939
No.

515
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,944
I have feelings. On a personal level.

516
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,449
He can be such a little boy sometimes.

517
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,285
That's it.
The one with the palm tree.

518
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,537
There's a buzzer under the desk.

519
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,373
An office in the back.

520
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,419
All right, tell me again what I said.

521
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:46,633
It's not just Dominic who is
the problem. It's the wife too.

522
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,888
Here.

523
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,494
May I help you?

524
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,995
What are you doing?

525
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,959
Stop! Stop!

526
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:21,751
Ah.

527
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,432
What are you doing?! Stop!

528
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,698
No!

529
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,328
No more! No!

530
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,794
- Please! Stop!
- You greasy son of a... Goddamn you!

531
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,964
Fucking son of a bitch!

532
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,215
Cocksucker!

533
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:16,723
Oh, goddamn! I'll kill you...

534
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,894
No. You go. We pay money.

535
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:46,336
Goddamn son of a bitch!

536
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,180
- Yeah?
- It's Dr. Melfi.

537
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,356
- Yeah, so?
- I tried your other number.

538
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:19,911
If you want, I could fit you in
tomorrow at 2:30.

539
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,668
Should I put you down?

540
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,045
No, fuck it.

541
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,047
Why do you say that?

542
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,636
Getting by without it.
There's no cure for life.

543
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:43,393
Well... You think about it.

544
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:47,021
- I'll keep the hour open.
- Yeah.

545
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,576
"A".

546
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:00,743
"B".

547
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,788
"A"!

548
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,456
"B".

549
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:06,874
"A".

550
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:07,834
"B".

551
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,004
Outstanding!

552
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,382
A case in point:
Words are only words.

553
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:19,262
You just saw two actors have an
entire conversation saying only, "A"...

554
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,930
...and the other responding, "B."

555
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,349
Mitch, Christopher,
you wanna give it a try?

556
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,853
- Come on, Chris!
- Your girlfriend's gonna be pissed.

557
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,574
"A".

558
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,620
Stop it, Christopher!

559
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,123
This is inappropriate!
We do not hit!

560
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,418
Come on! Knock it off!

561
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,338
OH, MY GOD...

562
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,716
Are you okay? Are you all right?

563
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:01,679
Ah!

564
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,182
My God, sorry.

565
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,476
I think it's broken.

566
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,144
We should get you to a doctor.

567
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,812
There's nothing they can do.

568
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,440
They tape it up and send you home.
Been there.

569
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,193
I don't understand.
The guy didn't say anything?

570
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:19,530
He didn't have to. That was the point
of the whole exercise.

571
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,325
But he didn't flip you off.
You said so yourself.

572
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:28,748
Maybe doing that scene brought up
some bad feelings.

573
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,249
- What scene?
- You know...

574
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,918
...where he was your father.

575
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,045
You said the class all clapped.

576
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,713
I was fucking acting.

577
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,716
I was better than Mitch.
Even I knew that.

578
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:43,429
Maybe he reminded you of your father,
and that's why you got so into it.

579
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,933
- Maybe that's why you hit him tonight.
- My father?

580
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,686
Those feelings about how
he died so young.

581
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:53,648
- Oh, fuck that.
- Well, acting is mostly feelings.

582
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,527
Unless the actor is driving a car
or fighting or something.

583
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,322
You want to write?
Feelings is what it's all about.

584
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,450
Revealing your innermost feelings
is the best writing.

585
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,078
How do you know what it's all about?

586
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,288
From writing orders at the restaurant?

587
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,499
Ow!

588
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,877
- Take it easy!
- Your thing with scriptwriting...

589
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,547
...who else is behind you?
Who knows about it?

590
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,925
I hated seeing you suffer with
that writer's block.

591
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,261
When I saw the ad in the paper...

592
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,513
...I had to get it for your birthday.

593
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,014
I'm sorry.

594
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,978
Adrian, I'm sorry!

595
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,438
Are you still taking your medication?

596
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,611
Off and on.

597
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,698
You should either take it
or don't take it. Okay?

598
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,753
In the coffee shop,
you mentioned a panic attack...

599
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,880
...that led to an auto accident.

600
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,759
That seems like years ago.

601
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,512
You mean, you're so busy?

602
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,641
Or you mean you're angry with me
for not agreeing to treat you?

603
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,239
I found out a little medical history.

604
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,950
My old man had the same thing.

605
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,994
Panic attacks,
followed by passing out.

606
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,205
Cracked his head on
a cigarette machine.

607
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,500
- Interesting.
- Interesting?

608
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,921
That's it? You're not gonna send me
for a fucking test?

609
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,714
Did you read the article in the Times?

610
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,053
Anthony, what is it
you want to achieve here?

611
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,558
What do I want to achieve?

612
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,022
I want to stop passing out.

613
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,316
I want to stop fucking panicking.

614
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:49,699
I want to direct my power and anger
against the people that deserve it.

615
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:58,207
- I want to be in total control.
- There's no such thing.

616
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,877
- Of course there is.
- Want to be a better leader?

617
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,296
Read The Art of War by Sun Tzu.

618
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,299
You know what? Fuck you.

619
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:10,928
You know who I am, and you know
what I do. You called me.

620
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,977
Know where I was when you called?

621
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,980
I don't know.

622
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,443
At a whorehouse, while
a guy working for me...

623
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,279
...was beating a guy
that owes me money.

624
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,782
Broke his arm.
Put a bullet in his kneecap.

625
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,292
How'd that make you feel?

626
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,420
Wished it was me in there.

627
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,964
Giving the beating or taking it?
