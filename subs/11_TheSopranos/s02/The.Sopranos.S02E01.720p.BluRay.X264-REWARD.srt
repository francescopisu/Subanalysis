1
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,278
Okay, listen up.

2
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,617
This is the NASD Series 7
stockbroker's exam.

3
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,663
It will test your knowledge of stocks,
bonds and other securities.

4
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:07,376
If your last name starts with
A through L, you should be next door.

5
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,548
The exam is in two parts, each
part is three hours long...

6
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,508
...there will be a one-hour break.

7
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,010
As I call your name,
please answer "here."

8
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,138
- Martin, Samantha.
- Here.

9
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,098
- McClure, Peter.
- Here.

10
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,893
- Moltisanti, Christopher.
- Here!

11
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,049
Tony!

12
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,175
Ton'!

13
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,303
Jesus Christ!

14
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,764
Can I talk to you?

15
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,475
- Where the fuck you been?
- We're gonna talk here?

16
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,316
- Come in the house.
- I got your word, I walk in...

17
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,818
...I'm walking back out.

18
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,279
I don't see you for all this time.

19
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,449
No word. Nothing.

20
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,200
This is how you come back?

21
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,910
Do I got your word?

22
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,594
Coffee?

23
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,388
No.

24
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,726
You look good.

25
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,480
- Tan.
- Yeah, right.

26
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,731
The tan ghost.

27
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,526
You're a good guy, Tony,
but you abuse that jokey shit.

28
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,613
- What you gotta say to me?
- I'm back, Tony.

29
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,697
I'm tan.

30
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,409
I'm in a fucking tan nightmare.

31
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,203
What, you think I'm stupid?

32
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,916
I don't know it when every one of my
friends turns against me? Fuck!

33
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,878
All right, easy, okay?
I don't think you're stupid.

34
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,339
There was a fucking rat.

35
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,132
So you finger me?

36
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,053
You think I didn't know
what was going on...

37
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,973
...when you come to my house,
telling me you're my friend?

38
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,309
That's when I knew I was in trouble.

39
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,896
When out of the blue you start
telling me you're my friend!

40
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,733
- Oh, is that right?
- Anthony Jr., get up!

41
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,069
I think I'm sick!

42
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,826
You owe me the fucking explanation!
You know it!

43
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,496
Well, remind me never
to get sick again.

44
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,667
Never to have a serious illness,
because with you, Sylvio and Paulie...

45
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,212
...and all you pricks, weakness
spreads as fucking treason!

46
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,799
Fuck you! I don't want to hear
about your back anymore!

47
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:15,428
Who's your fucking boss, huh?
Who gets the explanation?

48
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,474
Am I supposed to trust you?
You off-the-reservation cocksucker!

49
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,437
It was a broad, Tony.
It was complicated.

50
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,942
- My back was for shit, you knew that.
- I don't want to hear about your back!

51
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,028
That's how we met.
This fucking "spondylolisth."

52
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,783
That's why I was popping Percocets
like freaking Jujubes.

53
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,454
So my doctor, he prescribes
this clinic for me in Puerto Rico.

54
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,001
I didn't exactly object,
given the vibes around here.

55
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,252
Go ahead, check.

56
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,880
- You don't tell your wife?
- That twat brought on most of this.

57
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,465
- How?
- Listen.

58
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,968
Down there I met this girl.

59
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,303
Twenty-six...

60
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,308
...an acupuncturist. It was the only
thing that helped my sciatic nerve.

61
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,310
One thing led to another.

62
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,646
- You can't send one feeler to me?
- I'm gonna trust you?

63
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,734
Paulie? Take the word of a
degenerate cop over me?

64
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,987
Tony, who are you
talking to down there?

65
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,240
Jesus!

66
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,079
So why'd you come back, huh?
What changed?

67
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,208
Nothing changed. That's the problem.

68
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,922
Still got two kids in college.
One just got married, needs my help.

69
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,634
I gotta get my action back.

70
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,052
Oh, just like that?

71
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,514
I came to you, Tony.
I'm in your hands.

72
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,976
Bring up two cases of bottled water
with you, then!

73
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,901
Come here.

74
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,237
Come here, you fat fuck.

75
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:08,124
Hey, my back! I still gotta get
these frigging shots.

76
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,712
You fucking beached whale.

77
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,047
Hey!

78
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,091
Want to pat this down too?

79
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,303
Come here.

80
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,681
Come on.

81
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,774
Don't ever pull this shit again.

82
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,827
- So your uncle's under indictment?
- 12 RICO predicates.

83
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,121
Who stepped up to run his crew?

84
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,415
Piss boy. Philly Parisi.

85
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,291
Oh, yeah, Philly.

86
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,796
Philly! Don't forget the pastries!

87
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,772
That's my favorite bag.
Don't lose it.

88
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,093
Yo, Philly!

89
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,271
Were you waiting long?

90
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,650
Not bad. We were late landing anyhow.
Thanks for doing this, Philly.

91
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,737
Coming off the lam,
every nickel counts.

92
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,282
These fucking cabs!

93
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,201
So how's Boston?

94
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,704
It was good to be back
for a while, then, you know...

95
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:14,083
Do I? That place is Scranton,
with clams.

96
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,338
So, what's been going on?

97
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,757
Same tale of woe...

98
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,970
What's this I hear about Tony
Soprano's mother, some accident?

99
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,809
- Had her in a nursing home.
- Get out of here.

100
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,061
This upset Junior no end.

101
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,188
When Junior come after him...

102
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,525
...Tony went to the home,
tried to suffocate his own mother.

103
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,070
You shouldn't spread that rumor.
That's some ugly shit.

104
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,404
Only telling you.

105
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,284
- Listen, you'd be fucking amazed.
- There's more?

106
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,038
No, what?

107
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,210
- He was seeing a psychiatrist.
- Tony?

108
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,171
Fucking broad from Montclair.

109
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,714
Anyway...

110
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,299
...this...

111
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,134
...is who leads us now.

112
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,056
Here you go, kid.

113
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,143
There you go, you big mouth fuck!
Fuck!

114
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,382
It's done.

115
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,601
Maybe she's seeing someone.

116
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,146
You know, the way I see you.

117
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,900
See why she'd never tell me.

118
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,365
I'm afraid we have to stop now.

119
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:19,125
- When will your office be finished?
- My new carpet's not in yet.

120
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,629
I'm sorry. I know this is awkward.

121
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,673
My old therapist worked
out of his home.

122
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,261
That's... not convenient for me.

123
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:41,898
Yes?

124
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,317
It's all over. Safe to go home now.

125
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,818
How'd you get this number?

126
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,279
Where are you calling from?

127
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,115
Are you watching me?

128
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,125
You know, Webistics would
be perfect for your portfolio.

129
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,628
I know you're on a fixed income but...

130
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,173
...with Webistics you could triple
your money in a year.

131
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,811
What time is it?

132
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,524
So, "E.F."
I'm listening.

133
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,818
It's fucking tedious, this shit.

134
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,487
Well, you are the boss.

135
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,074
If it's your executive decision
to go down the shore...

136
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,867
...fuck it.

137
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,995
Yeah.

138
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,170
Yo, Matthew.

139
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,716
I gotta take a meeting.
Keep things in control here.

140
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,010
Word up. Later, chief!

141
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:59,517
I shouldn't be telling you this.
Webistics is the next Yahoo.

142
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,228
We're only selling it to
preferred clients.

143
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:07,025
American Forestry? 191/2,
up 3/8. Very sound company.

144
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,192
Uh-huh.

145
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,790
Depends on whether you want to go
for growth or value.

146
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,960
We've got hundreds of mutual funds
to choose from...

147
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,923
You're supposed to push Webistics!

148
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,052
I was just giving them alternatives.
Shit!

149
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,262
Webistics is our pick of the week.

150
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:41,017
Why? It's got a 3 million float,
the competition's robust and their...

151
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,562
...technology's two years behind!
Your stock's a dog!

152
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,980
Ahh!

153
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,986
We say sell, you sell!
Don't think about it!

154
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,446
Please! Stop!

155
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,698
Hey! Stop that!

156
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,870
I'm still manager. This is
unacceptable. Where's Moltisanti?

157
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,165
I'm gonna make a call.
I know who runs this operation.

158
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,293
Get back in your fucking office.

159
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,173
Anybody else got a problem?

160
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,062
- Tony.
- Hey, counselor, how are you?

161
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,523
- How are you?
- Good.

162
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,318
- You look good.
- Thanks, have a seat.

163
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,823
- You want a drink?
- No.

164
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,868
Before we commence, a thousand
thank-yous for Webistics.

165
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,412
I sold off some of my Disney
to buy it.

166
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,497
My pleasure.

167
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,875
So, where do we stand this month?

168
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,921
Your uncle's petitioning to get out
on a medical, pending trial.

169
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,006
Let him.

170
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:59,262
- He thinks they might let him out.
- Maybe as a temptation for you to act.

171
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,516
Since you're at the helm, it gets
back to putting up bigger blinds.

172
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,602
Limiting your exposure to
potential RICO boo-boos.

173
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,814
Only way to run a family these days
is bunker-style...

174
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,566
...you peer out through the slit.

175
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,026
Excuse me.

176
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,653
Yeah.

177
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,531
You're not gonna believe this.
Your sister's here.

178
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,741
- Barbara?
- No, Janice.

179
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,577
- You're shitting me.
- No.

180
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,871
I wonder what the scam is.

181
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,666
I'm gonna be 5 grand lighter before
she rain-dances back to the commune.

182
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,130
Tell her she can stay.

183
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,965
Are you sure?

184
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,925
Yeah.

185
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:42,430
We'll get Barbara, Tom and the kids
and make a reunion out of it.

186
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,559
- But obviously...
- Your mother isn't welcome.

187
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,144
Give Janice my love.

188
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,730
See you later.

189
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,279
- My sister's here from Seattle.
- Nice.

190
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,119
Where is he?

191
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,290
Let me pinch those bulldog cheeks.
Come over here!

192
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,375
- Puerto Rico?
- Yeah.

193
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,755
That water down there. You think
you'd have shit some weight off.

194
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,300
You say we were gonna crab the
river looking for him?

195
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,386
- What's the matter with you?
- Tony explained it.

196
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,641
- Listen to this.
- You heard about Jimmy Altieri?

197
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,476
Flipped, fucking asshole.

198
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,605
- Had two when they buried him.
- So, all my money on the street...

199
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,609
...all those payments,
I guess just evaporated?

200
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,445
We made your pickups for you.

201
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,448
Thanks, Paulie. I mean that.

202
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,991
No shit.

203
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:49,288
- They all paid up to the letter?
- Few things got lost in the confusion.

204
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,998
You can picture.

205
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,793
Did what we could with the
information we had.

206
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,629
Boss of the family
deserves the credit.

207
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,011
- Salute!
- Salute!

208
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,390
- Hey, Silv.
- What?

209
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,683
What?

210
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,978
I've been gone a long time.
Let me hear it.

211
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,025
"Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in."

212
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,195
"All right, Kay.

213
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,741
Just this one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs."

214
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,913
"Is it true, Michael?"

215
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,166
"No."

216
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,254
"You fucking schifosa."

217
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,176
"Our true enemy has yet...

218
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,928
...to reveal himself."

219
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,597
He's on a roll!

220
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,310
I gotta get the fuck out of here!

221
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,814
Oh, Tony, I hate to ruin the party.

222
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,109
Got a call from Loiaco
down at brokerage.

223
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,487
"Chip and Dale" sent one
of the brokers...

224
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,033
...to the emergency room.
Oh, fuck me! These kids!

225
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,453
My fucking nephew, right?

226
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,499
You call him and tell him
I want to see him right away.

227
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,179
It all checks out.

228
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,767
Puerto Rico, the clinic.
All that shit, from what I can tell.

229
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:49,033
- How was the guest bed, sleep okay?
- Great.

230
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,161
Except usually I bring my own
pillow. Ergonomic.

231
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,539
Got ripped off at a bus stop
in Rapid City.

232
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,875
Linoleum's not good enough no more?

233
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,337
Look who decides to join us!
My little brother.

234
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,381
- How you doing, Jan?
- Good.

235
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,258
- "Parvati."
- I'm her brother, I get a pass.

236
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,595
You look good.
You look like a teenager.

237
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,849
- My therapist says I'm regressing.
- Your therapist?

238
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,268
- Who pays for that?
- State of Washington.

239
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,521
- Total disability.
- Oh, yeah...

240
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,523
...the Epstein-Barr.
Was.

241
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,651
Carpal tunnel from my last job.
Steam milk machine.

242
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,528
No worse pain.

243
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,616
I stayed up waiting.
When did you get in?

244
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,618
Late, you know, morning.

245
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,414
What's that smell?

246
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,624
Miso soup with seaweed.

247
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,793
She was telling us about Seattle.

248
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,379
I better not see those
grunge pants on you.

249
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,632
- Dad, how do you stay so hip?
- I'll be back in a sec.

250
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,927
Don't let your father near my soup.
He makes fun...

251
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,888
...but he'll eat anything
that's not locked away.

252
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,812
Don't see her in years
and you start in on her diet?

253
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,690
Believe me, she gives as good
as she gets.

254
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,031
Give me a hit off that.

255
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,369
Oh, ho! Who's in charge here?

256
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:23,085
You look sensational, Janice,
really. You know, not a line.

257
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:28,090
- Beautiful kids. You must be proud.
- Yeah, how about that, huh?

258
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,010
Even with our genes.

259
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,682
So, you still with that... Adolf?

260
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,392
Rolf.

261
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,645
No. Rolf went back to Andorra.

262
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:49,195
- You seem good. Mood-wise.
- Yeah, things are very good nowadays.

263
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,698
How are things really with Ma?

264
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,618
She's dead to me.

265
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,413
I don't want to get in your way.

266
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,707
You stayed and took the brunt.

267
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,376
Barb and I, we're never gonna forget.

268
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:10,508
You forgot it okay for about 20
years. At least Barb pitched in.

269
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:15,638
I've made my share of mistakes. But
Ma can't stay in the hospital forever.

270
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:20,476
I'll tell you about her stroke.
It's called a conversion reaction.

271
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,396
It's a big opera brought on by
repressed rage. It's bullshit.

272
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,273
No infarc-whatever-the-fuck.

273
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,193
But the symptoms were the same
as a stroke...

274
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,071
...so she can't take care of herself.

275
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,657
She's on the lam in that hospital.
From me.

276
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,826
Who did what to who,
it's not my business.

277
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:42,206
Mom is bewildered. I mention you
and her eyes fill up with tears.

278
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,542
Oh, boy!

279
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,420
I'm not asking you to step in, Tony.

280
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,423
It's my turn now. That's why I came.

281
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,802
She's a strega. She's the devil.

282
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:59,181
She was. Now she's just a confused,
frightened old woman.

283
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,104
So, look, all I need is
a couple hundred bucks...

284
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,607
...to fix her car so I can get back
and forth to the hospital.

285
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,736
Then I'll take her to Seattle.
I'll stay in her house meanwhile.

286
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,738
Oh, I doubt that.

287
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,825
- I just put her house on the market.
- Oh.

288
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,120
Look...

289
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,002
I'm glad you're here. Okay?

290
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,714
You want to play Florence Nightingale,
that's your choice.

291
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,720
Only this is the last time
we mention her in this house.

292
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,097
Okay.

293
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,238
Hey, T!

294
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,955
Seven and Seven, over here.
Whoa, what's the matter now?

295
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,959
Loiaco called. Your two friends
beat the shit out of a broker.

296
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,920
- Two others quit.
- He was pushing some other stock!

297
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,715
It attracts negative attention.

298
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,260
Then the fucks rip off
a Porsche from our own building.

299
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,847
- I'll call them.
- No, you'll go down there. Now.

300
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,392
What did you get your license
for, your résumé?

301
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,523
I told you, spend more time
down at the brokerage.

302
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,653
You're the SEC compliance officer,
for chrissake!

303
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,989
You gotta exercise impulse control.

304
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,160
Okay, Ton. I'm sorry.

305
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,161
Okay.

306
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,497
All right.

307
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,881
- I can't show it in this condition.
- What is this?

308
00:27:56,132 --> 00:28:00,177
There's a high school up the street.
A sink was left on upstairs.

309
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,179
You don't even want to see
the toilets.

310
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,639
Excuse me.

311
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,562
Wait'll I catch these kids.

312
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,856
Break a few windows,
think they're Johnny Badass.

313
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,024
The fuckin' jackals.

314
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,818
Will you stop, please?

315
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,737
Your sister Barbara and the kids
are coming down.

316
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,906
You better not be in this mood.

317
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,577
- And I need you to pick up sausage.
- Yeah, how many pounds, hot or sweet?

318
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,498
Don't you act like it's a chore.
This party was your idea.

319
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,584
You said you were happy
Janice was home.

320
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,546
And my parents are coming and...

321
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,798
Oh, really?

322
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,760
Now that the dragon lady's gone,
they'll set foot in our house?

323
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,305
She said some horrible things
to them over the years.

324
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,311
Hey, I'm not defending her.
She's dead to me.

325
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,523
Mope your way through this,
I'll cut your throat.

326
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,193
- I've been in a great mood lately.
- Right.

327
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,864
You need to start therapy again.
You're self-medicating.

328
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,534
- We haven't had sex since...
- Forget it. No therapy.

329
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,913
You should take a look at what they
did to your mother's bedroom.

330
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,757
They're rookies. They're not used
to this kind of stress...

331
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,718
- He better not say a word.
- It won't happen again.

332
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,805
- You got my word on that.
- I appreciate it, Chris, thank you.

333
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,142
Come on in.

334
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,104
Hey, Chris, brought you a little capp.

335
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,190
Thanks.

336
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,858
Sit down.

337
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,660
Refresh my memory on this play
we're making on Webistics.

338
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:52,080
We own 400,000 shares at 60 cents.

339
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,458
Trade on the bulletin board, OTC.

340
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,461
If we cold-call enough
seniors, pump and dump.

341
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,632
Yeah, yeah. You guys ain't spent
much time in the NFL, face it.

342
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,759
What? Two years with Eddie Stags.

343
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,636
Besides waxing his car.

344
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,680
- When he was in county...
- When you're bleeding a guy...

345
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,266
...you don't squeeze him
dry right away.

346
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,062
Contrarily, you let him
do his bidding. Suavely.

347
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:20,400
So you can bleed next week and the
week after. At a minimum.

348
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,784
We don't need a guy getting pissed
and running to the SEC.

349
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,037
- Is that what you're saying?
- Break it down.

350
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,708
- Sorry, Chris.
- When are we dumping the stock?

351
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,877
You'll know when you need to know.

352
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,629
Excellent.

353
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,966
This is cold, by the way.

354
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,762
Guys.

355
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:54,059
Any more Porsches disappear, make it
two towns over. And I want a taste.

356
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,644
You're the man.

357
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,446
She's gonna be so happy to see you.

358
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,741
- Grandma, it's me.
- Look who's here.

359
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:14,830
- Ma, I'm going downstairs.
- You spend all day on that elevator.

360
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,631
Grandma, you've got to eat.

361
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,091
Let me die.

362
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,176
Don't say that.

363
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,012
I saw a light.

364
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,140
And voices calling out to me.

365
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,810
What went on with you and Dad?
Mom won't tell me.

366
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,770
What? Why, what'd he say?

367
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,691
- Nothing. He won't mention you.
- Eh, that one.

368
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,943
He blames me for everything.

369
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,278
I know. Me too.

370
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,948
At night... they hit us.

371
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,036
- Why can't our family just get along?
- Some people don't want to.

372
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,373
But you, you listen to him.
You do what he says.

373
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,167
He's your father.

374
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:06,965
I won't leave you here like this.
They can't stop me from seeing you.

375
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,928
Meadow. Meadow.

376
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:16,350
Take that, in the drawer, in the
drawer. Take it.

377
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,485
Oh, my God. This was
your grandmother's, wasn't it?

378
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,404
It's so you won't forget me.

379
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,446
Come on, motherfuck!

380
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,115
Motherfuck!

381
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,912
Oh, fuck.

382
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:40,392
I told my family
I got broadsided...

383
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,729
...but I passed out behind the wheel.

384
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,487
See, my mother and me,
we had a falling out.

385
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:58,660
And since then, things
have been good.

386
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,622
- Clean break.
- What kind of falling out?

387
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,625
One of those unfortunate situations.

388
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,796
A lot of screaming, profanity.

389
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,883
Anyway, things were good.

390
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,929
And then my sister came back.
It's good to see her, I guess.

391
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,599
Cues from childhood kick in.
Older sister.

392
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,642
That should be obvious enough.

393
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,270
It's starting to bleed
into my business.

394
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,772
What sort of business?

395
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,816
Commercial and non-putrescible waste.

396
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,779
Mr...

397
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,822
..."Spears."

398
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,158
I watch the news like everyone else.

399
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:42,120
I know who you are.
And I saw Analyze This.

400
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:46,708
I don't need the ramifications that
could arise from treating someone...

401
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,543
...like yourself.

402
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,463
Analyze This?

403
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,299
It's a comedy.

404
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,802
I'm not taking new patients.

405
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,906
Oh, my baby sister!

406
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,785
Oh, you look great!
Who is this little guy?

407
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,829
Traffic was terrible...

408
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,206
Keep it down!
You'll scare the neighbors!

409
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,375
Oh, fuck!

410
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,715
Oh, my baby!

411
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,676
Cut it out. Knock it off!

412
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:48,228
- Carm, the fire's almost ready.
- Great, Parv, I'll be out in a second.

413
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,567
"Parvati," she's a cheese now?

414
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,361
- It's a Hindu goddess.
- Nice for her.

415
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,115
She still answers to "Janice"
if it makes you more comfortable.

416
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:06,705
You! Go to the market, pick up
a couple cans of pears.

417
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,959
Canned pears, not fresh.
That's the secret to my pound cake.

418
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,171
And get some basilico
while you're there.

419
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:18,758
- The pears, you want the Dole?
- I'm not even gonna answer this time.

420
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:23,138
There's a new market, Dad, on Pike.
Lot of changes since you've been here.

421
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,184
With that Mommy Dearest around?
Never again, I swore it.

422
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,896
It's exactly what she wanted.
You played right into her hands.

423
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,899
Remember what she said to you
at your wedding?

424
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,278
She said it was a mistake. Tony
would get bored with you.

425
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,534
Cannonball!

426
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,077
Hey, take it easy.

427
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,958
Tom, let me ask you something.
You ever go down to Cape...

428
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,838
I love seeing them like that
over a fire.

429
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,549
They're better over a spit.

430
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,929
Who does Anthony look like right now?

431
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,014
Dad.

432
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,519
We stopped in to see Ma.
How do you think she is?

433
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,314
Ma? A little weak,
but she's all there.

434
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,151
Some family reunion, our mother
is barred from the premises.

435
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,780
You shouldn't get too close.
Look what she tried to do to Tony.

436
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,200
I have no fantasies about my mother.

437
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,371
You know he's selling the house?
Ma's house.

438
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:37,045
That's what I'm talking about. Don't
get involved, let Tony handle it.

439
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:43,718
I called you 'cause I thought you'd
want to know if your mother was ill.

440
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:48,640
180 grand he's asking for that place.
Like he needs that.

441
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,685
I'm glad someone's taking charge.

442
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,478
You'll get your cut.

443
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,898
Ma's not dead yet and there's no will.

444
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,237
What? I mean, Ma still has rights.

445
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,950
Tony pays for her retirement home,
for the upkeep on her car...

446
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:12,247
Take it easy. According to you,
that could've been Robert Mitchum.

447
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,501
Jesus Christ. Fucking Paulie
Gualtieri. Isn't he dead yet?

448
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,009
You're not gonna stay for dessert?
It's grappa cake my mother made.

449
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,511
My friends are having
a gallery opening...

450
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,556
...and I'm trying to get them
to finance my video.

451
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,725
I'll leave some cake out for you.

452
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,977
Hey, I'm sorry.

453
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,605
- Hey.
- What's up?

454
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,310
What the fuck?

455
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:21,232
- I am sure there's an explanation.
- Oh, there is. There is.

456
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:26,029
Take Ma back to Seattle. She came
for the house and a $400 car.

457
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,115
That was the con.
That's the level she works at.

458
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,411
- Maybe the sign was broken or fell.
- I'm still a little fat kid to her.

459
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,790
She think she's gonna stop the
sale, picking up a sign?

460
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,918
She were here, I'd bounce her
head against the wall!

461
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,631
Look at yourself, Tony!

462
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,425
What do you care about that house?

463
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:51,513
It's not gonna stop with the house.
The $300 pillow...

464
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:56,267
...then the video equipment.
When are you getting back to therapy?

465
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,770
Hey, don't start with that. Okay?

466
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,649
I'm not insane and I'm not
overreacting. You don't know...

467
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,276
...this little pucchiac...
All right!

468
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,821
This is getting you no place.
Go outside...

469
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:13,201
...join the party, be with friends,
have some pleasure. Go ahead.

470
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,872
- Fucking bitch!
- Tony! Go ahead. Go have a beer.

471
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:32,137
- What the fuck you doing?
- Second seating coming up.

472
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,305
Fucking moron.

473
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,309
Look at my wife over there.

474
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,855
No, wait, Ton. The neighbor's dog
is on your property.

475
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,529
You're a fucking moron.

476
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,532
Anyway, we flew first class.

477
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,616
What service?

478
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,910
You get frequent flyer upgrades?

479
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,666
Only time you took a trip was with the
Rockette who put LSD in your drink.

480
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,502
- Where'd you get the tickets? Cuban?
- Yeah.

481
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,298
There must be a way to divert
frequent flyer miles on a grand scale.

482
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,301
You gotta break into the
main computer.

483
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,720
- What is that, "cracking"?
- Hacking.

484
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,098
Shelley Hack! Remember her?

485
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,852
- Yeah, those were the days.
- Good actress.

486
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,523
Let me tell you something, you can't
get good sausage and peppers no more.

487
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:30,028
I used to go down to Mulberry St. when
I was a kid. Sausage and peppers.

488
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:34,032
Now you go down there and there's
these guys with towels...

489
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,480
- You didn't like it?
- Fuck off.

490
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,776
So when do we get to roll with Tony?

491
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,153
- What?
- Are you tripping?

492
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,322
We gotta work our way up.

493
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,992
Must be deep, hanging out with him.

494
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,911
- Who?
- Mr. T.

495
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,580
You cap motherfuckers together?

496
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,416
Nah, too big. He doesn't get dirty.

497
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,089
We don't mind, we'll do anything.
Wet work, pick up his shirts.

498
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,635
Does Tony ever... talk about us?

499
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,429
No.

500
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,852
- You gonna drink or just sit there?
- Sit.

501
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:48,856
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
- You leave my gas burner on.

502
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:52,277
- I almost lit a cigarette and died!
- I apologized!

503
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,155
Why you can't use a lighter to
cook your shit is beyond me.

504
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,701
- When things were finally going good...
- Shut up!

505
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,371
Why? They'll still kiss ass.
They don't care if you're a junkie.

506
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,375
Sit down!

507
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,753
- I hate you, fucking pig. Get off me!
- Fucking whore!

508
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,631
- Fuck you.
- Go home! Get my dinner ready!

509
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,987
Don't yell. Don't scream.

510
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,949
All cutlery stays right where it is.

511
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,205
How's the bagels here?

512
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,252
You don't answer my calls,
I got no choice.

513
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:55,006
Walking away is a choice. Ruining my
practice, it's a choice.

514
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,383
You got your office back.
No harm done.

515
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:02,430
One of my patients committed suicide
because I wasn't available to her.

516
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,349
Know what that means to me?

517
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,685
She can't eat bagels.

518
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:12,106
She can't call in sick
because she's feeling blue.

519
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,401
She's gone. She's in the ground
because of you.

520
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,576
I don't deserve your help.

521
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,621
- And I hate your system.
- Fuck you!

522
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,544
But I got a family.

523
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,215
Believe it or not, they're
better off with me than without.

524
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,801
And I don't know what else to do.

525
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,429
- I drove off the road.
- You look fine.

526
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,014
The airbag.

527
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,895
- You told me if I was driving and...
- That...

528
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,106
...was a different time for us.

529
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,324
I don't blame you.

530
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,745
- Maybe you can recommend somebody.
- I would never...

531
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,207
...ask another colleague
to get involved in this.

532
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,627
How many more have to die
for your personal growth?

533
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,129
Look at me.

534
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,966
I swear to Jesus Christ,
nobody got killed 'cause of you.

535
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,639
Get out of my life!

536
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,265
Hey.

537
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,976
What are you doing home?

538
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,687
Nothing.

539
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,901
I thought it was AJ,
home from school.

540
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,360
Yeah.

541
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,086
- You all right?
- Yeah.

542
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,139
Want a little cold pasta?
I could microwave it.

543
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,643
Looks good.

544
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,938
- Want cheese, something to drink?
- Nah.

545
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,531
Sit down.
