1
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,153
Hey, no speeding.
This is a party zone!

2
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,866
Come on! We can do it!

3
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,497
Hey, Janet Jackson.

4
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,915
Hi, Mr. Soprano!

5
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,583
Where's Meadow?

6
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,961
I give up. In the house?

7
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,139
- Tony.
- Billy, thanks for calling.

8
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,267
As soon as I found out
it was your mom's place.

9
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,776
O.D. Friend says
Special K and ecstasy.

10
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,239
- You fucking kidding me?
- Your kid's all right.

11
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,116
She's a little drunk.

12
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,661
321, repeat,
you're breaking up.

13
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,917
529, are you in pursuit
of vehicle on 75 North?

14
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,561
- In your grandmother's house.
- It wasn't my fault.

15
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,022
If I had a quarter
every time I heard that...

16
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,150
...I'd have a private jet
on 24-hour standby.

17
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,611
Get in the car.

18
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,123
- In your grandmother's house.
- Now he's repeating himself.

19
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,377
Just lucky I knew that cop.
So he cut me a favor.

20
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,005
Let me guess, he owes you money?

21
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,726
- What did she do?
- Go upstairs.

22
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,105
- No, I want to see the fight.
- Get your little ass up those stairs!

23
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,816
Meadow!

24
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,070
- We can talk about it in the morning.
- Get down here!

25
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,321
Let her go to bed.

26
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,242
I want her to answer for herself!
She's drunk! Was she driving?

27
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,744
I could've taken ecstasy but I didn't!

28
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,579
Don't puke on the floor!

29
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,248
You still up? Go to bed!

30
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,377
- She's on ecstasy and you yell at me?
- Get up there!

31
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,217
What did she say for herself?

32
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,136
The usual shit. "Wasn't my fault."

33
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,139
There was designer drugs there, Tony.

34
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,975
So, what did you say?

35
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,354
I don't know. I yelled.
What the fuck else am I gonna do?

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,073
You sure you're gonna
be all right, Uncle Rich?

37
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,700
I want to walk.

38
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,577
See if I run into any
of the old crowd.

39
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,706
Thanks, doll.

40
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,263
Motherfucker.

41
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,481
There has to be consequences.

42
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,444
What kind of parents would we be
if we let her get away with this?

43
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,695
Typical?

44
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,114
Plenty of parents
still crack the whip.

45
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,533
Yeah, that's what they tell you.

46
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,786
I cannot wait until
she goes off to college.

47
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,664
Oh, right, so you can get
Empty Nest Syndrome...

48
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,542
...and go on Wellbutrin
like your sister.

49
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:41,173
As a parent today, you are over
a barrel no matter what you do.

50
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,759
You take the car, you're a chauffeur.

51
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,595
Ground her, you stay in
and be a prison guard.

52
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,431
Throw her out,
social services returns her...

53
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,767
...and we face a judge.
She's not 18 yet.

54
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,769
That's your solution?

55
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:59,107
All I'm saying, with the laws today,
you can't restrain your kid physically.

56
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,818
She could sue you for child abuse.

57
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,363
There has to be consequences.

58
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,655
And there will be.

59
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,532
I hear you, okay?

60
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,870
Let's not overplay our hand. If she
knows we're powerless, we're fucked.

61
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,582
Hey.

62
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,341
That guy wants to talk to you.

63
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,553
Jesus. Mother of Christ! Richie.

64
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,640
So when did you get out?
How come nobody told me?

65
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,561
That's funny. Paulie Walnuts
told me he ran into you this morning.

66
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,898
Honest to fucking God,
nobody said a word.

67
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,441
Just shut the fuck up.

68
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,617
You know, I did a lot of meditation
in the can on this.

69
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,868
On what?

70
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,664
You can't believe how crazy things...

71
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,208
- You ever meditate?
- Me? Meditate?

72
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,670
- Are you crazy?
- Not as crazy as I used to be.

73
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,589
But still crazy enough
to take an eye out.

74
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,716
What's going on here, Rich?

75
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,388
Ten years. And not even a pleasant
"Go fuck yourself" from you I get.

76
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,599
You know, I always asked
how you were doing.

77
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,477
Hold on there. You.

78
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,440
How could you let my dear friend
sit here with an empty cup?

79
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,358
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

80
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,110
Take it easy, kid.

81
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,946
Bring this gentleman
a veal-parm sandwich.

82
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,240
And hurry the fuck up about it.

83
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,202
The other two stores
doing as good as this?

84
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,288
Come on, you know, it's a grind.

85
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,002
That doesn't answer my question.

86
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,549
Rich, I know you're a made guy,
so I lose either way.

87
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,677
But I always respected you
and your brother, Jackie.

88
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,637
I'm no victim here.

89
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,141
I'm not some greaseball storeowner.
I'm sorry, Richie.

90
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,351
I will not be shaken down.

91
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,147
This sucking up to Tony Soprano
has done wonders for you.

92
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,401
I go away for a while. I come back,
you're a tough guy.

93
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,320
- Don't do this.
- Do what?

94
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,988
Take what's owed to me?

95
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,991
- What's owed to you?
- I put you in action, Beansie.

96
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,704
You got a bad memory, Beansie.

97
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,210
Veal parmigiana sandwich.

98
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,545
Fuck you.

99
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,592
I'll be back every Saturday, partner.

100
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,594
I don't fucking believe this.

101
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,848
I'm being shaken down, for what?
Tell me, what did I do?

102
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,350
This is not right.

103
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,727
I'm not gonna fucking lay down.

104
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,437
I'll step up.

105
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:58,662
Won't lay down, huh? You don't want
to lay dawn? You piece of shit!

106
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,292
All right, let's get her down here.

107
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,961
I guess.

108
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,506
- Where is the Bride of Frankenstein?
- She's still sleeping.

109
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,260
- Yeah, right. Go wake her up.
- I wake her up?

110
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,805
I want to get this shit
out of the way before I go out.

111
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:21,184
- You guys are making too much of this.
- I don't think we're making enough.

112
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,686
She was drunk.

113
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,272
Her choice. There's a Zuni saying:

114
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,149
"For every 20 wrongs
a child does, ignore 19."

115
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,487
There's an old Italian saying:
"You fuck up once, you lose two teeth."

116
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,616
That's what all this is about.
Ego and control.

117
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,328
- I beg your pardon?
- No, don't try to make sense with her.

118
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,498
No, I want to understand this.
Go ahead, tell me.

119
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,626
You want to hold on to control
over a young woman...

120
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,087
...whose entire
biological determinism...

121
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,923
...is to achieve independent
thought and behavior.

122
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,134
She's exercised her independence...

123
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,138
...but you want to penalize her
because you don't like her choices.

124
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,973
Go get a fucking permanent.

125
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,267
I'm trying to watch TV!

126
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,438
Well.

127
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,485
Good morning.
I'm sorry, is it afternoon?

128
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,988
- Mom, please.
- Please what?

129
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,200
- You'd better have some answers.
- Yeah. That's right!

130
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,957
- Fine. You're punished.
- For what? I didn't do anything!

131
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,292
You did nothing?

132
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,295
- It wasn't my fault!
- It's never your fault, Meadow.

133
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,340
It was gonna be me,
Hunter and the Macaluso twins.

134
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,760
Then Steve shows up with Adam
and people from Boonton!

135
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,472
So Steve's just trying doorknobs
till he hits the jackpot?

136
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,600
- No, Hunter tells him.
- Now with the Hunter.

137
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,479
And she's at home, blaming it on you.
It's an old game.

138
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,608
You try studying day and night
to get into college.

139
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,028
- We work hard. We deserved a night!
- Take it easy.

140
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,905
Take it easy.

141
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,618
I'm sorry you're under a lot of
pressure. It's still no excuse.

142
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,667
- So who was this ecstasy guy?
- I just told you. Adam.

143
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,169
I don't know him.
He came with Steve.

144
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,381
The Steve I know?
The school kid you're always with?

145
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,051
He's a flake. Why do you think
I stopped hanging with him?

146
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,470
That's news to me you don't
hang out with Steve.

147
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,724
It's painful to talk about, okay?

148
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,726
You're gonna get punished.

149
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:32,148
Look, you guys,
I know what I did was not okay.

150
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:37,570
I've been thinking about it a lot and
really not feeling good about myself.

151
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,615
You should take away my Discover card.

152
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,368
- You better believe it!
- That's right!

153
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,577
For two weeks.

154
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,121
Three!

155
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,756
How do I buy gas?

156
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,216
Your allowance.

157
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,136
I spent my allowance.
And I already owe Mom.

158
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,638
The Pashmina.

159
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,975
We can wait on that.

160
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,437
You get 10 dollars a week. Cash.

161
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,313
No more.

162
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,942
Till you get your card back.
For gas!

163
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,037
Come here.

164
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,709
Look at you.
You look great. You're sinew.

165
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,588
You sack of shit. If you lost that
baby fat, you'd disappoint me.

166
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,256
Hey, fuck you.

167
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,842
You been laid yet?

168
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,678
God, what's wrong? I'm trying.

169
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,764
Hey, I said 4:00.

170
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,183
I leave before
the stock market closes...

171
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,810
...you yell for not watching
the phone guys.

172
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,312
Meet Richie Aprile.

173
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,399
Jesus Christ, how you doing?

174
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,611
Your brother, Jackie,
was like a fucking god.

175
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,281
A great leader.
And I heard a lot about you.

176
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,617
Yeah, well, I heard a lot about you.

177
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,202
That's why I'm here.

178
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,205
What do you mean?

179
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:14,542
Out of respect for our friend here,
I'm gonna talk nice.

180
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,504
I ever hear you raise your hands
to my niece again...

181
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,964
...next time you won't see my face.

182
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,633
You understand?

183
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,927
Who told you I put my hand on her?

184
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,054
Is this kid getting jerky with me?

185
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,225
Look, kid, I shouldn't
have to explain myself.

186
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,185
I'm from the old school.

187
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,355
You want to raise your hands,
give her your last name.

188
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,148
Then it's not my business.

189
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,820
Until then, keep your hands
in your pockets.

190
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,655
We understand each other?

191
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,246
Now get out of here.

192
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,665
I want to talk to Tony.

193
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,625
Go ahead.

194
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,220
He's a good kid.

195
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,223
Capable.

196
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,228
Look, Ton, this is the thing.

197
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,522
I want to get my shy business back.

198
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,358
I keep getting calls
from Jackie's customers...

199
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,195
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'll talk to you later, Richie.

200
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,031
What just happened?

201
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,576
No more business talk
with him directly.

202
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,411
You fucking with me?

203
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,413
You can talk to him.

204
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,039
But not now.

205
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,542
And never here.

206
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,594
Can you believe we drank
a whole bottle of wine?

207
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,429
Thank God!

208
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,140
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

209
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,434
- We're out of here.
- Okay.

210
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,353
Richie broke a chair over his head.

211
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,063
You shitting me?

212
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,233
Hit him with a coffeepot too.
Broke his cheekbone.

213
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,321
Prick. I talked to him yesterday.
He's all sweetness and lights.

214
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,448
Already this shit's getting old.

215
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,410
Yo, bright eyes.

216
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,164
- Where you going?
- This isn't the Bing, huh?

217
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,498
Fuck did I say?

218
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,667
Hey, how have you been?

219
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,630
Can't complain.

220
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,593
- You look good.
- Where did your friends go?

221
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,180
- Tell them to come back, join us.
- No, they're leaving.

222
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,641
First time here. Excellent veal.

223
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,101
We making small talk now?

224
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,104
Nice to see you.

225
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,773
Yeah, you too.

226
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,446
- Toodle-oo.
- Bye-bye.

227
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,740
Not a bad ass.

228
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,494
She had nice pipe-fitter lips.
No disrespect.

229
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,039
Hey, what do I give a fuck?
I hardly know her.

230
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,793
You mean, you would take
the lips over the tits?

231
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,213
Trust me, my boy.
There's two things I'm good at:

232
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,341
It's pulling dents
and spotting good blowjobs.

233
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,220
And that sweetie had
world-class blowjob lips.

234
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,139
Am I right, skipper? Good or no?

235
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,685
What the fuck do I know?
It was a long time ago.

236
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,481
All right, she was good. All right?

237
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,191
Good?

238
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,567
Or great?

239
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,407
Why you busting my balls?
It was a long time ago.

240
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,451
Hey, I remember
every blowjob I ever got.

241
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,537
You remember your first blowjob?

242
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,247
Yeah, of course.

243
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,541
How long did it take
for the guy to come?

244
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,752
I said, "You remember
your first blowjob?"

245
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,715
"Yeah." "How long did it take
for the guy to come?"

246
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,510
"Toodle-fucking-oo"?

247
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,762
What the fuck was that?

248
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,557
I couldn't sleep
from the embarrassment.

249
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,102
What was so wrong?
It's an accepted form of goodbye.

250
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,938
That's not the way
I talk with patients.

251
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,482
It wasn't me. It was someone else.

252
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,900
It was Jennifer.

253
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:13,364
For whatever reason, at that moment,
you felt safer showing him Jennifer.

254
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:17,285
What did you see at that table
that made you want to hide "Doctor"?

255
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,870
Who were you hiding from?

256
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,165
I saw a patient that
I never wanted to see again.

257
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,209
That's who I was hiding from.
A patient.

258
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,336
When you say "see"...

259
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,215
...do you mean professionally
or just plain "see"?

260
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,385
- What's the difference?
- There's a big difference.

261
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,972
If it was just a matter
of just plain old "see"...

262
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,892
...the cordial doctor
would've said, "Good night."

263
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,313
But, because he's someone you didn't
want to see professionally...

264
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,275
...you abandoned the doctor façade
and adopted the Jennifer posture.

265
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,402
Hence, "Toodle-oo."

266
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,363
You're almost there,
Elliot, but not quite.

267
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,201
Young girls are not accountable
for their behavior.

268
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,288
I think "Toodle-oo" was the action
of a ditsy young girl.

269
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,877
And I regressed into the girl thing
to escape responsibility...

270
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,880
...for abandoning a patient.

271
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,840
He asked me for help.

272
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,431
Look, I need you as a colleague
to tell me that I did the right thing.

273
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,268
You gotta ask yourself
why you became a psychiatrist.

274
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,772
If it was to help people stop
smoking or biting nails...

275
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,691
...then so be it.
There's nothing wrong with that.

276
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,904
Another patient committed suicide
because I was treating this man.

277
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,198
Because I had to go on the lam.

278
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,284
Treating patients from a motel room
isn't optimum...

279
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,079
...but you were there for her,
in phone contact.

280
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,082
It would have been the same
if you'd been on vacation.

281
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,711
Did you say "lam"?

282
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,134
And lifting up into Cobra.

283
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:05,101
And now rising up
into Downward Facing Dog.

284
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,275
Coming back down into Cobra.

285
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,785
And relaxing into Child's Pose.

286
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,667
Richie.

287
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,505
Janice. You know,
I thought that was you.

288
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,840
"Parvati."

289
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,011
I changed my name to Parvati in '78.

290
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,513
I thought you lived in California now.

291
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,766
Seattle, actually, last couple years.

292
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,771
- So, how long you been?
- Out of jail?

293
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,609
One week. That's where
I picked up this yoga shit.

294
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,028
It's working. You seem very supple.

295
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,530
I'm doing a lot of stretching.

296
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,826
- So you back now?
- My mom's at St. Erasmus. A stroke.

297
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,913
Sorry to hear that.
Tony didn't say anything about it.

298
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,337
- Guess we're all getting a little old.
- Only if that's our choice.

299
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,228
Drag me all the way out here...

300
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,106
I walk through the food court,
this kid spills fried rice on me.

301
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,902
Take it easy.
Keep your voice down. Let's talk.

302
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,863
Yeah, let's. How would you feel?

303
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:45,409
Your crew evaporates, then you walk
away from me like I got a disease.

304
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,579
I don't talk business.
Don't take it personal.

305
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,456
I'm a government target.

306
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,542
Why do you think we're meeting
in a fucking mall?

307
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,713
It feels disrespectful.
You know, that's all I'm saying.

308
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,050
I'm the guy who saved you
from the hit parade.

309
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,470
When? When did you ever
step in for me?

310
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,721
You forget?

311
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,058
You and my brother stuck up
Feech LaManna's card game?

312
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,685
Feech was a made man.

313
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:16,315
If it wasn't for me, you would've got
a vicious beating, to say the least.

314
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,942
You know I love you.

315
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,153
You're like my big brother.
You'll be taken care of.

316
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,365
What was yours before you left
will be yours again.

317
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,617
You just gotta give us some time.

318
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:30,288
Jeez, Anthony, you'd do that for me?

319
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,623
Hey, fuck you.

320
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,461
What's mine is not yours to give me.

321
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:42,133
- Hey, prick, you reached out to me.
- I said what I wanted to say.

322
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,180
Well, we got a problem, kid?

323
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,975
I'm trying to get you to slow down.

324
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:55,313
Things are different now.
You gotta be extra, extra careful.

325
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,773
When do you know me not to be careful?

326
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,025
When?

327
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,322
You been out of the can 10 minutes,
you shake down Beansie for a piece.

328
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,034
Do me a favor, back off.
He's a good earner.

329
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,077
Yeah, for you.

330
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,496
That's none of your fucking cazzi.

331
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,000
Those joints are a cash business.
They come in handy.

332
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,003
- He's a sneaky cocksucker.
- Whatever, back off.

333
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,381
You taking the side
of a civilian over me?

334
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,009
Christ, I'm asking you
to do me a favor.

335
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,429
Do it if you want to.
If you don't, go fuck yourself.

336
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,140
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

337
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,851
How's your sister?

338
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,064
- There's no need for that talk.
- What?

339
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,899
My sister.

340
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,444
Janice. How's she doing?

341
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,159
Oh, I thought you were baiting me.
You know...

342
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,286
"How's your sister?"
"Fuck your mother."

343
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,204
No.

344
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,651
See what she did?

345
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,987
- Who?
- Meadow.

346
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,655
That house is fucked!

347
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,034
- Thought you didn't swear.
- What are you talking about?

348
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,955
I'm outraged.
No, I am beyond outraged.

349
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,084
Talk about disgrace? Disrespect for
other people's property?

350
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,462
It's like a freaking
shooting gallery.

351
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,174
It smells of urine, there's puke
all over the hardwood floors...

352
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,760
- Sounds like your place in Venice.
- She's been punished.

353
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,471
Three weeks without a card.

354
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,098
Oh, Madonna,
that's some heavy shit there!

355
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,559
- Janice...
- If that was my child...

356
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,979
You got a lot of fucking balls,
you know that?

357
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,441
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Let's clear the air here.

358
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,569
You're a Vishnu-come-lately,
playing concerned.

359
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,446
Who the fuck are you kidding?

360
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,907
You're here to pick
the frigging bones.

361
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,994
There's a lot I could say right now
that I am not gonna say.

362
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,622
A lot of balls.

363
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,876
Temper tantrums.

364
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,796
He hasn't changed one iota
since we lived in Newark. Not one!

365
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:12,426
You're passing judgment on him, Janice.
On us as parents.

366
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,680
How we discipline our children
is none of anybody's business.

367
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,226
You let that girl walk all over you,
you'll regret it.

368
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,896
Mother of God, Janice!
Are all of you Sopranos the same?

369
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,566
I ask you nicely to stay out of it,
you pretend not to hear.

370
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,276
Maybe you'll hear this.

371
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,197
Mind your fucking business. Keep your
mouth shut when it comes to my kids!

372
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,031
Alright?!

373
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,662
Maybe I've stayed here too long.

374
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:54,134
The fall in the shower didn't affect
your pre-existing heart condition.

375
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,805
- But you already knew that.
- It never hurts to be sure.

376
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,890
Fucking bum hip.

377
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,602
What next does the Man Upstairs
have in store for me?

378
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,521
You're lucky it was a sprain.

379
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,150
The thing is, doc, I've been feeling
these, like, little fibrillations.

380
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,862
Psychosomatic.
You got out of jail on a medical.

381
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:18,450
It's the mind-body connection.
Your body's just pitching in to help.

382
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,204
Hey!

383
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,498
There's my boy!

384
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,835
I was afraid you didn't
get the message.

385
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,428
Put a shirt on,
I'm getting a chubby.

386
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,014
Doc, this is one of my dearest friends.

387
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,767
Richie, this is the best heart man
in the world, Doug Schreck.

388
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,730
Mr. Soprano oversold me.
I'm only the best in the Western world.

389
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,732
Fucking ball-breaker.

390
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,484
Doc, do me a favor?

391
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,111
Me and Richie...

392
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,988
Yeah, no problem.

393
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:04,038
He's good. Lets me use his doctor-
patient privilege to meet people here.

394
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,751
Fucking house arrest.

395
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:15,341
Federal marshals so far up my ass,
I can taste Brylcreem.

396
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,887
Jesus, you look good.
How you feeling?

397
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,807
Better than some,
not as bad as others.

398
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:28,562
I gotta meet Tony at a mall, you here.
What the fuck is happening?

399
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,066
Like the man said,
"May you live in interesting times."

400
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,109
You met with Tony?

401
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,237
It's more like a fucking audience
with the pope.

402
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,990
What are you gonna do?

403
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,038
Whatever you tell me.

404
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,422
You and your brother
were always good boys.

405
00:27:56,132 --> 00:28:00,427
You tell me this is the way it is,
then so be it.

406
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,721
You tell me otherwise...

407
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,641
...I'm yours, Junior.

408
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,352
Whatever, whoever.

409
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,104
You just say it.

410
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,443
Once again, a big welcome home
to our guest of honor.

411
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,363
Richie was surprised by
the changes in 10 years.

412
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,365
New Jersey has a hockey team.

413
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,785
It's interesting,
Meadowlands is the only NHL arena...

414
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,080
...where the penalty box
is maximum-security.

415
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,333
Maximum-security penalty box.

416
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,584
Help me.

417
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,044
What the fuck?

418
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,171
I was talking to Paulie Walnuts...

419
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,299
...who thought that Richie
had been in Bosnia...

420
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,052
...where there's also
a large Muslim population.

421
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,138
- That's it. Out of here.
- Enough.

422
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,893
And now for all you youngsters with
visions of tit-fucking in your head...

423
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,312
...here are the Bing girls!
Come on!

424
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,330
Hey.

425
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,957
Welcome home.

426
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,711
Wait till you open it. It's all ones.

427
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,339
I'm a grandfather now, Rich.
Imagine that?

428
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,966
Please, no pictures.

429
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,470
Exploiting medical curiosities
is against the law.

430
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,972
That why they canceled
your mom's audition?

431
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,223
What did you say?

432
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,350
- It's a homecoming.
- Cocksucker.

433
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,394
Take a walk.

434
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,739
Welcome home, Rich.

435
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,949
- Is Beansie here?
- Haven't seen him.

436
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,453
Richie, how's your balls?

437
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,163
They're hanging.

438
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,082
Ready and waiting.

439
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,375
What?

440
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,211
Go with Silvio.

441
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,670
- Who?
- Go!

442
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,297
I'll hold this.

443
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,467
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.

444
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,969
This guy.

445
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,221
Trust me!

446
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,977
He's got a real
fucking attitude problem.

447
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,521
- Careful.
- Come on.

448
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,150
He just did 10 fucking years.
He has a right to be a bit fucked up.

449
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,193
No.

450
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,112
Richie will be all right.

451
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,176
Yeah, Yeah.

452
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,597
I see you like the dark.

453
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,641
Yeah, something like that.

454
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,443
Silvio says we can't take it.

455
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,072
Whose joint did you just cop,
mine or his?

456
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,825
- Did we do something wrong?
- You were fine.

457
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,451
Get out of here.

458
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,808
Hey, buddy!
What the fuck are you doing?

459
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,936
What'd you think Tony Soprano
was gonna do for you?

460
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,938
You got a raging hard-on for me.

461
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,149
- I don't know what for!
- You don't?

462
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,692
- Come here!
- No.

463
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,069
Come here! Come here!

464
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,405
How come you weren't at the party?

465
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,324
I moved a lot of H for you...

466
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,409
...and you made the lion's share.

467
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,581
You're just bitter because I invested
my money smart and you didn't.

468
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,751
I spent mine on lawyers,
you slippery fuck!

469
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,212
You want to talk like a tough guy?
Tough guy, here!

470
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,298
Hey, come on. Please, no guns.

471
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,468
What happened to
"I'm no greaseball storeowner"?

472
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,346
Tell me again how
you won't lay down, huh?

473
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,730
Asshole!

474
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,740
Janice?

475
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,579
- I'm sorry, is the music too loud?
- Oh, no, it's fine.

476
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:44,294
I just wanted to apologize.
You know, about earlier.

477
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,839
No, I should be apologizing to you.

478
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,967
I was out of line.

479
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,177
You're right.

480
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,514
I never raised a child.

481
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,935
I was robbed of that when Eugene
took him back to Montreal.

482
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,229
I'm petitioning
the State Department...

483
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,941
...but they have me on their
enemy radicals list, so...

484
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,486
When was the last time you saw Harpo?

485
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,490
He changed his name to Hal.

486
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,576
I'm sorry, Carm,
can we not talk about him?

487
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,163
Look, I just want you to know
that I was way out of line.

488
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,292
Well, I'm sorry too.
Really, I just feel terrible.

489
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,253
You know, you're family.

490
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,380
And family means a lot.

491
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,341
I just don't feel right
about you leaving here.

492
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,094
I don't know.

493
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,014
I don't think Tony wants me here.

494
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:41,727
Where will you go? The house is in no
condition to move into, especially now.

495
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,270
I'll be all right.

496
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,898
No, I'm sorry.
I really can't let you leave.

497
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,109
Really, I want you to stay.

498
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,611
Okay.

499
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,866
- Okay.
- All right.

500
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,076
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

501
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,538
Oh, maybe just a little bit.
The music.

502
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,290
Oh, all right.

503
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,769
Richie, no! Richie, no!

504
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,272
Jesus!

505
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,437
- Do I put the chocolate in now?
- Put it in, I'll pour the milk.

506
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,816
What did your parents
say about Saturday?

507
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,861
The usual. Nothing.
They're afraid I'll go bulimic again.

508
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,696
Mine just "blah, blah, blah."

509
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,990
Purge and they won't say anything.

510
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,828
When will they realize we're adults,
responsible for ourselves?

511
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,288
So we had a party
at your grandmother's.

512
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,375
Would they prefer we go to Limelight?
Hello!

513
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,962
It's because they have no life.
They focus on bullshit.

514
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,005
So, what did yours do?

515
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,716
They took my Discover card
for three weeks.

516
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,302
- That's nothing.
- I know, it was my idea.

517
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,638
- Dicks.
- So hypocritical too.

518
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,432
When you think how my dad
makes a living.

519
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,646
Oh, jeez! What is this?

520
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,025
- Why don't you ring for the nurse?
- Never you mind!

521
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,944
That's their job.

522
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,487
I don't need them.

523
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,116
My daughter came
all the way from Seattle.

524
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,329
Oh, Jesus!

525
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,215
Hello?

526
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,926
- She rang for you.
- I did not.

527
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,179
Mrs. Soprano.

528
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,182
- Who are you?
- Richie.

529
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,226
Richie Aprile.

530
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,146
But I thought you were dead.

531
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,774
No, hon, that was my brother, Jackie.

532
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,611
Oh, I'm sorry.

533
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,363
How did he die, the poor baby?

534
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,200
He had cancer.

535
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,492
Me too.

536
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,412
Shut that curtain, will ya?

537
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:54,294
You know, I was in a private room.

538
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,965
My Johnny would roll over
in his grave if he saw this.

539
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:04,387
Oh, they wheel people in and out,
in and out. Oh, go on!

540
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:09,059
So isn't Parvati supposed to be here?

541
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,810
I don't know who that is.

542
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,146
Your daughter, Parvati. Janice.

543
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,068
Oh, yeah, please.
Don't start with that name business.

544
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,779
She did it to shame me.

545
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,907
You'll have to have your
tea without lemon.

546
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,328
Richie.

547
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,627
You see the beautiful flowers
he brought me?

548
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:39,172
Yeah, see? Your father
has friends with class.

549
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,757
Not like some people.

550
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,135
Ma, he's not one of Dad's friends.
He's my friend.

551
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,471
You mean, he's your boyfriend?

552
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,182
Remember? You used to yell at me...

553
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,352
...for beeping my horn
when I came to pick up Janice.

554
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,271
Pimps beep!

555
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,277
You know, someday somebody's gonna
wash out your mouth with soap, hon.

556
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,779
Oh, yeah, who? You?

557
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,951
Oh, I wish the Lord would take me.

558
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,703
Ohh, Ma, Statazeet.

559
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,872
- The man's come to visit you.
- Take it easy!

560
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,292
Is that how you talk to your mother?

561
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,420
You lay the same trip
on everybody who comes.

562
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,006
- Don't you have any shame?
- Shame?

563
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,217
Oh, I got plenty of shame.

564
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,844
Believe me.

565
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,805
You don't want to hear
what I'm ashamed of.

566
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,308
Go ahead, Ma. Shoot your best shot.

567
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,310
Never you mind.

568
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,105
Just remember what
we talked about last week.

569
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,193
Ma, I'm gonna go to
the cafeteria for some coffee.

570
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,988
- Are you coming back?
- Yes.

571
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,533
I bet you're very good to your mother.

572
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,419
She'll be better when I get her home.

573
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,838
Does that mean you're sticking around?

574
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:05,884
- If I don't, who'll take care of her?
- What about Tony?

575
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,263
Long story.
You haven't heard what happened?

576
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,766
Tony blames everyone else...

577
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,226
...for anything bad in life,
including Ma.

578
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,687
Tony? No.

579
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,857
Trust me. Nothing's ever his fault.

580
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,905
So, what's with the flowers,
Mr. Candy Stripe?

581
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,783
I couldn't visit her empty-handed.

582
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,534
Oh.

583
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,872
- You weren't at yoga.
- I'm very busy with my mother.

584
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,332
Too busy for dinner?

585
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,667
We weren't good together
20 years ago.

586
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,753
Why do you think
it's any different now?

587
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,881
Let's get to the point.

588
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,469
After getting to where I am, it'd be
ridiculous to decompensate now.

589
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,847
I am so not that person anymore.

590
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,351
It works both ways.

591
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:01,314
You know, I don't think I'd be
interested in the same Jan I knew.

592
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:06,194
- So, what, you've grown?
- Well, you tell me.

593
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,155
Did you ever think you'd
see Richie Aprile doing...

594
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,033
...Downward Facing Dog?

595
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,252
- Can she put more gook shit in here?
- It's not that much.

596
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,963
Soy milk, tofu, I hate all that shit!

597
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,214
Yeah, me too.

598
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,550
Shut up, you said you liked soy milk.

599
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,553
I lied. She was taking me
to the video store.

600
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,680
I'm happy Aunt Parvati's staying.

601
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,932
The one who thinks you're spoiled?

602
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,436
It wasn't my fault.
How many fucking times I gotta say it?

603
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,937
- Hey!
- Whoa!

604
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,239
Don't look like you're gonna cry.
You made your bed.

605
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,495
I need $15.

606
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,955
Excuse me?

607
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:03,543
A Cole Porter CD. It's for Madrigals.
We're doing three of his songs.

608
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,628
You took my card, remember?

609
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,638
Here.

610
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,519
What's your problem?

611
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,189
Nothing.

612
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,983
Thank you, by the way!

613
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,364
Janice should be home by now.

614
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,409
My sister was almost out
and you fall for her con?

615
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,578
She can't afford a motel.

616
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,706
How about she goes back
to where she was for 20 years...

617
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,750
...while I took care of our mother?

618
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,711
I thought we couldn't
mention Grandma in this house.

619
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,048
Fine. I'm not gonna
argue with you, Tony.

620
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,676
You tell her to leave.
I won't. It's not Christian.

621
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,513
See? This shit works out.
She's a Buddhist.

622
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,181
Hello!

623
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,058
We're in here, Par.

624
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,106
- Isn't it cruel to cut flowers?
- Richie gave them to Ma.

625
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,484
- They're beautiful.
- Aren't they?

626
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,110
Richie?

627
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,445
Richie Aprile?

628
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,448
He went to visit her.
You know he always loved Ma.

629
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,538
All right, I gotta go.

630
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,834
You better water them.
I think I hear them crying.

631
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,635
Aw, Jesus Christ!

632
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,346
Peter, you're scaring your mother.

633
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,848
Leave me the fuck alone.

634
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,394
Hey, is that a way to talk?

635
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,104
Tony?

636
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,607
Can you pick up the BBC
on that thing, or what?

637
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,402
- No jokes please, Tony.
- Only family.

638
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,195
Let him stay.

639
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,538
How you doing, pal?

640
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,708
You said he wasn't
gonna bother me, Tony.

641
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,627
Jesus.

642
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,589
They said I might not walk.

643
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,969
Come on, Mom. Let's go
downstairs for a little while.

644
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,851
You gonna let that animal
get away with this?

645
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,733
I'll let you talk to your "friend."

646
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,122
Don't listen to these fucking doctors.

647
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,917
When it comes to spinal injuries,
it's all a mystery to them.

648
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,880
Paulie's cousin got run over
by a forklift. Broke his back.

649
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,008
The guy's dancing
in tango competitions.

650
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,222
All right, here.

651
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,891
Here.

652
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,644
I can't do it.

653
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,688
Ah, ah...

654
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,986
Come on.

655
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,617
Thanks.

656
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,911
Thanks, Tony.

657
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,416
I might not be able to wipe
my own ass, you know that?

658
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,253
Your nose is as far
as I'm willing to go.

659
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,684
Listen...

660
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,978
...Beans.

661
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,023
You 1000% sure it was
Richie Aprile driving?

662
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,025
A thousand percent? No.

663
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,027
A fucking million percent.

664
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,364
And let me tell you something.

665
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,325
He's lucky I ain't no rat fuck.

666
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,162
Because the law knows
that was no random hit-and-run.

667
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,873
Don't start talking foolish.

668
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,750
We're old school, right?

669
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,378
We wash our own dirty laundry.

670
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,217
Hey, am I right, Beans?

671
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,596
Yeah, yeah. Old school.

672
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,227
Okay, good.

673
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:44,235
So you here to see your ma?
I hear she's upstairs.

674
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,654
No, I came here to see you, you prick.

675
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,076
That's okay.

676
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,871
Go do what you gotta do.

677
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:07,174
- I told you to back off Beansie.
- I did. Then I put it in drive.

678
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,760
This is funny?
He might never walk again.

679
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,096
Did you know that? And for what?

680
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,806
He didn't duke you enough?

681
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,058
He didn't visit you in the can?

682
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,644
When did you visit anybody in the can?

683
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:22,523
When's the last time you gave a fuck
about anybody but yourself?

684
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,152
You remember one thing,
and listen good.

685
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:30,615
You want to talk this old school shit?
Here's a rule you might remember:

686
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,327
I'm the motherfucking fucking one
who calls the shots.

687
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:38,748
You pay me the respect I gave your
brother or we're gonna have a problem.

688
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,250
A bad one.

689
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,837
Now get the fuck out of here.

690
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,757
All right, Tony.

691
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,468
Yeah. All right.

692
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,605
- Hey.
- How you doing?

693
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,899
I'll open it, you change the locks.

694
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,525
Okay.
