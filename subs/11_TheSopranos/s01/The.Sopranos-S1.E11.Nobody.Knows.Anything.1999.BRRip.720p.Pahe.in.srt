1
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,323
Oh, debbie,
you've got magic fingers.

2
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:51,326
Oh, i bet you give
a great hand job.

3
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:54,830
Yeah, she does.
Hey, there's my baby.

4
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,333
Debbie, you gotta put her
on the "a" list, really.

5
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,836
She rides better
than willie shoemaker.

6
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:02,838
Did she go to the whip?
He is so crazy.

7
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:05,841
Only in the home stretch.

8
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:09,845
Ah, another
satisfied customer.

9
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:12,848
I think he's having
a heart attack!

10
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,102
Don't move.

11
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:20,989
Go see if dr. Mop- n- glo
is still here.

12
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,492
What do you mean,
dr. Mop- n- glo?

13
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:25,494
Who?
Don't worry.
He's a real doctor.

14
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:27,246
A dermatologist.

15
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,114
Excuse me.
What's the matter?

16
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:32,618
Dr. Edelstein, looks like
he's having a heart attack.

17
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:36,371
I don't need no doctor.
It's just my back.

18
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:39,374
Nice and slow.
Oh, god.

19
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:44,379
Grab the rail.
Grab the rail.
That's right.

20
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,882
Go easy.
Go easy, now.
That's it.

21
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:50,385
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.
Oh, mama.

22
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:52,387
That's it.
That's it.

23
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:56,892
Come on. That's it.
Hold the rail.

24
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:59,645
I got it.
Hold the rail.

25
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:06,034
Go slow.
That's it.
That's it.

26
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:20,048
Fuck this.
What, your fuckin' back
still botherin' you?

27
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:22,050
Yeah!

28
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:28,173
F. B. I.!
Nobody move!
You believe this shit?

29
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:32,928
Come on. It's
a friendly card game.
Relax, jimmy.

30
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:36,431
If i wanted to bust up
card games, i'd have
a donut in my mouth.

31
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,594
Hey! Hey!
Get him!

32
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:07,963
You! You!
-

33
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:16,855
oh, my goodness!
Do you know what this is?
It's a fucking gun!

34
00:04:29,117 --> 00:04:31,620
Fuckin' jimmy's
still in jail.

35
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,624
- It don't mean shit.
- I don't like it.
This is how it starts.

36
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:37,626
I think it was
a potluck raid.

37
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:40,629
You know, make it look like
they're earnin' their pay.
I agree.

38
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,631
Then why the fuck
would pussy run?

39
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:46,134
The guy's out of breath
liftin' his dick up
to take a leak.

40
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:52,007
So, puss, your ears
must be ringin'.

41
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:54,009
Come on, run.

42
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:57,512
Ha, ha. You guys
are a fuckin' riot.

43
00:04:57,512 --> 00:05:01,516
We were just gonna draw straws
to see who's goin' down there
and bail you out.

44
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:04,019
My wife did.
I nearly strangled her
on the ride home.

45
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,655
My head's hurtin',
i got angina,

46
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,658
and on top of all that,
i threw my goddamn
back out again.

47
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:12,911
Maybe it was
that ten- yard dash.

48
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,663
We don't run.
It's embarrassing.

49
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,665
Please. They robbed me,
those federal pricks.

50
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:19,668
- What do you mean?
- They grabbed four dimes
from me.

51
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:23,422
You shouldn't carry
that type of cash.

52
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:26,425
Never mind.
I need a drink.

53
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:32,798
Oh, jesus!

54
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:48,196
This better be good.
I was takin' my kid fishing.

55
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:51,199
Ah, jesus. What,
no "how you been?
How's it doin', vin"?

56
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,702
I thought we understood
each other, right?

57
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:57,706
I don't give two shits
about you, your family or
whether you take it up the ass.

58
00:05:57,706 --> 00:06:00,709
Now, what's so important
you take me away from my boat?

59
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:02,711
Hey, fuck face,
where you goin'?

60
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:06,214
Why do you gotta talk to me
like this? I do a lot
of risky shit for you.

61
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:09,084
You're not doin'
charity work, remember?

62
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:13,588
All right. I'm sorry.

63
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:17,843
Hey, vin, how ya doin'?
What do you got for me?

64
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:23,982
- Bompensiero.
- Pussy?

65
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:27,986
- What about him?
- He's wired for sound.

66
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:30,105
What?
I got it
from a good source.

67
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:33,608
I thought you should know.
All right?

68
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:37,112
I'm sorry.
I know you like him.
Like him?

69
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:42,117
I fuckin'lovehim.
Now, who's your source?

70
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:45,120
He's on the force.
He's on the task force,
all right?

71
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,623
Look, he's not lyin' to me.
He was in my wedding.

72
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:51,510
I wanna see the report.
I can't get my hands--

73
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,012
i wanna see
the fuckin' 3- 0- 2!
All right.

74
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,515
All right.
I'll see what i can do.

75
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,639
It doesn't make any sense.

76
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,144
Yeah, it does, ton,
if you take the blinders off.

77
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:13,782
I'm in robbery/homicide. I was
told he was movin' a lot of "h"
to pay for his kid's college.

78
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:16,651
Why would i know
something like that?

79
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:19,654
And last spring,
with that big heroin bust,
where was he?

80
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:23,041
He told you
he was in las vegas,
am i right?

81
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,544
Again, i'm sorry,
but, yeah,
that's where he was.

82
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:29,548
He was in las vegas.
He was in a federal building,
cutting a deal.

83
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:34,052
And why did he walk so easy
from that thing the other day?

84
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:36,054
"Known wise guy
resisted arrest."

85
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:40,559
Who walks away
from a thing like that
with low- ball bail?

86
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,561
Why? Why would he do it?
Why?

87
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:46,932
Because he's facin' a possible
sentence of "from now on."
Mandatory, that's why.

88
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:50,569
Come on. I know a lot of guys
who can't do that kind of time.

89
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,071
Who is this guy, pussy, huh?
Who is he?

90
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:56,074
He's a man who loves his family
above all else.

91
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:59,578
Well, guess what?
That's their favorite target.

92
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:09,955
No--

93
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,457
okay. That's fine.

94
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,460
I just said it's fine.

95
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:25,971
Was that my mother?
She's not coming.

96
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,974
You say it like you
expected different.
I hoped.

97
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:32,477
Every year we have this
open house, and every year
she pulls the same shit.

98
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:36,481
It's what they call
"negative attention gettin'."
Maybe i should call her back.

99
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,984
That's just what
she wants you to do.
Come here.

100
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:44,489
You're bein' too nice.
Forget about her.
She'll be fine.

101
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:48,493
Will you do me a favor?
Can you get the guys to help you
move the piano out of the way?

102
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,496
They're comin' to get it
tomorrow because
some people don't play.

103
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:55,000
- I will.
- When? It's been gathering
dust here for three months.

104
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,003
Oh, puss, come here.

105
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,506
Excuse me.

106
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,395
- What do you need?
- We're gonna move this.

107
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,514
I wanna slide this
out of the way.

108
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,022
I can't.

109
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:21,026
What do you mean, you can't?
The fuckin' thing's on wheels.
My back, tony.

110
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:26,031
I'm thinkin' about goin' home,
sittin' in the tub.
You all right?

111
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:30,035
Yeah, it's just my back.
They got me on
these elephant pills.

112
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,542
All right.
Go easy on'em.

113
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,045
Go ahead, sit down.
Take it easy.

114
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:49,304
Listen, i want you
to keep your eye on pussy.

115
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:51,806
There's somethin'
wrong with him.
He's not himself.

116
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:53,808
You're tellin' me?

117
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:56,311
You know, he hasn't even
done his rounds in a week.

118
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:59,314
He's startin' to look
like an easy mark.
I told him,

119
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:03,318
"if someone owes you money,
even if you gotta crawl,
you get it."

120
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:07,822
I even told him to give me his
list on who owes what, and i'll
collect the fuckin' thing.

121
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:11,326
What'd he say?
He just nodded
like a fuckin' retard.

122
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:13,328
Yeah, it's those
fuckin' percs.

123
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:15,330
He's throwin' them
in his mouth
like they're m&ms.

124
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,333
And there isn't even anything
wrong with his back.

125
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,835
What do you mean?

126
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:25,340
Remember when that guy hit me
in the head with that pool cue,
and i fucked my neck up?

127
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,843
Yeah, down at the shore.
Right. I went
to this doctor.

128
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:32,847
This guy works on the jets'
front line when they get hurt.

129
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,350
Yeah, he's fuckin' like
the jonas salk of backs.

130
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,853
Anyway, i send pussy
to this doctor.

131
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:43,858
The guy gives him the works--
m. R. I. S, cat scans,
dog scans, you name it.

132
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,861
He says there's not
a fuckin' thing wrong
with his back.

133
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:52,751
Then again, he says, uh,
when it comes to backs,

134
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:55,253
nobody knows anything, really.

135
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:59,174
You know, i was on a good run,
and then, boom.

136
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:02,177
I don't know. It's like
i'm walking down the street,

137
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:07,182
and i'm looking up,
because i feel like a safe's
gonna land on my head.

138
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:09,184
A feeling of pending doom?

139
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:12,187
Let me ask you a question.

140
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:16,191
This mental stuff can cause
physical problems, right?

141
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:18,693
Are you having
any physical problems?

142
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:21,196
No, no, i'm fine.

143
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:23,698
But i got a friend,

144
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:27,702
a dear, dear friend,
and i'm concerned about him.

145
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:31,706
- What's wrong with him?
- It's his back.

146
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:35,210
See, he-- he's complaining
about his back,

147
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,712
but i think the doctor thinks
it's all in his head.

148
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:40,215
That's very possible.

149
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:42,717
What do you think?

150
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:46,721
- I think we should
just keep this about you.
- This is about me.

151
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:51,726
Every time i offer my opinion
about any of your friends,

152
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:55,730
it seems to interfere
with our therapy.

153
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,734
You start cursing
and screaming.

154
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:04,739
What kind of mental stuff
would cause a backache?

155
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:08,743
- For conversation's sake?
- Absolutely.

156
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:13,748
With some people,
the pain is...

157
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:18,253
caused by more responsibility
than they can handle.

158
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:23,758
Well, that makes sense.
I mean, he's got a lot of bills,

159
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,760
a lot of problems
with his kid's school fund.

160
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,763
Secrets.

161
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:31,766
What do you mean?

162
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:35,770
Psychologically, a secret
is a heavy load.

163
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,275
It leads to feelings of guilt
which further burden the mind.

164
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:55,406
If you want my opinion,
this can't be true.

165
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,408
Thanks, debbie.

166
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,916
You know, i told you
that i would do what i could,

167
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:09,888
but this is d. E. A. ,
feds, task force.

168
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,341
This is not as easy
as you think--

169
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:15,810
gettin' my hands
on the 3- 0- 2.

170
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,762
Now, you listen to me.

171
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:21,266
This is the most serious
fuckin' decision i've ever
had to make in my life,

172
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,768
and i need proof.

173
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:27,272
I'm not gonna hurt
a man that i love
because of some cop gossip...

174
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:30,275
from a degenerate fuckin'
gambler with a badge,
you understand me?

175
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:33,778
You know, you got
the amazing ability...

176
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:37,782
to sum up a man's whole life
in a single sentence.

177
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:41,286
"Degenerate gambler
with a badge," huh?

178
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:45,790
- You're a pisser.
You're a real pisser.
- Oh, i'm sorry.

179
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,794
I'm under a little bit
of pressure here. I don't
have time to suck your dick!

180
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:51,796
- Apology accepted.
- Fuck you!

181
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:53,798
- Fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you!

182
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:59,304
You know, when i was a kid--

183
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:03,308
when i was a kid and my old man
would be in one of his ways,

184
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:05,810
with the screamin'
back and forth,

185
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:09,814
eventually it'd end
with her throwin'
the closest thing to her,

186
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:12,317
and he'd smack her around!

187
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:16,321
I don't know why,

188
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:20,825
but i would run into my room
and i would hide under my bed.

189
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:26,331
There was somethin' peaceful,
and there was somethin' safe
under that bed.

190
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:30,335
And that's where i would
wake up the next day.

191
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,806
Everything back to normal.

192
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:36,808
How about you, tony?

193
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:40,812
Do you ever feel
like hidin' under a bed?

194
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:45,316
Yeah. Right now.

195
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,824
Oh, you're a prick
to the end, right?

196
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,332
You really
like this place, huh?

197
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:03,835
It's my getaway.

198
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,838
This is where debbie's
taken care of me for years.

199
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:11,342
- I'll bet she has.
- I'm serious, she has.

200
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:14,846
I mean, there were times when
i'd be havin' a great weekend
with the football, you know,

201
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:17,348
and i would come in here
with a pocketful of money,
shitfaced,

202
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:22,353
and every friggin', fuckin'
penny of it would be there
when i got up in the morning.

203
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,356
She is an honest lady.

204
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:28,359
She'd do anything for you.
Anything.
Come on.

205
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:31,362
You come in here,
you flash your badge,
you get some free pussy.

206
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:35,867
Fuckin' pussy.
I wouldn't fuck one of
these broads with your dick.

207
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:39,871
They have absolutely no class,
and they're always
on the hustle.

208
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:42,490
That's kind of what they're
supposed to do, no?

209
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:58,389
"Oh, hello, carmela.
How nice to see you."

210
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:03,394
How are you feeling?
Oh, what can i say?

211
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,897
What's that?
Uh, it's a "rigot" pie.

212
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:09,400
I saved it from the open house.
Are you wearing makeup?

213
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,903
I can't eat that.
It's got cholesterol.

214
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:14,405
I made it with
the low- fat cheese.

215
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,408
Yuck!

216
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:21,412
Well, maybe
your friends'll eat it.

217
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:23,915
What friends?

218
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:26,417
Fine, you can eat it
when junior visits.

219
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:32,423
You know, ma, your son
loves you very much.

220
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:34,926
He worries all the time.

221
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:37,929
He felt bad that you
didn't come to the open house.

222
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,932
And i don't care if you think
it's disrespectful,

223
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,934
but i want you
to cut the drama.

224
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:45,937
- It's killing tony.
- What are you talking about?

225
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:49,557
I'm talking about this
"poor mother, nobody loves me"
victim crap.

226
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:54,445
It is textbook manipulation,
and i hate seeing tony
so upset over it.

227
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:56,948
I know how
to talk to people.

228
00:16:57,315 --> 00:17:00,818
Well, i am a mother too,
don't forget.

229
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:04,205
And you know the power
that you have,
and you use it like a pro.

230
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:06,207
Power? What?
What power?

231
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,710
I don't have power.
I'm a shut- in!

232
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,963
You are bigger than life!
You are his mother!

233
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:14,465
I don't think for one second
you don't know what
you're doin' to him.

234
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:17,468
Who, me? Me?
What did i--
what did i do?

235
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:20,838
Look, i didn't come by
to argue.

236
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,342
I came by to check on you
and to bring you the rigot.

237
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:29,347
If you don't want it,
you can give it to junior,
'cause i know he stops by a lot.

238
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:31,349
He's my husband's brother.

239
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,602
He can't check up on me
once in a while?

240
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:36,604
It's none of
anybody's business.

241
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:38,489
Oh, my god.
I am not saying that.

242
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,492
All i'm saying is,
if you don't want it,
give it to junior.

243
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:43,611
I know what
you're hinting at.

244
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:47,248
Ma, there is nothing wrong
with companionship!

245
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:54,622
- What is wrong?
-

246
00:17:56,124 --> 00:18:01,129
oh. Wait until
you're abandoned.

247
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:04,766
Oh!

248
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,769
Abandoned? Please!

249
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:17,028
When johnny was alive,
nobody treated me like this.

250
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:20,398
What are you talking about?
Who is treating you bad?

251
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,900
Tony would rather die
than see you hurt!

252
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:26,904
- Johnny was a saint.
- Yes, we have heard.

253
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:30,792
Funny, though, i don't remember
you telling him that
when he was alive.

254
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:34,295
Junior couldn't carry
johnny's socks.

255
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:37,298
Do you think i'd blacken
my johnny's memory...

256
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:39,801
by getting mixed up
with his brother?

257
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:42,303
Oh, jeez.

258
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:44,055
I didn't say that.

259
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:48,059
All i'm saying is that we
are happy that you and junior
get along so well.

260
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:52,563
Well, at least with junior, i--

261
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:56,067
i've got some purpose in life.

262
00:18:56,184 --> 00:19:00,938
Somebody listens to me
and doesn't treat me
like an old shoe.

263
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,447
Jesus!

264
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:15,703
Don't worry about the dish.
I'll come back tomorrow
and get it.

265
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,712
Oh, tony.
Hey, college boy!

266
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,718
Yo, dad,
it's uncle tony.

267
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:38,976
There he is,
the beached whale.

268
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:41,479
Hey, tony,
what are you doin' here?

269
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:45,483
I figured you'd be havin'
a cannoli withdrawal by now.
Spinelli's?

270
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,369
No, stop'n shop.
What do you think?

271
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:51,873
Hey, you're the best.
Kev, put those on a dish.

272
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:54,625
Wait till after supper.

273
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:59,130
So, your father tells me you're
takin' up astronomy in college.
No, business.

274
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,884
How come he keeps sayin'
you're takin' up space
in school?

275
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:07,388
Madron, don't make me laugh.
It kills my back.

276
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:10,391
He's a good- lookin' kid.
Sure he's yours?

277
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:13,394
You're lucky my wife's not home.
She'd toss you out for that.
She doesn't play.

278
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:16,898
I know.
He's a good boy, tony.

279
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:19,767
I pray to god i keep that
fuckin' tuition comin' in.

280
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:21,769
Hey, the kid can always
go to city college.

281
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:27,024
This kid's stayin' right where
he is. He isn't gettin' fucked
'cause his old man is!

282
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:33,531
You ought to relax.
You ought to take it
easy a little.

283
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:36,033
"Take it easy."
How the fuck can i
take it easy?

284
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,035
Things are happenin', tony.

285
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:42,039
What kind of things?
Things!

286
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,794
This fuckin' back has taken me
out of the game.
I'm way behind.

287
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:50,298
And top it off,
i think i'm gettin' hooked
on these fuckin' painkillers.

288
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,801
I don't know.
I feel like someone
put themaloikon me.

289
00:20:56,437 --> 00:21:00,942
Puss, you got options.

290
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:06,447
Don't let anyone make you feel
like you don't have any options,
'cause you got friends--

291
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:09,951
look at me-- friends
that would die for you.

292
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:11,953
You understand me?

293
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:14,205
Friends.

294
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:17,208
Yeah, i know.

295
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,714
You got anything
you want to say to me?

296
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:27,218
Like what?

297
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:33,474
Like,"you want some coffee,
tony? You want
somethin' to eat?"

298
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:35,476
You want coffee?
Yeah.

299
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:39,730
What do you think,
i'm gonna let you eat all those
fuckin' cannolis by yourself?

300
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,732
- You beached whale.
- Here.

301
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:45,236
What?
Help me up. You want coffee?
Who's gonna make it, you?

302
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:47,238
One, two, three.

303
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:50,241
You look good.

304
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,243
Yeah.

305
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:16,517
What's up, t?

306
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:18,519
Sit.

307
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:24,025
Fuckin' traffic.
I would've been here
20 minutes ago.

308
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:28,029
Want a drink?
Nah.

309
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:32,033
You okay?

310
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:38,539
- He's wearin' a wire.
- Who?

311
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:43,544
- Pussy.
- Oh, get the fuck outta here.
Our pussy?

312
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:46,547
Don't know how long.

313
00:22:46,547 --> 00:22:51,552
- Are you sure
about this, tony?
- Ninety percent.

314
00:22:53,554 --> 00:22:55,056
Not enough to do
what needs to be done.

315
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:58,559
Aw, jesus, tony,
i'm fuckin' dreamin' here.

316
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,561
Well, get used to it.

317
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:03,064
I've been walkin'
into walls all week.

318
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,072
I'll do it.

319
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:19,080
It's my responsibility.
Tony,

320
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,582
you waited a long time
for the stripes.

321
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,085
This is one of the perks.

322
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:26,087
I'll do it.

323
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:38,599
We need to be
110 percent sure.

324
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,102
I want you to see it.

325
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:44,105
I want you to see
that fuckin' wire
strapped on his body!

326
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:48,109
I want you to see it.
You hear me?

327
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:51,112
I want you to see it.

328
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:54,115
Otherwise,
all bets are off.

329
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:55,983
You understand?

330
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:03,124
No. This is our friend
we're talkin' about here.

331
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:05,626
You say it.

332
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,745
You understand?

333
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,881
I understand.

334
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:34,271
Come in.

335
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:37,775
Mr. Soprano.

336
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:42,279
Are you busy?
No, no, no.
Come in, please.

337
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:49,787
I was in the neighborhood,
figured i'd stop by
and see my mother.

338
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:53,290
Brought her
some mario lanza.

339
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,294
She, uh, loves
the old guys.

340
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:03,801
I'm a little worried about her.
You know, she's always
been depressed.

341
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:08,305
Sometimes these
half- assed tenors
can really do the trick.

342
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:16,313
You know where she is?
She's not in her room.

343
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:19,316
I wanted to tell her
her house went into escrow.

344
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:23,320
She's with the other girls
getting aqua therapy.
My mother?

345
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,324
The physical therapist told her
if she didn't get any exercise,

346
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:30,077
her back was gonna arch
like an old lady.

347
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:32,079
I didn't even know
she owned a bathing suit.

348
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:34,215
She's more connected
to the world.

349
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:35,833
Which one?
This one or neptune?

350
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:39,837
No, really.

351
00:25:40,337 --> 00:25:43,974
I think your uncle's visits
has a lot to do with it.

352
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:46,477
Oh, she looks forward
to them.

353
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:49,980
- Oh, could you excuse me
one moment?
- Yeah, sure.

354
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,984
No, just, uh, tell her
her house sold,

355
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:56,487
and they accepted
the counteroffer.
Hello?

356
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:59,490
Okay. Yeah,
i'll be right there.

357
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,742
I'm leavin', guys.
All right, pussy.
I'll see you later.

358
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:03,744
Feel better.
I'll tell ya if that horse
is runnin'.

359
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:06,497
Don't do me any favors.
I gotta take off.
I'll see ya.

360
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,781
- Follow me.
- Where?

361
00:26:41,282 --> 00:26:42,783
It's a surprise.

362
00:26:45,286 --> 00:26:47,288
Come on, ya hard- on,
before we get a ticket.

363
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,670
Paulie, i been here before.
What the fuck you want?

364
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,172
Look around.
I'll give you three guesses.

365
00:27:05,673 --> 00:27:07,174
Come on, down here.

366
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:13,180
We'll grab a rubdown after.

367
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:15,683
Here.

368
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:21,689
I don't know.
Come on, get undressed.
It's on me.

369
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:24,191
Why do you think
those russian leaders
live so long?

370
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:28,195
They take ashvitz
every day.
I can't.

371
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:31,699
Now, don't be like that.
It's a gift.
Take your clothes off.

372
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,201
What? You want me
to turn around?

373
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:38,205
The doctor said heat's no good
for me. I gotta avoid it.
That's why i sit in the shade.

374
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:40,207
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

375
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:43,711
Heat is good for your back.
Take your clothes off.

376
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:47,214
Look, paulie, i appreciate it,
but maybe another time, huh?

377
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:50,217
Take your clothes off.

378
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,722
You're fuckin' crazy.
I'm goin' home.

379
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:58,726
Why don't you wanna
take your clothes off?

380
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:02,730
I got high blood pressure,
you fuckin' idiot.

381
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,732
I go in there,
i could check the fuck out.

382
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:07,735
My doctor mentioned
steam and sauna
specifically as no- no's!

383
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:10,738
He said stay the fuck
away from heat!

384
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:15,743
Thanks for the thought,
but get out of my fuckin' face.

385
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:42,903
What'd you find out?
It's good.
It's fuckin' very good.

386
00:28:42,903 --> 00:28:45,406
Spit it out.

387
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:49,410
He's into pussy, big.
I mean, with a capital "b."

388
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,914
This fuckin' makazian,
he's a lyin' motherfucker.

389
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:56,417
He's into pussy for,
like, 30 large.

390
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,419
Twenty grand
just on football.

391
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,921
Uh, the rest is shy.

392
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:04,425
Pussy must be burying
this prick in vig alone.

393
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:13,934
It doesn't mean
he's a liar.

394
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:18,439
It just means he's got
a reason to see pussy dead.
It buys him time.

395
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:24,445
Could this prick have the balls
to try somethin' like this?

396
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:26,947
Hey, we're talkin' about
30 grand here.

397
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:30,951
I don't even wanna think about
what me and you would do
to remove that debt.

398
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:32,953
I wouldn't bet football.

399
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:39,460
I gotta think about this.

400
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:44,965
Look, t, if my vote
counts for anything,

401
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:50,971
i cannot believe that pussy
would fear the can enough
to hurt his friends.

402
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:55,976
That's what they said
about gravano.

403
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:01,482
All right. Go back in.
I gotta think.

404
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:16,663
Deb?

405
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:20,667
Debbie?

406
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:31,795
Why don't you take it easy?
I would think a whore
would like a little pain.

407
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,797
Come on!
Take it easy!
Vinnie, stop it!

408
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:36,800
Let's get this show
on the road!
Look at this.

409
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,303
A doctor, a madam,
wise guy and a cop.

410
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:42,940
That's what i call
a vice superfecta.

411
00:30:47,945 --> 00:30:51,198
The four were arrested
last night. A police
spokesman says...

412
00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:54,701
that the officer in question
will be placed on
administrative leave,

413
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:57,204
pending the outcome
of the hearing
set for this morning.

414
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:59,456
I'd hate to have been there
when he got home.

415
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:01,458
I don't know which
is more embarrassing--

416
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:04,962
to be caught in a bordello
or to be caught
with the wise guy.

417
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:07,965
Meanwhile, there was a fire--
asshole.

418
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:11,084
What's a bordello?
It's a fancy name
for a whorehouse.

419
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,837
- Don't start, okay?
- It is.

420
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:15,973
Yeah, i know it is.
I just don't like that talk.

421
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:18,592
This country's light years
behind the rest of the world.
Most civilized countries...

422
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:21,595
have legalized prostitution.
Don't you got
somewhere to be?

423
00:31:22,095 --> 00:31:24,097
It's a joke.
Look what they're putting
the president through.

424
00:31:24,231 --> 00:31:28,735
- He deserved what he got.
- He got monica "kazinski" and
the broad with the long nose.

425
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:30,988
I just don't think sex
should be a punishable offense.

426
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:34,358
That's where i agree with you.
I don't think sex should be
a punishable offense either.

427
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:38,745
I do think that talkin'
about sex at the breakfast table
isa punishable offense.

428
00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:41,865
- So no more sex talk, okay?
- It's the 90s.

429
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:44,751
Parents are supposed
to discuss sex
with their children.

430
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:46,753
Yeah, but that's where
you're wrong.

431
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:49,256
You see, out there
it's the 1990s,

432
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:53,260
but in this house
it's 1954.

433
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:55,879
1990s. 1954.

434
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,883
So now and forever,
i don't wanna hear
any more sex talk, okay?

435
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:06,390
What's with him?

436
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:08,525
Come on! Let's go!

437
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:15,032
Come on, come on!
Come on, you lame- ass driver!

438
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,902
Keep moving, please.

439
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:20,904
Come on!

440
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,907
Move it!
Where do you want me to go?

441
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,913
- Goddamn it!
- Come on, pull up!

442
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:41,174
Come on, goddamn it!

443
00:32:41,174 --> 00:32:45,679
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

444
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,823
Oh, go right ahead, detective.
Excuse me. Move it out, please.

445
00:32:57,074 --> 00:33:00,694
Got a police officer here.
Move it out!

446
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:02,696
Let's go. Pull up.

447
00:33:03,196 --> 00:33:04,698
Come on.

448
00:33:05,198 --> 00:33:07,200
Police vehicle comin' through!

449
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:57,000
Are you sure?
Who told you this?

450
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:03,006
What?

451
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:09,513
Yeah. Yeah, i'm still here.

452
00:34:09,513 --> 00:34:13,016
All right, thanks.
I'll talk to you later.

453
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,522
You gonna tell me?

454
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:22,025
The fuckin' jerk did a header
off the road one bridge.

455
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:24,027
Who?
Makazian.

456
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:27,531
Fuck!

457
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:31,918
There goes our only shot
to find out for sure
the truth about pussy.

458
00:34:34,921 --> 00:34:39,926
Well, if it matters,
he always said how much
he respected you.

459
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:41,928
It matters.

460
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:47,434
He helped me out
of a lot of jams.

461
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:49,803
Not just with the law.

462
00:34:51,304 --> 00:34:53,807
What the fuck was he thinkin'?
He could've kept his job.

463
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:56,309
He might've been suspended,
that's all.

464
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:58,311
It wasn't like
he was dealin'.

465
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:00,814
That's not why he did it.

466
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:02,816
Don't get me wrong,
it was the straw.

467
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:06,820
But he was not happy...

468
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,323
with himself,
how he turned out.

469
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:12,826
What did he
come here for, therapy?

470
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:14,828
You could say that.

471
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:18,832
Instead of a couch
you use a bed?
It's not a bad deal.

472
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:21,835
Hey, who wouldn't want
to sleep with their shrink?

473
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:26,840
What does that mean?

474
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:31,845
You would be amazed
how much easier it is
to open up when you're naked...

475
00:35:32,345 --> 00:35:34,848
and in the arms of someone
who cares for you.

476
00:35:34,848 --> 00:35:40,353
Did he ever...mention anything
about my guys to you?

477
00:35:40,353 --> 00:35:42,856
He didn't like paulie.

478
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:44,858
He thought he was a psycho.

479
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:50,363
- What about pussy?
- He really didn't have much
to say about any of you guys.

480
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:55,869
Except that he
owed some money.

481
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:58,872
He wasn't worried
because you liked him,

482
00:35:59,873 --> 00:36:02,375
and as long as he had you
in his corner,

483
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:04,377
there was nothing
really to worry about.

484
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,881
I'm not gonna lie
'cause he's dead.

485
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:11,384
He didn't have a good thing
to say about anybody,

486
00:36:11,384 --> 00:36:13,887
but he did feel like
he could trust you, tony.

487
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,394
He said many times,
"at least with tony soprano,
you know where you stand."

488
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:33,657
Livia, open up.
It's junior.

489
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:37,544
Come on in.
It's open.

490
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:41,548
What's goin' on?

491
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:44,417
My dominican girl
said you called me.

492
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:49,422
Well, he sold our house.

493
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:51,925
Don't people
have names anymore?
Who's "he"?

494
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:55,929
Anthony.
He sold my house--

495
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:59,432
the home that
my husband and i made!

496
00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:01,935
What else were they
gonna do with it?

497
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:03,937
You too?

498
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:06,940
Hey!

499
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,444
I suppose he would've found it
harder to have his meetings
atmyhouse...

500
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:13,947
than in this nursing home.

501
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:15,949
What are you talkin' about,
"meetings"?

502
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,336
Don't think i'll ever
see any of that money either.

503
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:23,089
- What meetings?
- Raymond, larry,

504
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,343
that sneak from manhattan.

505
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:28,345
Johnny sack?
Johnny sack was here?

506
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:31,848
With his mohair suits
and his shoe lifts.

507
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:34,851
Suits? Pleurisy?

508
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:38,355
More than once he was here?
Why didn't i know about this?

509
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:41,858
Well, maybe it was you
they were talking about.
Who knows?

510
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:54,371
I just don't like being put
in the middle of things.

511
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:58,375
I should've known
something was strange...

512
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:03,380
when suddenly larry boy's mother
moved in here...

513
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,383
and then
jimmy altieri's mother.

514
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:09,135
Three of mycappos
have their mothers
in this place?

515
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:14,641
Instead of living in
normal homes with their sons,
like human beings.

516
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:18,144
This must be some kind
of fuckin' end move.

517
00:38:18,144 --> 00:38:20,146
What, do they think
i'm stupid?

518
00:38:20,146 --> 00:38:22,899
We'll see.
Now, wait a minute.

519
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,653
I don't like
that kind of talk.

520
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:29,656
Now, just stop it.
It upsets me.

521
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:33,159
Or i won't tell you
anything anymore.

522
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,162
If this is true, livia,
you know what i--

523
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:38,164
i mean--

524
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:40,166
i'm divorced,
for christ's sake!

525
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,669
If i don't act,
blood or no--

526
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:53,680
i have to!
Oh, god!

527
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,184
What-- what did i say now?

528
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:09,195
I suppose i should have
just kept my mouth shut,
like a mute,

529
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:12,699
and then everybody
would have been happy.

530
00:39:23,543 --> 00:39:25,545
Anthony, go see
who's at the door.

531
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:28,548
- I'm eating.
- But you won't have any teeth
left to eat with...

532
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:30,550
if you don't get off your ass
and see who's at the door.

533
00:39:37,057 --> 00:39:39,559
Make sure you know who it is
before you answer it!

534
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:42,562
Who is coming at dinnertime?
People can't call?

535
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:46,066
I don't know.
It's uncle jimmy!

536
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:49,569
Uncle jimmy?
Let him in!

537
00:39:53,323 --> 00:39:55,825
I don't believe it.
How'd you get out?
Hey.

538
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:58,328
Carm, look who's here.
It's jimmy. He's out.

539
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:01,831
Oh, my god! Jimmy!
Thought you'd never
see me again, huh?

540
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:03,833
So, what happened?
Long story.

541
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:07,837
You got someplace in private
we can talk?
Yeah, in the basement.

542
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,593
What's goin' on?

543
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:18,098
You got a problem.

544
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,102
Yeah, i know.
I'm workin' on it.

545
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:26,106
- Workin' on what?
- Why, what were you gonna say?

546
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:30,610
- You better lay low
with that safe house money.
- What are you talkin' about?

547
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:34,114
They were askin' me
a lot of questions
in there, you know?

548
00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:38,618
If i knew anything
about the dead columbian
in the apartment and all that.

549
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:44,624
You look good.

550
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,127
Thanks. I wasn't
gone that long.

551
00:40:47,127 --> 00:40:50,130
Yeah. Yeah, i know.

552
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,633
My lawyer told him,
"he doesn't own the building.

553
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:56,636
He's not responsible
for what's in the building."

554
00:40:56,636 --> 00:41:01,141
I told him the pool table
was there when i first
rented the joint.

555
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:04,644
Good thinkin'.
Missed your callin'.
Should've been a lawyer.

556
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:06,646
Please.

557
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:10,150
Enough people hate me.

558
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,404
So, uh, what are you
gonna do about
the columbian money?

559
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:21,411
They were puttin'
the screws to me
like i was a school kid,

560
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:23,413
tellin' me that the money
was marked.

561
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:27,917
They even said that there's
a new fingerprint technique that
lifts'em right off the bills.

562
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:35,792
- You're a lucky man, jimmy.
- What do you mean?

563
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:39,929
- You're out on bail on that
conspiracy thing, right?
- Yeah, so?

564
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:42,432
So only a lucky prick like you
would get pinched with a gun...

565
00:41:42,432 --> 00:41:46,436
while he's out on bail
for something else and still
be out in time for dinner.

566
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:50,440
You're a lucky guy.

567
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,442
Speakin' of dinner,
carmela's got some lasagna.

568
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:54,444
You want some?
Come on.
I'll pass.

569
00:41:54,444 --> 00:41:57,447
I still got a few people to see
that are late with payments.
Oh, yeah?

570
00:41:57,947 --> 00:42:00,450
I gotta make sure they
see my face, otherwise they
think they're off the hook.

571
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,452
Yeah, i know how that is.

572
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:13,580
- Get off the phone!
- I gotta go. What's up?

573
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,082
It's jimmy!
It's fuckin' jimmy!

574
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:19,586
What?
The wire,
it's fuckin' jimmy!

575
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:22,589
What are you talkin' about?
The wire.
Do you understand?

576
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:26,092
The wire,
it's fuckin' jimmy.
Holy shit.

577
00:42:26,092 --> 00:42:30,096
"New fingerprint technique."
I should've killed him
right in my fuckin' basement.

578
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:33,600
Makazian's guy got his facts
crossed. They both got busted
at the same fuckin' time--

579
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,603
jimmy and pussy,
you understand?

580
00:42:38,104 --> 00:42:41,608
Two fat fucks with black hair.
Where the fuck is paulie?

581
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:44,994
Uh, he called an hour ago,
i swear to god.
He said he's on his way.

582
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:47,997
Why the fuck
isn't he here now?

583
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:51,501
Jesus, tony.

584
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:54,504
You don't think, uh,
paulie jumped the gun?

585
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:56,506
Shut up. God forbid.
God forbid.

586
00:42:57,006 --> 00:43:01,511
Don't talk like that.
Where's pussy?
Get him on the phone.

587
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:05,014
All right. All right.

588
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:08,768
I haven't seen him since, uh,
paulie took him to theshvitz.

589
00:43:08,768 --> 00:43:11,137
Hey, fellas.

590
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,642
Where the fuck have you been?
I've been calling you
all fuckin' night long!

591
00:43:16,142 --> 00:43:18,645
I was at mygoombahs.
I told silvio i was comin'.

592
00:43:18,645 --> 00:43:21,147
You answer me like
i'm jesus christ himself,

593
00:43:21,147 --> 00:43:24,150
and if you fuckin' lie to me,
may your mother die
of cancer of the eyes.

594
00:43:28,154 --> 00:43:30,657
Where's pussy?
I don't know.

595
00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:33,660
Don't you fuckin'
lie to me.
Tony.

596
00:43:36,162 --> 00:43:38,665
Did you do it?
Tony--

597
00:43:38,665 --> 00:43:42,669
shh. Don't fuckin'
lie to me.

598
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,173
Did you do it?
No.

599
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:49,175
Did you fuckin' do it?
No.

600
00:43:49,676 --> 00:43:51,177
Did you fuckin' do it?

601
00:43:51,678 --> 00:43:55,682
I said no! Now get
your fuckin' hands off me.

602
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:59,319
Come on, tony.
Come on.

603
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:20,957
I'm sorry, paulie.

604
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:25,962
I can't find pussy anywhere!

605
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,965
Nobody knows anything!

606
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:33,353
I haven't seen him
since theshvitz.

607
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:37,857
The last thing
he said to me was,
"go fuck yourself."

608
00:44:37,857 --> 00:44:41,611
Did he at least
take theshvitz?

609
00:44:44,113 --> 00:44:47,367
He refused
to take his clothes off.

610
00:44:53,122 --> 00:44:57,126
The rat,
it's fuckin' jimmy.

611
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:03,383
Ah, fuck it.

612
00:45:03,383 --> 00:45:05,501
Let's all have a drink.

613
00:45:10,757 --> 00:45:13,893
Easy. Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

614
00:45:15,395 --> 00:45:17,397
All right.

615
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:19,399
Hey, babe!

616
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:26,406
- Look what chucky brought us.
- Oh, another kitchen appliance.

617
00:45:26,906 --> 00:45:28,408
Whoop- fuckin'- pee.

618
00:45:28,908 --> 00:45:30,910
Well, slit your wrists,
why don't ya?

619
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:33,913
A truckload fell off
the loading dock
at zim's last night.

620
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,916
Oh, it's not even
a "bra- oom."

621
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:39,419
That's a braun, babe.

622
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:41,671
Junior said for me to tell ya...
yeah?

623
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:44,674
He's decided...
on that thing.

624
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:47,677
He said we should
look out of town
for who's gonna do it.

625
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:49,679
Finally.
Yeah.

626
00:45:49,796 --> 00:45:51,798
Yeah.

627
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:53,433
It's gonna

Yeah.

628
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:56,185
I'll see ya.
All right.
See ya later. All right.

629
00:45:56,686 --> 00:45:58,688
I'll see ya, jo.
Yeah, see ya.

630
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:07,697
- What was that sick fuck
talkin' about?
- Mind your business.

631
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:11,818
Whatever it is, mikey,
we're goin' to vegas
next month.

632
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:15,321
I already lined up child care
for frances albert,
so i don't wanna hear it.

633
00:46:15,321 --> 00:46:18,324
Forget it.
Somethin's come up.

634
00:46:19,826 --> 00:46:21,828
Somethin' always comes up.

635
00:46:22,078 --> 00:46:24,330
This is a good somethin'.

636
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:28,334
I hope it means more money,
'cause i need a new car.
Trust me.

637
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:32,972
If this goes down,
you're gonna have a new car
and then some.

638
00:46:34,223 --> 00:46:36,726
Can you tell me?

639
00:46:36,976 --> 00:46:39,479
Oh, come on, mikey.
Tell me.

640
00:46:39,479 --> 00:46:41,981
Mm- mmm.
Come on. Please?

641
00:46:44,984 --> 00:46:47,987
I may be gettin' bumped up
a notch or two.

642
00:46:47,987 --> 00:46:52,992
Tony soprano's on his way out,
and i mean as inforever.

643
00:46:52,992 --> 00:46:56,496
Oh, my god!
He's goin' to jail?

644
00:46:56,496 --> 00:46:59,499
No, the other forever.

645
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:01,501
Does junior know?

646
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:04,003
Oh, jeez.

647
00:47:04,003 --> 00:47:07,507
Now, listen to me.
If you breathe
a word of this to anybody,

648
00:47:07,507 --> 00:47:11,511
they're gonna be buryin'
me and you right next
to tony soprano, understand?

649
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:13,513
Yeah.
Okay.

650
00:47:13,513 --> 00:47:15,515
Make it decaf.

651
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:24,273
You don't belittle a man
like junior soprano.
He's old school.

652
00:47:24,774 --> 00:47:26,776
You don't joke
about cuntlapping,

653
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:29,529
and you definitely
don't spill your guts out
to a fuckin' shrink...

654
00:47:29,529 --> 00:47:32,031
about business that isn't
yours to talk about.

655
00:47:32,532 --> 00:47:34,534
Tony soprano sees a shrink?

656
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:37,537
You fuckin' believe that?
And to add insult to injury,

657
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:40,039
he was plannin' on makin'
a move against junior.

658
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,658
His own uncle?

659
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,163
Were you this fuckin' stupid
when i married you?

660
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:50,049
- Oh, fuck you!
- No, fuck you.

661
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:52,552
What are you doin'
standin' there?
Make the coffee.

662
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:56,055
Take it easy!
Take it easy.
It's brewin'.
