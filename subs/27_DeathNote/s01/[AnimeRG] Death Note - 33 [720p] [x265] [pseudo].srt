<i>Easy easy banzai Easy easy banzai
Easy easy banzai Human</i>

00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,317
<i>Easy easy banzai Easy easy banzai
Easy easy banzai Human</i>

00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:31,448
<i>Wanna get them mad? Get them mad?
Get them mad? People</i>

4
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,535
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

5
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,496
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

6
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,332
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:49,508
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

9
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,472
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

11
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,475
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

12
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:04,398
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

13
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,233
<i>Hey Hey! Subservient People!</i>

14
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,611
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

16
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,572
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

17
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,490
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>Are you worried?</i>

19
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:32,342
<i>The Second L, and the one
who I think is Kira, is Light Yagami.</i>

20
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>Good evening.
I am Kiyomi Takada.</i>

21
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,431
KIYOMI TAKADA CHOSEN AS
KIRA'S SPOKESPERSON

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,184
About our investigation...

23
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,604
I think we should incorporate
Kiyomi Takada from now on.

24
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,064
Sorry.

25
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,233
Kira...

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
It can't be helped...

27
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,738
Listen Kiyomi...

28
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,282
I'm Kira.

29
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,786
Yagami is... Kira?

30
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,998
SCORN

31
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,002
<i>All the pieces are set.</i>

32
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,212
<i>Now that things have
gone this far,</i>

33
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,131
<i>It's my turn to head to Japan...</i>

34
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,801
Commander Rester.

35
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,178
<i>Yes.</i>

36
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,597
Can you return to New York now?

37
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,098
<i>NOW?</i>

38
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,683
I've decided to go to Japan.

39
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,354
<i>Does that mean that I'll be standing by
in New York while you're gone?</i>

40
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,605
No...

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,899
<i>Then why do I have to
return to New York?</i>

42
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:34,237
I've never been on
an airplane by myself.

43
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,574
I want you to come back now,
and come with me to Japan...

44
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>All right.</i>

45
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,586
As we expected,

46
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,505
Yoshida Productions and
NHN jumped at the chance.

47
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,300
MISA AMANE TO MAKE A COMEBACK AT NHN EAST WST POP SONG FESTIVAL "MISA-MISA'S
I'M GONNA DO MY BEST!" TO BE HOSTED BY ANCHOR KIYOMl TAKADA

48
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,137
It's difficult to enter
NHN right now,

49
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,390
but this will allow us to do it
without looking suspicious.

50
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,976
Yes. Mogi can go as her manager.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,271
We definitely want someone
who can freely enter NHN.

52
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,608
I'll also investigate through Takada.

53
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,070
<i>This is Near. Get me L.</i>

54
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,323
This is L... What do you want?

55
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:24,037
I'm going to arrest Kira and
I'm here in Japan.

56
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,164
<i>In Japan?</i>

57
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,709
<i>Why is he taking the time
to tell me that?</i>

58
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,421
<i>L... You've contacted
Takada the anchor</i>

59
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,256
<i>and are investigating Kira,
aren't you?</i>

60
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,427
Yes... I'm investigating her myself.

61
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,011
I thought so.

62
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,348
Right now, it's a given
that we must investigate

63
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,936
NHN's Kiyomi Takada if
we want to find Kira...

64
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,439
So please tell Takada that...

65
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:56,361
SPK members have entered Japan
in order to arrest Kira.

66
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,238
Why?

67
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,949
In order to lure Kira out.

68
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,202
<i>I also want you to add this:</i>

69
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:10,208
<i>There are only four members
of the SPK, including myself.</i>

70
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,961
<i>Kira won't run away.</i>

71
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,173
<i>He'll deï¬nitely try to kill us.</i>

72
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,883
<i>We're...</i>

73
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,760
going to use that to beat him
at his own game.

74
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,803
<i>"Beat him at his own game," huh?</i>

75
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,352
<i>Fine... Near...
I'll accept your challenge!</i>

76
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,772
I'm in Japan.

77
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,815
I'm also in Japan.

78
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:40,030
Then we may meet
face-to-face soon.

79
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,615
You're right.

80
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,327
I'll look forward to that time.

81
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,745
Yes.

82
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,706
We'll bring this business with Kira
to an end once and for all...

83
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,333
Definitely...

84
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,421
<i>Come to think of it,
ever since the beginning...</i>

85
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,841
<i>this has been a one-on-one
battle against L...</i>

86
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,971
<i>Only now, it's shifted to someone
who's inï¬‚uenced by L.</i>

87
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:11,353
<i>Fine, Near.
I'll come out if you're coming out.</i>

88
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,022
<i>When we meet,</i>

89
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,151
<i>we'll see who's more prepared
and who can surpass the other.</i>

90
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,822
<i>When that happens,
the battle will end.</i>

91
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,075
<i>That's when I'll begin
my reign at the top!</i>

92
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,996
First, we have to figure out
our current situation.

93
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,415
L is Light Yagami.

94
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,835
And Kira...

95
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,504
Let's assume that there
is an L-Kira.

96
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,923
And there's another.

97
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,344
X- Kira. He holds the notebook
and is using it.

98
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:50,016
Judging by X-Kira's killings,
he definitely has the Shinigami eyes.

99
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:56,648
L- Kira and X-Kira plan to
communicate through Takada.

100
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:02,654
So, I believe there are approximately
two ways to win against Kira.

101
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,739
Our first option...

102
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:11,204
is to kill L-Kira and X-Kira
and take the notebook.

103
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,208
But we will never resort
to this method.

104
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,501
Why not?

105
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,837
That is not how we do things.

106
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,422
"We?"

107
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,299
That's right.

108
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,302
Killing people and getting
ex post-facto justification

109
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,888
just by the fact that
the killings have stopped...

110
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,432
That's not the way that
L and I do things.

111
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,059
L wouldn't be able to rest...

112
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,439
There would be no meaning to entrusting
this case to his successor...

113
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,332
Takada, I heard on the news that

114
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,626
you receive an enormous amount
of fan mail every day.

115
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:02,213
Yes. I've heard it's about
an average of 200 letters a day.

116
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,592
<i>200 letters...
I'm kind of jealous...</i>

117
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,595
<i>- I don't even have time to read them.
- With just audio and no video...</i>

118
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,347
it's quite boring.

119
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,559
I think you should look through
them even if they're fan letters.

120
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,895
You're right.

121
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,107
<i>Keep calm when you
read this note.</i>

122
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,360
<i>Make sure not to let the people
listening to this conversation</i>

123
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,278
<i>detect your surprise.</i>

124
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,700
The SPK has started to move.

125
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,497
For your safety, you should
not only accept messages...

126
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,542
<i>but make demands to Kira as well.</i>

127
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,128
Light has moved on to the main topic.

128
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,299
You shouldn't remain
just a spokesperson.

129
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,011
Why don't you reach out to Kira?

130
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,560
<i>There is a different job
that T must do.</i>

131
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,397
<i>In order to create
the perfect world for Kira...</i>

132
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,151
I WANT YOU TO PUNISH AS KIRA

133
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:13,159
It's all right. You'll do it well...

134
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,998
If you do, you can give
information to Kira

135
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,667
that you don't want the SPK to know.

136
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,632
All right. I'll do it.

137
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,175
We did it.

138
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,761
As I expected of Light. He's good.

139
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,851
Delete... Delete...

140
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,394
Delete...

141
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,689
Kiyomi Takada...

142
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,694
Yes?

143
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,362
Here's your message.

144
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:54,868
Send me a fan letter that I can
tell is from you.

145
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,038
Place within it...
Five blank notebook pages.

146
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:04,044
<i>Continue killing as usual
until I receive them.</i>

147
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,129
What about after you receive them?

148
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:11,718
Continue killing using
a fake notebook.

149
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,386
<i>A fake?</i>

150
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,596
Yes.

151
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,557
Make a notebook that looks
as close to the original as possible...

152
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,685
and act as if you're killing
using the fake...

153
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,314
I understand.

154
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,068
<i>God, what are you doing?</i>

155
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,237
<i>No, there's no need to question.</i>

156
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,364
<i>God is absolute...</i>

157
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,660
<i>My job is to do as God wishes.</i>

158
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,516
What is this show?

159
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,601
<i>It's the program that
took over Kira (9 Kingdom.</i>

160
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,853
They're as unscrupulous as always.

161
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,814
Today, Miss Takada will introduce...

162
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:11,111
her four female bodyguards who have
passed a rigorous screening process.

163
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,616
The 22nd Karate Title Champion,
Tatsumi Ooyama.

164
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,954
Former CIA agent Hal Lidner.

165
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,499
<i>If there's an SPK member
among these people,</i>

166
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,042
<i>it would have to be Hal Lidner...</i>

167
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,045
<i>Near is also trying to
investigate Takada...</i>

168
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,967
<i>A random murderer
has stabbed six people...</i>

169
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,053
<i>- Who would I choose...
- in Shinjuku's busy quarters.</i>

170
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,305
<i>- to be X-Kira?
- There has been another killing.</i>

171
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:44,185
<i>Children should be educated about</i>

172
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,690
<i>Kira's existence and teachings.</i>

173
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,276
<i>- Takada was chosen because...
- I think that there is nothing...</i>

174
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,611
<i>- she worships Kira.
- more important.</i>

175
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,951
<i>X- Kira is someone who knows
that Takada is a Kira-worshiper.</i>

176
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,746
<i>Someone who has a close,
intimate relationship with Takada...</i>

177
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,251
<i>Kira will not forgive any small crime.</i>

178
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,420
<i>From now on...</i>

179
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,922
<i>assume that any living person
is punishable.</i>

180
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,856
<i>I'd like to hear Kira's voice...
his thoughts once more.</i>

181
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,527
<i>I think that following Kira's teachings
exactly as ordered</i>

182
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,614
<i>is the quickest path to world peace.</i>

183
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,959
<i>If there are no orders or
words from Kira,</i>

184
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,378
<i>we need to believe that
it's all part of Kira's plan.</i>

185
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:57,592
<i>And make our own decisions
and take action.</i>

186
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,637
<i>- L-Kira is Light Yagami.
- Kira's orders. Kira's Kingdom.</i>

187
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,555
<i>- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
- Spokesperson. Close since college.</i>

188
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,891
<i>- to contact Kiyomi Takada...
- Coincidental past. Secret meetings.</i>

189
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,393
<i>- in order to stop Demegawa's rampage.
- Had notebook before our surveillance.</i>

190
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,566
<i>Everything seems to ï¬t...</i>

191
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,653
I've been saying...

192
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,656
Why aren't I the headlining performer?

193
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,409
You said that I was the highlight of
this year's East West Pop Festival.

194
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,328
No, the highlight is the highlight.

195
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,373
But the headlining act
is usually a big name...

196
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,505
So we should take precautions...

197
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,843
<i>Kiyomi Takada...</i>

198
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,012
She sure is stupid.

199
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,724
She doesn't know that Light is just
using her for his investigation.

200
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,269
Don't say that.
You'll be killed if you do.

201
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,355
I know. That's why I whispered it.

202
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,068
She snickered at me!

203
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,696
I'm going to kick her!

204
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,822
Don't!

205
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,870
What were you trying to do?

206
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,999
What was I doing?
Looks who's talking, lady?

207
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,799
Lidner, she's a good friend of mine.

208
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,302
Please don't be rough with her.

209
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,096
Yes, Miss Takada.

210
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,723
I'm very sorry.

211
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,601
M- Misa-Misa!

212
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,020
Are you all right?

213
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,815
<i>That was so frustrating!</i>

214
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,986
<i>L. If Mr. Aizawa is there...</i>

215
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,865
<i>May I talk to him?</i>

216
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,410
Near, this is Aizawa.
What is it?

217
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:54,250
<i>Do you videotape and wiretap L
and Takada's meetings?</i>

218
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,170
No. We only have wiretaps now.

219
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:03,259
<i>I see. Only wiretaps now.
Thank you very much.</i>

220
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,179
If it's only wiretaps...

221
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,723
then we can assume that L-Kira
and X-Kira

222
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,351
are contacting each other
through Takada.

223
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,604
If that's the case,
then Lidner is in increasing danger.

224
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,397
I know.

225
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:21,944
What's important is for L to turn
his attention to Lidner and Takada.

226
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,781
We'll investigate Mikami
while his attention is on them.

227
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,658
How are things, Gevanni?

228
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:32,663
About Mikami...
Tailing him is strangely easy...

229
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,499
He doesn't try to hide and

230
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,461
has been living normally in
the same place for the past four years.

231
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,964
He's prosecuting people
actively at his job.

232
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,592
I don't think that he can be X-Kira...

233
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,262
No. There is a high possibility
that Mikami is X-Kira.

234
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,889
Please be careful...

235
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,518
<i>Don't enter his room yet,
just keep watch over him...</i>

236
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,811
Yes.

237
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:01,484
Jeez. How many meetings
do I have to have with NHN?

238
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:06,239
And how many times have only I been told,
"Be careful about what you say"?

239
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,698
What's with that?

240
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,867
Yes. I'll ask her.

241
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,165
Misa-Misa. Takada is asking if
you would like to have dinner together.

242
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,667
Huh?

243
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,420
<i>Damn Kiyomi... What does she want?</i>

244
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,506
That's fine.

245
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,925
The Pop Song Festival emcee
and the main headliner

246
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,803
should have dinner together
at least once...

247
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,012
Tell her, "Okay. "

248
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,433
Hello?

249
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,394
Miss Takada, she agreed.

250
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,980
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

251
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,733
Lidner, book a nice private room.

252
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,070
Also... I would like you
to attend as well.

253
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,281
Yes...

254
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,222
Miss Amane, I'm sorry
this is so late at night.

255
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,893
It just had to be after
News 9 finished.

256
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,480
Not a problem. I don't mind.
I'm a night owl anyway.

257
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,116
So, what do you want?

258
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,952
It's hard for me to say if
you ask, but...

259
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:39,540
Your boyfriend seems busy.
Do you still see him?

260
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:45,087
<i>Why that... She knows that
she can see him, but I can't...</i>

261
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,797
<i>What aâ€!</i>

262
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:52,345
I do. He's a lot more
affectionate than he seems.

263
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,723
He keeps clinging onto me
every night when he comes home.

264
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,603
I see... You're doing well.
Thank goodness.

265
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,648
Also, since you're the emcee,

266
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,150
I wanted to tell you this
in advance, but...

267
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,279
I'm going to announce my engagement
to him at the Pop Music Festival.

268
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,577
Does he... know about this?

269
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,248
Of course. It's an engagement.

270
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,041
I can't do it by myself.

271
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,419
He promised me more
than a month ago.

272
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,713
Don't you think it would make
things more exciting if

273
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,924
I made the announcement at
the Pop Music Festival, Miss Emcee?

274
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,767
You're right.

275
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,894
It would be great if you can.

276
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,563
What do you mean, "if I can"?!

277
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,733
You're not going to let me do it?
Or are you...

278
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,861
Going to have me killed by Kira?

279
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:57,118
Of course not.
Only Kira decides who to punish.

280
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,832
I'm not involved.
I think of you as a friend.

281
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,834
Don't say such depressing things.

282
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,004
I don't have any intention
of killing anyone,

283
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,423
no matter how horrible they may be.

284
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,262
Well, whatever.
I used to like Kira as well, but...

285
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,181
Light's going to catch Kira soon.

286
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,189
When he's caught,
you're not going to get away either...

287
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,525
You'll probably get...

288
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,235
executed.

289
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,072
M- Miss Takada!

290
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,991
Are you all right?

291
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,836
<i>Listen, Kiyomi... I'm Kira.</i>

292
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,631
<i>With me... You're...</i>

293
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,425
<i>going to become the goddess
of the new world...</i>

294
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,765
Miss Amane.

295
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,183
Yes?

296
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,226
That was very unpleasant.

297
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,229
Well... the same to you!

298
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,066
I should have waited
to invite you to dinner

299
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,735
until after you had become
more mature

300
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,030
and learned some manners.

301
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,281
Oh my...

302
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,326
I'm older than you are, Little Kiyomi.

303
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,995
Besides, doesn't leaving the table
for something like this

304
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,039
make you the more childish one?

305
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,099
Mochi...

306
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,435
Thanks for waiting...
How are you?

307
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,772
A- Are you all right?

308
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,858
Of course. I won.

309
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,151
Won?

310
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,986
Yeah. It was a cinch!

311
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,700
<i>About tonight's conversation between
Takada and Amane...</i>

312
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,952
<i>I could only assume that
they were ï¬ghting over...</i>

313
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,706
<i>who was Light Yagami's girlfriend.</i>

314
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,666
Near...

315
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,626
All that I can deduce from this is...

316
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,671
Light Yagami is popular
with the ladies.

317
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,383
Takada and Amane adore
Light Yagami.

318
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,552
Near, be serious!

319
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,054
It's a problem if
they seriously like him.

320
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,515
They won't easily betray him.

321
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,727
Yes, he can make them do
whatever he wants them to do...

322
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,740
Please stop!

323
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,950
What's up with that, lady?

324
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,578
You're wearing such
a short skirt even though it's winter...

325
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,079
You were tempting me, weren't you?

326
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,497
S- Someone-!

327
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,087
<i>A cell phone?</i>

328
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,675
<i>Mikami has taken out a notebook.</i>

329
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,264
Delete...

330
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,350
He's writing in it.
Could that be it...?

331
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,811
Mikami's getting off.

332
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:26,076
