<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

<i>Hey Hey! Subservient People!</i>

16
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,776
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

17
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,653
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

18
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,655
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,574
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

20
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>Are you worried?</i>

21
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,146
How many seconds has it been
since you wrote down the first name?

22
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,899
35...

23
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,276
36...

24
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,736
37...

25
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,446
38!

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,281
39!

27
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,658
I win, Near!

28
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,619
40!

29
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,122
NEW WORLD

30
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,769
We're not dead...

31
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,438
A minute's passed...

32
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,689
But we're not dead!

33
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,362
I've been telling you that
nobody would die.

34
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,657
W- Why?

35
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,784
Why won't they die?!

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,370
G- God!

37
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,580
I did as you told me!

38
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,791
Rester, Gevanni, apprehend Mikami.

39
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,841
Gevanni, the notebook.

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,472
See for yourselves.

41
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:07,854
KANZO MOGI - TOUTA MATSUDA
HIDEKI IDE - SHUICHI AIZAWA

42
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,611
Light Yagami.

43
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,949
Mikami called you "God,"

44
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,410
and said that he did
as you told him to...

45
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,162
This proves it.

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,459
It's a trap!

47
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,627
This is a trap!

48
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,672
Near set the whole thing up
to frame me!

49
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,966
It's strange that no one's dead

50
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,509
even after their names
were written in the notebook.

51
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,469
That proves that this is a trap!

52
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,143
But I told you that nobody would die

53
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,103
because I tampered
with the notebook.

54
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,523
N- No...

55
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,692
This is impossible!

56
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,156
This is a setup.
I don't know that man.

57
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,789
Light, it's too late.
Near wins.

58
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,001
A second ago,
you said, "| win. "

59
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,045
That's as good a confession as any.

60
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,093
Light...

61
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,638
W- Why?

62
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,190
S- Stop it!

63
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,286
Light Yagami... L...

64
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,413
Kira...

65
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,208
You lose.

66
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:58,340
You claimed your victory
a moment ago.

67
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:03,887
To tell the truth, you might actually
have won, and I might have lost.

68
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,517
Things turned out exactly
as you had expected...

69
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,520
And we tampered with
the fake notebook.

70
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,192
But when I said that
I had tampered with it,

71
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,195
I was referring to
the real notebook as well.

72
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,282
We only switched a part
of the fake notebook.

73
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,909
But as for the real one...

74
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,953
We replaced the whole thing.

75
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,664
This is the real notebook.

76
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,667
I- Impossible!

77
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:39,089
We used the same pen as Mikami,
copied Mikami's handwriting to perfection,

78
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,259
and made the inside and
outside look exactly the same...

79
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,470
Gevanni was able to
do it overnight.

80
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,102
Since I had already touched
the real notebook...

81
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,021
I could see the Shinigami...

82
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,610
Mr. Shinigami, pleased to meet you.
I'm Near.

83
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,906
Nice to meet you. I'm Ryuk.

84
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,492
<i>He's talking to Ryuk...</i>

85
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,787
<i>He can see him,
so he must be telling the truth...</i>

86
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,041
The edges of this page of
the notebook are clipped.

87
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,753
Would someone die if his name were
written on this clipped portion?

88
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,630
Yeah. They'll die.

89
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,215
I thought so...

90
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,468
You probably found many ways
to use this...

91
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,764
I wonder how many times you've killed
and deceived us with this...

92
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,812
Light Yagami. You are Kira.

93
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,402
<i>There's got to be
some sort of trick behind this...</i>

94
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,905
<i>Could Mikami have
double-crossed me?</i>

95
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,239
You're wrong.

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,700
I owe this to Mello.

97
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,162
I'm sure you understand
what I mean by that.

98
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,331
<i>Mello?!</i>

99
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,666
Take a good look at this...

100
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,755
KIYOMI TAKADA SUICIDE
BURNS TO DEATH

101
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,341
<i>A plan to kill Takada...</i>

102
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,509
<i>JANUARY 262:33 PM
a minute after I did!</i>

103
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,679
<i>Could it be that Mikami did
the same thing at that time?!</i>

104
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,934
G- God, I thought that you were being
watched and couldn't take action...

105
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,855
I thought it was my job to take care
of Takada in a situation like that...

106
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,357
<i>Idiot!</i>

107
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,652
<i>I've been giving you orders to not
make any unnecessary moves until today!</i>

108
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,654
That's right.

109
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,366
On the 26th, right after Takada's
kidnapping was broadcast...

110
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,868
Mikami went to the bank...

111
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,037
According to my findings,

112
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,540
Mikami goes to the bank
every month on the 25th.

113
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,585
It is very odd for someone
as methodical as Mikami

114
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,003
to go there for two days in a row.

115
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,174
I followed Mikami to
a safe deposit box.

116
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,010
It was only at this time that

117
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,346
Mikami seemed nervous about
someone possibly following him...

118
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,975
It was easy to open the safe.

119
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,434
Inside it...

120
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,314
The real notebook was there and
Takada's name was written in it...

121
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,234
Light Yagami.

122
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,863
You didn't notice that Mikami
took the liberty and made a move...

123
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,367
because you had just killed her
with a clipping from the notebook...

124
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:18,081
This is when I noticed the possibility
of a fake notebook...

125
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,583
Thanks to Mello...

126
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,128
who was the one
who created this situation.

127
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,424
<i>Mello may have known about it...</i>

128
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,387
<i>...by having his name
written in the notebook?</i>

129
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,888
Yes...

130
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,726
Then I guess I'm going to
have to do it.

131
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,105
Mello knew...

132
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:48,528
He knew that alone, we aren't able
to attain our goal, to surpass L.

133
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,947
But together...

134
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,575
Together we can stand with L.

135
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,952
Together we can surpass L!

136
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,581
And right now, we are
confronting Kira who defeated L...

137
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,624
with solid evidence!

138
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,673
Let's see you talk your way
out of this if you can.

139
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,126
That's right...

140
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,839
I'm Kira.

141
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,562
That's right. I'm Kira.

142
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,066
So what are you going to do?

143
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,569
Are you going to kill me here?

144
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,575
Listen... I'm Kira.

145
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,077
And...

146
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,039
I'm the god of the new world!

147
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,253
Kira is the law of
the world right now.

148
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,630
Kira is maintaining order.

149
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,341
I am now Justice.

150
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,136
The human race and
the world's only hope.

151
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,346
Are you going to kill me?

152
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,724
Is that really the right thing to do?

153
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,063
Since Kira appeared six years ago...

154
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:51,651
wars have stopped and global crime rates
have decreased by 70 percent.

155
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,863
But the world is still rotten!

156
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,532
There are too many
rotten people...

157
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,037
Someone's got to do it.

158
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,668
From the moment I got hold of
the notebook, I knew I had to do it!

159
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,547
No, I was the only one
who could do it!

160
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,759
I know that killing people
is a crime...

161
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,598
But this is the only way
to fix the world!

162
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,600
This is a duty given to me!

163
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,729
I'm the only one who can do this!

164
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,692
Could anyone else have done it?!
Could they have done this much?!

165
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,194
Could they have continued on?!

166
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,323
That's right...

167
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,913
I'm the only one who can
create the new world...

168
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,922
No. You are just a murderer.

169
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,636
And this notebook is
the worst murder weapon in history.

170
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,765
You've yielded to the power
of the Shinigami and the notebook.

171
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,101
You're just a crazy serial killer

172
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,437
who has confused himself with a god.

173
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,814
That's all you are...

174
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,026
Nothing more, nothing less.

175
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,170
<i>They're all fools who don't understand.</i>

176
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,021
Near.

177
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,566
The notebook you have right now,
and the notebook that

178
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,612
Aizawa brought from the Japanese
Task Force Headquarters...

179
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,240
Are they real?

180
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,326
<i>Is he blufﬁng now?</i>

181
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,913
Only I know where
the real notebook is...

182
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,127
If you're going to defeat Kira...

183
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,130
even if it's just to test out
the notebook that Aizawa's carrying...

184
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,803
you should write either
my name or Mikami's in it.

185
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,435
To see if the notebook is real...

186
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,563
or fake!

187
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,107
He's hidden
a piece of the notebook!

188
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,862
Matsuda!

189
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,869
You idiot!

190
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,913
Matsuda! Who do you think
you're shooting at?!

191
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,249
Stop messing around!

192
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,919
What was it all for?

193
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,965
What in the world did
your dad die for?

194
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:02,633
Dad?!

195
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,928
Oh, you mean Soichiro Yagami?!

196
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,264
That's right, Matsuda!

197
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,309
Overly earnest people with
a strong sense of justice like him

198
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,643
are always going to lose.

199
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,313
Are you okay with
a world like that?!

200
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,941
Kill the others if you understand!

201
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,110
Shoot!

202
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,906
You let your father die...

203
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,825
How can you act as if
it were nothing?!

204
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,624
He's writing with his blood!

205
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,465
I'm going to kill you!

206
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,675
We have to kill him!

207
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,344
Matsuda!

208
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,242
Damn it...

209
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,370
What... the hell is this?!

210
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,877
Mikami... What are you doing?!

211
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,046
Write!

212
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,175
Kill.. them!

213
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,224
Near, it's finally over, isn't it?

214
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,268
Yes.

215
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,107
What happened to Misa?!

216
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,818
What about Takada?!

217
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,034
<i>S- Somebody...</i>

218
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,540
<i>What in the world should I...?</i>

219
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,681
M- Mikami is...

220
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,269
Stop the bleeding!

221
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,562
No, but...

222
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,522
There's nothing we can do...

223
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,331
Light!

224
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,502
Light! Wait!

225
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,628
Mr. Aizawa!

226
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,465
He probably doesn't have
any more notebooks hidden.

227
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,801
He can't go very far
with those wounds.

228
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,638
He'll stop on his own
if we leave him alone.

229
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,184
Near, I'm not taking your orders.

230
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,356
I understand. I'll leave it to you.

231
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,624
<i>You lose, Light.</i>

232
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,044
<i>I told you when we ﬁrst met,</i>

233
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,381
<i>that I'd be the one writing
your name...</i>

234
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,717
<i>in my notebook when you die.</i>

235
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,305
<i>That's the rule between</i>

236
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,265
<i>the Shinigami who brings the notebook
into the Human Realm...</i>

237
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,521
<i>and the ﬁrst human
who picks up the notebook.</i>

238
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,693
<i>If they put you in prison,
who knows when you'll die?</i>

239
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,780
<i>And that would be too much of
a pain to wait around for.</i>

240
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,034
<i>It's all over for you.</i>

241
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,914
<i>You should die right here.</i>

242
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:37,718
<i>We were able to ease each other's
boredom for a long time.</i>

243
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,726
<i>It was a lot of fun.</i>

244
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,019
LIGHT YAGAMI
