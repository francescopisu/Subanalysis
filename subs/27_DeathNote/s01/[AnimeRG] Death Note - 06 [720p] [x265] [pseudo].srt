<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,323
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,242
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:39,748
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:48,340
<i>The ending</i>

00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,635

<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,641
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,521
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,859
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,363
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:17,327
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,339
UNRAVELING

17
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:41,852
lam L.

18
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,520
<i>He's L?</i>

19
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,189
<i>He's different
from what I imagined...</i>

20
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,945
I am Detective Superintendent Yagami
of the National Police Agency.

21
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,655
Uh, I'm Matsuda.

22
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,948
I'm Aizawa.

23
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,658
- I'm Mogi.
- I'm Ukita.

24
00:01:58,577 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm sorry we're late.

25
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,622
These five are our current...

26
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,831
Bang!

27
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,124
What...?

28
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,208
Is this some kind of joke?

29
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,131
Mr. Soichiro Yagami,
if I were Kira you would be dead.

30
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:18,388
You already know that all Kira needs
is a face and a name, don't you?

31
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,350
Please don't give out
your names so carelessly.

32
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,977
Let's value our lives.

33
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,148
I've heard about him needing a face,

34
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,193
but I haven't heard anything
about him needing a name?

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,741
Criminals whose names were unknown or
whose names were broadcast incorrectly

36
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,701
were all spared.

37
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,663
It was discussed at
task force headquarters.

38
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,832
Let's not stand around and chat,
please come right this way.

39
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,501
Oh, yes.

40
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,419
Please turn off
all cell phones, laptops,

41
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:53,090
and other electronic devices and
place them on that table.

42
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,761
L, do you think that
we'd have our phones on

43
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,429
to leak information?

44
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,098
<i>Just do as he says.</i>

45
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,685
I know he's cautious, but...

46
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,187
I still can't tell if he trusts us or not.

47
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:13,026
No, I just can't stand it when people's
cell phones go off when I'm talking.

48
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,445
Let me start by saying...

49
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:20,409
Please do not take any notes on anything
we say here at this headquarters.

50
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,202
Keep all of it in your head.

51
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,747
Please, sit wherever you like.

52
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,957
Okay.. -

53
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,605
Um, L...

54
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,735
When you refer to me from now on
I wish to be called Ryuzaki, not L.

55
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,403
Just to be safe.

56
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,655
Oh, then, Ryuzaki...

57
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,450
If you know that a face and
a name are needed,

58
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,328
then couldn't we cut down the number
of victims by censoring crime reports?

59
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,457
If we do that, then ordinary people
would be killed.

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,001
- Ordinary people?
- Why?

61
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,672
Kira's childish and hates to lose...

62
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,174
Childish...?

63
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,675
And hates to lose?

64
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:24,264
Yes. I'm also childish and
hate to lose... That's why I know.

65
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,641
Ryuzaki...

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,853
Could you explain that
a little more clearly?

67
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,691
When I used the TV broadcast
to challenge Kira...

68
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,196
...up until then, we thought that
Kira only went after criminals.

69
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,282
But he didn't hesitate
to kill my double.

70
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,870
Also, as soon as I said
he was in the Kanto region...

71
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,540
He started concentrating on
and killing Japanese criminals

72
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,375
as if to say, "So what if I am?"

73
00:04:55,921 --> 00:05:00,175
He's met each of my challenges
without flinching.

74
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,636
What do you think would happen

75
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,556
if we tried to use media restrictions to
hide criminals from someone like this?

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,183
Well...

77
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,477
"if you won't give me your criminals,

78
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,189
"then I'll kill those who've commited
lesser crimes or even the innocent!

79
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:19,402
"The whole world is my hostage!
I'm not the evil one.

80
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,907
"Those who oppose me
and hide evil-doers are!"

81
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,411
That is Kira's mental process.

82
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,080
Speaking of the mass media,

83
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,541
let's think of ways we can
use it to our advantage.

84
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,750
For example?

85
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,752
How about this...

86
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,339
"U.S. furious over deaths of FBI agents. "

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,675
"World outraged over Kira's antics,

88
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,512
"the leading nations send a total
of 1,500 investigators into Japan. "

89
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,599
It would be different from
his recent experience with the FBI.

90
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,853
He would begin to see everyone
as a threat.

91
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,274
When he's feeling cornered,
it should illicit some sort of response.

92
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,110
T- That's interesting...

93
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,197
When in reality there's only seven,
we make him think there's 1,500?!

94
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,368
And unlike the FBI agents,
they don't exist and they can't be killed!

95
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,703
This could work!

96
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,708
Well then, I'll tell you my thoughts
on the Kira case.

97
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,712
Kira works alone...

98
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,215
He was accessing inside information
from the investigation before...

99
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,302
Why do you believe he's working alone?

100
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,553
Aizawa, wait.

101
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,389
Let's listen to Ryuzaki's
entire theory first.

102
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,726
Kira needs a name and face to kill.

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,729
To a certain degree, he can even
control the victim's time of death

104
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,981
and the actions the victim
takes before their death.

105
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,568
With all of that in mind...

106
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,238
Please listen closely to the following.

107
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,242
On December 14,

108
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,412
twelve FBI agents
entered Japan.

109
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,457
December 19...

110
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,169
Kira began using prisoners
to conduct tests

111
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,088
on the actions a victim
can take before death.

112
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,508
12/19 TEST 12/14 FBI ENTER JAPAN

113
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,349
Because he didn't know
their faces or names,

114
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,351
in order to eliminate
all of the FBI agents...

115
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:19,189
He had to see how far he could
control the deaths of his victims.

116
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,651
Finally, on December 27...

117
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,528
<i>After making sure the FBI agents
received the ﬁle</i>

118
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,282
<i>with all the names and faces
of the other agents,</i>

119
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,451
<i>I succeeded in killing all of them.</i>

120
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,538
<i>It is nearly impossible to
ﬁgure out whose ﬁles Kira saw...</i>

121
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,958
<i>But...</i>

122
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,129
<i>I can't let anyone know that
I made contact with Raye Penber.</i>

123
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,715
<i>12/20 BUS</i>

124
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,303
Huh? You're not using
the Death Note today?

125
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,389
Are you studying
for the entrance exams?

126
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,809
It's no use studying
for those at this point.

127
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,978
Oh? So what is it?

128
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,400
I worked the most between
December 19 and 27.

129
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:09,489
<i>Within this time, 23 people died
of heart attacks as we all know.</i>

130
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,910
They were all wanted criminals,
ex-convicts...

131
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,663
And people who were
suspected of crimes.

132
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,083
People obviously different
from those Kira usually targets.

133
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,751
Indeed.

134
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,213
It means that in order to
kill the FBI agents,

135
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,341
he needed to control those
with even lesser crimes.

136
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,513
<i>He killed 23 people,
so we couldn't tell who he used.</i>

137
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,391
He actually probably only used a few.

138
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,936
He left eight days after the tests

139
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,189
to allow the FBI to gather
information on other suspects.

140
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,858
He wanted to draw attention
away from himself.

141
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,611
Thus, I suspect that Kira
was one of the people

142
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:54,534
who was being investigated by the FBI
between the 14th and the 19th.

143
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,955
This is data from the FBI.

144
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,708
It contains other important information.

145
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,878
You can't take these out
of this room, but...

146
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,129
Amazing!

147
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,380
This is amazing!

148
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,965
If we have this much information,

149
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,884
we can do more
than enough on our own.

150
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,303
Let's split into two groups.
One will trace the FBI agents,

151
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,722
and the other will investigate
the heart attack victims.

152
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,601
There are only a few people who
had access to info from HQ,

153
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,480
and who were beings investigated
by the FBI in the first five days!

154
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,647
Yeah...

155
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,609
So, does anyone have any questions?

156
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,946
Well then, Ryuzaki,
I have a question.

157
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,742
You said earlier that you hate to lose.

158
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,661
But you've shown us your face.

159
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,122
Doesn't that mean that you've
already lost to Kira?

160
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,166
That's correct.

161
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,959
The fact that I've shown my face

162
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,838
<i>and that I've sacrificed
twelve FBI agents are both losses.</i>

163
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,508
But I will win in the end.

164
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,594
This is the first time
I've laid my life on the line.

165
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,681
Let's show Kira that
we're willing to risk our lives...

166
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,103
Because justice will definitely prevail.

167
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,355
T- That's right...

168
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,023
Justice will prevail!

169
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,191
Let's give it our best!

170
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,360
Let's do this, Ryuzaki!

171
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,323
<i>When I ﬁrst saw him,
I was suspicious, but...</i>

172
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,783
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

173
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,660
<i>This man is L.</i>

174
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,831
First off, in order to make sure
Kira isn't among us,

175
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,792
I would like to talk to each of
you individually.

176
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,877
Huh? Oh, yeah.

177
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,213
So he doesn't trust us...

178
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,340
It's understandable.

179
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,469
If Kira was in the task force HQ
in the beginning, gathering info...

180
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,888
chances are high that
he's still here.

181
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,682
' get n!

182
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,476
And if he remained
he's seen Ryuzaki's face.

183
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,062
Even this is a risk, huh?

184
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,815
<i>Things have been going well so far.</i>

185
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,237
<i>If only I had one more thing,
just one more decisive clue...</i>

186
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,407
<i>If there was just one thing I missed...</i>

187
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,577
<i>Just one piece of evidence
that would come to light...</i>

188
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,246
<i>It could cost me my life.</i>

189
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,665
<i>- Just one thing...
- Just one thing...</i>

190
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,106
Did you finish studying?

191
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,774
Yeah.

192
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,276
<i>It's all right.</i>

193
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,527
<i>There wasn't anything I missed.</i>

194
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,281
<i>My biggest gamble was
the bus-jacking incident, but...</i>

195
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,701
<i>It is impossible to
connect it with Kira.</i>

196
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,120
<i>The police and L don't know</i>

197
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,957
<i>that Kira can kill people with
means other than heart attacks.</i>

198
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,753
<i>But if anyone were to
discover that fact,</i>

199
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,880
<i>it would be a huge problem for me.</i>

200
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,424
What? Right now?

201
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,469
Dad's been pulling all nighters.
He needs clean clothes.

202
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,095
You've got to give this to him.

203
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,265
I promised I'd go to the first
New Year's Shrine Visit with my friends!

204
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,308
I'll go.

205
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,809
I could use a break.

206
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,061
How lucky!

207
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,812
Thank you, Light!

208
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,399
That means that you can
spy on the Police Department.

209
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,818
I'll only be able to go as far as
the reception though.

210
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,909
Oh? You're bringing a page?

211
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,786
Killing someone out there?

212
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,747
Lately, I've been doing
this when I go out.

213
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:28,998
Just in case.

214
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,171
<i>That day...</i>

215
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,508
<i>Raye said that he was going to
go to Shinjuku.</i>

216
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,428
<i>On that same day,</i>

217
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,598
<i>there were four heart attacks
in the Shinjuku area.</i>

218
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,851
<i>And... a bus-jacking...</i>

219
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,854
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

220
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,398
<i>Kira can...</i>

221
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,736
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY AND
NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY COMMISSION

222
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,450
<i>kill in ways other than heart attacks.</i>

223
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,162
<i>The number you have just dialed...</i>

224
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,998
That's unusual for Dad...

225
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,128
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY AND
NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY COMMISSION

226
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,007
Please...

227
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,969
I must speak directly to someone
from the task force.

228
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,722
I've told you already,

229
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,017
there is no one in
the Kira Task Force Headquarters.

230
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,311
<i>There's no one at headquarters?</i>

231
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,522
<i>Dad's phone is off...
What's going on?</i>

232
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,025
Is there any way I can contact them?

233
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,986
It's something very important
regarding the Kira investigation.

234
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,821
<i>The Kira investigation?!</i>

235
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,702
Well, I'll try to call their headquarters
once more.

236
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,081
I'm Detective Superintendent
Soichiro Yagami's son, Light.

237
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,833
I brought a change of clothes
for my father,

238
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,252
but it doesn't look like he's here,
could you hold on these for him?

239
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,921
Sure. Light, I haven't seen you
around in a while.

240
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,174
Oh... sorry.
Umm...

241
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:06,054
Remember? We solved that
insurance murder with your advice.

242
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,514
I was the receptionist then, too.

243
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,100
Really, I'm sorry...

244
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,686
I just write my name here, right?

245
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,607
Does this mean that you're
going to help outwith the Kira case, too?

246
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,860
Yes, if all goes well,
I may be able to beat L.

247
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,779
<i>Beat L?</i>

248
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,740
Nobody's at headquarters.

249
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,034
Please trust me on this.

250
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,203
I'll be sure to give them
your message.

251
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,788
That won't do.

252
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,206
It must be in person.

253
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,415
Excuse me...

254
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,627
My father is the chief leading
the Kira investigation.

255
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,129
Do you want to leave
a message with me?

256
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,925
His cell phone is off,
so I can't tell him immediately.

257
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,719
But they're probably busy.

258
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,429
A bunch of FBI agents were killed,

259
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,225
and a lot of detectives quit the case
because they were afraid of Kira.

260
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,645
Light, you shouldn't be
telling civilians that...

261
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,107
People are already talking about it.

262
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,484
Besides, this person is trustworthy.

263
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,277
I can tell by looking at her eyes.

264
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,488
She's a very wise and careful person.

265
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,908
You've heard about the FBI incident,
and you figured out that

266
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,327
there's a problem within
the Japanese police force itself.

267
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,623
That's why you want to speak
directly to headquarters.

268
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,458
Did I get that right?

269
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,797
I'll probably get a call
from my father

270
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,091
once he gets the message
I left on his phone.

271
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,177
You can talk directly
to him at that time.

272
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,846
Is it all right?

273
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,347
Of course!

274
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,308
I can't give you my father's
cell phone number,

275
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,019
but you can use my phone.

276
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:41,441
Of course, it's no use if
you don't trust both of us...

277
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,361
<i>Who is this cheery guy?</i>

278
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,489
Thank you.

279
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,535
You've managed to lead
her along well, Light.

280
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,832
You're pretty brave.

281
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,334
To involve yourself in the Kira case.

282
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,211
Not at all...

283
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,338
You think that Kira is...

284
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:11,846
Um, may I ask what your name is?
My name is Light Yagami.

285
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,475
Light as in the character for "moon,"
and Yagami as in "night god. "

286
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,226
It's a strange name, isn't it?

287
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,645
I'm Shoko Maki.

288
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,898
Shoko for "shining child,"

289
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,025
and Maki as in "space" and "tree. "

290
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,818
Ms. Maki, right?

291
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,241
Ms. Maki, I think that Kira's powers...

292
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,245
enable him to control
his victims before he kills them.

293
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,747
I- I thought so too...!

294
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,083
That's exactly what I was thinking!

295
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,920
Kira can control the actions
of a person before death.

296
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,213
But that's not all...

297
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,256
If my analysis is correct...

298
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,385
Kira can also kill people in
Ways other than heart attacks.

299
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,014
<i>Who is this woman?</i>

300
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,559
I don't think anyone's noticed yet...

301
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,563
But I think this is what's
going to catch Kira.

302
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,359
I hadn't even thought about that.

303
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,361
But if that's the case,

304
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,613
Kira would make sure not to
give his victims heart attacks

305
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,698
when he's intent on hiding a murder.

306
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,744
Yes, someone I know
may have met Kira.

307
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,120
Met Kira?!

308
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,582
Sorry.

309
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,544
Meeting Kira is definitely something

310
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,629
that the police would have
a hard time believing.

311
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,091
Yes, that's why I have to
explain it in detail to

312
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,802
someone from
task force headquarters.

313
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,973
But wouldn't it be better if
that person spoke to them instead?

314
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,434
That person is no longer alive.

315
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,647
He was one of the FBI agents
who came to Japan.

316
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,652
<i>An FBI agent who met Kira...</i>

317
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,571
<i>C- Could it be?</i>

318
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,823
He was also my fiancé.

319
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,577
He said that he witnessed
a bus-jacking incident.

320
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,414
He probably met Kira
on that bus.

321
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,250
<i>Raye Penber!</i>

322
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,756
What's wrong?

323
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,425
Oh, nothing.

324
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,260
I'm sorry your fiancé's passed away.

325
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,599
So... what makes you think
he met Kira?

326
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,644
Eight days after the bus-jacking...

327
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,190
He died, along with
the other FBI agents.

328
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,779
That hijacker robbed
a bank two days earlier.

329
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,866
He died in an accident...

330
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,160
an unusual and rare set of events...

331
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,204
I think that Kira set up
the hijacking

332
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,875
to steal information from my fiancé...

333
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:51,339
in order to kill the FBI agents
who had come to Japan.

334
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,551
The hijacker died in an accident.

335
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,139
In other words, heart attacks aren't
the only way that Kira can kill.

336
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,071
The hijacker didn't die
of a heart attack.

337
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,033
So that's why you think that Kira can
kill by means other than heart attacks?

338
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,326
Yes.

339
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,829
I think that's a bit of a leap...

340
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,998
No, it's not.

341
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,378
I can't help but think that
the hijacker was being controlled by Kira.

342
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,088
Why?

343
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,048
I've been wondering about

344
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,592
the hijacking ever since
my fiancé told me about it.

345
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,512
I asked him about it more
when he was relaxed.

346
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,433
He didn't name any names,
but he did tell me this.

347
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:45,601
What did he say?

348
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,939
That he reluctantly showed
his FBI ID to someone.

349
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,028
It was a top-secret investigation

350
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,613
that the FBI kept secret from
the Japanese police.

351
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,408
He wasn't supposed to show his ID.

352
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,539
So whoever saw his ID was the one
who let slip that the FBI was in Japan.

353
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,625
<i>She really knows what
she's talking about!</i>

354
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,045
<i>So this would be the "one thing"
that Light was worrying about!</i>

355
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,630
I see.

356
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,384
It's a conclusion you came to
with your singular knowledge

357
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,636
and your desire to avenge your fiance.

358
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,722
You believe that Kira can
murder his victims

359
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,265
by means other than by heart attacks.

360
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,641
Yes.

361
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,059
You have some
amazing deductive skills,

362
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,769
but you can't deny you have
personal interests in this case.

363
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,646
Your argument seems a bit forced.

364
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,485
But... this theory is definitely
worth investigating.

365
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,946
Your testimony will be
very important to the case.

366
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,573
Y- Yes.

367
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,661
If what you said is correct,
Kira should be caught soon...

368
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,496
Because...

369
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:53,127
Kira was the one your fiancé
showed his ID to on that bus.

370
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,087
Yes.

371
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,344
<i>That was close...</i>

372
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,683
<i>If this woman had told the police
all this before she told me...</i>

373
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,980
<i>It seems like a god other
than a Shinigami</i>

374
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,150
<i>is on my side.</i>

375
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,118
TO BE CONTINUED

376
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:31,916
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

377
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:37,338
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

378
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,883
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

379
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:46,347
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

380
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:52,728
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

381
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:57,316
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

382
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:02,988
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

383
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,784
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

384
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,454
<i>To accomplish</i>

385
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:21,549
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

386
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:26,428
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

387
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:32,226
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

388
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,898
PREVIEW

389
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,902
I want to see how
this woman dies,

390
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,280
but I can't be caught
following her.

391
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,951
Go on, hurry to your death!

392
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,495
OVERCAST
