00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,653

00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,697
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

17
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,699
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

18
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:19,496
<i>Are you worried?</i>

19
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,089
KIRA'S IDENTITY

20
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,136
<i>The victim was Mr. H...</i>

21
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,391
at someone's face like Second Kira...

22
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,226
Matsuda will die.

23
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,608
<i>It's him!</i>

24
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,612
Don't screw around! Remember
the names of the people you hire!

25
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,323
<i>I still have two hours.</i>

26
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,962
I've confirmed Higuchi.

27
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,590
He's only got a bag on him.
I'm going after him.

28
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,259
<i>I will... kill him...</i>

29
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,554
<i>Everything will be mine!</i>

00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,807

<i>Cosme Misa...</i>

00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,727
<i>Devilish charm...</i>

33
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,314
<i>Angelic shine...</i>

34
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,236
<i>- Misa's winning rouge...
- The commercial's going to end, Ryuzaki.</i>

35
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,030
Oh, really?

36
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,163
<i>If I reveal too much detail,</i>

37
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,000
<i>the people who were there
will know who Kira is...</i>

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>So... I can't say any more.</i>

39
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,590
<i>Yes. Let's save that
revelation until the end.</i>

40
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:58,637
Make speaker one Higuchi's car
and speaker two Sakura TV.

41
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,599
Higuchi's glued to
the TV in his car.

42
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>According to what you said earlier,
you've met Kira?</i>

43
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:11,483
<i>Yes. But at that time,
I didn't know who Kira was.</i>

44
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,696
I think it takes
a lot of courage to appear

45
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,989
<i>even though he's seen your face...</i>

46
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,157
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

47
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,827
<i>Yes. As I was investigating,</i>

48
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,622
<i>I discovered the two things
that Kira needs to kill.</i>

49
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,750
<i>There are many rumors as
to what they might be,</i>

50
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,919
<i>but I've found out for sure.</i>

51
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,422
<i>A face and a name...</i>

52
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,718
<i>But Kira only knows one
of those things about me.</i>

53
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,262
<i>He feels safe enough to step forward
because he thinks he won't be killed</i>

54
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,514
<i>just because I don't know
his real name, huh?</i>

55
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,810
<i>Does that mean that there's nothing
remaining that connects him to his name?</i>

56
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,730
<i>If he already took his records
into account...</i>

57
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,773
<i>does that mean it's pointless
to go to Yoshida Productions?</i>

58
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,985
Rem... What do you think?

59
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,904
What do I think? About what?

60
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,948
Who's Rem?

61
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,200
He's in his car by himself.

62
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,661
I don't think that there's
anyone else in that car.

63
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,205
He isn't using his cell phone either.

64
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,374
Could it be a radio or
something?

65
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,919
No. There's no radio in that car.

66
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,506
Only our wire-taps, cameras,
and tracking devices.

67
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,967
That was Wedy's job,
so I'm completely sure of it.

68
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,470
Could it be that there won't be
a record on him

69
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,013
even if I go to Yoshida Productions?!

70
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,515
Is he talking to himself?

71
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,853
There's no way I would know.

72
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,064
If he's smart,
he would've destroyed everything

73
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,692
that connected him to his name
before appearing on TV.

74
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,779
Also, don't you think that
it's suspicious

75
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,448
for Yoshida Productions to just
let me into their offices?

76
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,912
No, in this case, if there was a robbery,
the culprit would be me...

77
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,122
This sounds kind of bad...

78
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,750
It's all right. He'll go.

79
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,127
Even if he does have a record
at Yoshida Productions,

80
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,630
what if it's filed under an alias?

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,760
Yes, there's a big possibility
that he'd go that far...

82
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,722
<i>It's probably Light and Misa's plan</i>

83
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,225
<i>to have Higuchi go
to Yoshida Productions...</i>

84
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,646
But if he knows that you're Kira,

85
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,315
then he'll end up announcing
your name.

86
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,067
That is an inescapable fact.

87
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,320
<i>All right, there's only an hour
left until the announcement.</i>

88
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,656
You have to go.

89
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,284
Whether there's an alias on
his record or not...

90
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,995
there's no way that
you'll be suspected

91
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,622
if you kill him with
the Death Note.

92
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,083
Yeah. I know.

93
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,001
<i>But just in case,</i>

94
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,671
<i>I should kill the people I called
from Yoshida Productions,</i>

95
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,507
<i>Misa, and her manager.</i>

96
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,260
What?! No way, he said he'll kill me!

97
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,681
It's all right. He means after
he's killed Mr. Matsuda.

98
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,434
There's no point for him to do
that unless he's killed Mr. Matsuda.

99
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,061
That's true, but...

100
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,065
Think hard. You only have to kill him.

101
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,860
If you kill the people whom
you just called,

102
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,988
your call history
will implicate you.

103
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,199
Oh yeah...
Rem, you're really smart...

104
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,620
I'll kill them after
I erase my call history.

105
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,790
But the telephone company
will still have a record of it.

106
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,501
He can't be talking to himself...

107
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,504
Who's "Rem"? Who is he talking to?

108
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,133
If he is talking to someone,
it would have to be with...

109
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,886
A Shinigami...

110
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,639
“perhaps?

111
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,059
<i>Maybe I should ask him...</i>

112
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,980
How about returning ownership
of the notebook to me?

113
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,734
No. That would only
end miserably for me.

114
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,069
He says he has proof.

115
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,907
If he were to highlight
Yotsuba's growth,

116
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,785
no one would doubt him.

117
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,247
The person he says is Kira
will be marked as Kira.

118
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:59,419
Even if he doesn't have clear proof,
my life will be over...

119
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,171
I won't be promoted.

120
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,131
I won't even be able
to stay with Yotsuba...

121
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,091
<i>We, at Sakura,
have structured this show</i>

122
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:09,679
<i>under the premise that
Kira is watching.</i>

123
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,307
<i>I will now speak directly to Kira...</i>

124
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,393
<i>Kira, turn yourself in.</i>

125
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>He acts like an idiot,</i>

126
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,192
<i>but earlier, he faked his own death
by making it seem like he died...</i>

127
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,111
<i>I've got to kill him.</i>

128
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,492
He's arrived at Yoshida Productions.

129
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,369
It's about to begin...

130
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,388
<i>To the left of the entrance...</i>

131
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,100
<i>In the desk farthest back...</i>

132
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,604
<i>In the bottom drawer...</i>

133
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,580
MANAGER
TAICHIRO YAMASHITA

134
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,751
<i>Now then, show me how you kill!</i>

135
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,589
I'm ready to apprehend Higuchi.

136
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,259
- Just give me the signal.
- All right.

137
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,096
TAICHIRO YAMASHITA

138
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,813
It's no good! He just made a note
of his name and is leaving.

139
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,314
He's not going to kill him here?

140
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,775
Ryuzaki! Shall I apprehend him?

141
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,445
I still don't know how he kills.

142
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,823
He might do something in his car.

143
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,950
Turn monitor one to Higuchi's car.

144
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,752
Higuchi is awfully calm despite wanting
to kill Matsuda as soon as possible...

145
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,628
You're right.

146
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,130
If he needed a name,

147
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,840
then he should have taken
the personnel file with him...

148
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,301
But he just put it back
in the drawer.

149
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,513
<i>36... 37... 38...</i>

150
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,890
<i>39...</i>

151
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,641
<i>40 seconds...</i>

152
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,188
<i>Kira is a murderer,
so I cannot forgive him.</i>

153
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,857
Damn it! Why isn't he dead?!

154
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,651
What does that mean?!
He said, "why isn't he dead?"

155
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,488
Did he already try to kill?

156
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,240
Was writing his name all
he had to do to kill?

157
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,367
What are you going to do?

158
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,244
Are you going to just
keep watching what he does?

159
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,829
It seems like he can will
a person to die

160
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,539
with just that person's name...

161
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>What's going on?</i>

162
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,169
<i>I can't determine how
he kills people...</i>

163
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,547
<i>But if I try to restrain him now
and try to get him to confess...</i>

164
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,509
<i>There are only ﬁfty minutes
until the Kira announcement!</i>

165
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,928
Damn! I don't have any time!

166
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,888
He's making a phone call.

167
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,681
He's probably trying Misa again.

168
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,975
You're right!

169
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,854
C'mon!

170
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,275
<i>I know his face...</i>

171
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,152
<i>If I go back to the ofﬁce,</i>

172
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,155
<i>there should be surveillance camera
videos of him sneaking in...</i>

173
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,574
<i>If I just had the Shinigami eyes...</i>

174
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,369
<i>Half of my remaining life, huh?</i>

175
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:24,040
<i>But if he makes the announcement,
my life is ﬁnished.</i>

176
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,335
<i>Well then, better to have a life
that's short and sweet.</i>

177
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,340
Rem. Let's make the deal.

178
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,928
Deal? Who is this "Rem"
he's been talking to all this time?

179
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,723
Could Kira's power be
from heaven or something?

180
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,226
I don't want to think
that's the case.

181
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,353
Then what is Rem?

182
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,480
A Shinigami?

183
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,650
At any rate, we should watch him.

184
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,069
It looks like we can
still find out more.

185
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,446
We may be able to
find out how he kills.

186
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,661
<i>Now I'm unstoppable...</i>

187
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,205
<i>With this, I have unlimited options.</i>

188
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,877
I'm going after him!

189
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,634
<i>Stop your car!
Pull over to the side of the road.</i>

190
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,803
<i>Pull over and stop!</i>

191
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,561
This is bad. Higuchi has been
caught by a motorcycle policeman.

192
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,271
<i>I'm going to pass him by.</i>

193
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,772
<i>I'll leave this to Aiber
and the others.</i>

194
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,942
You were speeding.
Show me your driver's license!

195
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,944
Yeah... all right.

196
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,280
All screens on Higuchi's car...

197
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,742
<i>Where did I put my license...?</i>

198
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,205
<i>I can't waste time
sticking around here.</i>

199
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,789
YUKITO SHIRABA ACCIDENT

200
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,418
Hey!

201
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,962
Higuchi ditched the motorcycle cop
and is on the run!

202
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,550
What a bastard!

203
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,385
This is highway patrol...

204
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,978
The motorcycle cop just
rear-ended a truck! It's a collision!

205
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,147
A collision?! An accidental death?

206
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,649
This is bad.

207
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,318
<i>Higuchi put his hand in his bag...</i>

208
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,820
<i>Did he do something then?</i>

209
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,406
<i>No, that aside, how did he obtain</i>

210
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,575
<i>the name of that
motorcycle cop?</i>

211
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,870
<i>Could it be that he killed him by
looking at his face like the Second Kira?</i>

212
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,456
Rem... Deal...

213
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,293
<i>No... If he could kill by just
looking at someone's face...</i>

214
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,088
<i>he should have immediately
killed Mr. Matsuda.</i>

215
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,049
<i>What's going on? But...</i>

216
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,637
Everyone! It's too dangerous to
allow further action by Higuchi!

217
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,055
We will proceed to capture him.

218
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,891
Higuchi is now able to kill just
by looking at someone's face,

219
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,851
like the Second Kira.

220
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,105
We will capture him
with that in mind!

221
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,668
Watari, connect me to
the Director of the NPA.

222
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,919
<i>Yes.</i>

223
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,923
<i>This is L. We have narrowed down
Kira to a single person.</i>

224
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,385
<i>Currently, he's heading from
Hibiya to Shibuya</i>

225
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,430
<i>on Highway Route One in
a red sports car.</i>

226
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,890
We shall capture him.

227
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,894
So please instruct all units
not to approach that car.

228
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,732
Dad, after the next commercial,
commence stage seven.

229
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,275
All right.

230
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,861
Demegawa, during
the next commercial,

231
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,654
switch Matsuda and
the emcee with mannequins...

232
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,531
We'll make it seem as if
the broadcast is still continuing

233
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,742
using the audio we've prepared.

234
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,037
We'll leave the cameras
and everyone will withdraw.

235
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,415
Then Yagami, shall we go?

236
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,958
Yeah.

237
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,715
Sorry Misa, but I'm going to
restrain you for a while.

238
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,176
What?! What's this?!

239
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,761
Stop kidding around.

240
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,604
Ryuzaki, I never knew you
could pilot a helicopter.

241
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,105
It's just intuition...

242
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,570
Higuchi isn't heading
towards Sakura TV.

243
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,863
He's going the wrong way.

244
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,492
By his route, I'd say he's headed
to Yotsuba's main offices.

245
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,286
<i>That's incredible courage.</i>

246
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,497
<i>No, I just did what
was appropriate.</i>

247
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,540
<i>If I go to the main ofﬁces</i>

248
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,543
<i>and ﬁnd a surveillance video
with him on it, I can kill him...</i>

249
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,756
Wedy, everything relating to Matsuda
at Yotsuba's main offices

250
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,091
has been disposed of, right?

251
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,802
<i>Yes. Is he headed there?</i>

252
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,470
<i>How convenient.</i>

253
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,680
That'll give me time to
go ahead of him

254
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,724
and wait with Mr. Yagami.

255
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,773
<i>Damn it! He's nowhere!</i>

256
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,110
<i>No, he's been erased from
these videos...</i>

257
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,445
<i>Did he come and erase himself?</i>

258
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,990
<i>Or has someone betrayed me...</i>

259
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,494
<i>No, doing that would not
absolve them of their crimes.</i>

260
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,999
<i>At any rate, I don't have time.
I've got to hurry!</i>

261
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,963
<i>The time for the announcement
is fast approaching.</i>

262
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,342
<i>Yes. I feel like saying it already.</i>

263
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,554
<i>I understand your feelings, but...</i>

264
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,264
<i>We'll have just one more
commercial break right now...</i>

265
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,515
<i>Damn it!</i>

266
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,643
<i>I'll just have to go to
Sakura TV and kill him.</i>

267
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,608
Dad, Higuchi will arrive
at Sakura TV soon.

268
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,319
He'll be there in less than 15 minutes.
Are you all right?

269
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,656
I don't want my son to
ask me if I'm all right.

270
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,408
I'm all right, Light.

271
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,370
<i>Is there anything more you want to
say before the announcement?</i>

272
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:59,959
<i>Well... I want everyone to think
about Kira after he's caught.</i>

273
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,336
<i>- Mr. Yagami, it's almost time...
- Kira is definitely evil.</i>

274
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,713
Yeah...

275
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,881
Here...

276
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,051
Aiber hates guns,
so I'm the only one with one...

277
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:14,515
I'm no longer a police officer.
I'm not allowed to have this.

278
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,976
You're also not allowed to
use this in Japan.

279
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,271
Stubborn as usual, aren't you?

280
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,023
SAKURA TV

281
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,443
<i>I made it!</i>

282
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,621
<i>Why isn't anyone here?</i>

283
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,708
<i>Are they being careful because
they're broadcasting the truth?</i>

284
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,837
<i>Oh well, this'll be easier
since no one's here.</i>

285
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,550
We've arrived at Sakura TV.
I'm getting into position.

286
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,053
Let's go, Aiber.

287
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,387
Okay, Mogi!

288
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:58,601
<i>We're getting lots of phone calls
and faxes showing support...</i>

289
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,271
<i>for what you're doing here.</i>

290
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,692
<i>Even the studio is empty?</i>

291
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,738
<i>Still, I've got to watch out
for the television cameras.</i>

292
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,157
<i>I'm sorry,
but due to certain circumstances,</i>

293
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,784
<i>- we must end this program here.
- What?!</i>

294
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,912
<i>Mannequins!
No way?!</i>

295
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,956
Stop right there, Higuchi!

296
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,541
Don't move!

297
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,506
Give yourself up.

298
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,968
You must be making
some kind of mistake.

299
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,680
I have a meeting
with Mr. Demegawa and...

300
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,765
<i>They're wearing helmets.</i>

301
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,350
<i>They've taken precautions
against Kira.</i>

302
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,685
<i>In that case...</i>

303
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,063
I'm from Yotsuba Group's
development department...

304
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,815
Let me get you my card.

305
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,697
Chief!

306
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,533
Aiber!

307
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,954
<i>Damn it!
I didn't want to use this, but...</i>

308
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,212
Higuchi has a gun!
The Chief has been shot.

309
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,797
Higuchi is making an escape!

310
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,508
I'm all right. Sorry, Ryuzaki.

311
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,095
If we pursue him,
we can still catch him. Hurry!

312
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,764
This is bad.
He's escaped from Sakura TV!

313
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,692
We have no choice.

314
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,236
We shall proceed to capture
him as well.

315
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,572
Watari, are you ready?

316
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,282
- Yes...
- Yagami...

317
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,162
Hold on to this for self-defense.
It's Kira we're after.

318
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,915
No. Those aren't allowed
in Japan.

319
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,919
I'm sure Mr. Yagami
said the same thing.

320
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,171
Yeah...

321
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,182
What insane driving!

322
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,184
- Don't lose sight of him!
- Okay!

323
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,657
<i>What was going on earlier?</i>

324
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,200
<i>I can only think
that was a trap...</i>

325
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,204
<i>We now end our current broadcast
to bring you the news.</i>

326
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,667
<i>The program ended,
but I wasn't the one who ended it...</i>

327
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,002
<i>Damn it... Who in the...</i>

328
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,963
<i>What is this?!</i>

329
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,892
<i>So it was a trap...
Police cars with tinted windows?</i>

330
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:49,021
<i>So the police were
still going after Kira!</i>

331
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,401
What is going on? I told the police
not to take any action.

332
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,778
The only one who would do this is...

333
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,613
Yes... you're right.

334
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,265
<i>Damn it!
I'll go this way!</i>

335
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,394
Stop right there!

336
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,916
Don't come any closer!
Don't you come near me!

337
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,889
It's over...

338
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,225
Yes. It is...

339
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,951
