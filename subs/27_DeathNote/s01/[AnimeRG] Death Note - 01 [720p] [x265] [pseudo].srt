What?
Two death's heads again?

18
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,801
Hah! I win.
Don't hold it against me.

19
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,305
Hey Ryuk... Do you wanna join us?

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,641
Join us, for once.

21
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,812
No, I'm okay.

22
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,739
I didn't do anything
but he still got upset...

23
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:36,990
Really? And then?

24
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,159
What's the matter, Yagami?

25
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,120
Please translate the sentence.

26
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,919
Follow the teachings of God.

27
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,756
Then the blessings of the sea
will become bountiful...

28
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,509

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,521
No way! You went to see that?

44
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,066
It was such a waste of time.
I shoulda' asked for a refund!

45
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,693
Well, you did watch it...

46
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,899
<i>Death Note... Directly translated,
a notebook of death...</i>

47
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,612
<i>How to use it...</i>

48
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,115
<i>The human whose name is written
in this note...</i>

49
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,117
<i>shall die?</i>

50
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,704
<i>So stupid...</i>

51
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,041
<i>This is so sick.</i>

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,295
<i>It's no different
from a chain letter.</i>

53
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,924
<i>"The human whose name is written
in this note shall die... "? C 'mon.</i>

54
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,312
<i>Seriously...
something's the matter with me.</i>

55
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,526
<i>This note will not take effect
unless the writer</i>

56
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,237
<i>has the person's face in their mind
when writing his/her name. Therefore...</i>

57
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,241
<i>People sharing
the same name will not be affected.</i>

58
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,160
<i>If the cause of death is written</i>

59
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,579
<i>within 40 human seconds
of writing the person's name,</i>

60
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,081
<i>it will happen.</i>

61
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,749
<i>If the cause of death
is not specified,</i>

62
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,584
<i>the person will simply die
of a heart attack.</i>

63
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,628
<i>After writing the cause of death,</i>

64
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,214
<i>details of the death
should be written</i>

65
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,299
<i>in the next 6 minutes
and 40 seconds.</i>

66
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,847
So you can let people die
peacefully or make them suffer.

67
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,892
A prank this intricate
isn't too bad, I guess.

68
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,777
Write in their name and they die, huh...

69
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,613
This is so stupid!

70
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,881
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

71
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,134
<i>If someone actually dies,
does that make me a murderer?</i>

72
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,306
<i>No way. That's impossible.</i>

73
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,475
<i>The assailant who killed
six people yesterday...</i>

74
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,519
<i>at a busy shopping district
in Shinjuku...</i>

75
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,479
<i>has now taken
eight people hostage,</i>

76
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,399
<i>including children and teachers,
in this daycare center.</i>

77
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,276

00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,070
<i>as 42-year-old Kurou Otoharada,
unemployed.</i>

79
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,406

00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,629
<i>Well, that is not clear
at the moment.</i>

83
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,049
<i>You can't help but be worried
for the hostages right now.</i>

84
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,258
<i>Absolutely.</i>

85
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,719
<i>This has been a report
from the scene.</i>

86
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,179
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

87
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,640
<i>What do you think, Mr. Hashimoto?</i>

88
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,560
<i>Well, I'm hoping for
a quick resolution to this.</i>

89
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,855
<i>Oh well, nothing happened.</i>

90
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,608
<i>What did I expect?</i>

91
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,486
<i>Just a minute...</i>

92
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,321
<i>There seems to be
something happening.</i>

93
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,239
<i>The hostages are coming out!</i>

94
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,824
<i>They all seem to be all right!</i>

95
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,410
<i>And now it looks like
the SWAT team is entering!</i>

96
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,954
<i>Has the suspect been arrested?!</i>

97
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,164
<i>Yes!</i>

98
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,832
<i>We just received word</i>

99
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,293
<i>that the suspect has died
inside the daycare center!</i>

100
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,337
<i>The suspect is dead!</i>

101
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,964
Dead?!

KUROU OTOHARADA

103
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,260
<i>The police are strongly denying
that they shot the suspect!</i>

104
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,431
<i>Could he have felt cornered...
and committed suicide?</i>

105
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,602
<i>According to one of the hostages,
"the suspect suddenly collapsed. "</i>

106
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,020
<i>A heart attack...</i>

107
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,316
<i>N- No way...</i>

108
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,861
<i>This is a coincidence.
It's gotta be coincidence!</i>

109
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,613
Light!

110
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,785
It's almost 6:30. Don't you have
your prep course tonight?

111
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,413
Yeah, I'm getting ready now.

112
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,873
<i>Death Note...</i>

113
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,710
<i>But if this really works...</i>

114
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,921
<i>It's worth testing it out once more.</i>

115
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,508
<i>So I guess it will have
to be another criminal.</i>

116
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,219
<i>But it can't be someone
too famous.</i>

117
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,807
<i>If he dies, it's possible news
of it will be covered up.</i>

118
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,976
<i>I need an immediate result.</i>

119
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,437
Hey, Ryo baby!

120
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,397
W- What is it, Sudou?

121
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,733
Lend me some money...
2000 yen will do.

122
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,901
W- What? Again?

123
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:47,986
<i>Sudou...</i>

124
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,529
<i>- Shall I kill him?
- What? You refusing?</i>

125
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:54,159
<i>No, I'd better avoid
people around me.</i>

126
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,580
<i>No... Why should I worry?</i>

127
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:04,085
<i>No one would care if one or
two people like him died.</i>

128
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,172
Now we can go to
the arcade after school.

129
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,759
Maki, wanna party with
some guys tomorrow?

130
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,052
Absolutely!

131
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,261
Hey, me too!

132
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,680
Damn it, Mom!

133
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,099
She's not here to pick me up!

134
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,479
<i>Damn it... It's sickening.
Every single one of them...</i>

135
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,608
<i>I'd do society a favor
by killing them.</i>

136
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,986
Hey girl!

137
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,656
Wanna come and play with us?

138
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,618
Hey Taku!
You've got a beauty there!

139
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,120
I'm Takuo Shibuimaru.

140
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,663
Shibutaku, for short.

141
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,584
C'mon and join me... pretty girl.

142
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,294
I don't think so.

143
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,462
She doesn't think so!

144
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,506
She's so cute!

145
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,429
C'mon, grab her...
get those clothes off!

146
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,931
You sure?

147
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,433
S- Stop...!

148
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,060
Please!

149
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,812
Stop!

150
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,691
TAKUO SHIBUIMARU
ACCIDENTAL DEATH

151
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,069
<i>Now let's see...
What'll happen!</i>

152
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,156
Hey wait!

153
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,533
Taku! Watch out!

154
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,041
<i>This... This proves it!</i>

155
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,294
<i>The Death Note is real!</i>

156
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,046
Taku!

157
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,548
I- Idiot!

158
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,591
He just jumped out in front of me.

159
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,346
Now then...

160
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,223
I'd better get going.

161
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,738
It's been five days... since...

162
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,740
All right...

163
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,284
I'd better get going...

164
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,120
Huh? You going out, Ryuk?

165
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,165
This place is barren...
everywhere you go.

166
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,294
I dropped my Death Note.

167
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,381
You really messed up big time!

168
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,427
Hey, weren't you carrying around
a second one behind the old man's back?

169
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,470
You saying you lost both?

170
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,473
And do you know
where you dropped it?

171
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,350
The Human World.

172
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,518
- What?!
- What?

173
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:56,925
Welcome home.

174
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,718
You're early, Light.

175
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,345
Yeah.

176
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,722
I'm back, Mom.

177
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,519
Oh... The results of the national
practice entrance exams?

178
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,771
Hurry!

179
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,981
Here.

180
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,359
Goodness! Number one again!

181
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,402
You really did your best, Light!

182
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,779
Well yeah.

183
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,281
I'll be studying,
so don't interrupt me.

184
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,741
All right.

185
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,119
Oh Light...
Do you want anything?

186
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,913
Anything at all?

187
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,123
Not really, Mom.

188
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,212
<i>I already have what I want...</i>

189
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,024
You seem to like it.

190
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,659
Why so shocked?

191
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,997
I'm Ryuk, the Shinigami,
who dropped that notebook.

192
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,165
From what I just saw...

193
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,169
You're already aware that
it's no ordinary notebook.

194
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,760
A Shinigami... huh.

195
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,350
I'm not shocked, Ryuk.

196
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,355
In fact...
I've been waiting for you, Ryuk.

197
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,357
Oh?

198
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:41,738
I didn't think
a Shinigami's Notebook was real...

199
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:47,201
but after seeing its results,
I can act with certainty.

200
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,914
I see.
You've really surprised me...

201
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:58,379
I've heard of Death Notes getting down
to the Human World a few times before.

202
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,633
But you're the first one to use it
to this extent in just five days.

203
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,136
Most people would be
too scared to try it out.

204
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,764
I'm prepared, Ryuk.

205
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,309
I used the Death Note knowing
it belonged to a Shinigami.

206
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,144
And now the Shinigami's here.

207
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,229
So what'll happen to me?

208
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,981
Are you going to take my soul?

209
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,609
Huh? What's that about?

210
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,278
Is it some fantasy you humans
came up with?

211
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,656
I'm not going to do
anything to you.

212
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,452
Once the Death Note lands
in the Human World,

213
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,704
it belongs to the Human World.

214
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,083
In other words, that belongs to you.

215
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,418
It belongs to... me?

216
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,254
If you don't want it,
give it to some other human.

217
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,131
But if you do that,

218
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,051
all memory of the Death Note
will be erased from your mind.

219
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:50,098
So there isn't a price
for using the Death Note?

220
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,767
Well, if anything,
there's...

221
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,938
only the fear and pain humans who have
used the Death Note will experience.

222
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,982
And when you die...

223
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,946
I'll be the one to write
your name on my Death Note.

224
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,616
Don't think for a moment,
that any human...

225
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,786
who's used the Death Note
can go to Heaven or Hell.

226
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,455
That's all.

227
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,796
You'll find out about it
after you die.

228
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:26,968
Light...

229
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,386
Don't worry.

230
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,637
Go ahead.

231
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,182
What?

232
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,644
I brought some apples,
they're from our neighbor.

233
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,021
Why is it so dark in here?

234
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,648
You'll ruin your eyesight!

235
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,732
<i>What's going on?</i>

236
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,026
<i>Mom can't see him?</i>

237
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,365
That notebook...
originally belonged to me.

238
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:55,079
And since you're the one using it,
you're the only one who can see me...

239
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,456
and of course, only you...

240
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,999
Can hear my voice.

241
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,959
In other words,
the Death Note is a bond

242
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,129
between Light the human
and Ryuk the Shinigami.

243
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,134
Tasty.

244
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,303
Let me ask you one more thing.

245
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,513
Why did you choose me?

246
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,391
Hey, are you listening?

247
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,314
Hmm... apples in the
Human World are awesome.

248
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,692
What would you call them? Juicy?

249
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,277
Answer my question.

250
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,821
I didn't choose you.

251
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,449
I just dropped the notebook.

252
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,869
Did you think you were "chosen"
because you were smart?

253
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,204
Don't flatter yourself.

254
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,750
It just happened to fall around here...
and you just happened to pick it up.

255
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,210
That's all.

256
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,046
That's why I wrote the explanation
in English,

257
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,381
the most popular language
in the Human World.

258
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,217
Then why did you drop it?!

259
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,594
Don't tell me it was by mistake

260
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,013
after you went to the trouble and
wrote all those instructions.

261
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,265
Why'd I drop it?

262
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,684
...because I was bored.

263
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,312
Bored?

264
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,150
In fact, Shinigami these days
have so much time on their hands.

265
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,611
They're either taking a nap
or gambling.

266
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,615
If others see you studiously
scribbling names in the Death Note,

267
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,576
they'll say, "what are you working
so hard for?" and laugh at you.

268
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,497
Writing the names of other Shinigami
doesn't work.

269
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,250
But since we live
in the Shinigami Realm,

270
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,753
it's no fun at all to kill people
who live in the Human World!

271
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,258
So I figured it would be more fun
to come down here myself.

272
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,805
But you sure wrote a lotta names.

273
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,974
But Why'd you write down
the cause of death

274
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,434
only for that guy who
was hit by the truck?

275
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,937
Without the cause of
death written down,

276
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,438
they all die of heart attacks.

277
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,109
That's the best thing about
the Death Note, Ryuk.

278
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,989
I can write down
the names of the criminals...

279
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,491
and slowly reduce
the number of evil people.

280
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,368
What's the point?

281
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:02,415
Any fool can figure it out if someone
is just "eliminating the bad guys. "

282
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,085
I want the world to know...
of my existence!

283
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,463
And that there's someone
who is passing judgment onto them!

284
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:16,137
But... what's the point
in passing judgment?

285
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,638
Why do it?

286
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,642
I was bored... too.

287
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,689
Naturally, I didn't believe it at first.

288
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,234
But that Death Note has
the supernatural power...

289
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,612
to tempt people to want
to try it at least once.

290
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,033
<i>I- I killed them...</i>

291
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,287
<i>Two men- - - I killed them!</i>

292
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,708
<i>Human lives...
shouldn't be taken so lightly!</i>

293
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,378
<i>Do I have the right to
judge people like that?</i>

294
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,257
<i>No...</i>

295
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,717
<i>I'm not wrong!</i>

296
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,844
<i>I always thought about this...</i>

297
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,721
<i>The world is rotten!</i>

298
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,557
<i>And that rotten people
should die!</i>

299
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,559
<i>Someone...</i>

300
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,187
<i>Someone must do it!</i>

301
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,565
<i>Even if it means sacrificing
one's conscience and life!</i>

302
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,985
<i>Things can't stay... like this!</i>

303
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,073
<i>Even if someone else had
picked up the Death Note...</i>

304
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,868
<i>would they be able to erase
unwanted people from this world?</i>

305
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,495
<i>No way]</i>

306
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,248
<i>But I can... I can do it!</i>

307
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,544
<i>In fact, I'm the only one
who can do it!</i>

308
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,923
<i>And I will...
with the Death Note!</i>

309
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,717
<i>I'll change the world!</i>

310
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,757
At first, I kept writing the names
of criminals...

311
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,843
like I was cleaning up the world.

312
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,555
So that in time,
no one would do evil.

313
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,934
While those guilty ones who truly
deserved to be punished for their crimes,

314
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,602
die of heart attacks...

315
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,106
people who were immoral
or harass others

316
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,775
will slowly be erased through
illness or accidents.

317
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,447
Then the world would truly
move in the right direction.

318
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,620
And I would create a new world of
earnest, kind humans.

319
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,624
Then you'd be the only one left...
with a bad personality.

320
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,252
Huh? What're you saying?

321
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,754
Ryuk...

322
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:59,258
I'm probably the best,
most diligent honor student in Japan.

323
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,970
And I...

324
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,308
will become the god
of this new world!

325
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,229
<i>Humans...</i>

326
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,815
<i>are interesting, after all.</i>

327
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,493
TO BE CONTINUED

328
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,624
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see</i>

329
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:37,046
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

330
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,508
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

331
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:46,013
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

332
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:52,394
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

333
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:57,024
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

334
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:02,696
<i>I can't hold back
the flooding impulses</i>

335
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,367
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

336
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,954
<i>To accomplish</i>

337
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:20,965
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

338
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:26,095
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

339
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:31,767
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>
