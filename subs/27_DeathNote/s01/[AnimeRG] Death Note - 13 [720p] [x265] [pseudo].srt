<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,342
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:13,472
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:18,644
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,406
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,494
<i>I'm going the change</i>

7
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,831
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:48,382
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,718
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,972
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,604
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:08,026
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,321
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:17,411
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,007
CONFESSION

17
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:37,306
<i>Light, another message from
the Second Kira was sent to Sakura TV.</i>

18
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,766
<i>This time it's a video and a diary.</i>

19
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,185
<i>I thought I'd tell you.</i>

20
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,939
<i>A diary? He made another move?
That idiot.</i>

21
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,358
<i>Can't he just sit still a while?</i>

22
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,156
Did he want the diary to
be shown on TV?

23
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,949
Yeah. This is it.

24
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,122
<i>2006... Last year's diary?</i>

25
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,459
Please take a look at the thirtieth.

26
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,005
28TH SOMETHING BETTER THAN THE PZ2 IS COMING OUT, ITS
CALLED PZX. 30TH CONFIRMED OUR SHINIGAMI AT THE TOKYO DOME

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,842
<i>I'm pretty sure he's saying he wants
to do that on May 30...</i>

28
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,887
<i>If we air this,</i>

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,139
<i>the public will find that
that's what he plans to do.</i>

30
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,725
<i>Furthermore...</i>

31
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,186
<i>he can't see my Shinigami unless
he touches my notebook,</i>

32
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,812
<i>so how does he plan to do that?</i>

33
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,816
22ND MY FRIEND AND I SHOWED OFF
OUR NOTEBOOKS IN AOYAMA

34
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,694
Hey, Rem.

35
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,987
Hmm?

36
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,991
Why can't I see my own lifespan
even if I have the Shinigami eyes?

37
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,993
MISA AMANE

38
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,954
People who have Death Notes

39
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,707
only need to know the lifespan
of the people they kill.

40
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:50,379
Just like Shinigami can't see
the lifespan of other Shinigami...

41
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,299
people who hold a Death Note
can't see each other's lifespans.

42
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>May 22nd, My friend and I showed off
our notebooks in Aoyama.</i>

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,018
<i>If "notebook" means "Death Note,"</i>

44
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,521
<i>then it would only be understood
by me, Kira.</i>

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,564
<i>And the police...</i>

46
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,651
<i>will probably pay attention to
the May 30 entry which says,</i>

47
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,905
<i>"We confirmed our Shinigami
at the Tokyo Dome. "</i>

48
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:22,119
<i>I'm pretty sure that the "Aoyama" part
of the message is the real message...</i>

49
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,454
<i>But if that's the case...</i>

50
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,416
Light, what do you think?

51
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,294
<i>I shouldn't say anything carelessly.</i>

52
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,630
<i>I should watch
how he approaches this...</i>

53
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,343
Right now...
I can only say that he's an idiot.

54
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,970
He is, isn't he?

55
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,473
It's obvious that he wants to
meet Kira at the home game.

56
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,685
Doesn't he understand that
if we air this there'll be a panic

57
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,855
and the game will be canceled?

58
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,858
To be honest, it's so stupid...

59
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,404
That I'm not sure how to
deal with it...

60
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,283
If the diary is broadcast,

61
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,954
then we'll have to announce that
the game on the 30th is canceled.

62
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,167
But if we don't, the Second Kira
won't make a move.

63
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,419
But if he gets angry that
we cancelled the game,

64
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,628
there's no telling what he'll do...

65
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,672
That's all right.

66
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,509
The Second Kira
seems to revere Kira.

67
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,638
He promised the Kira we created,
that he'd refrain from killing excessively.

68
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,182
We can believe that.

69
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,812
Anyway, we'll air the diary and announce
the cancellation of the game...

70
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,858
And also announce that we're going
to close off and inspect all roads

71
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,194
around the Tokyo Dome.

72
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,031
Furthermore, our "own" Kira
will respond with,

73
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,618
"Understood. Let's meet. "

74
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,871
You don't really think that they would
go there even

75
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,915
if we're inspecting the roads
around the dome, do you?

76
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:54,878
I don't think that the real Kira will go,
but I'm not sure about the Second Kira.

77
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,380
I can't tell how stupid he is.

78
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,299
Also...

79
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,385
Assuming that he isn't
as stupid as we think he is...

80
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,556
I'll try to see if there might
be another message within this diary.

81
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,311
If there is a code that
only people

82
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:16,316
who have the so-called Shinigami power
can understand, I can't decode it.

83
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:22,239
But we should thoroughly check out
the places listed in the diary.

84
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,493
The 22nd, he's meeting
a friend in Aoyama.

85
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,413
The 24th, he's meeting
a friend in Shibuya.

86
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,208
We have to prepare for the possibility
that our efforts will be fruitless.

87
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,836
We also have to be wary of people waiting
around with notebooks in Aoyama,

88
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,381
and people lurking in
clothing stores in Shibuya.

89
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,259
<i>It's as I thought...</i>

90
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:47,264
<i>If the fake Kira is caught,
I'll have to obtain his notebook...</i>

91
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,852
<i>In the worst case scenario,
I may have to kill everyone there.</i>

92
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:57,941
All we can do is place more surveillance
cameras in Aoyama and Shibuya

93
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:02,112
and station undercover officers
on the stated dates.

94
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,741
Then I'll go to Aoyama and
Shibuya since I'd fit right in.

95
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:08,952
I'll go too.

96
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,203
Light...

97
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,875
It's all right, Dad. I go to
Aoyama and Shibuya occasionally.

98
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,629
And I'd be the one who'd look
most natural hanging outwith Mr. Matsui.

99
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,426
And the only person the Second Kira
is interested in is Kira.

100
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:32,309
So Mr. Matsui, I'll talk to you tomorrow
about going to Aoyama and Shibuya.

101
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,186
All right, Light. Be careful.

102
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,657
<i>This always happens as soon
as I go out and turn on my phone...</i>

103
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,534
Yes?

104
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:54,831
<i>This is Ryuzaki. Please be sure
to keep an eye on Light.</i>

105
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,083
<i>Please keep this a secret.</i>

106
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,337
Y- Yes... I understand...

107
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,466
<i>As long as there's still
a small percentage of doubt,</i>

108
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,218
<i>we still have
to suspect him, eh?</i>

109
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,472
I'm home.

110
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,807
Light, you're late today.

111
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,975
Yeah...

112
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,186
<i>I'm supposed to keep the fact</i>

113
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,021
<i>that I'm helping with
the investigation a secret...</i>

114
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,941
Yeah, I have a girlfriend now...

115
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,693
<i>' Oh, my.
- What?!</i>

116
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,112
Light has a girlfriend? Wow!

117
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,407
Hey, hey, I'm an 18-year-old
college student...

118
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,493
Of course, I have one.

119
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,244
Good luck to you too, Sayu.

120
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,498
Huh? |- | don't need
anything like that yet...

121
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,458
Light, what about dinner?

122
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,294
I got room service at the hotel.

123
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,381
Did you just say hotel?!

124
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,384
What was that?! What was that?!
So scandalous!

125
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,805
All right, Ryuk...
I have something to ask you.

126
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,015
Oh... I thought so.

127
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,559
Answer me if you can.

128
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,481
Can Shinigami who come to
the human world talk to each other?

129
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,108
It's hard to say...

130
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,820
If I'm attached to a human,
I think that's against the rules

131
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,823
unless I have the permission
of the person I'm attached to.

132
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,450
We don't have a code
against that, so I guess...

133
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,870
another Shinigami might
start talking to me.

134
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,999
So does that mean if
Fake Kira's Shinigami sees you,

135
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,753
there's a chance that
he'll tell the Fake Kira that I'm Kira?

136
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,340
That's usually not done,
but it depends on their personality.

137
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,512
So I can just assume that
you'll act how you usually do, right?

138
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:37,809
Yeah. Even if I see someone
with a Shinigami, I won't tell you.

139
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,104
Well, I agree with your stance.

140
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
Thanks.

141
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,816
Hmm?

142
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,319
So, Fake Kira... Have you thought
this out this far?

143
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,863
What's wrong?

144
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,990
Aoyama is pretty big.

145
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,161
I was searching for ways we
could find each other, but...

146
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:01,541
On the 22nd, there is an event at
a club called the Note Blue in Aoyama...

147
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,962
<i>Ao means "Blue"...
And "note"...</i>

148
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,132
That's pretty elaborate...

149
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,926
He might be smarter than I thought...

150
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,222
That means I need to be
more careful, but...

151
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,268
right now, this Note Blue
is worth checking out.

152
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:25,482
But you don't want him to
know that you're Kira, right?

153
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,534
Uh... Light?

154
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,078
What's going on?

155
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,538
These are my friends from school.

156
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,249
P- Pleased to meet you...

157
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,126
This is my cousin Taro.

158
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,003
It's his first time in Tokyo

159
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,799
and he said he wanted to go have
some fun in Aoyama and Roppongi.

160
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,550
I'll be counting on you guys!

161
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,386
He's also looking for a girlfriend.

162
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,388
Does anyone want to volunteer?

163
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,516
Hey, Light...

164
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,728
<i>I'm impressed, Light.</i>

165
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,563
<i>No one would ever suspect</i>

166
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,233
<i>a police officer among
a group of kids.</i>

167
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,155
<i>Even if Ryuk is spotted,</i>

168
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,451
<i>no one could tell who he's attached to
if I'm with this many people.</i>

169
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,538
<i>It's also defense against
L's surveillance cameras...</i>

170
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,082
<i>And it's not a bad way
to investigate.</i>

171
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,170
<i>I just have to watch the entrance
of the Note Blue when it opens..</i>

172
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,596
Found him!

173
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,565
<i>Is it read... Tsuki... Yagami?</i>

174
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,067
<i>He's the only one whose
lifespan I can't see.</i>

175
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,236
LIGHT YAGAMI

176
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,823
<i>I never thought I would
find him so easily.</i>

177
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,664
All right, Rem. Let's go home.

178
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,917
What? You just found him.
Is that good enough?

179
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,589
I can't just greet him by saying,
"Mr. Kira... I'm pleased to meet you,"

180
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,591
with all these people around.

181
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,761
I know his name.
I can look him up later.

182
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,598
After all, it's such a unique name.

183
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,574
YAGAMI, LIGHT BIRTHDATE FEBRUARY 28, 1989
HEIGHT 179CM WEIGHT 54KG BLOOD TYPE A

184
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,618
That's kind of dreamy!

185
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,704
Anyways,
Light Yagami is impressive...

186
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,873
He won the national tennis competition

187
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,375
when he was in his second and
third year of middle school.

188
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,961
He gave an address as
the freshman representative

189
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,255
at this year's entrance ceremony
at To-oh University...

190
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,382
There's no picture of him,

191
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,843
but there can't be anyone else
with a name like this.

192
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,264
<i>Who would have thought that Kira
would be so young and cool!</i>

193
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,975
<i>He's better than I ever imagined.</i>

194
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,062
There are so many places that will
just go and sell your personal records.

195
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,105
The world is so twisted, isn't it?

196
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,649
I even know his address now!

197
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,985
So in the end...

198
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,904
There isn't a trace of anything
happening in Aoyama

199
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,367
on the 22nd and Shibuya on the 24th.

200
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,161
The only place left is
the Dome on the 30th...

201
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,958
<i>I didn't see anyone who could
be the Fake Kira at Note Blue.</i>

202
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,377
<i>Could he really be going
to the Dome?</i>

203
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,506
<i>Ryuzaki, Sakura TV just received</i>

204
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,841
<i>another message
from the Second Kira.</i>

205
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,844
<i>It's postmarked... on the 23rd.</i>

206
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,224
<i>I have found Kira.</i>

207
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,351
<i>To all of the people at
the television station</i>

208
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,229
<i>and the police, thank you very much.</i>

209
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,357
<i>I- It can't beâ€!</i>

210
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,901
<i>Where? In Aoyama?</i>

211
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,321
<i>Did his Shinigami find
Ryuk and tell him?</i>

212
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,450
<i>No... There is no way that he could
tell who Ryuk was attached to.</i>

213
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,370
<i>I made sure that no one
was following me...</i>

214
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,709
<i>If this is true, the only thing that
corresponds to this tape</i>

215
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,628
<i>being mailed on the 23rd
is the 22nd in Aoyama</i>

216
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,464
<i>Matsuda and Light Yagami are
the only ones</i>

217
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,508
<i>from this investigation
who went to Aoyama.</i>

218
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,760
<i>Is Light really Kiraâ€?</i>

219
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,596
<i>But we don't have absolute proof
this happened in Aoyama.</i>

220
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,182
He found him?
That's not good.

221
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,687
Yes... It means that the Second Kira
and Kira have teamed up...

222
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,565
We're still not sure
if they've teamed up.

223
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,027
The Second Kira is only saying
that he found him.

224
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,529
He may not have contacted him yet.

225
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,907
Since we've come to this point...

226
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,913
the police will have to send
a message to the Second Kira...

227
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,749
Send a message?

228
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,587
Yes. The police will have to reach out
to the Second Kira

229
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,923
and offer him a deal in
exchange for Kira's name.

230
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,137
Isn't this a really bad turn
of events?

231
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,680
<i>This isn't good...</i>

232
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,725
<i>I don't know how
the Fake Kira would react...</i>

233
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,228
<i>But I have no reason to stop this...</i>

234
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:20,902
<i>If Kira doesn't know who you are yet,
there is still time.</i>

235
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,405
<i>Don't approach Kira out of curiosity.</i>

236
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,117
<i>Kira will kill you if you contact him.</i>

237
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,994
<i>He'll just use you.</i>

238
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,999
<i>What you can do is reconsider
the value of human life,</i>

239
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,961
<i>and atone for your crimes by
giving us information on Kira,</i>

240
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,173
<i>and save the people of the world
from Kira's reign of terror.</i>

241
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,928
Where are you going?

242
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,888
I'm going to introduce myself.

243
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,141
<i>Oh, to him...</i>

244
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,811
Oh, I wonder if it's your father.

245
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,104
Coming...

246
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,399
Welcome home-!

247
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,776
Huh?

248
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,113
Good evening.
My name is Misa Amane.

249
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,742
I came to give Light an important
notebook he left at the university...

250
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,036
C- Could you wait for a second?

251
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,164
Light!

252
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,167
<i>Notebook?! Could it be?</i>

253
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,142
Pleased to meet you...

254
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,852
My name is Misa Amane.

255
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,689
I thought you might be worried
if you were watching TV...

256
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,941
I just couldn't take it any more...

257
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,401
This notebook...

258
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,112
<i>A Death Note...</i>

259
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:54,871
<i>A Shinigami!</i>

260
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:56,914
<i>She's the Fake Kira...</i>

261
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,209
Come on in.

262
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,379
Huh? Is it all right-?
I'm so happy.

263
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,716
Mom, she came all this way
to return my notebook to me.

264
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,217
Could you make us some tea
or something?

265
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,886
|- | suppose I should.

266
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,431
She's the one
I was telling you about.

267
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,313
Have a seat.

268
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,065
T- Thank you.

269
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,952
How did you find me?

270
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,415
Oh... I thought so. You didn't do
the deal for the eyes, did you?

271
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,418
When you have the Shinigami eyes,

272
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,756
you can see a person's
lifespan and age. But...

273
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,092
you cannot see the lifespan
of someone who has a Death Note.

274
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,557
Well... I didn't know that detail...

275
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,435
Okay, I understand that, but...

276
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,480
What would happen if you were
caught by the police

277
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,565
and Kira's secret was discovered-?

278
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,108
It's all right...

279
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:12,657
I wasn't caught and if I continue
to do as you say, I won't be. Right?

280
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,451
And I will see L's name...

281
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,120
I will become your eyes...

282
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,289
So...

283
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,085
So'?

284
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,504
Please make me your girlfriend!

285
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:29,966
Girlfriend-?

286
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:31,968
Yes...

287
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,973
<i>If I'm not careful with her,
she might kill me...</i>

288
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,683
<i>But...</i>

289
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,393
That's impossible.

290
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:45,106
There were three times
the usual number of surveillance cameras.

291
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:50,820
Anyone in Aoyama would have
been caught on camera. Including me.

292
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,656
If we get together after that...

293
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,826
Even being together here isn't good.

294
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,995
Try to understand.

295
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,165
This is a picture of me
when I went to Aoyama.

296
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,421
I'm sure no one would
recognize her like this.

297
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,298
So what about your fingerprints?

298
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,509
The tapes you sent to
the television station...

299
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,511
all have the same fingerprints.

300
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,638
Those aren't my fingerprints.

301
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,683
<i>I did put some thought
into my actions.</i>

302
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,644
A little while back I lived
in the Kansai region.

303
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,980
I had a friend who was into the occult.

304
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,358
When I told her we should
make fake ghost videos and

305
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,278
send it to several TV shows,

306
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,196
she agreed to help me.

307
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,158
I had her dub ten tapes and

308
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,870
I made sure not to leave
any fingerprints.

309
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,830
I took those video tapes,

310
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,624
added a graphic,
and added sound.

311
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,044
And what is that friend doing now?

312
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,797
If you want me to kill her,
I'll kill her right now!

313
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,968
If you really...
don't believe me...

314
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,847
You can hold on to my Death Note.

315
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,434
You're just holding on to it,
so I'll still have ownership and

316
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,561
I'll still have my eyes.

317
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,521
Isn't that right, Rem?

318
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,231
Indeed.

319
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,319
Now there's no way
I can kill you.

320
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,198
If I'm of no use, you can kill me.

321
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,950
<i>Why would she go this far?</i>

322
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,330
But you might have removed
several pages from the Death Note.

323
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,248
You could be hiding them somewhere.

324
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,251
Why are you so suspicious of me?!

325
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,713
I don't care if you use me!

326
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,548
Believe me.

327
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,426
How can you say that?

328
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,263
Exactly one year ago,

329
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:46,227
my parents were killed by
a burglar right before my eyes.

330
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,063
I couldn't forgive him...

331
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,943
the trial was drawn-out and some people
started saying he was falsely accused...

332
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,948
That's when Kira punished him...

333
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,202
Kira... means everything to me.

334
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,834
I just... I just wanted to
meet you so badly!

335
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,044
I wanted to thank you.

336
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:20,678
<i>All these irrational methods
just to meet Kira...</i>

337
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,139
<i>But at least she can get
around surveillance cameras</i>

338
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,559
<i>and keep her fingerprints
off the evidence.</i>

339
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,811
<i>She's not as stupid as I thought...</i>

340
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,648
<i>She even says that she'll obey me...</i>

341
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,211
I understand...

342
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,339
I can't be your boyfriend,
but I can play the part...

343
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,721
Those eyes you gave up half of
your life for, to meet me and to help me,

344
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,556
will be a valuable weapon.

345
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,479
Thank you...
I'll work hard to make you love me.

346
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:28,537
TO BE CONTINUED

347
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:33,834
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

348
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:39,215
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

349
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,760
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

350
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:48,224
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

351
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:54,605
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

352
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:59,193
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

353
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:04,865
<i>I can't hold back
the flooding impulses</i>

354
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,661
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

355
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,331
<i>To accomplish</i>

356
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:23,259
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

357
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:28,305
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

358
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:34,103
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

359
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,484
PREVIEW

360
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,655
I consider you a friend too.
We have so much in common.

361
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,908
It's been lonely since you've been
taking breaks from school.

362
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,911
I'd like to play tennis
with you again.

363
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,497
FRIEND
