<i>Easy easy banzai Easy easy banzai
Easy easy banzai Human</i>

00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,443
<i>Easy easy banzai Easy easy banzai
Easy easy banzai Human</i>

00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>Wanna get them mad? Get them mad?
Get them mad? People</i>

4
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,661
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

5
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,622
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

6
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,458
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

7
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

8
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,634
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,554
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,598
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

11
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,601
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

12
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:05,524
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

13
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,359
<i>Hey Hey! Subservient People!</i>

14
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:08,819
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

15
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,737
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

16
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,698
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

17
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,616
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>Are you worried?</i>

19
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:36,346
Near, I think it's time you told us
your thoughts about this case...

20
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,141
The current Kira is foolish and

21
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,060
his exchange with the Japanese
task force was far too convenient.

22
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,729
Taking that into consideration...
Kira is...

23
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,064
probably conspiring with
the Japanese task force.

24
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,692
- "Conspiring?"
- If that's the case, Kira is...

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,194
The new L...

26
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,654
It can't be...!

27
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,240
Are you serious, Near?

28
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,701
Yes. But even though I say
that I'm serious,

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,536
I'm only seven percent sure...

30
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,959
Commander Rester, we have to make
assumptions during investigations.

31
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,712
If we're wrong,
we can just say we're sorry.

32
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,174
JUSTICE

33
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,765
There have been fewer crimes
in Japan lately.

34
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,142
My dad told me that if
you do something bad,

35
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,311
your name will be posted
on the internet

36
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,398
- and Kira will kill you.
- What's your name? Come on.

37
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,692
If you don't tell us your name,
we can't file a report.

38
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,654
Give me a break!
Anything but my name!

39
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm going to post your names
on the internet.

40
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:46,291
KIRA, PLEASE KILL...

41
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:09,606
<i>I will declare this right here!
Kira is justice!</i>

42
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,319
KIRA'S KINGDOM

43
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,866
<i>It is absolutely true that
I was appointed</i>

44
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,785
<i>by Kira as his spokesperson.</i>

45
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,956
<i>Some people may try to kill me
because of this.</i>

46
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>But!</i>

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,793
<i>I am prepared to risk my life</i>

48
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:40,262
<i>Persecuting Kira is an unforgivable act
and should be considered a crime.</i>

49
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,806
We should really kill this guy.

50
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,017
<i>If you see someone trying to ﬁnd Kira,
whether that person is a police ofﬁcer,</i>

51
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,477
<i>- Oh, the president's press conference...
- a regular citizen, or a criminal,</i>

52
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,104
<i>- is about to begin.
- bring charges against them!</i>

53
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,482
What could it be about?

54
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,527
They said that it was
an announcement to the world.

55
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,905
You're always watching TV,
aren't you?

56
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,535
<i>We, the United States of America...</i>

57
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,457
<i>Could it be?!</i>

58
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,503
<i>Acknowledge Kira and will
do nothing to stand in his way...</i>

59
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,217
Damn! This is insane!

60
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,513
<i>I did it! The United States
has bowed down to Kira...</i>

61
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,099
What is he talking about?

62
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,851
Is he afraid of Kira?!

63
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,562
- Mr. President, explain this!
- When was this decided?!

64
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,855
- Give us more details!
- Explain yourself!

65
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,982
- Are you saying that Kira is justice?!
- That's right!

66
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,526
Justice? I didn't say that.

67
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,946
But war no longer exists
because of Kira...

68
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,823
Criminal organizations are in
a state of ruin,

69
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,868
not only in the United States,
but around the world...

70
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:49,831
<i>There is no mistake. Whoever deﬁes
Kira directly will be killed.</i>

71
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,542
<i>We know that Kira does not
stand for justice, but...</i>

72
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,505
<i>as a country, we will not take
any actions to catch Kira.</i>

73
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,131
<i>T- That's the same thing!
You idiot!</i>

74
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,466
<i>You just announced that
you acknowledged Kira!</i>

75
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,675
<i>Please explain!</i>

76
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,802
<i>Are you running away?!</i>

77
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,553
<i>How can you call yourself
the leader of our country?!</i>

78
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,514
I don't believe it.

79
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,309
This is the U.S. we're talking about...
That was the president's statement!

80
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,687
Umm... I'd like to ask
a serious question.

81
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,606
What is it all of a sudden, Matsuda?

82
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,733
So you're saying that
you're not always serious?

83
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,570
In the depths of your heart,
do you think that Kira is evil?

84
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,906
- What?!
- What do you mean, Matsuda?!

85
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,577
Honestly... I don't think
he's completely evil.

86
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,413
Do you believe that Kira is justice?

87
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,541
I don't know...

88
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,795
But I think that Kira is fighting evil.

89
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,923
The world has definitely
become a good place

90
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,092
for people who live honestly.

91
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,510
You're wrong, Matsuda.

92
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,764
They're afraid of the carnage.
It's not true peace...

93
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,767
I know. I know that!

94
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:56,022
But I understand the feelings
of those who call Kira a savior!

95
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,607
I've always been...

96
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,110
A weak person...

97
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,573
But I'm a detective.
I can't accept Kira...

98
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,077
I understand that and want
to catch him as a part of my job.

99
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,957
I'm probably messed up for not being
able to completely denounce him.

100
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,502
There's nothing wrong
with you, Mr. Matsuda.

101
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,256
Light, you too?
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,844
Kira probably knows that
what he's doing is evil...

103
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:31,016
He'll change the world even
if he becomes a martyr...

104
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,768
That is the form of justice
that Kira has chosen...

105
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,104
That's probably what Kira thinks.

106
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,443
It's not our business to debate
whether Kira is good or evil.

107
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,362
We just have to catch Kira.

108
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:50,535
If Kira is caught, he is evil.
If Kira rules the world, he is justice.

109
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:59,878
<i>But the world is rapidly
going over to Kira's side.</i>

110
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,173
<i>Soon Kira will be justice.</i>

111
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,802
What will happen to us?

112
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,306
We'll be dissolved because
of that chicken of a president...

113
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,144
No, he's not even a chicken.
He's less than a maggot.

114
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,649
<i>You've got to be kidding.</i>

115
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,234
<i>There's no way that
accepting Kira can be good.</i>

116
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,308
You're alive?

117
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,896
Near!

118
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,568
What should we do?

119
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,736
Let him in.

120
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,374
Welcome Mello...

121
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,834
Put down your gun!

122
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,924
Everyone, please put
down your guns.

123
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,802
It is meaningless for
us to shed blood here.

124
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,848
But Mello killed the others.

125
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,766
Don't make me repeat myself.

126
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,395
Our goal is to catch Kira...

127
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,982
Right now, killing Mello
will not benefit us.

128
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,652
All right...

129
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,366
Have things gone as
you've planned, Near?

130
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,077
Yes. You've heard from
Lidner, haven't you?

131
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,662
About the Second L...

132
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,124
I've pretty much figured out
who Kira is

133
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,709
because of everything you've done.

134
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,046
Near!

135
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,176
I'm not a tool for you to use
to solve the puzzle.

136
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,638
Mello, shoot me if you want.

137
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,814
Mello! If you shoot Near,
we'll have no choice but to shoot you.

138
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:29,110
What'll happen if you both die?
Only Kira will be happy.

139
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,032
That's true.

140
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,328
Near, I just came to get
the photograph you have of me.

141
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:43,374
Yes, this is the photograph.
There's only one, no copies.

142
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,920
I've already dealt with everyone

143
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,005
who knows your face at
Wammy's house and elsewhere.

144
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,175
I can't say I'm a hundred percent
certain, but...

145
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,928
it's safe to say you won't
be killed by the notebook.

146
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,724
Is that all, Mello?

147
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,938
Near...

148
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,743
|... have no intention
of working with you.

149
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,745
I know.

150
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,792
But it'll upset me to receive this picture
without giving anything in return.

151
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,964
The killer notebook...
It's a Shinigami's notebook.

152
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,050
Whoever touches it,
is able to see the Shinigami.

153
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,263
- That's crazy!
- Who would believe that?!

154
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,722
I believe him.

155
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,518
What good would it be for
Mello to tell a lie like that?

156
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,273
He would, at least tell a better lie,
or something that has some truth to it.

157
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,066
Therefore, Shinigami really exist.

158
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,986
The notebook I had
was one that belonged

159
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,780
to someone other than a Shinigami...

160
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,450
Also... there were fake rules within
the rules written in it.

161
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,912
That's all I can tell you.

162
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,551
Near.

163
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,719
Mello...

164
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,310
Which of us is going to get Kira first?

165
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,478
The race is on...

166
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,356
Our destination is the same.

167
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,525
I'll be waiting for you...

168
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,235
Yes.

169
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,301
<i>A fake rule...</i>

170
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,347
<i>Judging from previous events,
there's no doubt that...</i>

171
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,891
<i>the notebook can cause heart attacks
and control its victims, to a degree.</i>

172
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,143
<i>As for burning or
tearing up the notebook...</i>

173
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,563
<i>The notebook still exists and
there is no way to test it.</i>

174
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,023
In that case...

175
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,657
<i>The fake rule is the rule</i>

176
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,577
<i>that a person will die if he doesn't
write a name within thirteen days...</i>

177
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,540
Gevanni.

178
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,584
Get me L.

179
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,044
Yes.

180
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,506
It's from Near.

181
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,800
Yes?

182
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,927
<i>L, we've caught Mello.</i>

183
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,513
But he escaped.

184
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,891
<i>However, we were able to
interrogate him a little.</i>

185
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,186
He didn't escape.
You let him escape.

186
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,521
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

187
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,690
No, he really did escape.

188
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,986
By the way, Mello said that there is
a Shinigami attached to the notebook.

189
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,115
<i>Have you been able to
conﬁrm any such entity?</i>

190
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,202
Yes. Shinigami do exist.

191
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,707
I kept it a secret because
I didn't think that you'd believe me.

192
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,335
<i>I'd like to talk to the Shinigami
about some things.</i>

193
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,671
I don't want to talk.

194
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,716
The thing that bothers me
the most is the fact that

195
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,886
there is a fake rule among
the rules written within the notebook.

196
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,055
There's a fake?

197
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,518
<i>Yes. L, tell me your thoughts...</i>

198
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,604
<i>If there is a fake rule,
which one do you think it is?</i>

199
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,819
By elimination,
it would have to be the one

200
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:44,449
that requires the owner of the notebook
to write a name within 13 days, or die.

201
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,286
<i>I thought you'd say that.
I think so too.</i>

202
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,710
Shinigami. Is there a fake rule among
the rules written within the notebook?

203
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,754
No, there aren't any.

204
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,799
So there's a Shinigami there?

205
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,968
Yes.

206
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,261
<i>I see...</i>

207
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,056
I pretty much get the picture.

208
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:13,394
In other words, Kira is there and
he's making the Shinigami lie.

209
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,564
<i>This guy's amazing.
He got it right...</i>

210
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,987
Even if the Shinigami is lying,
it doesn't mean anything.

211
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,866
No. It would mean that it was
meaningless to detain Light.

212
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,912
If the rule that a person has to
continue writing names is fake,

213
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,832
it makes it meaningless that he spent
more than 13 days doing nothing.

214
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,295
But that's wrong!

215
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,881
There's no way that Light is Kira.

216
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,758
The Deputy Director confirmed that

217
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,719
he didn't have a notebook
and passed away...

218
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,398
<i>Well then, how about
testing it in this way?</i>

219
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,818
I will write Mello's name
in the notebook.

220
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:08,658
<i>When Mello dies,
and if I die 13 days later, Kira wins.</i>

221
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,827
<i>I don't mind.</i>

222
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,620
What's this?

223
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,955
So it's just a matter of
winning or losing?

224
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,835
Even if testing the 13-day rule
benefits the Kira investigation,

225
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,254
there shouldn't be any drawbacks.

226
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,382
I shall put my life on the line.

227
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:29,345
<i>If I reject this offer on my own,
it will give a bad impression...</i>

228
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,766
Wait a moment.
We need to think about that suggestion.

229
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,395
Give me your honest opinion.

230
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,356
It's easy to say that
we should honor human life

231
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,318
and we shouldn't do that,
but I was the one who was confined.

232
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,237
It's strange for me to
be saying that.

233
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,364
This is awkward...

234
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,241
I think that Near should do
it if he wants to.

235
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,201
I want to see
the Deputy Director avenged.

236
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,956
I'm against it. I don't believe
that Kira is among us.

237
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,042
We shouldn't kill anyone
with the notebook.

238
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,254
Yes. We should follow
the Deputy Director's will.

239
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,048
I'm also against
testing the notebook.

240
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,221
<i>Near, we cannot allow you
to test the notebook.</i>

241
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,393
I thought you would say that...
And lastly, one more thing.

242
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,563
To the members of
the Japanese Task force:

243
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,777
Was there ever a time when
the Second L was thought to be Kira?

244
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:33,367
<i>If you've listened to our conversation
and want to help my investigation...</i>

245
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:38,122
<i>Call the number I'm going to give you.
I'll answer.</i>

246
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,793
<i>There's no way that
Light could be Kira...</i>

247
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,422
<i>No, I just don't want to
think that... But...</i>

248
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,383
<i>If the thirteen-day rule is fake...</i>

249
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,886
<i>it's true that we can't say
that he's innocent...</i>

250
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,437
<i>Near... I've got to kill him!</i>

251
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,988
<i>It's me.</i>

252
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,073
<i>This is Kira.</i>

253
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,242
I- Is this a prank?

254
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:18,496
<i>I will read you a list of people that
I'm going to punish tomorrow.</i>

255
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,457
<i>Check it and make your decision.</i>

256
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:27,797
<i>Mr. President, lam very grateful that
you have sympathized with me.</i>

257
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,716
<i>But that isn't enough.</i>

258
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,012
<i>The SPK is trying to catch me.</i>

259
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,432
<i>I want you to stop them immediately,
and disband them.</i>

260
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,730
<i>At the same time, I want you to use
American police, the CIA, the FBI...</i>

261
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,733
<i>And all other intelligence agencies...</i>

262
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,571
<i>To ﬁnd out where the members
of the SPK are hiding.</i>

263
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:58,035
<i>Let me know immediately.
I will tell you how to contact me.</i>

264
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,288
<i>Mr. President...</i>

265
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,416
<i>It is your choice whether
or not you live a long life.</i>

266
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,501
<i>Don't forget that.</i>

267
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,962
All right...

268
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,929
Mr. Demegawa! Please wait!

269
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,681
Why are you suddenly
going to New York?

270
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,517
I'm going to crush an organization
that's defying Kira.

271
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,102
It's going to be live!

272
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:28,649
This is an order from Kira.
I had a call from the President.

273
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,820
I don't even know
what I'm saying anymore!

274
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,739
I don't care about anything!

275
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:39,785
I'll get a 100 percent, no,
120 percent viewer ratings!

276
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,582
Come on, everyone!

277
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,084
The age of Kira has come!

278
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,304
<i>The last L was suspicious of Light...</i>

279
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:03,517
<i>But I'll just be killed
if he really is Kira and</i>

280
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,354
<i>I suggest that we should
investigate him again...</i>

281
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,773
<i>The thirteen-day rule...</i>

282
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,400
Aizawa.

283
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,906
I've known you for a long time.
I know what you're thinking...

284
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,326
You should do
what you think is right.

285
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,496
I never trusted L to begin with.

286
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,916
I'm doing what I'm doing now

287
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,960
because I want to work with you
rather than Light.

288
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:31,796
Ide...

289
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,008
I'll contact Near without
letting Light know.

290
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:37,968
All right...

291
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,014
I'll make sure that no one knows
what you're doing...

292
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,786
<i>Light... I want to believe that...</i>

293
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,247
<i>you're not Kira...</i>

294
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,296
Bad news!
Demegawa's on TV!

295
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,220
I, Demegawa, along with
my comrades have finally...

296
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,764
pinpointed the location of
and surrounded the hideout

297
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,810
of the evil organization that
is trying to catch our god, Kira.

298
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:38,237
Right now, they appear to be
hiding within this building!

299
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,534
Behold the power of the people!
The power of justice!

00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,498
<i>When Near escapes,
I'll write his name in the notebook...</i>

What's wrong, Near?

<i>Is this a plan by Mello to
ﬁnish off the SPK?</i>

306
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>Or is it because the SPK
is so poorly structured</i>

307
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:12,271

able to discover your location?</i>
