<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:18,602
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,365
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,369
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,790
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:48,215
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,677
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,641
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,563
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,943
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,405
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:17,369
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,964
GLARE

17
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:34,678
That was footage that was coincidentally
captured on surveillance cameras

18
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,556
of the FBI agents who died in Japan.

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,685
Please show me only
the scenes of Raye Penber

20
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,398
passing the ticket gate,
riding the train, and then dying.

21
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,733
Yes.

22
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,276
Let's see...

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,527
It's right below that.

24
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,404
Oh, this?

25
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:59,953
Raye Penber enters through the ticket
gate of Shinjuku Station at 15:11.

26
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,415
At 15:13,
he rides the Yamanote Line.

27
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,377
Even if he was following someone,
it would be difficult...

28
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,547
to conclude anything from
this blurry video.

29
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,091
And at 16:42...

30
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,927
Oh, thank you very much.

31
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:22,142
And at 16:42, he gets off and dies at
the Tokyo Station Platform.

32
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,895
It's strange, isn't it?

33
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,731
What's strange, L?

34
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,608
Did you notice something?

35
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,612
Judging by this footage,

36
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,156
from the time that Raye Penber got
on the train until his death,

37
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,077
he had been riding for an hour and a half.
The Yamanote Line only takes an hour.

38
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,412
That envelope is especially strange.

39
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:43,955
Envelope?

40
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,918
He's holding that envelope

41
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,920
as he enters the ticket gate
and reaches the platform.

42
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,588
I- Indeed.

43
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,131
He's carrying it.
He's carrying it!

44
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,258
But by the time he dies...

45
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,094
It's gone!

46
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,930
Ryuzaki, it's amazing you noticed that!

47
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,433
Envelope isn't on the list of
articles he left behind.

48
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,144
Which means it was left in the train.

49
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,980
And this video of Penber's
final moments...

50
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,984
It looks to me as if
he's desperately trying

51
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,278
to look inside the train.

52
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,989
If so, could there be a hint there?

53
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,659
Wouldn't it be interesting
if Kira was there?

54
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,119
C- Couldn't be!

55
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,996
I don't think so either.

56
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,708
There's no reason for Kira,
who can control death from a distance,

57
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,334
to come to the scene of the crime.

58
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,508
But despite that, he may
have tried something bold.

59
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,476
Light, are you all right?

60
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,812
You've been writing criminals'
names in the Death Note

61
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,149
for four days already
without sleeping.

62
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:57,654
Why do you have to set up a death
schedule for several months ahead?

63
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,197
Quite simply...

64
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,158
Suppose I get hospitalized.
People will say that...

65
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,161
"As soon as Chief Yagami's son
was hospitalized,

66
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,372
"criminals have
stopped dying, haven't they?"

67
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,249
So that's why...

68
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,667
But are you sure

69
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,171
any date before the end of
their predestined life span is all right?

70
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,842
Shinigami never use it that way,
so I can't say for sure, but...

71
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,220
In theory, any time before
their natural deaths should be all right.

72
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,390
You're not much help.

73
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,683
You can't.

74
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,351
No, I'm not.

75
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,104
Yes, please wait one moment.

76
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,689
Ryuzaki.

77
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:38,570
Ukita at the NPA has received
a phone call he's concerned about.

78
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,907
Then have him give the telephone
number of number five

79
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,577
and have the informant
call that number.

80
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,748
Matsuda, you can turn on
your cell phone.

81
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,458
I mean, please turn it on.

82
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,793
Oh, yes.

83
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,759
Yes, this is Suzuki, head of the Public Information
Processing Unit for the Kira Case.

84
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,553
Raye Penber's fiancée?

85
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,891
Naomi Misora...
I've heard that name somewhere...

86
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:16,483
<i>It's her... from the Los Angeles
BB murder case...</i>

87
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:22,072
<i>So that's it... She worked under me on
that case and now she's in Japan.</i>

88
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,330
She's been missing
since the death of her fiance.

89
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,667
Anyone would be depressed
over the death of a fiance...

90
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,960
Could it be...

91
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,127
...suicide?

92
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,756
No, the Naomi Misora I knew

93
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,926
was very strong-willed,
an excellent FBI agent.

94
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,346
She would likely be thinking
of catching Kira.

95
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,140
She was with Penber.

96
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,935
She might have found a clue...

97
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,939
<i>If that's the case,
did Kira get to her ﬁrst?</i>

98
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,361
Everyone, from now on,
we'll focus our investigation

99
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,322
on the people Raye Penber
was investigating while in Japan.

100
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,449
He was investigating two people

101
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,702
in relation to the police
and the people around them.

102
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,955
Who are they? Who are those two?

103
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,709
Deputy Director General Kitamura
and his family, and...

104
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,169
Detective Superintendent Yagami
and his family.

105
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,963
What?!

106
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:25,719
I also wish to place wiretaps and
surveillance cameras in both households.

107
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:31,308
<i>I have to make sure this computer
is clean in case anyone examines it.</i>

108
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,855
<i>I just have to hide a clipping
of the Death Note in here...</i>

109
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,860
You sure are skillful
with your hands.

110
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,070
You're popular with the girls,
aren't you?

111
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,241
That has nothing to do with skill.
It's more about looks than skill.

112
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,161
Ryuk, you aren't popular, are you?

113
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,748
Surveillance cameras? Ryuzaki!

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,042
That's way out of the question!

115
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,336
It would become a civil rights issue
if this is discovered...

116
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,879
and we'll all be fired!

117
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,423
Weren't you willing to risk
more than your jobs?

118
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,550
I thought we were
putting our lives on the line.

119
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,053
Ryuzaki...

120
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,430
What is the possibility that
Kira is among them?!

121
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,518
Ten percent...
No, five percent.

122
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,688
No way! All that for only a five-percent
possibility is a bit much.

123
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,899
No... Of the people
we investigated so far...

124
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,693
there wasn't anyone who even
seemed the least bit suspicious.

125
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,570
I think we should look into it

126
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,198
even if there's only
a one-percent chance of finding Kira.

127
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,699
Chief!

128
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,870
I never thought that my family
was under suspicion...

129
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,247
Fine.
Please place them!

130
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,419
In return, install them in every part
of the house! Even the bathroom, the toilet!

131
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,879
Don't miss a single corner!

132
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,714
Thank you very much.

133
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,049
That's what I was planning to do.

134
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,593
Chief!
What are you talking about?!

135
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,389
That's right! You have a wife
and daughter, don't you?

136
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,224
I know!

137
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,560
There's no point in doing this
unless we're thorough!

138
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,312
Just be quiet!

139
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:03,942
Soffy...

140
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,610
No, it's okay...

141
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,404
I'm sorry...

142
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:15,286
Well, out of courtesy, only Yagami and I
will conduct surveillance on his home.

143
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,083
Watari, how long will it take to set up
the wiretaps and camera monitors?

144
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,168
Starting tomorrow...

145
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:26,089
I can set them up at any time once
we know when both families will be out.

146
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,136
See you later, Light.

147
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,096
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

148
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,518
<i>What? No one's home yet?</i>

149
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,986
I'm home...

150
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,797
Hey Light, no one seems to be home.

151
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,008
Wanna play a game together?
It's been awhile.

152
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,012
Hey Light, let's play a game.

153
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,972
Are you listening to me?

154
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,561
Light?

155
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,819
C- Couldn't be.

156
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,363
I never knew he went to
those lengths!

157
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,658
Could he have something in his
room he doesn't want anyone to see?

158
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,244
If you keep in mind that
he's only seventeen,

159
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,497
there's nothing suspicious
about his behavior.

160
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,374
I also did that for no apparent reason.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,044
Have you ever talked to him
about the investigation?

162
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,337
Of course not!

163
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,173
I'd never tell him about anything
classified that hasn't been broadcast.

164
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,591
Besides...

165
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,718
Lately I haven't been returning
home regularly,

166
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,012
and when I do, I'm too tired...
and just go to sleep.

167
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,889
I understand...

168
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,101
Light, where are you going?

169
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,856
Hey, Light, you've been ignoring me!
I'm getting mad.

170
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,527
- There don't seem to be...
- Hey, Light!

171
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,237
any taps planted on these clothes.

172
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,863
Light...

173
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,408
Ryuk, there's a possibility that there are
wiretaps or surveillance cameras,

174
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,037
no, likely both,
placed within the house.

175
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,041
Huh? But that piece of paper
was still in your door, wasn't it?

176
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,544
That piece of paper was
a fake to make people think

177
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,213
it was there to see whether anyone
had entered the room while I was gone.

178
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,048
The real detector is,
first of all, my door handle.

179
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,216
Door handle?

180
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,385
When that door is closed,

181
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,428
the door knob naturally rises
to a horizontal position.

182
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,888
It won't rise any higher.

183
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,724
But whenever I close the door,

184
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,060
I purposefully lower the door knob

185
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,937
to five millimeters below
its highest position.

186
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,233
In other words, when I open the door,
if the knob is all the way up,

187
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,777
chances are that someone
was in my room.

188
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,114
But I can't rely on just that.

189
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,325
So I also put a mechanical
pencil lead in place.

190
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,286
A pencil lead?

191
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,745
On the hinge.

192
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,122
After I close the door,

193
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,333
I place a mechanical pencil lead
on the hinge at an angle

194
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,502
so that it will break
if the door is opened.

195
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,422
The lead is sure to break
if the door is opened.

196
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,924
I've always taken it out myself
when I entered,

197
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,467
but today, it was broken.

198
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,095
Oh, that. I remember you doing that.

199
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,805
The door handle and the pencil lead.

200
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,266
I have no doubt that someone went in.

201
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,851
Isn't it probably your parents?

202
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,812
My parents and sister probably
wouldn't notice the piece of paper.

203
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,441
It's suspicious because someone
took the time to put it back.

204
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,610
Welcome.

205
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,990
Are you planning to buy a book
to research wiretaps and surveillance?

206
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,786
Ryuk, by the way,
what will happen to your apples?

207
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,622
Apples?

208
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,167
Oh! From the surveillance camera...

209
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,295
if I put the apple in my mouth
no one can see it,

210
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,672
but it'll look like it's floating in air
if I'm just holding it.

211
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:55,840
I thought so...

212
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,551
Shinigami cannot die,
so they won't starve either.

213
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,638
In other words, there's no problem
if I don't give you any apples.

214
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,182
Whoa, wait just a minute, Light!

215
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,142
Apples are to me...

216
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,521
W- Well... What cigarettes and liquor
are to humans.

217
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,982
I'll get withdrawal symptoms
if I don't have any for a while...

218
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,026
What kind of symptoms?

219
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,821
My body twists around wildly,
and I'll do handstands.

220
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,198
I don't want to see that...

221
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,324
Right?

222
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,992
Ryuk, listen.

223
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:28,331
I've given L the hint that
Shinigami love apples.

224
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,666
When did you...

225
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,502
If you really want to eat apples...

226
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,382
find out where all the cameras are.

227
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,094
There might be a place where
you can eat apples without being seen.

228
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,222
All right, Ryuk, let's go!

229
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,225
Yeah!
Finding cameras.

230
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,019
This is also interesting!

231
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,835
Oh right, I have to find cameras...

232
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,088
I can't believe my diligent son
is looking at a magazine like that!

233
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,841
It's normal for a 17-year-old.

234
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:24,429
But to me, it seems like
he's making an excuse, as if to say,

235
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,681
"| was checking to see
if someone was in this room...

236
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,267
"because I have magazines like these. "

237
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,980
Ryuzaki, are you telling me that
you suspect my son?

238
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,690
I do suspect him.

239
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,109
That's why I placed wiretaps
and cameras in your house

240
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,320
as well as
the Deputy Director Generals house.

241
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,991
I found a camera in the air conditioner.

242
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,328
<i>$0 there were cameras. -.</i>

243
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,997
<i>That probably means
there are wire taps as well.</i>

244
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,915
<i>Even if this is for the Kira case,</i>

245
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,210
<i>I can't believe the Japanese police
would go this far.</i>

246
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,171
<i>This is L's doing...</i>

247
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>If that's the case,
how far has he narrowed it down to?</i>

248
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,384
<i>He must be down to at least someone</i>

249
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:07,847
<i>that Raye Penber was investigating
or he would have never gone this far.</i>

250
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,809
<i>Tricked by the cover again!</i>

251
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,145
<i>No, in this case, I should act as if...</i>

252
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,899
<i>I was the only one being suspected
and being watched.</i>

253
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,401
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

254
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,737
<i>I've been preparing for
something like this...</i>

255
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,364
<i>That's why I got
these magazines.</i>

256
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,369
Light...

257
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,874
It's time for dinner...

258
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,502
<i>I...</i>

259
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,462
<i>love you.</i>

260
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,345
Hideki Ryuga, you're so dreamy!

261
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,723
There's nobody in my class like him!
No one at all!

262
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:51,808
Sayu...

263
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,351
Eat your dinner.

264
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,769
I will later!

265
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,398
Mr. Aizawa, are the Kitamuras
watching television now?

266
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,774
<i>Yes.</i>

267
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,150
Aside from the Deputy Director General,

268
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,860
the four of them are watching
television as they eat.

269
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,362
It's channel four.

270
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,450
Watari, order the various television
companies to broadcast our banner.

271
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,952
Understood.

272
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,328
NKK NEWS FLASH

273
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,205
Huh? What?

274
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,417
"In response to the Kira murders,

275
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:22,797
"the ICPO has decided to dispatch
1,500 investigators

276
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,926
"from various developed
countries to Japan. "

277
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,429
1,500 investigators?

278
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,930
Wow!

279
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,392
<i>There should also be cameras
in the living room.</i>

280
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,145
<i>Whether this news is real or not,</i>

281
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,856
<i>it's being shown to me
to get some kind of reaction...</i>

282
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,193
<i>L... It's the same trick you
used the ﬁrst time.</i>

283
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,779
The ICPO sure is stupid.

284
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,783
There's no point in making
this announcement.

285
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,660
If they're going to send them in,

286
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,787
they should let them come in
and investigate in secret.

287
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,416
<i>Even those FBI agents investigating
in secret were killed.</i>

288
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,501
<i>The outcome will be the same.</i>

289
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:06,299
<i>This is just an overblown attempt
to shock Kira into exposing himself.</i>

290
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,635
<i>But, it just might be completely
obvious to Kira.</i>

291
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,765
Your son is very smart.

292
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,185
Huh? Yeah, well...

293
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,352
<i>Thanks for dinner.</i>

294
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,190
No way! Are you eating potato chips
after dinner?

295
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,650
You look so fit right now...
do you wanna get fat?

296
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,819
It's just a late night snack
while I study for exams.

297
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,991
L- Light...

298
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,869
I found all of the cameras...

299
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,914
I guess even Shinigami get tired
when they try hard...

300
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,082
I'll explain now.

301
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,503
It's a bit complex, so pay attention.

302
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,506
I don't want to explain it again.

303
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,716
All right, time to study hard!

304
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,011
There are so many cameras.

305
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,182
Whoever put them here must've
expected you to find some.

306
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,184
There are 64 in all.

307
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,061
<i>It's deﬁnitely L.</i>

308
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,272
<i>He had no qualms putting
a death row inmate in his place</i>

309
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>when he challenged me.</i>

310
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,527
<i>He knows no limits...</i>

311
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,280
So where am I going to eat
apples in this situation?

312
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,824
<i>Obviously that's impossible, Ryuk.</i>

313
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,119
Oh, yeah you can't talk to
me in this house, can you?

314
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,705
Tomorrow, tell me when
we go outside.

315
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,750
Okay, I got this one right.

316
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,836
<i>Judging from the number of cameras,</i>

317
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,422
<i>he's planning on making
his decision in a short amount of time...</i>

318
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,051
<i>A normal person would
probably give himself away, but...</i>

319
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,554
<i>you're messing with
the wrong person, L...</i>

320
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,721
<i>this is as far as you'll get.</i>

321
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,989
<i>I've written down criminals
in the Death Note.</i>

322
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,449
<i>So they will continue to die
over the next three weeks, but...</i>

323
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,829
<i>Kira has already shown L that
he can control the time of death.</i>

324
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,497
<i>So in this case...</i>

325
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,208
<i>Current criminals being
broadcast on the news...</i>

326
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,837
<i>have to die while I'm not
receiving any knowledge of them.</i>

327
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,505
Oh no!

328
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,090
My withdrawal symptoms!

329
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,676
<i>Just watch, L!</i>

330
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,892
<i>With Ryuk's information
and my prior preparations,</i>

331
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,979
<i>I can kill criminals
currently being broadcast</i>

332
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:31,277
<i>while masquerading...
as a regular high school student.</i>

333
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,113
<i>I'll solve equations
with my right hand...</i>

334
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,657
<i>and write names with my left.</i>

335
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,160
TAYOSHI MURAO

336
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,372
<i>Grab a potato chip...
And eat it!</i>

337
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,636
After dinner, your son has
continued studying

338
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,055
without turning on
a television or computer, hasn't he?

339
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,433
It's because the Entrance Exams
are less than ten days away...

340
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,195
<i>Now a criminal which I should
have no knowledge about...</i>

341
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,697
<i>will die of a heart attack
in forty seconds.</i>

342
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,243
<i>The witness to my alibi is L himself.</i>

343
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,126
All right, just a little more!

344
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,258
Ryuzaki.

345
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,760
Watari, what is it?

346
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,806
Two people just broadcast on
today's nine o'clock news,

347
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,017
a bank clerk on suspicion of
embezzlement during questioning...

348
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,187
And a purse snatcher
in a detention center...

349
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,981
just died of heart attacks.

350
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,400
It's Kira!

351
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,652
During that time in your home...

352
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,446
your wife and daughter were
watching a drama.

353
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,240
As soon as that was finished,

354
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,867
they turned off the television
and didn't watch anything afterwards.

355
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,371
From just past 7:30 until now,
11 o'clock,

356
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,206
the only thing your son has
done is study.

357
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,793
Kira needs a face
and a name to kill...

358
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:15,297
Those who did not watch
the news, can't be Kira, huh?

359
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,592
This means my family is innocent, right?

360
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:24,557
Kira killed people with minor crimes as
soon as they were broadcast, didn't he?

361
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,811
Even if it is the first day
the cameras were installed,

362
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,689
the Yagami household is
so clean, it's almost funny.

363
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,654
Light, are you awake?

364
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,157
Yeah, I'm up.

365
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,744
Today is trash day, so bring out
any garbage if you have any.

366
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,079
What a pain!

367
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,664
What are you talking about?

368
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,334
I always say you should be doing
this without me reminding you!

369
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,878
Yeah yeah...

370
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,967
The weather today is nice.

371
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,430
Well... I don't know if you'll do
just about anything if it's for yourself

372
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,265
or if you're just a big spender, but...

373
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:10,644
didn't that mini-LCD TV
cost 39,800 yen?

374
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,940
Good morning.

375
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,076
TO BE CONTINUED

376
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:31,415
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

377
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:36,879
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

378
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:45,888
<i>I'm holding these feelings
that I can't give up in my heart</i>

379
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:52,228
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

380
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,857
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

381
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:02,446
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

382
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,242
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

383
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,954
<i>To accomplish</i>

384
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:20,798
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

385
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,928
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

386
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:31,767
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

387
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,148
PREVIEW

388
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,860
TO-OH UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE CEREMONY

389
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,447
This just proves that
they don't have anything on me.

390
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,702
It's just a contest
between L and me, a match of wits.
