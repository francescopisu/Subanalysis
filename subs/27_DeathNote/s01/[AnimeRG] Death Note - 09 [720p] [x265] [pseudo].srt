00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,464
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,175
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,347
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,477
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,240
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:35,369
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,665
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:48,257
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,552
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,805
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,599
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:07,859
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,363
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:17,244
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,551
I can't believe my diligent son
is looking at a magazine like that!

17
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,264
Light, it's time for dinner...

18
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,232
<i>I'll solve equations
with my right hand...</i>

19
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,942
<i>And write names with my left.</i>

20
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,488
<i>Grab a potato chip... And eat it!</i>

21
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,909
<i>The witness to my alibi is L himself.</i>

22
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:02,039
ENCOUNTER

23
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,167
Are you sure, Ryuk?

24
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,378
Yeah. You definitely aren't being followed.

25
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,675
G- Give it to me quickly.
My withdrawal symptoms are...

26
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,596
You're not saying that
just because you want an apple, are you?

27
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,264
Hey, hey!

28
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:24,686
I flew around, above you a bunch...
up to a radius of a hundred-meters.

29
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,812
I'm sure.

30
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,481
But there was the news report

31
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,609
about Interpol dispatching 1,500 investigators...

32
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,987
You know they were bluffing.
You said it yourself.

33
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,658
If it were real, they would sneak in
and investigate secretly.

34
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,454
All right, Ryuk.
I'll buy you an apple.

35
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,081
All right!

36
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,958
Thank you very much.

37
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,628
Light! Hurry! Hurry!

38
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,637
You know, the way you go around treating
Shinigami...

39
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,060
You had me search for cameras...

40
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,480
And made me give up
eating apples in the house.

41
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,442
Eat the core too...

42
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:20,158
In the end, I'll write your name
into my Death Note and kill ya!

43
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,994
Are you in a position to laugh?

44
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,748
That's right. There's just one thing left
to top everything off.

45
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,961
Ryuzaki...

46
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,504
Yes?

47
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,007
About the purse-snatcher and embezzler's
heart attacks two days ago...

48
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,053
That happened before my family
had any knowledge of it.

49
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,097
Have they been cleared?

50
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,015
I suppose you're right...

51
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,227
Even though Kira can control
the time of death,

52
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,979
I don't think that there's any way

53
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,815
he could set up his victims without
watching that broadcast-!

54
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,318
Your son has come home again.

55
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,702
So, you're gonna ignore me and act like
you're studying again, huh?

56
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,082
<i>I already have an idea of
where all the cameras are.</i>

57
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,335
<i>But I was only able to kill
a purse-snatcher and an embezzler</i>

58
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,212
<i>with the potato-chip trick...</i>

59
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,592
<i>They ended up being minor criminals
compared to those I've killed until now.</i>

60
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,720
<i>- Next on the news- - -
- Are you going to watch I V?</i>

61
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,307
<i>I killed criminals whose names
and faces were broadcast</i>

62
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,476
<i>when I didn't have access
to TV or the Internet.</i>

63
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,895
<i>But there still is a chance
that I'll be suspected because</i>

64
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:34,149
<i>only minor criminals die
when I don't have any information...</i>

65
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,401
<i>- ... an investigation has been opened...
- In other words...</i>

66
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:41,615
<i>If I also kill minor criminals
being broadcast when I watch TV...</i>

67
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,158
<i>I won't call attention to myself.</i>

68
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,870
<i>Also, when I go out...</i>

69
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,122
<i>regardless of the severity
of the crime...</i>

70
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,876
<i>I should remember the names
of criminals broadcast...</i>

71
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,254
<i>And kill them at random times...</i>

72
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,800
<i>with the piece of the Death Note
I left in my wallet.</i>

73
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,221
<i>Now, my countermeasures against
the surveillance cameras are perfect.</i>

74
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,686
During these past few days...

75
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,774
I have checked the tapes
and video footage many times.

76
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,610
I've come to a conclusion.

77
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,031
Of the people in the Kitamura and Yagami families,
suspicious activity was observed in...

78
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,868
...no one.

79
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,747
I shall remove the cameras
and wiretaps.

80
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,627
So, in the end the culprit
wasn't here, huh?

81
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,379
Don't lower your guard!

82
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,130
We're going to narrow down
our possibilities once more.

83
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,924
Please don't misunderstand...

84
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,594
I just meant that there wasn't
anyone suspicious

85
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,138
from what I could see
from our footage.

86
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,602
Even if Kira is among them,
he wouldn't give himself away.

87
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,979
No.

88
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,858
It means that he was killing criminals
as usual, without showing it.

89
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,530
So are you saying one of them
might be Kira?

90
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,116
As I said...

91
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,326
There's a five-percent probability.

92
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:17,377
<i>Kira was still killing people even while
the surveillance cameras were in place...</i>

93
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,464
<i>I don't know how he does it...</i>

94
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,343
<i>But even if he's able to kill
just by imagining it...</i>

95
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,263
<i>...any normal human being would exhibit
a change in their facial expressions</i>

96
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,017
<i>or behaviors while
committing the murders...</i>

97
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,853
<i>"Kira is not among them,"</i>

98
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,355
<i>is what most people would conclude.</i>

99
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,693
<i>But... If one of them is Kira...</i>

100
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,780
<i>His psychological state
has already reached god-like levels.</i>

101
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,409
<i>Judging sinners without
any change in expression.</i>

102
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,329
<i>I want to believe that Kira
doesn't really exist...</i>

103
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,373
<i>that this really is divine judgement.</i>

104
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:02,047
<i>But to think that a god would
need a person's face and name to kill is ridiculous.</i>

105
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,133
<i>This isn't divine judgement.</i>

106
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,929
<i>It's the actions of a childish killer
who thinks he's a god.</i>

107
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,847
<i>That's all.</i>

108
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,477
<i>The mass murderer known
as Kira definitely exists.</i>

109
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,812
<i>And I will catch him.</i>

110
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,816
<i>But I don't think that Kira will
expose himself</i>

111
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,778
<i>even if I keep
these cameras in place...</i>

112
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,322
<i>What should I do?</i>

113
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,993
<i>It would be best to get him to
tell me himself that he's Kira,</i>

114
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,788
<i>and have him
show me how he kills...</i>

115
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,916
<i>But there's no way I can...</i>

116
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,802
Hey, Light. All the cameras
have been removed!

117
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,595
All of them, all of them!

118
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,224
Hey Light, are you listening?

119
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,520
Hey, Light.

120
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:04,317
Oh, I get it.
The wiretaps might still be here.

121
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,737
<i>I'm no longer a suspect.</i>

122
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,280
<i>It went exactly the way I'd planned.</i>

123
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,159
But L will probably continue
to pursue Kira.

124
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,371
<i>And if he's still working
with the Japanese police...</i>

125
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,542
<i>My father will be among
those being used.</i>

126
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,877
<i>If that's the case...</i>

127
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,798
<i>I'll use my father to find
out L's identity so I can...</i>

128
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,091
<i>eliminate him...</i>

129
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,471
<i>If I just get rid of L...</i>

130
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,767
<i>Kira will be one step closer
to becoming the god of the new world.</i>

131
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,314
Light, hurry up.

132
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,025
Do your best!

133
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,985
Good luck, Light!

134
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,237
Really, you're making such
a big fuss over this.

135
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,697
I'll be going now.

136
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,830
It sure feels good, now that we know
that there aren't any wiretaps.

137
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,790
<i>Well, it's nice to know</i>

138
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,334
<i>that one cause of stress
is gone before my test.</i>

139
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,629
2007 TEST CENTER FOR UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS
TO-OH UNIVERSITY TEST

140
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,262
You there! The test will start
in ten minutes! Hurry up!

141
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,766
I was planning on going in
three minutes before the test

142
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,476
because I didn't want to wait around
in the classroom...

143
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:20,977
I sure got here early.

144
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,063
<i>Talk about confident...</i>

145
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,944
You may begin.

146
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,299
You there... Number 162...

147
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,551
Sit in your seat properly!

148
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,849
There's been
a lot of Shinigami...

149
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,643
looking real hard into
the human world lately.

150
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,936
What's going on?

151
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,064
It seems that Ryuk has turned
into some human's pet.

152
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,609
W- What in the world is he thinking?

153
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,238
Really. He's a disgrace to
all Shinigami.

154
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,200
No, I'm talking about the human
who's keeping him.

155
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,955
Ryuk's probably not a very cute pet.

156
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,250
Well, yeah.

157
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,838
So, what kind of human's keeping him?
Is it a woman? A man?

158
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,298
Who knows?

159
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,675
Guess I'll go take a peek as well...

160
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,968
Good grief!

2007 TO-OH UNIVERSITY
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

162
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,875
So you're a college student
now, huh, Light?

163
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,170
I'm kind of.. filled with emotion.

164
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,093
<i>Now for our freshman address.</i>

165
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,722
Our freshman representative,
Light Yagami.

166
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,390
Yes.

167
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,934
Oh, wow.

168
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,021
And other freshman representative,
Hideki Ryuga.

169
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,773
Oh! Yeah...

170
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,192
Hideki Ryuga, the pop idol?!

171
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,737
Couldn't be... There's no way
he's smart enough to enter To-oh.

172
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:22,700
Ah... You're right. He doesn't even
look anything like him.

173
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,376
<i>I heard I was going to be giving
the address with someone else, but...</i>

174
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,670
<i>I never thought
it was going to be him.</i>

175
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:40,176
<i>He's the guy who was sitting weird
behind me on the first day of the Exams.</i>

176
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,929
<i>He completely stood out...
from everyone else.</i>

177
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,059
Life springs renewed
in the breath of Spring...

178
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,229
The person who scored highest on
the test is supposed to do this, right?

179
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,773
That just means that there were
two top scorers this year...

180
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,734
I heard they both
scored 100% in all subjects.

181
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:57,902
Seriously?!

182
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,821
I guess there really are
people like that.

183
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,074
I definitely like the guy on the right!

184
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,077
Whatâ€?! Kyoko, you're weird!

185
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,453
Most people would choose
the one on the left.

186
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,712
But those two sure are different...

187
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,796
Yeah...

188
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,717
One looks like a brilliant genius
from a sheltered family.

189
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,218
The other...

190
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,430
Life springs renewed
in the breath of Spring...

191
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,433
Seems wild...
Or at least very weird...

192
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,269
Is that what people
would call a genius?

193
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,521
He's doing the address...

194
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,481
for the To-oh entrance ceremony
dressed like that.

195
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,775
He is either not taking this seriously
or an idiot.

196
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,028
Thank you very much...
Hideki Ryuga.

197
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,583
Yagami...

198
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:58,671
You are the son of Soichiro Yagami,
Detective Superintendent of the NPA.

199
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,340
You have a sense of justice

200
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,383
which rivals that of
your respect for your father.

201
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,135
<i>What is with this guy?</i>

202
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,222
You aim to become an NPA official...

203
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,685
and have helped the police to
solve several cases in the past.

204
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,688
You're now showing great interest
in the Kira case.

205
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,983
I have faith in your sense of
justice and abilities,

206
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,153
and if you swear not to tell anyone,

207
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,824
I'll tell you something very important
concerning the Kira case.

208
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,118
<i>What is this all of a sudden?</i>

209
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,497
<i>Should I just ignore him?</i>

210
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,459
<i>But what is this important information
concerning the Kira case?</i>

211
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,712
I won't tell anyone. What is it?

212
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,636
I'm L.

213
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,228
<i>I- It couldn't be!
What is he talking about?!</i>

214
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,814
<i>There's no way that
L would say that he's L.</i>

215
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,526
<i>I thought he was weird,
but is he actually insane?</i>

216
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,695
<i>T- This isn't good.</i>

217
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,408
<i>Don't be shocked.
If he really is L...</i>

218
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,953
<i>I have to act naturally,</i>

219
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,415
<i>like how
Soichiro Yagami's son, Light would act.</i>

220
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:24,173
If you truly are who you say you are,
I respect and admire you.

221
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,800
Thank you...

222
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,302
I revealed myself
because I think that

223
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,431
you can be of help in solving
the Kira case.

224
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,058
<i>Light Yagami...</i>

225
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,228
<i>The probability that you are Kira
is just under five percent.</i>

226
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,857
<i>But out of everyone we were watching,
I sensed something from you.</i>

227
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,234
<i>You're too perfect.</i>

228
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:48,114
<i>And if you're Kira, there's nothing that
could pressure you more than this.</i>

229
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:53,828
If this guy's really L,
he's something else.

230
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,081
<i>Indeed... if he really is L.</i>

231
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,334
<i>No, even if he isn't L...</i>

232
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,253
<i>I...</i>

233
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,965
<i>I can't do anything to him!</i>

234
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,636
<i>If what he's saying is true,</i>

235
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,264
<i>he's probably already shown
his face to my father.</i>

236
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,685
<i>If he dies as soon as he reveals
himself to me,</i>

237
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,937
<i>then it would immediately
cast suspicion onto me.</i>

238
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,776
<i>And he's using an obvious
alias like "Hideki Ryuga. "</i>

239
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,280
<i>If his name really
isn't Hideki Ryuga</i>

240
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,408
<i>and I try to kill him by writing
his name in the Death Note...</i>

241
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,997
<i>and he may die instead...</i>

242
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,126
<i>But he won't die and
he'll infer that I'm Kira.</i>

243
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,004
<i>Is he really Lâ€?</i>

244
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,965
<i>And does he suspect that I'm Kira?</i>

245
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,178
<i>I don't know how much he knows,
but I'm sure he suspects me.</i>

246
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,641
<i>There's no other reason for him to
tell Soichiro Yagami's son that he's L.</i>

247
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,186
<i>Does this mean that
he's still focusing on</i>

248
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,313
<i>the people that
Raye Penber was investigating?</i>

249
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,192
<i>But why would L approach
me directlyâ€?</i>

250
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,447
<i>Not now...
It's better to keep my mind blank.</i>

251
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,991
<i>I need to look calm.</i>

252
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:19,580
<i>He's definitely watching me to
see if I'm rattled or not...</i>

253
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,253
2007 TO-OH UNIVERSITY
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

254
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,386
Light, that was a fun
college entrance ceremony.

255
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,142
Yagami.

256
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,354
Hey, Light... He's calling you.

257
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,898
It was nice to meet you...

258
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,692
No, the pleasure was all mine...

259
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,655
What an amazing car...

260
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,864
A limousine?

261
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,242
Well, I'll see you around campus.

262
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,577
Oh, yeah.

263
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,331
Where is that rich kid from?

264
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,459
And he's even at the top of the class?
What a jerk.

265
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,190
Welcome home,
To-oh University student!

266
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,580
Damn it! He got me!

267
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,123
He "got you"...?

268
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,461
Damn it, L... I've never been
so humiliated in my life!

269
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:53,132
Hey, why don't you just do
the Shinigami eye deal with me

270
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,759
and just kill him?

271
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,596
What good would that
do if this is a trap?!

272
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:03,893
If he's not really L, then that would
be just like telling L that I'm Kira!

273
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,936
S- Sorry...

274
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,981
Shinigami killing people and

275
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,401
humans killing people
aren't the same thing.

276
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,905
I want to kill him,
no matter what it takes,

277
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,698
but if I do,
it'll be traced back to me...

278
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,827
The Death Note can only kill
a person whose name I write in it...

279
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,830
I cannot control someone
to kill someone else.

280
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,584
The Death Note is
a pain in the ass!

281
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,712
<i>Light is usually calm,
but he's fuming now...</i>

282
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,297
<i>He's pretty annoyed.</i>

283
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,675
At first, I thought that when
I found out his name,

284
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,219
I'd have him get in
an accident or commit suicide.

285
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:43,933
But it's no good unless
I know a hundred percent that he's L.

286
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:50,648
No. Even if I do know it's him,
it may be too late.

287
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,985
No matter what the cause of death,
if L dies, I'll cast suspicion on me...

288
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,780
I underestimated him...

289
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,245
I never thought that I would
come up to me and say, "I'm L!"

290
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,332
<i>He just has to tell all
the suspects that he is L.</i>

291
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,044
Even if he's his double...

292
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:19,176
This is a solid defense as well as
an attack against Kira.

293
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,179
He beat me...
It was a good move...

294
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,643
<i>Ryuga will continue to play dumb and
probably continue to approach me</i>

295
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,770
<i>and manipulate me at the university...</i>

296
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,953
This is great...

297
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,456
There's nothing to worry about.

298
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,876
This proves that they don't have
anything on me...

299
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,546
It's a contest between L and me.

300
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,423
It's a game of wits!

301
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,010
On the surface, we'll be
friendly acquaintances on campus.

302
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,889
In reality, we'll be investigating each other,
"Are you L?" or "Are you Kira?"

303
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,849
This will be fun, Ryuga.

304
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,812
If it's friendship you want from me,
I'll gladly accept.

305
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,565
I'll make you trust me...

306
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,611
And once I've pulled everything
out of you, I will kill you...

307
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,905
with my own hands!

308
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,202
TO BE CONTINUED

309
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:31,499
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

310
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:36,921
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

311
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,508
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

312
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:45,930
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

313
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:52,311
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

314
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,899
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

315
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:02,571
<i>I can't hold back
the flooding impulses</i>

316
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,450
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

317
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:10,037
<i>To accomplish</i>

318
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:20,923
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

319
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,970
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

320
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:31,892
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

321
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,190
PREVIEW

322
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,863
There's no way that he could
profile me with this tennis game.

323
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,447
He has some other goal in mind.

324
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,325
But even if it is tennis,
I will win!

325
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,203
DOUBT
