1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,506
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,217
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:18,519
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,536
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,706
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:48,340
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,641
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,521
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,405
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:17,286
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,964
DOUBT

17
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,726
You surprised me, Ryuga.

18
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,020
I never thought that you'd
come out and ask me

19
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,605
to play some tennis to get
to know each other.

20
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,231
Is it a problem?

21
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,359
Not at all. But did you know

22
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,777
how good I am?

23
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,530
Don't worry, Yagami.

24
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,659
I was once the British Junior Champion.

25
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,996
<i>If I ask him if he's British,</i>

26
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,165
<i>is he going to think that I'm trying
to find out more because I'm Kira?</i>

27
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,500
<i>Whatever. I'll give it a try.</i>

28
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,086
Ryuga, were you raised in Britain?

29
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,423
I lived in Britain for five years, but...

30
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:17,012
Don't worry. There's nothing there
that can reveal L's identity.

31
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,889
<i>Oh, really...</i>

32
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,685
So the first to win a set or six games
wins the match. Is that okay?

33
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,312
All right.

34
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,529
<i>This is just a friendly game of tennis.</i>

35
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,741
<i>This isn't a test to determine
if Light is Kira.</i>

36
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,578
<i>But Kira hates to lose.</i>

37
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,380
Fifteen, love.

38
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,967
Hey, hey, Ryuga.
You're serious right from the start!

39
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,761
He who makes the first move wins.

40
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,931
What do you mean that you can't say?

41
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,766
I'm very sorry.

42
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,601
Under L's orders,

43
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,312
no one outside the task force can know,
even you, Deputy Director General.

44
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,732
Even what you are doing and
where you're doing it, huh?

45
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,526
I'm very sorry.

46
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,823
You know, Yagami...

47
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:22,327
It's been more than four months since
this case has come to light.

48
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,707
People are saying that
the police and L are incompetent...

49
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,583
With all due respect, Sir, but...

50
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,086
Can you really call the police
competent for

51
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,963
putting their tails between
their legs in fear of Kira?

52
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,509
You should see how many people
are left at task force headquarters!

53
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,636
If you're worried about
what people are saying,

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,513
then try not to let them know that

55
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,016
most detectives
have run away from Kira!

56
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,145
Excuse me.

57
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,856
Yagami.

58
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,777
How is L?
Can he be trusted?

59
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,281
I think he's much more
capable than we are.

60
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,368
He's putting his life at
stake right now.

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,877
Are they really amateurs?
Who are they?

62
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,588
They're Light Yagami and
Hideki Ryuga.

63
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,883
The ones who entered
this year with top scores.

64
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,554
<i>Don't worry, Yagami.
Kira hates to lose, but...</i>

65
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,057
<i>Most people don't like to lose either.
It's not just Kira.</i>

66
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,061
<i>Is getting worked up and going
for the win something Kira would do?</i>

67
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,272
<i>Even so, if I lose on purpose,</i>

68
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,317
<i>he'll think that getting worked up
and winning is like Kira,</i>

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,653
<i>so losing on purpose is
also like Kira... right?</i>

70
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,114
<i>In the end,
it's the same thing.</i>

71
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,785
<i>There's no way that he would
profile me through this tennis game.</i>

72
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,287
<i>He has some other goal in mind.</i>

73
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,248
<i>But even if it is just tennis...</i>

74
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,083
<i>I will win!</i>

75
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,925
<i>See? He's trying to win.</i>

76
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,928
Game count, four games all.

77
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,764
All of a sudden...

78
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,350
there's a chair and line umpire!

79
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,060
Sir!

80
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,855
I thought I'd heard of Light Yagami
somewhere, so I looked him up.

81
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,608
It seems he was the Junior High Champion
in 2002 and 2003.

82
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,027
During the Junior High third-year
commendation ceremony...

83
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,112
he announced that he'd only
play in junior high.

84
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,448
He hasn't played in
any tournaments since.

85
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:24,991
Hey, hey!

86
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,452
So what about Ryuga?

87
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,038
He's holding his own with
the junior high champion.

88
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,086
<i>I can read your feelings,
Light Yagami.</i>

89
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,631
<i>As if we'd really get to know each other
by playing tennis.</i>

90
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,216
<i>We're just going through
the motions...</i>

91
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,969
<i>Just so we can say
we're better friends.</i>

92
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,888
<i>By playing this match with you,
you'll think...</i>

93
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,393
<i>that I am preparing to take a step
closer to you.</i>

94
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,146
<i>And then you're gonna try to
get me to say something</i>

95
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,566
<i>only Kira would know.</i>

96
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,736
<i>But you'll tell me you'll need to know
if you can trust me first.</i>

97
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,031
<i>And try to get me to give you details
on the Kira case...</i>

98
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,826
<i>If I want to talk about
the Kira case...</i>

99
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,705
<i>I'm going to have to ask
him for proof</i>

100
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,250
<i>that he's currently in charge of
the Kira Case.</i>

101
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,921
<i>So the first thing you're going to
want out Oo me is...</i>

102
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,467
<i>proof that you really are L
from a third party.</i>

103
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,261
<i>In other words,</i>

104
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,805
<i>â€ we'll go to the task force headquarters!
â€ we'll go to the task force headquarters!</i>

105
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,559
<i>In life, one cannot win
just by playing defense.</i>

106
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,145
<i>To win...
You need to attack.</i>

107
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,233
Game set. Won by Yagami.

108
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,360
Six games to four!

109
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,195
Wow...!

110
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,285
As I expected of you. I lost.

111
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,955
Ryuga, it's been a while since
I've played seriously.

112
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,082
I'm thirsty.

113
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,209
And I have something I want
to ask you,

114
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,794
so do you want to go
get a drink afterwards?

115
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,424
I've lost the game,
so I'll tell you whatever I can.

116
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,095
But before that,
I have something I must tell you.

117
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,430
What is it?

118
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:15,226
Yagami, I suspect that
you may in fact be Kira.

119
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,355
If you still want to ask me
knowing that, go ahead.

120
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,736
I'm Kira?

121
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,739
Well, even though I say
I suspect you,

122
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,823
it's only a one-percent possibility.

123
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:30,700
Leaving that aside,

124
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,036
once I'm sure that you aren't Kira and

125
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,289
because you have
sharp reasoning abilities,

126
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,085
I'd like for you to work with me
on this investigation.

127
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,589
<i>One-percent, huh?</i>

128
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,424
<i>Nicely worded.</i>

129
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,552
<i>Even if he suspects me
just a little,</i>

130
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,388
<i>it still means that it won't do
any good</i>

131
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,264
<i>if I ask him to meet
someone from the task force.</i>

132
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,976
<i>Which means he beat me
to the punch.</i>

133
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,811
<i>He beat me.</i>

134
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,608
This coffee shop is
one of my favorites.

135
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,153
If we sit here, there's no chance
of anyone overhearing us.

136
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,031
Thank you for choosing the perfect place.

137
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,786
We don't have to worry about
how we sit here either.

138
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,456
I have to sit like this.

139
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,461
If I sit normally, my reasoning skills
drop by forty percent.

140
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,798
So... what did you want to ask me?

141
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,383
Oh yeah.

142
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,927
That can wait until
you're sure that I'm not Kira.

143
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,388
You can talk about whatever
you want to, Ryuga.

144
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:40,145
Then excuse me, but do you mind
if I test your reasoning abilities?

145
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,314
Yeah, okay. Sounds like fun.

146
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,277
Then first... please take a look at this.

147
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:54,117
These three are pictures of notes that
we believe were written

148
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,787
by criminals in prison right before they died,
while under Kira's control.

149
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,666
Please tell me what you think.

150
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,295
This is interesting.

151
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,798
<i>Really, this is child's play...</i>

152
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,177
<i>The print number is written on
the back of these photographs.</i>

153
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,845
<i>If I paid no attention to this...</i>

154
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,058
<i>And correctly unscrambled
the sentence the way Kira wrote it,</i>

155
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,687
<i>There'd be a strong possibility that
I'd be Kira.</i>

156
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:28,818
<i>But just because I solve this code
doesn't prove I'm Kira.</i>

157
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:35,116
It would be amazing if Kira
could not only inflict death on others,

158
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,493
but control his victims'
actions as well.

159
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,748
And there's a message
encoded here taunting you.

160
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,919
When we rearrange the messages and
look at the top letters of each line,

161
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,378
they form another sentence.

162
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,049
Rearranging it into a message
which makes sense would probably be...

163
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,971
L DO YOU KNOW GODS OF
DEATH EAT ONLY APPLES

164
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,642
But there are print numbers
in the back...

165
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,186
When we arrange them in that order...

166
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:08,066
L DO YOU KNOW EAT ONLY
APPLES GODS OF DEATH

167
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,319
It doesn't make sense and
it's hard to think that

168
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,947
Kira would have wanted you
to read it this way.

169
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,032
Incorrect.

170
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,828
There are actually
four photographs.

171
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,789
When we add this one,
this is what it reads...

172
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,503
"L, do you know? Gods of Death who
love apples have red hands. "

173
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,633
<i>It's a fake. I never had a criminal write
this message.</i>

174
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,260
<i>Is he stupid?</i>

175
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,722
But even with the three photographs,
my deduction was perfect, wasn't it?

176
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,307
It wasn't perfect.

177
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,768
The truth is that there
are four of them.

178
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,146
It would have been perfect if
you'd figured out there was another.

179
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,275
Yagami, even though you knew
the message wasn't finished,

180
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,443
you decided that there were
only three notes.

181
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,445
You didn't guess
that there was a fourth.

182
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,156
This is also true...

183
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,824
<i>Damn him...</i>

184
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,828
<i>I see. He wasn't just gauging
my reasoning abilities.</i>

185
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,454
<i>He's trying to get me to reveal myself.</i>

186
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,416
<i>If I latch onto this,
I'll play right into his hands.</i>

187
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,211
Hmm... I hadn't thought that far.

188
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,757
Well, whatever the case, it's not
a message that would lead to Kira.

189
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,968
Shinigami don't exist.

190
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:23,600
Then if you were me, faced with
someone who might be Kira,

191
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,476
how would you check
if he was Kira?

192
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,479
I would try to have him say
something

193
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,649
that wasn't broadcast to the public,
that only Kira would know.

194
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,235
What you were doing just now.

195
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,196
That's amazing.

196
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,200
I've asked several detectives
that same question,

197
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,369
but most of them needed
a few minutes to answer.

198
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,121
And... you immediately thought
of a scenario

199
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,417
in which Kira is talking to the investigator.

200
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,088
Your reasoning abilities are amazing.

201
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:00,553
The more impressive my answers,
the more of a suspect I become, it seems.

202
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,181
Yes. By about three percent.

203
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:09,020
But in that respect, it's made me
more determined to work with you.

204
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,815
Even if you are Kira,

205
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,903
I would like for us to work together
on this investigation.

206
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,197
Do you know why?

207
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,826
If I cooperate with you,
the investigation will move forward,

208
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,663
and if I really am Kira,
I might reveal myself.

209
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,541
In other words, conduct the investigation
while investigating me all at once.

210
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,877
I think it's a great idea...

211
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,047
But aren't you getting
the wrong idea, Ryuga?

212
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:41,094
I'm interested in the Kira case and I
conduct detective work as a hobby, but..

213
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,931
<i>I am not Kira,
and I don't want him to kill me.</i>

214
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,977
First of all, I have no proof
that you aren't Kira, either.

215
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,523
It would be strange for just
one of us to be investigated, right?

216
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,567
Neither of us have proof
that we aren't Kira.

217
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,572
But Ryuga, if you are L,
I'm sure you can show me proof of that.

218
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,993
Like having someone in the task force
or my father

219
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:08,121
tell me that you are really L
in person.

220
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,666
If you can't,
I can't investigate with you.

221
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,420
<i>You talk a lot, don't you,
Light Yagami?</i>

222
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,755
<i>Typical for someone who hates
to lose.</i>

223
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,592
<i>Seven percent... could he really be...?</i>

224
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,805
I never said that
I wouldn't let you meet anyone

225
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,932
from the task force headquarters.

226
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,017
What?

227
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,604
I am currently working
with your father.

228
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:39,360
If I take you to headquarters,
you'll help with the investigation.

229
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,363
Am I right in thinking that?

230
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,825
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

231
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,039
Excuse me.

232
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,623
Oh, me too.

233
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,209
Yes?

234
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,170
<i>Ryuzaki, something terrible
has happened!</i>

235
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,339
<i>Light, your father's had aâ€!</i>

236
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:00,882
Yagami!

237
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,469
My father had... a heart attack!

238
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,525
Well, see you tomorrow.

239
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,402
I'll bring your things that you need.

240
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,780
Light, I leave the rest to you.

241
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,239
Okay.

242
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,747
You're sure it's just fatigue, right?

243
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:37,877
Yeah. When I collapsed,
I thought it was Kira, but I'm all right.

244
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,963
I've been pushing myself
a bit hard lately.

245
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,635
Especially since your son
has been suspected of being Kira.

246
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,678
You've said that to my father?

247
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,598
Yes, I've told him everything.

248
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,142
Even the fact that I'm L.

249
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,022
That's right. He's L.

250
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,860
We call him Ryuzaki so others
can't find out,

251
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,695
but there's no mistaking it. He is L.

252
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,699
<i>He's the real L.
My father says so.</i>

253
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,120
<i>Probably the same L who has
been ordering the NPA until now.</i>

254
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,623
<i>If I get rid of him and
the task force...</i>

255
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,835
<i>No, it's probably not
that simple.</i>

256
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,131
<i>There's no need to rush.
I'll have time to investigate...</i>

257
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,425
<i>At any rate,</i>

258
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,427
<i>I have to be the Light Yagami
who is worried about his father.</i>

259
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,265
So Ryuzaki, has talking
with my son,

260
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,975
cleared away your suspicions?

261
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,562
I'll say that I suspect him,
but it's only a little.

262
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,273
I'll explain once more.

263
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,735
Kira killed twelve FBI agents
who entered Japan.

264
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,865
They were tracking those who
were connected to the Japanese police.

265
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,118
One of them was Raye Penber...

266
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,329
There were many suspicious things
surrounding his death.

267
00:15:56,414 --> 00:16:00,501
And I was one of the people
he was investigating.

268
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,171
It's no wonder I'm a suspect.

269
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,673
No, it's as Ryuga says...

270
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,800
There is no one else to suspect.

271
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,012
Your reasoning skills
are quite impressive.

272
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,514
You're always quick and accurate

273
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,350
Ryuga, I'll cooperate with you
on this investigation.

274
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,271
My father has vouched that you're L.

275
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:25,276
Also, I want to catch Kira
and prove that I'm not him.

276
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:26,944
Light...

277
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,657
You're going to have to start studying
soon to enter the NPA.

278
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,076
It won't be too late to
do this afterwards.

279
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,245
Dad, what are you talking about?

280
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,372
I don't know how many years
that'll take.

281
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:44,045
I promised you, didn't I?
If something happened to you...

282
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,215
I'll be the one to
send Kira to his execution...

283
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,220
<i>There's no way that
my son can be Kira.</i>

284
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,226
<i>It's hard to believe this is all an act.
No, if it is an act, it's just way too corny.</i>

285
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,395
Light, listen to me...

286
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,566
The fact of the matter is...
Kira is evil.

287
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,112
But recently, I've been thinking
about it in this way...

288
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,908
The real evil is the power
to kill people.

289
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,329
People who gain
that kind of power are unlucky...

290
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,748
No matter how you use it,

291
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:26,420
nothing gained by killing people
can bring true happiness.

292
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,923
It's as he says.

293
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:34,178
If Kira is an ordinary person
who gained this power,

294
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,430
then he is a very unlucky person.

295
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,934
Ryuzaki, I'm sorry for
causing you trouble.

296
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,478
I'll try to get better quickly.

297
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,063
Excuse me...

298
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,691
Visiting hours are now over.

299
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,533
Ryuga.

300
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,912
Is there any way that I can get
you to believe that I'm not Kira?

301
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,917
If you aren't Kira, there wouldn't
be any need to do that.

302
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:10,590
Cut that out! Think about how
it feels to be accused of being Kira.

303
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,303
It feels horrible.

304
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:22,518
How about keeping watch over me
in a place without TV or anything for a month?

305
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,315
<i>Would someone really go
that far to clear their name?</i>

306
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,191
I can't do that.

307
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,361
I can't do anything which would
deprive you of basic human rights.

308
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,654
And furthermore...

309
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,824
It's nonsense to take suggestions
from a suspect.

310
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,035
I see...

311
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,746
It's all right.

312
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,124
If you aren't Kira, it will become
apparent eventually.

313
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,544
Also, during that exchange
with your father...

314
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,963
I thought that you might not be Kira.

315
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,133
Well then, take good care of your father.

316
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,135
Oh, one more thing.

317
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,512
I said that I would cooperate
with the investigation,

318
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,183
but I don't think I can do anything
until my father is well again.

319
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,060
I understand.

320
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,603
Well then...

321
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,400
<i>Hideki Ryuga... Ryuzaki...</i>

322
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,321
<i>He's the L I've been fighting.</i>

323
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,115
<i>What is his real name?</i>

324
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,329
<i>Light Yagami... are you Kira?</i>

325
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:26,957
Ryuk...

326
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,670
I never once felt unlucky since

327
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,547
I picked up this notebook
and gained this power.

328
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,969
I'm very happy, and

329
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,013
I'll create a wonderful world...

330
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,641
I couldn't care less

331
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:48,646
if finding the notebook's made
you happy or unlucky.

332
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,564
But...

333
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,110
It seems people who have Shinigami
attached to them

334
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,861
experience nothing but misfortune.

335
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,953
Then I shall show you
an exception to the rule.

336
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,123
I appreciate that.

337
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,254
What is it? Is this the only plan
you can think of?!

338
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,505
You think that we'll get ratings

339
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,592
if we do any kind of special program
on Kira, don't you?

340
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,887
We've been getting ratings

341
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,266
because we cover stories that
other stations don't!

342
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,600
Understand?

343
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,520
The problem is with the story.

344
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,856
Someone bring me a good story!

345
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,985
But the police are keeping
quiet about this. It's hopeless.

346
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:40,865
Idiots! If we don't have any stories,
just make something up!

347
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,036
Director Demegawa,
a special delivery.

348
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,289
What is this?

349
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,708
Who is this from?

350
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,634
This is what I'm talking about.
This is the stuff I want you to come up with...

351
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,763
This is just too good.

352
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,515
"A message to the world from Kira. "

353
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,018
"if you don't broadcast this...

354
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,730
"I'll kill you all, starting from
your company's president..

355
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,648
Who wouldn't air this?

356
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,402
This is amazing,
if it's real.

357
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:22,490
I'm so happy,
my heart's racing!

358
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,160
TO BE CONTINUED

359
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:31,499
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

360
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:36,921
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

361
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,508
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

362
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:45,930
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

363
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:52,311
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

364
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,899
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

365
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:02,571
<i>I can't hold back
the flooding impulses</i>

366
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,408
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

367
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,037
<i>To accomplish</i>

368
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:20,923
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

369
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,970
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

370
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,809
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

371
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,773
PREVIEW

372
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,610
L might be finished within
the next four days.

373
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,655
God is really on my side.

374
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,492
Only this time, it's not really God,
but a Shinigami, a God of Death.

375
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,120
ASSAULT
