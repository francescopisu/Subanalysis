<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:19,454
<i>Are you worried?</i>

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,381
<i>And when you know I'm Kira,
we'll get married!</i>

23
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,551
And so...

24
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,303
Higuchi is Kira.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,723
GUIDANCE

26
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,278
<i>If the killing of criminals stops,</i>

27
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,032
<i>Higuchi probably has Kira's powers...</i>

28
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,825
<i>Still...</i>

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,747
<i>I knew that Amane would do
anything for Light Yagami, but...</i>

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,832
<i>I never thought
she would go this far.</i>

31
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,668
<i>If the killing of criminals stops...</i>

32
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,088
<i>it will become difﬁcult to deduce
the method of killing.</i>

33
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,091
<i>I have to think of a plan...</i>

34
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,220
Misa, how did you get
Higuchi to say that?

35
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,307
Huh? He's totally in love with me.

36
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,018
I told him that I'd marry him
if he was Kira.

37
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,897
And he thinks that
I'm the Second Kira.

38
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,443
<i>If I don't say this now,
I'll probably contradict myself later...</i>

39
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,656
You idiot!
We told you to deny all of that.

40
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,076
B- But... now we know that
Higuchi is Kira...

41
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,702
we can just catch him.

42
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,956
I suppose you could call this
a victory, right, Mr. Matsuda?

43
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,876
In our current situation,

44
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,045
we still don't know how
he kills his victims.

45
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,381
Yes...

46
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:57,511
Before we catch Higuchi,
I want to know how he kills people.

47
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,973
If criminals stop dying,
we won't be able to figure it out.

48
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,183
Isn't that right?

49
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,645
Yes. Even if we're going to
arrest Higuchi,

50
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,898
we'll do it when we're sure
that criminals have stopped dying.

51
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,651
Please let me think for a moment.

52
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,862
Wed)’-

53
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,155
<i>Yes.</i>

54
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,032
What's the current situation?

55
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,534
<i>Everything's going smoothly.</i>

56
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,786
<i>We should be able to track...</i>

57
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,789
70% of the seven's actions with
our cameras while they're in the building.

58
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,624
What about outside of the building?

59
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,627
That's impossible with
just Watari and me.

60
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,380
How about just focusing
on Higuchi?

61
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,923
Higuchi?

62
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,218
I've only been inside
five of their houses...

63
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:43,056
But Mido, Namikawa, and Higuchi's
houses have serious security systems.

64
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,683
Especially Higuchi. He's...

65
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,811
recently constructed an underground
room that blocks out electronic waves.

66
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,731
It took me two days to break in.

67
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,525
Higuchi is definitely suspicious.

68
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,777
All right.

69
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,197
Then please install wire-taps,
tracking devices, and cameras...

70
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,033
in Higuchi's car,
rather than his house

71
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,202
<i>What? After all this...?</i>

72
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,330
<i>Do you know how difﬁcult it is
to get inside someone's house?</i>

73
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,167
<i>Besides, how many cars
do you think Higuchi has?</i>

74
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,376
Six.

75
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,964
<i>All right. I just have to install them
in all of his cars, right?</i>

76
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,300
Please do.

77
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,389
<i>Whoa... I would have been in trouble
if he'd been wire-tapped earlier.</i>

78
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,439
Yagami, sorry for coming
back to this topic, but...

79
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,233
I have to ask you again.

80
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,110
Ask me what?

81
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,906
Do you remember how to kill?

82
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,160
You're still saying that?

83
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,704
I'm not Kira. How many times do |...!

84
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,664
Just answer the question.

85
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,750
Do you remember?

86
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,086
I don't...

87
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,713
Misa, what about you?

88
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,925
I don't remember and I'm not Kira.

89
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,596
Yagami, please seriously
analyze and deduce...

90
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,142
what I'm going to say.

91
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,104
Your answer will determine
if we can catch Kira.

92
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,108
Light Yagami was Kira.

93
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,612
And Kira's power passed on
to someone else.

94
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,325
Right now, Light Yagami doesn't
remember that he was Kira.

95
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,702
Give me your thoughts based
on this premise.

96
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,872
Can you think about it in that way?

97
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,124
Yeah, I'll give it a try.

98
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,963
<i>Light Yagami was Kira.</i>

99
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,799
<i>And Kira's power
passed to someone else.</i>

100
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,219
<i>Did it pass on through
Light Yagami's will?</i>

101
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,847
<i>Or was there someone behind
Light Yagami</i>

102
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,348
<i>who gave him Kira's power?</i>

103
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,644
<i>Did that person pass
Light Yagami's power to someone else?</i>

104
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,827
Under those circumstances,
it would be Light Yagami's choice.

105
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,957
Of course it is.

106
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,670
If there was someone who was
moving that power from person to person

107
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,172
and didn't want the method
of murder to be discovered,

108
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,051
it's strange that he took so long to
move it from you to someone else.

109
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,682
If we acknowledge the existence of
someone watching us from above,

110
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,685
he would be impossible to catch...

111
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,521
and I'd either be dead already,

112
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:41,067
or be toyed with, forever...
in the palm of his hand.

113
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,696
It's highly unlikely
such a being exists.

114
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,784
<i>Even if Light Yagami was Kira...</i>

115
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:55,832
<i>Kira's power can only move
by the will of the person who has it.</i>

116
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,712
Yagami, thanks to you,
I feel 99% better.

117
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,808
We shall create a situation

118
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,019
where Higuchi cannot pass
his power on to anyone else,

119
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,063
and have him show us how he kills.

120
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,356
What are you going to do?

121
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,359
I'm going to trick Higuchi
using Sakura TV.

122
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,777
A hidden camera show?

123
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,070
What's that?

124
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,490
The Kira Special that Demegawa
airs every week...

125
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,034
We'll take up a three-hour time slot
and right at the beginning,

126
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,038
we'll say that at the end of the program,
we're going to announce who Kira is.

127
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,832
Will he believe that?

128
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,584
We're talking about
Sakura TV, right?

129
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,963
Besides, Higuchi might not
watch that program.

130
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,924
We'll contact Namikawa
and have him call Higuchi and say,

131
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,512
"This is bad. Turn on your

132
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,683
Higuchi will believe us when
he realizes that the person on

133
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,434
knows his secret.

134
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,104
I see. So we're going to use Aiber.

135
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,107
He'll reveal that he was
really a spy.

136
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,361
Not by a long shot.
We won't use Aiber.

137
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,991
The person who appears
on that show...

138
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,452
has to be someone who
Higuchi thinks he can kill...

139
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,500
In other words, someone whose name
he can easily look up.

140
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,586
Is there anyone who can do it?

141
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,715
Only Mr. Matsuda can do it.

142
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,882
Matsu!

143
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,259
Matsuda, huh?

144
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,471
Higuchi probably thinks that you
were listening in on their meeting.

145
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,017
He'll believe that the manager
he thought was dead would rat him out.

146
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,060
That's right.

147
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,063
I'll have Sakura TV prepare
the glass privacy screen and voice filter

148
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,815
they always use for witnesses.

149
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,485
Higuchi would probably realize from
the announcement and the silhouette

150
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,862
that it's Matsui, the manager.

151
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,448
We'll have the station make
a mistake and accidentally flash

152
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,325
the face of the person behind
the glass screen.

153
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,370
Wow! Sounds fun.

154
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,247
<i>- Until the show ends,
- Kira's is identity will be revealed at the end</i>

155
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,834
we'll keep saying that we'll reveal
the real name of H, who's Kira.

156
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,169
In this situation,

157
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,672
Higuchi will have to discover
his name as soon as possible.

158
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,508
We can anticipate Higuchi's actions.

159
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,844
And we'll be able to see
how Kira kills.

160
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,888
After that, we'll apprehend him.

161
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,768
Right now, the only problem
in this plan is...

162
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:25,940
if Higuchi can kill by looking
at someone's face like the Second Kira,

163
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,401
Mr. Matsuda will die.

164
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:33,865
Since you're still alive
and he still wants Misa,

165
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,033
that probably won't happen.

166
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,453
Well, this is a plan for when
the criminals stop dying.

167
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,539
We'll have to watch for two or
three days to see whether that happens.

168
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,211
In that time, Mr. Matsuda must
decide if he wants to do it.

169
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,595
I don't need two or three days.

170
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,598
Please let me do it.

171
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,411
What did you want to talk
to me about in secret?

172
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,249
Namikawa, who do
you think is Kira?

173
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,460
Why do you want to know?

174
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:32,382
Besides... he could be either of you.

175
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,843
No, Shimura's not Kira.

176
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,845
He was just crying to me

177
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,264
about how he can't keep up
with Kira's evil deeds any more.

178
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,268
Shimura, if Mido was Kira,
you would have been killed.

179
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:47,230
No, you and Mido would have
been successful on your own.

180
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,984
You two wouldn't need to hold
those stupid meetings with eight people.

181
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,278
Even I know that.

182
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,989
We're all cooperating because

183
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,448
we're afraid that
Kira's going to kill us.

184
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,619
But if we continue,
the world will some day find out.

185
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,123
No, it won't end until that happens.

186
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,295
So Shimura, let me ask you:
Who do you think is Kira?

187
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,006
Takahashi or Higuchi.

188
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,466
Takahashi is only there to make
Kira look smarter.

189
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,928
He needs someone around
who's less sophisticated than he is.

190
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,515
It seems everyone
already knows...

191
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,310
It's probably Higuchi...

192
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,647
Yeah. Higuchi is the one most
obsessed with money and status.

193
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,900
The way he always says things as if

194
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,653
he's not interested in success
is proof of that.

195
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,574
Still, he's always insulting people
and can't use people well.

196
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,367
That's why he was demoted from

197
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,703
being the head of development
to just a divisional head.

198
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,165
Was I the only one you called here?

199
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,542
I also called Ooi, but...

200
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,254
He said, "You can hold your silly
secret meetings by yourself. "

201
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,758
That sounds like the sort
of impatient thing he'd say.

202
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,885
We know Kida isn't Kira

203
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,764
because he provided the account
to fund and commission Coil.

204
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,227
Namikawa, during the meeting
after Hatori died,

205
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,145
you received a phone call.

206
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,688
Who was it from?

207
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,400
Shimura, you're really sharp...

208
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,655
Kira probably made you a member
because he appreciates your caution.

209
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,746
This is Namikawa.

210
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,166
This is L. Mr. Namikawa,
are you by yourself?

211
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,668
No.

212
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,419
<i>Then chime in as you
see ﬁt once again.</i>

213
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,296
There's no need for that.

214
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,717
There's someone who got suspicious
after you called me during the meeting.

215
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,428
Who's calling you, Namikawa?

216
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,055
It's L.

217
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,186
L, Mido and Shimura are here, but...

218
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,397
I don't think they're Kira.

219
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,649
They seem to be fed up with Kira.

220
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,484
<i>Despite what they say,</i>

221
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,612
<i>they choose to stand back and watch
your face-off with Kira, just as I plan to.</i>

222
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,864
That should be fine.

223
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,367
Tonight, I'm going to catch Kira.

224
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,369
I want you to help me a little.

225
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,832
Higuchi's done, huh?

226
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,208
You knew?

227
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,129
It seems even L can be tricked.

228
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,508
By your reaction,
now I'm 100% sure it's Higuchi.

229
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,553
Namikawa is pretty good...

230
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,015
I was expecting that
considering his looks.

231
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,767
No, Light just made a mistake.

232
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,855
We're going to set Higuchi
in motion with a special on Kira

233
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,732
on Sakura TV which
will air tonight at 7:00.

234
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,443
A few minutes into the program,

235
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,779
I want you to contact Higuchi and
tell him to watch that show.

236
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,449
I won't do anything to the six of you.

237
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,784
<i>If the others who aren't there,</i>

238
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,288
<i>Kida, Takahashi, and Ooi,
try to do something, stop them.</i>

239
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,789
Yes, all right.

240
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,128
So it really is Higuchi.

241
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,465
He'll probably be arrested tonight.

242
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,971
<i>It's been three days since
I stopped killing criminals.</i>

243
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,723
<i>That should be good enough.</i>

244
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,144
<i>Now, If I many the Second Kira,
Misa Amane...</i>

245
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:20,443
<i>I'll have the Shinigami eyes.
And I'll control everything Yotsuba has!</i>

246
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,411
Higuchi,
something horrible's happening.

247
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,997
Turn on Sakura TV.

248
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,336
KIRA'S IDENTITY

249
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,840
What is this?

250
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,843
It's probably a hoax. It's Sakura TV.

251
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,970
<i>At the beginning of the program,</i>

252
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,349
<i>he said that he came across
a meeting of eight people.</i>

253
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,352
<i>Someone who knows
about the meetings?</i>

254
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,063
<i>Who is it? Did someone betray us?</i>

255
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,650
<i>And one of them was killed and
now there are only seven left...</i>

256
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,985
<i>The victim was Mr. H.</i>

257
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,196
<i>H...? Hatori...</i>

258
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,783
<i>If he knows this much...
is he one of the other six?</i>

259
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,118
<i>No, is he Coil?!</i>

260
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,205
<i>He was killed by Kira because
he wanted to leave the meetings.</i>

261
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,292
<i>No. There's no beneﬁt
for him to do this...</i>

262
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,130
<i>But, there's no one else who
knows about those meetings...</i>

263
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,882
<i>No... This guy is...!</i>

264
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,097
I- It's him!

265
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,894
Misa's manager...
I think his name was Matsui!

266
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,729
How is he still alive?!

267
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,818
<i>He just explained that he thought
he was going to be killed.</i>

268
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,779
<i>He took a chance,
pretended to fall out of the condo...</i>

269
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,615
<i>And escaped to a veranda
on the floor below.</i>

270
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,035
<i>No. Just in case, I went home,</i>

271
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,706
<i>I took his name from his business card
and wrote it into the notebook</i>

272
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,668
<i>Was he a former entertainer</i>

273
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,587
<i>who became a manager
under his stage name?</i>

274
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,547
<i>I don't know!</i>

275
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,676
Furthermore, he says that
he's continued to investigate Yotsuba

276
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,928
and figured out who Kira is...

277
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,473
I'm contacting everyone right now.

278
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,017
All right. I'm going to hang up.

279
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,605
<i>Are you all right from that
mishap just now?</i>

280
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,440
<i>Shall we stop?</i>

281
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,485
<i>No... I'm well aware of the danger...</i>

282
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,154
<i>For justice, even if I'm killed...</i>

283
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,239
<i>I shall give it my all until the end!</i>

284
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,450
This is good. That is good!

285
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,662
Don't make the Kira announcement
until the end of the program.

286
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,999
<i>I have to kill him.</i>

287
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,794
<i>If the Second Kira is Misa,
she knows his face,</i>

288
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,338
<i>so she should know
what his name is...</i>

289
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,512
Here it comes!

290
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,890
What the hell? C'mon!

291
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,935
<i>To be honest,
I've been debating whether</i>

292
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,561
<i>I should make
this announcement or not.</i>

293
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,232
<i>But now that I'm here,
I've decided it's my duty to reveal it.</i>

294
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,358
This is not good.

295
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,568
- I don't know when he's going reveal it.
- The announcement will come soon.

296
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,070
Don't change the channel.

297
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,031
<i>Cosme Misa...</i>

298
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,327
<i>Devilish charm...
Angelic shine...</i>

299
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,247
<i>Misa's winning rouge...
Now available for you...</i>

300
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,123
Mido, it's me.

301
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,833
Something bad is happening
on Sakura TV.

302
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,294
Contact your father in
the House of Councilors.

303
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,673
Have the Ministry of Internal Affairs
stop this program.

304
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,425
I'm watching too,
but that's impossible.

305
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,763
<i>No one takes this program seriously
so we'd just look suspicious.</i>

306
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,975
<i>Besides, there's nothing to
fear any more.</i>

307
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,102
<i>That guy just showed his face...</i>

308
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,771
<i>We can conﬁrm that
it's Taro Matsui.</i>

309
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,650
<i>Namikawa is telling everyone
to watch this show.</i>

310
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,987
Somebody out of
the seven of us is Kira.

311
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,738
So, Taro Matsui...

312
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:53,864
<i>will die soon.</i>

313
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:59,495
<i>That's right! I'm the only one who knows
that Taro Matsui is not his real name.</i>

314
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,958
<i>If I say that, then I'll reveal
that I'm Kira.</i>

315
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,129
<i>Everyone!
- You're right.</i>

316
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,172
<i>- Kira'ss identity will become clear soon!
- Talk to you later.</i>

317
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,799
<i>Stay with us!</i>

318
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,426
Damn!

319
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,847
<i>Ryuzaki. Mogi's in front of
Yoshida Productions,</i>

320
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,308
<i>and he's received a call
from Higuchi.</i>

321
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,686
Yes. The next stage has come,
exactly as planned.

322
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,313
<i>Moji, where's Misa?</i>

323
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,149
<i>Oh, Mr. Higuchi, a pleasure doing
business with you.</i>

324
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,694
<i>Misa is taking a much-needed
break right now.</i>

325
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,697
<i>She'll be back tomorrow...</i>

326
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,824
<i>I'm asking you, where is she?!</i>

327
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,244
<i>Well, that's private, she doesn't
want anyone to know...</i>

328
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,332
<i>I'm very sorry.
I can contact her tomorrow.</i>

329
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,293
<i>Damn it... I know his face.</i>

330
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,670
<i>I could kill him at any time
if I only knew his name...!</i>

331
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,883
<i>Was the previous manager
an ex-entertainer?</i>

332
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,134
Pardon?

333
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,510
<i>The guy by the name
of Taro Matsui!</i>

334
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,681
Oh... | came in as a replacement,
so I don't know anything...

335
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,892
If that's the case,
please contact someone at the office...

336
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,437
Oh... but everyone's gone to Okinawa.

337
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,689
Could you call our president?

338
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,984
Wow. It's going exactly as we planned
and it's kinda scary.

339
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,987
Don't be scared. Be happy, Yagami.

340
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,658
<i>I shall broadcast Higuchi's call to
Yoshida Production's president.</i>

341
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,409
<i>This is Higuchi from Yotsuba.</i>

342
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,079
<i>Taro Matsui's not the real name of
the guy who was with you earlier, was it?</i>

343
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,582
<i>- He's getting more and more direct.
- Ah, he was using...</i>

344
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,125
<i>- Higuchi is an idiot.
- his manager's name.</i>

345
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,753
<i>- It's proof that he's losing confidence.
- / see.</i>

346
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,129
So what's his real name?!

347
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,383
<i>I believe it was...
Yamada... no, Yamashita.</i>

348
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,512
<i>And his ﬁrst name...
I don't remember.</i>

349
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,721
Don't screw around!

350
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,516
Remember the names
of the people you hire!

351
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,769
<i>What's with that tone?</i>

352
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,730
<i>I have his personal history
back at the ofﬁce.</i>

353
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,107
Then go back there and tell me.

354
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,526
<i>Give me a break!</i>

355
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,237
<i>We haven't had a company vacation
in over two years!</i>

356
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,823
<i>If you want to know that badly,</i>

357
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,616
<i>I'll tell you the security code
for the ofﬁce's door.</i>

358
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,244
<i>You can go right in and look around.</i>

359
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,457
<i>Personnel ﬁles are in
the desk farthest back to the left.</i>

360
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,252
<i>They're alphabetized in
the bottom drawer.</i>

361
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,962
<i>It's probably Yamashita.</i>

362
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,507
<i>If he's going to say it
at the end of the program,</i>

363
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,134
<i>I still have two hours...</i>

364
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,098
I wonder if he's gonna do it...

365
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,578
I've confirmed Higuchi.

366
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,830
He only has one bag on him.
I'm going after him.

367
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,294
Everything's going according
to plan, isn't it?

368
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,670
Yes.

369
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,927
I Will... kill him...

370
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,680
<i>I've come this far,
I will not be stopped!</i>

371
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,933
<i>Everything will be mine!</i>
