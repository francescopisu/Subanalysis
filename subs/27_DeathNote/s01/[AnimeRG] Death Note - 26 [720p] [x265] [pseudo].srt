00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,332
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern

00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,543

<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,430
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

11
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,475
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,436
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,233
<i>Hey Hey! Subservient People!</i>

15
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

16
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,528
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

17
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,572
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

18
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,407
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

19
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,288
<i>Are you worried?</i>

20
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,634
What's the meaning of this?!

21
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,897
Everyone. Shiniga...!

22
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,962
RENEWAL

23
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,051
<i>I told you that this is
a live worldwide broadcast...</i>

24
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,179
<i>But... this is only being broadcast
in the Kanto region of Japan.</i>

25
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,683
<i>The ﬁrst victim was the perpetrator
of the random murders in Shinjuku.</i>

26
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:26,313
<i>- His crime was only broadcast in Japan.
- ... The suspect has died!</i>

27
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,649
<i>I have been able to
deduce this much...</i>

28
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:36,573
You are in Japan and your first victim
was your guinea pig.

29
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,700
KIRA TASK FORCE HEADQUARTERS

30
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,329
Kira has found a way to obtain information
from the task force headquarters...

31
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,499
There are 141 people within
the police force alone...

32
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,585
who have access to classified
information on the Kira investigation.

33
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,716
But one of the 141 people
or someone close to them...

34
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,260
Kira is definitely among them!

35
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,890
FBI Investigation of Those Involved
with the Japanese Police

36
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,609
December 19. Kira began using
prisoners to conduct tests...

37
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,237
on the actions a victim
can take before death.

38
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,408
In order to eliminate
all of the FBI agents...

39
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,536
...he had to see how far he could
control the deaths of his victims.

40
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,123
Thus, I suspect that Kira
was one of the people

41
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,208
who was being investigated
by the FBI...

42
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,170
between the fourteenth
and the nineteenth.

43
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,843
AN IMPORTANT WITNESS
NAOMI MISORA

44
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,305
Raye Penber's fiancée?
Naomi Misora.

45
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,766
So that's it...

46
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,729
She worked under me on that case
and now she's in Japan.

47
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,690
She was with Penber.

48
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,484
She might have found a clue...

49
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,321
If that's the case,
did Kira get to her first?

50
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,123
LIGHT YAGAMI

51
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,418
Everyone. From now on,
we'll focus our investigation...

52
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,879
on the people Raye Penber
was investigating while in Japan.

53
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,008
Deputy Director General Kitamura
and his family,

54
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,844
and Detective Superintendent Yagami
and his family.

55
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:27,100
I also wish to place wiretaps and
surveillance cameras in both households.

56
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,688
Ryuzaki, are you telling me
that you suspect my son?

57
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,440
I suspect him.

58
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,901
CONTACT WITH LIGHT YAGAMI

59
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,528
I'm L.

60
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,620
<i>Don't worry, Yagami.</i>

61
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,707
<i>Kira hates to lose, but most people
don't like to lose either.</i>

62
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,875
<i>It's not just Kira.</i>

63
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,421
<i>See? He's trying to win.</i>

64
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,926
Yagami, I suspect that you,
may in fact be Kira.

65
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,721
I'm Kira?

66
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:11,019
Ryuga, is there any way that I can get
you to believe that I'm not Kira?

67
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:16,983
If you aren't Kira,
it will become apparent eventually.

68
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,115
KIRA MURDERS,
USING A TELEVISION STATION

69
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,037
<i>- was sent these four tapes.
- no, seventy percent...</i>

70
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,915
<i>It foretells another death
to prove that he is Kira</i>

71
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,211
<i>...and also contains a message
to people all over the world.</i>

72
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,004
<i>I am Kira.</i>

73
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,841
<i>The anchor,
Mr. Kazuhiko Hibima,</i>

74
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,260
<i>will die of a heart attack
at exactly six o'clock.</i>

75
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,846
Something terrible will happen
if we don't stop this broadcast!

76
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,097
You idiot!

77
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,393
Mr. Ukita!

78
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,937
Kira shouldn't be able to
kill without a name!

79
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,230
From what I just saw,

80
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,776
it's not entirely impossible that
he may only need a face to kill...

81
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,949
This is the police!
Stop this program!

82
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,286
<i>There is a high possibility
that this Kira is a fake.</i>

83
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,789
No, we should call him
the Second Kira.

84
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:18,920
Mr. Yagami. May I ask your son
to cooperate in this investigation?

85
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,590
LIGHT YAGAMI IS SUMMONED TO
TASK FORCE HEADQUARTERS

86
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,971
It's exactly the same deduction
as L, I mean Ryuzaki.

87
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,389
<i>When we meet,</i>

88
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,225
<i>we can conﬁrm ourselves,
by showing our Shinigami to each other</i>

89
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,227
What's wrong?!

90
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,688
If there is a code

91
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,567
that only people who have the so-called
Shinigami power can understand...

92
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,485
I can't decode it.

93
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,617
But we should thoroughly check out
the places listed in the diary.

94
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,038
Please be sure to
keep an eye on Light.

95
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,582
In the event that Light is Kira,

96
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,669
the Second Kira might try
to contact him in some way.

97
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:05,675
Also, Mr. Yagami. I would like Mr. Mogi
to keep watch over Light's activities.

98
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,929
MISA AMANE ARRESTED UNDER SUSPICION
OF BEING THE SECOND KIRA

99
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,056
Light! There you are!

100
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,809
I'm Light's girlfriend, Misa Amane.
Pleased to meet you.

101
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,144
I'm Hideki Ryuga.

102
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,145
Huh?

103
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,355
<i>Hideki Ryuga?</i>

104
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,651
This may come as good
and bad news to you, but...

105
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,319
But Misa Amane has just
been taken into custody

106
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,196
under suspicion of being
the Second Kira.

107
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,990
There were hairs and fibers...
among other things,

108
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:33,870
attached to the masking tape sealing
the video tapes the Second Kira sent.

109
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,247
We discovered many matching samples
of evidence in her room.

110
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,500
MISA AMANE'S CONFINEMENT

111
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,336
Ryuzaki! What is this?!

112
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,380
Hurry up and kill me!

113
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,924
You're able to kill me
immediately, right?!

114
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,803
Is this because you admit
to being the Second Kira?

115
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,514
No! I don't know anything
about the Second Kira!

116
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,016
LIGHT YAGAMI IS CONFINED
AT HIS OWN REQUEST

117
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,315
<i>For him to say that he may be Kira?</i>

118
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,733
<i>It's an act...</i>

119
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,152
<i>It's not that you may be Kira,
but that you are Kira...</i>

120
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,613
<i>Light, are you all right?</i>

121
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,576
Yeah... I know I probably look
pretty bad in here,

122
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,081
<i>but this pride,
I'll just have to get rid of it!</i>

123
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:23,628
Ryuzaki! I know I agreed
to be detained and chose to do this...

124
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,132
But now I just clearly realized...
I'm not Kira!

125
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,758
Get me out of here quickly!

126
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,385
What's going on?

127
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:34,639
Two weeks worth of criminals
were murdered all at once yesterday!

128
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,975
<i>I don't understand what's going on...</i>

129
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,436
TWO PEOPLE RELEASED

130
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,772
It seems like all three of them
are at their limit...

131
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,942
Ryuzaki, why are you
still confining Light?

132
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,652
It's already been fifty days...

133
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,116
I'm going to kill you here
and then kill myself.

134
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,367
What are you talking about, Dad?!

135
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,286
- That's crazy!
- Stop it already!

136
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,912
- It would be better if we ran away.
- It's too late, Light...

137
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,707
Stop, Dad, I'm not Kira!

138
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,625
Light...

139
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,170
- from one murderer to another,
- Dad!

140
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,755
I'll see you in hell.

141
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,257
Stop!

142
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,264
It was a convincing performance.

143
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,976
As I promised,
I will end their confinement.

144
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,313
LIGHT YAGAMI IS SUMMONED AGAIN
TO HELP WITH THE INVESTIGATION

145
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,527
so that you and I will be together 24 hours
a day working on the investigation.

146
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,492
YOTSUBA

147
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,371
Checking back, there have been
as many as thirteen such cases

148
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,831
in the past three months...

149
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,501
Is Kira someone from Yotsuba?

150
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,338
I haven't figured that out yet,

151
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,299
but let's investigate this with the
assumption that this is Kira's doing.

152
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,843
Let's thoroughly investigate Yotsuba!

153
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,472
Please be sure not to act
out of panic or haste

154
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,474
and don't take matters into
your own hands.

155
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,310
My name is Taro Matsui.
An agent with Yoshida Productions!

156
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,438
How would you like to use Misa Amane
in your commercials?!

157
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,357
Ryuzaki, are you watching?

158
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,442
The eight who are here,
were having a meeting

159
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,111
to determine who
they would get Kira to kill.

160
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:15,240
If Matsuda dies that would justify
the suspicion against Yotsuba...

161
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,075
Is there anything I can do
to save myself?

162
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,827
Stupid Matsuda...

163
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,913
KYOSUKE HIGUCHI CONFIRMED TO BE KIRA

164
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,206
Good luck, Misa-misa!

165
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,125
I'll start planning the party

166
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,085
to celebrate when you
land this commercial!

167
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,507
It's my dream to become Kira's bride.

168
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,760
Because I'm the Second Kira.

169
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,890
Well, I'm Kira, so...
Marry me, Misa!

170
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,769
And so, Higuchi is Kira.

171
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,771
THE PLAN TO CAPTURE HIGUCHI
IS SET INTO MOTION

172
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,232
I'm going to trick Higuchi
using Sakura TV.

173
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,692
A hidden camera show?

174
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,236
Higuchi, this is bad. Turn on your TV.

175
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,948
<i>So one of these people is Kira, right?</i>

176
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,909
<i>Yes. I have a lot of proof.</i>

177
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,081
It's him!
How is he still alive?!

178
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,378
I've confirmed Higuchi.
I'm going after him.

179
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,505
I'm going after him!

180
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,389
<i>Stop your car.
Pull over to the side of the road.</i>

181
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,808
Rem. Let's make a deal.

182
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,143
"Deal?"

183
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,562
You were speeding.
Show me your driver's license!

184
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,606
Yeah... all right.

185
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,193
Hey!

186
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,153
Higuchi ditched the motorcycle cop
and is on the run!

187
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,613
This is highway patrol-!

188
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:43,536
Everyone! It's too dangerous to
allow further action by Higuchi!

189
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,662
We will proceed to capture him.

190
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,707
Higuchi is now able to kill by
looking at someone's face,

191
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,042
like the Second Kira.

192
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,169
We will capture him
with that in mind!

193
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,468
Stop right there!

194
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,057
Don't you come near me!

195
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,020
HIGUCHI'S CAPTURE

196
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,649
You may not believe me...

197
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,401
But if I write the name of someone
whose face I know in that notebook,

198
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,779
that person dies.

199
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,989
Yeah, there's one in Higuchi's bag.

200
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,993
<i>What's wrong, Mr. Yagami?</i>

201
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,329
A monster!

202
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,002
It's a Shinigami...

203
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,838
<i>There are more than
two notebooks in existence!</i>

204
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,091
<i>This isn't ﬁnished yet...</i>

205
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,718
THE DEATH NOTE AND
AN INQUIRY INTO ITS RULES

206
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,512
"How to use it...

207
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,558
"The human whose name
is written in this note shall die.

208
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,186
"And this last sentence...

209
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,357

212
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,118
<i>Light Yagami and Misa Amane
are alive...</i>

213
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,578
<i>Thirteen days...</i>

214
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,580
<i>This is the only...</i>

215
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,091
<i>The following is the record which
contains everything</i>

216
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,468
<i>I have investigated
on the Kira incident.</i>

217
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,139
<i>The fact that you are
reading this message means</i>

218
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,809
<i>I am no longer alive at this moment.</i>

219
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:35,732
I hereby leave this record
as my firm achievement.

220
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,343
It's been ten days since
Ryuzaki's secret funeral...

221
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,845
It looks like we aren't going to die...

222
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,140
We now know Watari's identity,
but in the end,

223
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,142
we didn't find out anything
about Ryuzaki...

224
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,396
It seems Watari was actually
an amazing inventor.

225
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,441
He created orphanages worldwide

226
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,985
with the fortune built on
numerous patents.

227
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,488
He's a hero! A hero!

228
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:29,619
But we can't continue investigating here
now that L and Watari are gone...

229
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,162
This is tough...

230
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,580
Hmm...

231
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,831
Light, how is it going?

232
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,461
I can remove the entire system
here by tonight.

233
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,547
I don't feel good about it.
It feels like stealing.

234
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,218
I've created a voice like
the one that Ryuzaki used.

235
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,886
We can act like he's still alive

236
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,223
and control the police
as we've been doing, but...

237
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,185
Who will replace L?
Where will we do it?

238
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,187
What'll we do with
the killer notebook?

239
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,398
What are you talking about, Light?!

240
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,650
The only one who can take on
the role of L is you!

241
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,907
If Ryuzaki was killed by Kira
for challenging him...

242
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,700
I don't feel comfortable about it.

243
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,329
Besides that, I'll be tricking
the people of the world...

244
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,417
I understand your feelings,
but you're the only one who can do this.

245
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,294
That's right. Ryuzaki even said so...

246
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,797
You'd be capable of succeeding L.

247
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:30,388
<i>So easy...
It's no fun without Ryuzaki...</i>

248
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,724
Yeah, all right. I'll do it.

249
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,645
But I won't do anything dangerous

250
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,816
like challenging Kira directly
in order to gain clues, like Ryuzaki did.

251
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,276
Is that okay?

252
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,529
Yes. That would be better and safer.

253
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,407
Ryuzaki might have been
too confrontational...

254
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:50,867
In that case...

255
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:55,329
I can do about the same work
with this computer and my own.

256
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,499
It's also possible to be L
from my room at home.

257
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,793
I'll also be Watari.

258
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,589
But it would be difficult to do this
with my mom and little sister around.

259
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,759
It would be good if I could rent
a one-room apartment.

260
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:13,931
There's nothing suspicious about renting
a room for my son to live on his own.

261
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,475
That's right.

262
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:19,437
Then the place he'll be renting out
will be the task force headquarters.

263
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,521
Yes.

264
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,274
All that's left is what to do
with the killer notebook...

265
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,776
There's no need to think too hard...

266
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,279
We'll just have one of the five of us,

267
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,241
one who we trust will never
use the notebook...

268
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,701
hide it somewhere
where no one can get to it.

269
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,371
Chief, please do this!

270
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,790
We can count on you!

271
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,335
You're a pillar of justice!

272
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,462
Me, huh?

273
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,672
All right...

274
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,841
Let's avenge Ryuzaki!

275
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,343
Yeah.

276
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,430
Yes. Kira's still here.
Let's catch him!

277
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:00,144
Well then, let's have a party to
celebrate Light becoming the second L.

278
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,563
Quit fooling around, now's not the time.

279
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,689
Now, now...

280
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:12,990
Light!

281
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,370
It's our first date in a while.
Enjoy yourself a little more...

282
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,541
Misa...

283
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,585
Let's live together.

284
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:25,836
Huh?!

285
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,838
Really?!

286
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,341
Yeah.
I've already rented an apartment.

287
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,428
All right! We're living together!

288
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,846
Misa wins!

289
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,014
"Wins?"

290
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,975
You know, against Kiyomi
and Mari and Yuri.

291
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,143
It's all right, Light.

292
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,021
You only used them to trick L,
didn't you?

293
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,439
I understand.

294
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,441
You won't see them anymore, will you?!

295
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,110
Yeah...

296
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,034
Hey...

297
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,246
So is your score
finally settled with L?

298
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,081
Yeah.

299
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,043
So I shouldn't expect
anything interesting anymore...

300
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,464
That's not true, Ryuk.

301
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,133
Hm?

302
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,217
From now on...

303
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,638
I'll show you the creation
of a new world.

304
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,849
Oh?

305
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,295
Papa!

306
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,550
Papa!

307
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,728
Yotsuba's reconstruction
is just beginning.

308
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,855
Yeah.
Let's do our best!

309
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:51,857
Hm?

310
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,651
Hey... Namikawa?

311
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,154
