1
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,355
It's...

2
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:25,259
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

3
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,739
The larch.

4
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,042
<i>the larch.</i>

5
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,747
Mr. larch, you have heard
the case for the prosecution.

6
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:24,384
Is there anything you wish
to say before I pass sentence?

7
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,421
Well, I'd just like to say,
my lord, I've...

8
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,290
I've got a family--
a wife and six kids--

9
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:34,561
And I hope very much you don't
have to take away my freedom

10
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,864
Because... well,
because, my lord

11
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,066
Freedom is a state much prized

12
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,802
Within the realm
of civilized society.

13
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,505
It is a bond wherewith
the savage man may charm

14
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,306
The outward hatchments
of his soul

15
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,010
And soothe the troubled breast
into a magnitude of quiet.

16
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,046
It is most precious
as a blessed balm

17
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,249
The savior of princes,
the harbinger of happiness.

18
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,684
Yea, the very stuff and pith
of all we hold most dear.

19
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,319
What frees
the prisoner

20
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,621
In his lonely cell

21
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,623
Chained within
the bondage of rude walls

22
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,024
Far from the owl of thebes?

23
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,426
What fires and stirs
the woodcock in his springe

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,262
Or wakes
the drowsy apricot betide?

25
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,797
What goddess doth
the storm-tossed mariner

26
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,300
Offer most
tempestuous prayers to?

27
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,002
Freedom!

28
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,436
Freedom!

29
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,504
Freedom.

30
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,641
It's only a bloody
parking offense.

31
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,977
I'm sorry
I'm late, my lord

32
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,013
I couldn't find
a kosher car park.

33
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,716
Uh, don't bother
to recap, my lord.

34
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,451
I'll pick it up as we go along.

35
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,786
Call mrs. fiona lewis.

36
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,821
Call mrs. fiona lewis.

37
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,524
I swear to tell the truth

38
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,493
The whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

39
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,762
So anyway, I said...
I said to her, I said

40
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,830
They can't afford that
on what he earns.

41
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,533
I mean, for a start,
the feathers get up your nose.

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,703
I ask you, four and six a pound,
and him with a wooden leg?

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,305
I don't
know how

44
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,339
She puts up with it

45
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,874
After all the trouble she's had

46
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,975
With her you-know-what.

47
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,343
Anyway, it was

48
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,278
A white wedding,
much to everyone's surprise.

49
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:00,647
Of course, they bought
everything on the hire purchase.

50
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,083
I think they ought to send it
back where they come from.

51
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,918
I mean, you've got
to be cruel to be kind.

52
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,187
So mrs. harris said,
so she said, she said, she said

53
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,223
The dead crab,
she said, she said.

54
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,358
Well, her sister's
gone to rhodesia

55
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,026
What with her womb and all

56
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,561
And her youngest

57
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,231
Her youngest as thin
as a filing cabinet

58
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,766
And the goldfish, the goldfish,
they've got whooping cough.

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,401
They keep spitting water
at the bratbys.

60
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,836
Well, they do,
don't they?

61
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,204
I mean, you can't, can you?

62
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,073
I mean, they're not even
married or anything

63
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,207
They're not even divorced.

64
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,375
And he's in the k.g.b.

65
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,409
If you ask me.

66
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,944
He says he's
a tree surgeon

67
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,746
But I don't like
the sound of his liver

68
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,781
All that squeaking
and banging every night

69
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,016
Till the small hours.

70
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,218
Well, his mother's
been much better

71
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,254
Since she had her head off,
yes, she has.

72
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,489
I said, don't you talk
to me about...

73
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,092
Don't you talk to me
about bladders, I said.

74
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,296
Mr. bartlett, I fail to see the
relevance of your last witness.

75
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:53,000
Uh, my next witness will explain
that, if my lordship will allow.

76
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,968
I call the late arthur aldridge.

77
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,270
The late
arthur aldridge.

78
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,205
<i>The late
arthur aldridge?</i>

79
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,107
Yes, my lord.

80
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,476
Mr. bartlett, do you think
there's any relevance

81
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,977
In questioning the deceased?

82
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,412
Uh, I beg your pardon, my lord.

83
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,181
Well, I mean, your
witness is dead.

84
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,516
Yes, my lord... well,
uh, virtually, my lord.

85
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,951
He's not completely dead?

86
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,053
No, he's not completely dead,
my lord, no

87
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,288
But he's not at all well.

88
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,489
What? well, if he's not dead

89
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,924
What's he doing in a coffin?

90
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,493
It's purely precaution, my lord,
if I may continue.

91
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,395
Uh, mr. aldridge,
you were...

92
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,829
<i>You are a stockbroker</i>

93
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,032
Of 10 savundra close,
wimbledon.

94
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,635
What was
that knock?

95
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:29,937
It means "yes," my lord--

96
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,805
One knock for "yes"
and two knocks for "no."

97
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,940
If I may continue.

98
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,975
Uh, mr. aldridge,
would it be fair to say

99
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,476
That you are not at all well?

100
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,745
In fact, mr. aldridge

101
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,214
Not to put
too fine a point on it

102
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,683
Would you be prepared to say
that you are, as it were

103
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,419
What is generally known as,
in a manner of speaking... dead?

104
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,927
Mr. aldridge, I put it to you
that you are dead.

105
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,531
Aha!

106
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,132
Where is all this leading us?

107
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,503
That will become apparent
in one moment, my lord.

108
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,372
Mr. aldridge,
are you considering the question

109
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,374
Or are you just dead?

110
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,615
I think I'd better
take a look, my lord.

111
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,362
No further questions, my lord.

112
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,197
What do you mean,
"no further questions"?

113
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,132
You can't just dump
a dead body in my court

114
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,567
And say "no further questions."

115
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,002
I demand an explanation.

116
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,504
There are no easy answers
in this case, my lord.

117
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,006
I think you haven't got
the slightest idea

118
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,040
What this case is about.

119
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,542
My lord, the... the...

120
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,278
The strange, damnable,
almost diabolic threads

121
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,780
Of this extraordinary
tangled web of intrigue

122
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,415
Will shortly, my lord

123
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,285
Reveal a plot so fiendish,
so infernal, so heinous.

124
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,654
Mr. bartlett, your client
has already pleaded guilty

125
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,988
To the parking offense.

126
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,292
Parking offense,
schmarking offense, my lord.

127
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,694
We must leave no stone unturned.

128
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,529
Call cardinal richelieu.

129
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,498
Oh, you're just trying
to string this case out.

130
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,499
Cardinal richelieu?

131
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,000
A character witness, my lord.

132
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,510
Hello, everyone.

133
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,980
It's wonderful to be here, you
know, I just love your country.

134
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,482
London is so beautiful
at this time of year.

135
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,118
You are cardinal armand
du plessis de richelieu

136
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,054
First minister of louis xiii?

137
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,689
<i>oui.</i>

138
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,424
Cardinal, would it
be fair to say

139
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,760
That you not only built up the
centralized monarchy in france

140
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,563
But also perpetuated
the religious schism in europe?

141
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,632
That's what they say.

142
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,367
And did you
persecute the huguenots?

143
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,202
<i>oui.</i>

144
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,104
And did you take
even sterner measures

145
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,706
Against the great
catholic nobles

146
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,708
Who made common cause
with foreign foes

147
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,710
In defense
of their feudal independence?

148
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,211
I sure did that thing.

149
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,746
Cardinal, are
you acquainted

150
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,282
With the defendant,
harold larch?

151
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,985
Since I was so high.

152
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,420
Speaking as a cardinal
of the roman catholic church

153
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,922
As first minister of louis xiii

154
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,223
And as one of
the architects

155
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,092
Of the modern world already

156
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,562
Would you say that harold larch
was a man of good character?

157
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:13,000
Listen, harry is a very
wonderful human being.

158
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,801
My lord, in view
of the impeccable nature

159
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,304
Of this character witness,
may I plead for clemency?

160
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,939
It's only 30 shillings.

161
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,608
Not so fast.

162
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,609
Why not?

163
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,777
Uh... uh...

164
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,379
None of your smart answers.

165
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,947
You think you're so clever.

166
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,782
Well, I'm dim.

167
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,754
Dim? consternation, uproar!

168
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,157
Yes, and I have a few
questions I'd like to ask

169
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,293
Cardinal so-called
richelieu.

170
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,795
<i>bonjour, monsieur dim.</i>

171
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,230
So-called cardinal

172
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,332
I put it to you
that you died

173
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,834
In december 1642.

174
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,101
That is correct.

175
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,637
Aha! he fell for my little trap.

176
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,543
Curse you, inspector dim

177
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,046
You are too clever
for us naughty people.

178
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,647
And furthermore, I suggest

179
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,850
That you are none other
than ron higgins

180
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,485
Professional
cardinal richelieu impersonator.

181
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,387
It's a fair cop.

182
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,791
My life, you're clever, dim,
he'd certainly taken me in.

183
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,326
It's all in a day's work.

184
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,361
Well, with a brilliant mind
like yours, dim

185
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,597
You could be something other
than a policeman.

186
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,397
Yes.

187
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:18,398
What?

188
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:24,071
If I were not in the c.i.d.,
something else I'd like to be.

189
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,774
If I were not in the c.i.d.,
a window cleaner me.

190
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,877
With a rub-a-dub-dub
and a scrub-a-dub-dub

191
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,945
And a rub-a-dub
all day long.

192
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,814
With a rub-a-dub-dub
and a scrub-a-dub-dub

193
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,616
I'd sing this merry song.

194
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,820
If I were not in the c.i.d.,
something else I'd like to be.

195
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,690
If I were not in the c.i.d.,
a window cleaner me.

196
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,626
With a rub-a-dub-dub
and a scrub-a-dub-dub

197
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,561
And a rub-a-dub
all day long.

198
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,496
With a rub-a-dub-dub
and a rub-a-dub-dub

199
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,098
I'd sing this merry song.

200
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,366
Hey!

201
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,835
If... I were not
before the bar

202
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,670
Something else
I'd like to be

203
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,941
If I were not a barrister,
an engine driver me.

204
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,477
With a chuf-chuf-chuf
and a chuf-chuf-chuf...

205
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,520
Chuf...

206
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,105
The larch.

207
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,708
<i>the larch.</i>

208
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,825
This man is no ordinary man.

209
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,760
This is mr. f.g. superman

210
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,063
To all appearances
no different

211
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,665
From any other
law-abiding citizen.

212
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,724
But mr. f.g. superman has
a secret identity.

213
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,028
When trouble strikes,
at any time, at any place

214
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:31,465
He is ready to become...
bicycle repairman.

215
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,178
Hey!

216
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,546
There's a bicycle broken.

217
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,114
Up the road!

218
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,317
<i>hmm... goodness</i>

219
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,320
<i>this sounds like a job
for bicycle repairman.</i>

220
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,623
<i>but how to change without
revealing my secret identity?</i>

221
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:00,027
If only bicycle
repairman were here.

222
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,361
Oh, yeah.

223
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:02,462
Wait!

224
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,932
I think I know where
I can find him.

225
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,334
Look-- over there!

226
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,343
Bicycle repairman!

227
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,445
But how?

228
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,617
Look!

229
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,788
Is it
a stockbroker?

230
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,489
Is it a
quantity surveyor?

231
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,358
Is it a
church warden?

232
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,492
No!

233
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,462
It's bicycle repairman!

234
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:42,536
Why, bicycle
repairman

235
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:45,038
Thank goodness
you've come.

236
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,074
Look.

237
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:19,173
Why, he's mending it
with his own hands!

238
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,742
See how he uses
a spanner

239
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,944
To tighten that nut.

240
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:33,520
Bicycle repairman,
how can I ever repay you?

241
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:35,189
Well, you don't
need to, guv.

242
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,390
It's all right.

243
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,824
It's all in
a day's work

244
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,226
For bicycle
repairman.

245
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,632
Our hero!

246
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,302
Yes, wherever
bicycles are broken

247
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,571
Or menaced
by international communism

248
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,472
Bicycle repairman is ready...

249
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:55,342
Ready to smash the communists,
wipe them up...

250
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,946
And shove them
off the face of the earth.

251
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,316
Mash the dirty red scum!

252
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,751
Kick them in the teeth
where it hurts!

253
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:05,986
Kill!

254
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,821
Kill, kill!

255
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,224
Filthy bastard commies!

256
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,893
I hate them, I hate them!

257
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,494
Ah!

258
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,465
Ah!

259
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,834
Tea's ready.

260
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,736
Coming, dear.

261
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,148
Hello, children, hello.

262
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,317
Here is this morning's story.

263
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,219
Are you ready?

264
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:42,189
Then we'll begin.

265
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:46,527
"one day, ricky the magic pixie
went to visit daisy bumble

"he found her in the bedroom.

"roughly, he grabbed
her heavy shoulders

00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,569
Pulling her down onto the bed
and ripping off her..."

"old nick the sea captain

00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,478
"was a rough, tough,
jolly sort of fellow.

"he loved the life of the sea

00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,782
"and he loved to hang out
down by the pier

00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,918
Where the men dressed
as ladies..."

275
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:19,960

Naked...

Hello again.

289
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,631
Now here's a little sketch
by two boys from london town.

290
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,432
They've been writing
for three years

291
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,434
And they've come up
with a little number.

292
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,703
Here it is, it's called
"restaurant sketch."

293
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,573
It's nice here,
isn't it?

294
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,807
Oh, very good
restaurant.

295
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:41,909
Three stars,
you know.

296
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,277
Really?

297
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,278
Good evening, sir.

298
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,445
Good evening, madam.

299
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:46,980
And may I say
what a pleasure it is

300
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,248
To see you here again, sir.

301
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,316
Oh, thank you.

302
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,351
Hmm, well, there
you are, dear.

303
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:52,853
Just have
a look there.

304
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,921
Anything you like?

305
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,856
The boeuf en croute
is fantastic.

306
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,026
If I may suggest, sir,
the pheasant a la reine--

307
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:02,529
The sauce is one of the chef's
most famous creations.

308
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:03,597
Mmm, that
sounds good.

309
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:04,865
Anyway, just
have a look.

310
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:06,166
Take your time.

311
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,368
Oh, by the way, I've got
a bit of a dirty fork.

312
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,803
Could you get me another one?

313
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,071
I beg your pardon?

314
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,306
Well, it's nothing.

315
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,007
I've got a fork--
a little bit dirty--

316
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,309
Could you get me
another one?

317
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,343
Thank you.

318
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,511
Oh, sir, I do
apologize!

319
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,546
Oh, no need to apologize,
doesn't worry me.

320
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,181
Oh, no, no, no,
I do apologize!

321
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,617
I will fetch the headwaiter
immediatement.

322
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,785
Oh, there's no need to do that.

323
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,653
Oh, no, no, I am sure
the headwaiter

324
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,755
He will want to apologize
to you himself.

325
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,224
I will fetch him at once.

326
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,626
Well, you certainly get
good service here, don't you?

327
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,795
They really look
after you, yes.

328
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,197
Excuse me,
monsieur, madame.

329
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:39,066
It's filthy!

330
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,134
Gaston!-- find out
who washed these up

331
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,237
And give them
their cards immediately!

332
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:43,971
Oh, no, no...

333
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,105
No, better still--

334
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,273
Can't afford to
take any chances--

335
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,574
Sack the entire
washing-up staff!

336
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:49,076
No, look, I don't want
to make any trouble.

337
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,477
Oh, no, please,
it's no trouble.

338
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,112
It's quite right
that you should point

339
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,247
These kind of things out.

340
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,281
Gaston-- tell the manager

341
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,516
What has happened immediately!

342
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,852
No, no, please, I don't
want to cause any fuss.

343
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,220
Please, it's no fuss.

344
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:03,190
We simply wish to ensure
that nothing interferes

345
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,726
With your complete
en joyment of the meal.

346
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,760
I'm sure
it won't.

347
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,161
It was only
a dirty fork.

348
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:11,365
I know,
and I'm sorry!

349
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,634
Bitterly sorry!

350
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,870
But I know that
no apologies I can make

351
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:20,340
Can alter the fact
that in our restaurant

352
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:24,411
You have been given
a dirty, filthy...

353
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:25,779
Smelly piece of cutlery!

354
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:26,780
It wasn't
smelly.

355
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:27,814
It was smelly!

356
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,383
And obscene
and disgusting!

357
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,784
And I hate it,
I hate it!

358
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,219
I hate it!

359
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,088
Nasty, grubby, dirty,
mangy, scrubby little fork!

360
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,123
Oh... oh... oh...

361
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,492
That will do,
gilberto... gilberto.

362
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,527
Good evening, sir,
good evening, madam.

363
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:41,562
I am the manager.

364
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:42,696
I've only just heard.

365
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:43,730
May I sit down?

366
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,232
Yes, of course.

367
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,303
I want to apologize

368
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:54,107
Humbly, deeply and sincerely
about the fork.

369
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,610
Oh, no, please,
it was only a tiny bit dirty.

370
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,478
Just... couldn't see it.

371
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:02,082
Oh, you're good, kind,
fine people for saying that

372
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,383
But I can see it.

373
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,219
To me it's like a mountain...

374
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,621
A vast bowl of pus.

375
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:08,755
It's not as bad as that.

376
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,859
<i>It gets me here.</i>

377
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,195
I can't give you any excuses
for it, there are no excuses.

378
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:18,765
I've been meaning to spend more
time in the restaurant recently

379
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,701
But I haven't been too well

380
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:23,437
And things aren't
going very well back there.

381
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:26,206
The poor cook's son
has been put away again

382
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,309
And poor old mrs. dalrymple,
who does the washing up

383
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,345
Can hardly move her poor fingers

384
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:34,147
And then there's
gilberto's war wound.

385
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:38,218
But they're good people
and they're kind people.

386
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:41,889
Together we were beginning
to get over this dark patch.

387
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,392
There was light
at the end of the tunnel

388
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,461
When this...

389
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,063
When this... happened!

390
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,700
Could I get you
some water?

391
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,802
It's the end
of the road!

392
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,277
You bastards!

393
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,948
You vicious, heartless bastards!

394
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,386
Look what you've done to him!

395
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,922
He's worked his fingers
to the bone

396
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,124
To make this place what it is

397
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:22,596
And you come in with
your petty, feeble quibbling

398
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:27,935
And you grind him into the dirt!

399
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:30,103
This fine, honorable man

400
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,640
Whose boots
you are not worthy to kiss!

401
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:38,445
Oh, it makes me mad.

402
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,082
Mad!

403
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,353
Mad.

404
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,355
Easy, mungo, easy.

405
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,356
Mad.

406
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,357
Mungo!

407
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,358
Oh,
the war wound!

408
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,193
The wound,
the wound!

409
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,561
It's the end!

410
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,730
They've
destroyed him!

411
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:57,998
The end!

412
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,568
He's dead!

413
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:04,071
They killed him!

414
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,273
Revenge!

415
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,774
Revenge!

416
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,176
No, mungo!

417
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,111
Mungo!

418
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,813
Never kill
a customer.

419
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,083
Oh, the wound,
the wound!

420
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,284
The wound
again!

421
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:27,694
Lucky we didn't say anything
about the dirty knife.

422
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,597
Oh, no, come on, no!

423
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,132
No, no, no, no!

424
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,735
Well, there we are, then,
that was the restaurant sketch.

425
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,504
Nice little number, bit vicious
in parts, but a lot of fun.

426
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,239
But how about
that punch line, eh?

427
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,641
Oh, you know
what I mean?

428
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,743
Oh, really.

429
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,287
Tired of that drab,
boring life you lead?

430
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,290
Then purchase a past.

431
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,559
Yes, thousands
of people have led

432
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,196
Far more interesting lives
than you will ever lead.

433
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,729
They undoubtedly continue
to lead interesting lives

434
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:38,498
Whereas you
just as assuredly will not.

435
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:45,539
Bits of their lives are being
made available for purchase.

436
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:47,207
For only 15 shillings

437
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:49,810
Dullards like yourself
can obtain

438
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:54,014
Beautifully framed photographs
of other people's lives.

439
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:55,883
Hang them in your den.

440
00:21:55,949 --> 00:22:00,420
Stand them on your desk
or next to your bed.

441
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:05,125
<i>Pretend they are pictures
from your past.</i>

442
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,302
Hello, I'm uncle frank
and family.

443
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,671
Mind if we stay
a couple of nights?

444
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,772
Or a month?

445
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,973
Or three years?

446
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,742
Hello, we're uncle george
and agnes.

447
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:22,809
Where's the bathroom?

448
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:26,246
Shut up!

449
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,649
Oh, shut up!

450
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,250
Oh, sorry.

451
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:33,387
Not good enough.

452
00:23:36,817 --> 00:23:38,151
Good evening.

453
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:41,421
Here is the 6:00 news
read by michael queen.

454
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,157
It's been a quiet day
over most of the country

455
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:46,159
As people went back to work

456
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:49,096
After the warmest july weekend
for nearly a year.

457
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,866
The only high spot of the
weekend was the meeting

458
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,469
Between officials of the
n.e.d.c. and the o.d.c.n.

459
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:56,503
In bradford today.

460
00:23:57,671 --> 00:23:59,540
Mr. ted johnson
of the n.e.d.c...

461
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:16,790
In geneva, officials
of the central clearing banks

462
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:18,959
Met with herr voleschtadt
of poland

463
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:22,462
To discuss non-returnable loans
on a 12-year trust basis

464
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:26,066
For the construction
of a new zinc-treating works

465
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:31,038
In the omsk area of krakow,
near the bulestan border.

466
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:35,142
The board of trade has ratified
a trade agreement

467
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,944
With the soviet union

468
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,548
For the sale of 600 low-gear
electric sewing machines.

469
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:45,219
The president of the board
of trade said he hoped

470
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:49,256
This would mark a new era
of expansion in world trade

471
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:53,927
And a new spirit of cooperation
between east and west.

472
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:59,366
There has been a substantial
drop in gold reserves

473
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,235
During the last 12 months.

474
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:03,570
This follows a statement
by the treasury

475
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:07,140
To the effect that the balance
of imports situation

476
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:12,045
Had not changed dramatically
over the same period.

477
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,082
Still no news of
the national savings book

478
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:18,218
Lost by mr. charles griffiths
of porthcawl

479
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:20,153
During a field expedition

480
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:23,423
To the nature reserves
of swansea last july.

481
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,992
Mr. griffiths' wife said

482
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:28,195
That her husband was refusing
to talk to the press

483
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:33,066
Until the savings certificate
had been found.

484
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,703
In cornwall, the death
has been announced today

485
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,806
Of the former minister
without portfolio

486
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,509
General sir hugh marksby-smith.

487
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:46,980
Sir hugh was vice-president
of the rotarian movement.

488
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:49,850
In the match between glamorgan
and yorkshire

489
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,719
The yorkshire bowler nicholson
took eight wickets

490
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:53,720
For three runs.

491
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,722
Glamorgan were all out for 36

492
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,760
And therefore won the match
by an innings and seven runs.

493
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,795
Weather for tomorrow
will be cloudy

494
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,730
With occasional outbreaks
of rain.

495
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:05,933
That is the end of the...

496
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,846
The larch.

497
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:38,765
The horse chestnut.

498
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,770
Eric, do you think

499
00:26:43,837 --> 00:26:46,974
You could recognize
a larch tree?

500
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:53,814
I don't know.

501
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:56,984
What's
your name?

502
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:59,253
Michael.

503
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,022
Michael, do you
think you know

504
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,724
What a larch tree
looks like?

505
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:09,997
I want
to go home.

506
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:12,799
Bottom.

507
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:16,537
Are there
any other trees

508
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:19,506
That any of you think
you could recognize

509
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,408
From quite
a long way away?

510
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:25,946
I want... sketch
of eric's, please.

511
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:27,014
What?

512
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,782
I want to see
a sketch of eric's--

513
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:29,816
"nudge, nudge."

514
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:30,817
A what? sketch?

515
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:31,952
Eric's written a...

516
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:33,620
I've written
a sketch.

517
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,958
"nudge, nudge,"
eric's written.

518
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:38,959
"nudge, nudge."

519
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:39,960
"nudge, nudge."

520
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,464
Is your wife
a... a goer, eh?

521
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,233
Know what I mean,
know what I mean?

522
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,668
Nudge, nudge,
nudge, nudge.

523
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,669
Know what I mean?

524
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:50,170
Say no more,
know what I mean?

525
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,205
I beg your pardon?

526
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:52,406
Your wife...
does she, uh...

527
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:53,473
Does she go,
eh, eh, eh?

528
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,075
Know what I mean,
know what I mean?

529
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:56,243
Nudge, nudge,
say no more?

530
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,411
Well, she
sometimes goes, yes.

531
00:27:57,477 --> 00:27:58,846
I'll bet she does,
I'll bet she does

532
00:27:58,946 --> 00:27:59,947
I'll bet she does.

533
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,481
Know what I mean,
know what I mean?

534
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:02,516
Nudge, nudge?

535
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:03,517
I'm sorry--

536
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,718
I don't quite
follow you.

537
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:05,752
Follow me, follow me!

538
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,087
I like that, that's good.

539
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,356
A nod's as good as
a wink to a blind bat, eh?

540
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:10,924
Are you trying
to sell something?

541
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:14,161
Selling, selling,
very good, very good.

542
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:15,762
Oh, wicked, wicked,
you're wicked, eh?

543
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,331
Know what I mean,
know what I mean?

544
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:18,365
Nudge, nudge?

545
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:19,867
Know what I mean,
nudge, nudge?

546
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:20,968
Nudge, nudge?

547
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,770
Say no more!

548
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:25,706
Ah! ooh!

549
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:28,041
Your wife, is she, uh...

550
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,776
Is she a sport, eh?

551
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,345
Well, yes, she
likes sport, yes.

552
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,080
I'll bet she does,
I'll bet she does.

553
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:34,314
She's very fond
of cricket

554
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,349
As a matter of fact.

555
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:36,350
Who isn't, eh?

556
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,351
Know what I mean?

557
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:38,819
Likes games,
likes games?

558
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:41,755
Knew she would, knew she would,
knew she would.

559
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,924
She's been around,
eh? been around.

560
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:44,958
She's traveled.

561
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:46,093
She's from purley.

562
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,161
Oh, oh, say no more,
say no more!

563
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:49,463
Say no more, purley!

564
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,031
Say no more, purley, eh?

565
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:53,233
Know what I mean,
know what I mean?

566
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,268
Say no more.

567
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:56,036
Your wife
interested in...

568
00:28:57,604 --> 00:28:58,705
Photographs, eh?

569
00:28:58,772 --> 00:28:59,940
Know what I mean?

570
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:02,643
"photographs?" he
asked him knowingly.

571
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:03,677
Photography?

572
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,646
Yes, nudge, nudge,
snap, snap

573
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,147
Grin, grin, wink, wink

574
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:08,048
Say no more.

575
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,082
Holiday snaps?

576
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:10,684
Could be, could be
taken on a holiday

577
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:11,752
Could be, yes.

578
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:13,654
Swimming costumes,
you know what I mean?

579
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,589
Candid photography,
you know what I mean?

580
00:29:15,622 --> 00:29:16,590
Nudge, nudge.

581
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:18,325
No, no, we don't
have a camera.

582
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,493
Ah.

583
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,961
Still... whoa! hey?

584
00:29:20,994 --> 00:29:23,463
Whoa! hey?

585
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:28,468
Look, are you
insinuating something?

586
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:30,470
Oh, oh...

587
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:31,471
Yes.

588
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:32,472
Well?

589
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:33,740
Well, I mean
you are

590
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:35,776
A man of the world,
aren't you?

591
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:38,378
I mean, you've been
there, haven't you?

592
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,480
I mean, you've
been around, eh?

593
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:42,149
What do you mean?

594
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:45,385
Well, I mean, like
you've done it.

595
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:49,523
I mean, you know,
you've slept with a lady.

596
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,557
Yes.

597
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:51,825
What's it like?

598
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:34,334
The larch.
