1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,108
Hmm...

2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,010
Hmm...

3
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,197
It's...

4
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:34,201
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

5
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,302
Speaking as
a public opinion poll

6
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,470
I've had enough
of the permissive society.

7
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,006
I haven't had enough
of the permissive society.

8
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,947
I would not appear in a frontal
nude scene unless it was valid.

9
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,983
In 1943, a group
of british army officers

10
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,952
Working deep behind enemy lines

11
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,888
Carried out one of the most
dangerous and heroic raids

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,089
In the history of warfare.

13
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,227
But that's as may be.

14
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,595
And now...

15
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:38,899
Come in.

16
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,470
What do you want?

17
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,506
I'd like to leave
the army, please, sir.

18
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,807
Good heavens,
man, why?

19
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:47,975
It's dangerous.

20
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,009
What?

21
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,344
There are people
with guns

22
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,144
Out there, sir.

23
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,212
What?

24
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,847
Real guns, sir,
not toy ones, sir.

25
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,048
Proper ones, sir.

26
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,917
They've all got 'em,
all of 'em, sir.

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,018
And some of 'em

28
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,019
Have got tanks.

29
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,054
Watkins, they are on our side.

30
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,589
And grenades, sir,
and machine guns, sir.

31
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,658
So I'd like to leave, sir,
before I get killed, please.

32
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,295
<i>Watkins, you've only
been in the army a day.</i>

33
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,398
I know, sir, but people get
killed, properly dead, sir

34
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,133
No barley, cross fingers, sir.

35
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,003
A bloke
was telling me

36
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,238
If you're in the army
and there's a war

37
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,706
You have to go
and fight.

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,708
That's true.

39
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,043
Well, I mean... blimey

40
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,611
I mean, if it
was a big war

41
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,613
Somebody could be hurt.

42
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,716
Watkins, why did you
join the army?

43
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,852
For the water-skiing
and for the travel, sir.

44
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,855
And not for the killing, sir.

45
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:35,856
I asked them
to put it

46
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,391
On my form, sir--
"no killing."

47
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,194
Watkins, are you a pacifist?

48
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,462
No, sir, I'm not a pacifist,
sir, I'm a coward.

49
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,032
That's a very
silly line.

50
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:45,999
Sit down.

51
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,434
Yes, sir,
it's silly, sir.

52
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,135
Awfully bad.

53
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:54,541
Two civilian gentlemen
to see you, sir!

54
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,810
Show them in,
please, sergeant.

55
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,913
Mr. dino vercotti
and mr. luigi vercotti!

56
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,919
Good morning,
colonel.

57
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,354
Good morning,
gentlemen.

58
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,889
Now, what can i
do for you?

59
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:09,656
You've, uh...

60
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,958
You've got a nice

61
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,693
Army base here,
colonel.

62
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,661
Yes.

63
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,730
We wouldn't want anything
to happen to it.

64
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:18,932
What?

65
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,634
Oh, no, what
my brother means

66
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,636
Is it would be
a shame if, uh...

67
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,638
Oh, sorry, colonel.

68
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,174
Well, don't worry about that,
but please do sit down.

69
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,510
No, we prefer to stand,
thank you, colonel.

70
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,777
All right,
but what do you want?

71
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,346
Oh, what do we want?

72
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,682
Very good, colonel.

73
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,351
Always the joker, luigi.

74
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,453
Explain it to
the colonel, dino.

75
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,488
How many tanks
you got, colonel?

76
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,257
About 500 altogether.

77
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,358
500, eh?

78
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,093
You ought to be
careful, colonel.

79
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,028
We are careful,
extremely careful.

80
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,597
'cause things break,
don't they?

81
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,832
Break?

82
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,868
Well, everything breaks,
don't it, colonel?

83
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,436
Oh, dear.

84
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,772
Oh, see, my brother's
clumsy, colonel

85
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,408
And when he gets unhappy
he breaks things.

86
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,943
Like, say he don't feel

87
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,945
The army's
playing fair by him

88
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,447
He may start
breaking things, colonel.

89
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,650
What is
all this about?

90
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,152
How many men you
got here, colonel?

91
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,988
Oh, uh... 7,000
infantry, 600 artillery

92
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,724
And, uh... two divisions
of paratroops.

93
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,892
Paratroops, dino.

94
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,460
It'd be a shame

95
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,863
<i>If someone was
to set fire to them.</i>

96
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,997
Set fire to them?

97
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,499
Fires happen,
colonel.

98
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,900
Things burn.

99
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,902
Look, what is
all this about?

100
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,039
My brother and i
have got

101
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,007
A little proposition
for you, colonel.

102
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,509
Could save you
a lot of bother.

103
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,910
You're doing
all right here

104
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,945
Aren't you, colonel?

105
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,046
Well, suppose

106
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,948
Some of your tanks
was to get broken

107
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,850
Or troops started
getting lost, uh...

108
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,218
Fights started
breaking out

109
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,819
During general
inspection, like?

110
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,487
It wouldn't be
good for business

111
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,655
Would it, colonel?

112
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:49,823
Are you
threatening me?

113
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,058
Oh, no, no, no.

114
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,427
Whatever made you think that,
colonel?

115
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,928
The colonel
doesn't think

116
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,430
We're nice
people, luigi.

117
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,098
We're your
buddies, colonel.

118
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,700
We want
to look after you.

119
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,968
Look after me?

120
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,569
We can
guarantee you

121
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,472
That not a single
armored division

122
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,274
Will get done over...

123
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,176
For 15 bob
a week.

124
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,344
No, no...
12 and six?

125
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,378
No, no...
eight and six?

126
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,379
No, no...
five bob?

127
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,380
No, no, this is silly.

128
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,381
What's silly?

129
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,649
No, the whole
premise is silly

130
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:16,850
And it's very
badly written.

131
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,018
I'm the senior
officer here

132
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,486
And I haven't had
a funny line yet

133
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,487
So I'm stopping it.

134
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,622
You can't
do that!

135
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,123
I've done it.
the sketch is over.

136
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,124
I want to leave
the army

137
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,392
Please, sir,
it's dangerous.

138
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,593
Look, I stopped
your sketch

139
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,295
Five minutes ago,
so get out of shot.

140
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,830
Right, director!

141
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,031
Close up.

142
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,399
Zoom in on me.

143
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,269
That's better.

144
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,005
It's only 'cause you couldn't
think of a punch line.

145
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,072
Not true, not true.

146
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,507
It's time for the cartoon.

147
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,878
Cue telecine--
ten, nine, eight...

148
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:47,447
Our general public's not going
to understand this, are they?

149
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,415
Shut up, you eyeties!

150
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,601
Ooh, what the devil's
going on here?

151
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,437
Hey! hey, what's going...

152
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,972
What's happening here?

153
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,308
Hey, wait a minute.

154
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,678
Hey, oh, hey, stop that!

155
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,752
Well, ladies and gents

156
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,454
Here it is, the show
you've been wanking for

157
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,989
The show you've heard
so much about.

158
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,824
This is the show
that gives you what you want

159
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,226
The way you like it.

160
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,428
So move right up front
for "full frontal nudity."

161
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,776
Excuse me...

162
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,678
<i>Will you sit down!</i>

163
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,146
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,893
A cold ice cream, sweetie?

165
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,461
Sit down!

166
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,603
The owner of the vehicle with
this license registration

167
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,805
Will please move it;
it's causing an obstruction.

168
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,424
Wasn't that just great,
ladies and germs?

169
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,394
Admittedly, a few problems,
a few disappointments...

170
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,728
Shut up, you pansy.

171
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,363
I paid for full
frontal nudity

172
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,831
And I'm going
to get some.

173
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,099
Ta ta, sailor.

174
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,269
Full frontal
nudity? never.

175
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,637
What do you
think, barbara?

176
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:51,939
Oh, no, no, no...

177
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,374
Unless it was artistically
valid, of course.

178
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,744
Full frontal nudity?

179
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,880
Yes, I'd do it, if it was valid.

180
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,650
Or if the money was valid,
and if it were a small part.

181
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,393
Good evening.

182
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,463
I'd like to talk to you tonight

183
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,465
About the place of the nude
in my bed...

184
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,466
Um...

185
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,436
In the history of my bed...

186
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,606
Of art... art-- I'm sorry.

187
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,641
The place of the nude
in the history of tart...

188
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,742
Call-girl-- I'm sorry.

189
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,546
I'll start again.

190
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:34,815
Bum-- oh, what a giveaway!

191
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,316
The place of the nude in art.

192
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,752
Oh, hello there, father, uh...
confessor, professor

193
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,287
Your honor, your grace...

194
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,357
I'm not your grace,
I'm your elsie.

195
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,594
What a terrible joke!

196
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,631
But it's my only line!

197
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,028
We want to buy
a bed, please.

198
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,430
Oh, certainly.

199
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,432
I'll get someone
to attend to you.

200
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,933
Mr. verity!

201
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,301
Can I help
you, sir?

202
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,170
Ah, yes, we'd like
to buy a bed...

203
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,838
A double bed,
about £50.

204
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,273
Oh, no, I am afraid not, sir.

205
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,041
Our cheapest bed is £800, sir.

206
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,443
Eight hundred pounds!

207
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,645
Oh, uh... perhaps
I should have explained.

208
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,480
Mr. verity does
tend to exaggerate

209
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:16,483
So every figure he gives you
will be ten times too high.

210
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,952
Otherwise he's perfectly
all right, perfectly.

211
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,187
Oh, I see.

212
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,726
I see-- so your
cheapest bed is £80?

213
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,994
£800, yes, sir.

214
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,262
And how wide is it?

215
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,331
Uh... the width is,
uh... 60 feet wide.

216
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,866
Oh... six foot wide, eh?

217
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:33,901
And the length?

218
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,068
The length is, um...

219
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,036
Lambert?

220
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,304
Hmm?

221
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,940
What is the length of
the comfydown majorette?

222
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,275
Uh... two foot long.

223
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,743
Two foot long?

224
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,645
Ah, yes, you have to remember,
of course

225
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,014
To multiply everything
mr. lambert says by three.

226
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,283
Uh... it's nothing he can help,
you understand.

227
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,251
Apart from that
he's perfectly all right.

228
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,553
I see, I'm sorry.

229
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,954
But it does mean

230
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,190
That when he says
a bed is two foot wide

231
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,991
It is, in fact, 60 feet wide.

232
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,126
Oh, yes, I see...

233
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:00,794
And that's not counting
the mattress.

234
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:01,895
Oh, how much
is that?

235
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,764
Lambert will be able
to help you there.

236
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,765
Lambert?

237
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:05,766
Hmm?

238
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,367
Will you show
these 20 good people

239
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:08,769
The, uh...
dog kennel please?

240
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:09,770
Certainly.

241
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:10,771
Dog kennel?
no, no, no.

242
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:11,839
Mattresses,
mattresses.

243
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,073
Oh, no, no,
you have to say

244
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,775
"dog kennel" to mr. lambert

245
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,878
Because if you say "mattress,"
he puts a bag over his head.

246
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,446
I should have explained.

247
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,481
Apart from that
he's really all right.

248
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:30,357
Uh... um, uh, we'd like to see
the dog kennels, please.

249
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,758
Dog kennels?

250
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,293
Yes, we want to see
the dog kennels.

251
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,463
Ah, yes, well, that's the pets
department, second floor.

252
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,499
Oh, no, no, we want to see
the dog kennels.

253
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,035
Yes, pets department,
second floor.

254
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,505
No, no, no, we don't really
want to see dog kennels

255
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,373
Only your colleague
said we ought to...

256
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,375
Oh, dear, what's he
been telling you now?

257
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,776
Well, he said
we should say

258
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,778
"dog kennels" to you
instead of "mattress."

259
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,117
Oh, dear, hello, hello?

260
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,385
Did you say "mattress"?

261
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,020
Well, a little, yes.

262
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,689
I did ask you not to say "mattress,"
didn't i?

263
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,459
Now I've got to stand
in the tea chest.

264
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:13,267
And did those feet
in ancient times

265
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,469
Walk upon england's
mountains green...

266
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,871
Did somebody say "mattress"
to mr. lambert?

267
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:21,175
And was the holy
lamb of god

268
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,710
On england's
pleasant...

269
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,816
He should be
all right now.

270
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,885
But don't...
you know, just don't.

271
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,387
Oh, no, no, no.

272
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,823
Uh...

273
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:40,160
We'd like to see
the dog kennels, please.

274
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,296
Yes, second floor.

275
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,499
No, no, look, these
dog kennels here, see?

276
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:46,867
Mattresses?

277
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,435
Oh, yes!

278
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,938
Well, if you meant mattress,
why didn't you say "mattress"?

279
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,439
I mean, it's
very confusing for me

280
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,842
If you go and say "dog kennels"
when you mean "mattress."

281
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,210
Why not just say "mattress"?

282
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,278
Well, I mean you put
a bag over your head

283
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,746
Last time
I said "mattress."

284
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:05,619
Bring me my bow
of burning gold

285
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:09,456
Bring me my arrows
of desire

286
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,392
Bring me my spear...

287
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,561
Did somebody say "mattress"
to mr. lambert?

288
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,696
Twice.

289
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,997
Hey, everybody

290
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,466
Somebody said "mattress"
to mr. lambert twice!

291
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:25,372
I shall not cease
from mental strife

292
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,843
Nor shall my sword
sleep in my hand...

293
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,378
We need more!

294
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:44,191
On england's green
and pleasant...

295
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,695
Now, uh...
can I help you?

296
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,264
We want
a mattress.

297
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,900
Oh, what did you
say that for?

298
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,636
But it's my only line!

299
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,372
Well, you didn't
have to say it.

300
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,076
Full frontal nudity?

301
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,378
Not in this part of esher.

302
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:08,415
I would only perform a scene

303
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,919
In which there was
total frontal nudity.

304
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,687
Now, I've noticed a tendency

305
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:15,989
For this program
to get rather silly.

306
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,792
Now, I do my best
to keep things moving along

307
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,295
But I'm not having things
getting silly.

308
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,464
Those last two sketches I did
got very silly indeed

309
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:27,501
And that last one
about the bed was even sillier.

310
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,370
Now, nobody likes a good laugh
more than I do

311
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:33,473
Except perhaps my wife...
and some of her friends.

312
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,475
Oh, yes, and captain johnson.

313
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:36,710
Come to think of it

314
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,246
Most people like
a good laugh more than I do

315
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,014
But that's beside the point.

316
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,084
Now, let's have a good,
clean, healthy outdoor sketch.

317
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,019
Get some air into your lungs.

318
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,654
Ten, nine, eight and all that.

319
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,591
<i>ah, yes, that's better.</i>

320
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:54,161
<i>now, let's hope
this doesn't get silly.</i>

321
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,697
Hello, are you a hermit by
any chance?

322
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,532
Yes, that's right.

323
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,766
Are you a hermit?

324
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,201
Yes, I certainly am.

325
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,302
Well, I never.

326
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,937
What are you
getting away from?

327
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,305
Oh, you know,
the usual--

328
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,940
People, chat,
gossip, you know.

329
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,476
Oh, I certainly do;
it was the same with me.

330
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,179
I mean, there comes a time
when you realize there's no good

331
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:13,447
Frittering your
life away

332
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,482
In idleness
and trivial chitchat.

333
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,084
Where's your cave?

334
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,119
Oh, up the goat track,
first on the left.

335
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,188
Oh, they're very nice
up there, aren't they?

336
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,723
Yes, they are,
I've got a beauty.

337
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,324
A bit drafty, though,
aren't they?

338
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,159
No, we've had
ours insulated.

339
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,127
Oh, yes?

340
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,362
Yes, I used
birds' nests, moss

341
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,863
And oak leaves
round the outside.

342
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:30,998
Oh, sounds marvelous.

343
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,599
Oh, it's a treat,
it really is

344
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,302
'cause otherwise, those stone
caves can be so grim.

345
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,204
Yes, they really
can be, can't they?

346
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,238
They really can.

347
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,339
Morning, frank.

348
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,774
Uh, morning,
norman.

349
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,477
Talking of moss, uh, you know
mr. robinson?

350
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,212
With the, uh,
green loincloth?

351
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,747
Uh, no, that's
mr. seagrave.

352
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,148
Mr. robinson's
the hermit

353
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:49,750
Who lodges
with mr. seagrave.

354
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:50,918
Oh, yes.

355
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,953
Yes, well, he's
put me onto wattles.

356
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,987
Really?

357
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,355
Yes.
swears by them.

358
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,823
Morning, frank.

359
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,825
Morning, lionel.

360
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:01,762
Well, he says that moss tends
to fall off the cave wall

361
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,230
During cold weather.

362
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,432
You know, you might get
a really bad spell

363
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,668
And half the moss drops
off the cave wall

364
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,102
Leaving you cold.

365
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,637
Oh, well,
mr. robinson's cave

366
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,773
Has never been exactly nirvana,
has it?

367
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,374
Well, quite,
that's what I mean.

368
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,410
Anyway, mr. rogers,
he's the, uh, hermit...

369
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,444
On the end.

370
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:18,645
Up at the top, yes.

371
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:19,746
Well, he tried wattles

372
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,148
And he came out in a rash.

373
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,349
Really?

374
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,384
Yes, and there's me
with half a wall wattled.

375
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:25,419
I mean, what'll I do?

376
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,154
Well, why don't you
try birds' nests

377
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:28,188
Like I've done?

378
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:29,756
Or else dead bracken.

379
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,058
Frank!

380
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,292
Yes, han.

381
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,827
Can I borrow your goat?

382
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,462
Uh, yes, that'll
be all right.

383
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,965
Oh, leave me a pint
for breakfast, will you?

384
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,466
You know, that's
the trouble

385
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,301
With living
halfway up a cliff--

386
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,736
You feel so cut off.

387
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,272
You know, it takes me
two hours every morning

388
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,707
To get out
onto the moors

389
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,709
Collect my berries,
chastise myself

390
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,611
And two hours
back in the evening.

391
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,247
Still, there's one thing about
being a hermit--

392
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,415
At least you
meet people.

393
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,884
Oh, yes, i
wouldn't go back

394
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,585
To public relations.

395
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,454
Oh, well, bye for now, frank.
must toddle.

396
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,522
Right, you
two hermits

397
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:02,756
Stop that
sketch.

398
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:03,724
I think
it's silly.

399
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,092
Go on, stop it,
it's silly.

400
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,194
What do you mean? you can't
stop it; it's on film.

401
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:08,629
That doesn't make
any difference

402
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:09,997
To the viewer
at home, does it?

403
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,998
Go on, get out.

404
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:15,302
Get off, go on,
all of you.

405
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,004
Go on,
move, move!

406
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,472
Go on, get out.

407
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,045
Go on, get out.
move, move.

408
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:31,118
Move, move!

409
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,259
Hello, I wish to
register a complaint.

410
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,727
Hello? miss?

411
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,162
What do you mean "miss"?

412
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,697
Oh, I'm sorry,
I have a cold.

413
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,198
I wish to make
a complaint.

414
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:19,833
Sorry, we're
closing for lunch.

415
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,101
Never mind
that, my lad

416
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,269
I wish
to complain

417
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:24,171
About this parrot
what I purchased

418
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,807
Not half an hour ago
from this very boutique.

419
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:28,742
Oh, yes, the norwegian blue.
what's wrong with it?

420
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,577
I'll tell you
what's wrong with it.

421
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,646
It's dead,
that's what's wrong with it.

422
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,248
No, no, it's
resting, look.

423
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,783
Look, my lad, I know a dead
parrot when I see one

424
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,452
And I'm looking
at one right now.

425
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,687
No, no, sir, it's
not dead, it's resting.

426
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:41,889
Resting?

427
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,057
Yeah, remarkable bird,
the norwegian blue

428
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,592
Beautiful plumage, isn't it?

429
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:48,929
The plumage don't enter
into it-- it's stone dead.

430
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,063
No, no, it's resting.

431
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,735
All right, then, if it's
resting, I'll wake it up.

432
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,136
Hello, polly!

433
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,672
I've got a nice cuttlefish
for you when you wake up

434
00:18:58,739 --> 00:18:59,940
Polly parrot!

435
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:00,974
There,
it moved.

436
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,009
No, it didn't.

437
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,644
That was you pushing the cage.

438
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,278
I did not!

439
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,079
Yes, you did.

440
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,749
Hello, polly!

441
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,884
Polly!

442
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,087
Polly parrot,
wake up!

443
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,356
Polly!

444
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,628
Now, that's what I call
a dead parrot.

445
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,730
No, no, it's stunned.

446
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,232
Look, my lad,
I've had

447
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,900
Just about
enough of this.

448
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,936
That parrot
is definitely deceased.

449
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,338
And when I bought it
not half an hour ago

450
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,674
You assured me
that its lack of movement

451
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:37,277
Was due to it being tired and
shagged out after a long squawk.

452
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,812
Well, sir...

453
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,748
It's probably pining
for the fjords.

454
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,217
"pining for the fjords"?

455
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,785
What kind of talk is that?

456
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,054
Look, why did it fall
flat on its back

457
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,622
The moment I got it home?

458
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,091
The norwegian blue prefers
kipping on its back.

459
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,093
It's a beautiful bird,
lovely plumage.

460
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:55,629
Look, I took the liberty
of examining that parrot

461
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,598
And I discovered
that the only reason

462
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,601
That it had been sitting
on its perch in the first place

463
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,636
Was that it had been
nailed there.

464
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,340
Well, of course
it was nailed there.

465
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,609
Otherwise it would muscle up
to those bars and... voom!

466
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,744
Look, matey...

467
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,481
This parrot
wouldn't voom

468
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:17,017
If I put 4,000
volts through it.

469
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,519
It's bleeding demised.

470
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,521
It's not,
it's pining.

471
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:23,490
It's not pining,
it's passed on.

472
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:26,493
This parrot
is no more.

473
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,263
It has ceased to be.

474
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,933
It's expired and gone
to meet its maker.

475
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,402
This is a late parrot.

476
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,872
It's a stiff.

477
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:40,974
Bereft of life,
it rests in peace.

478
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,210
If you hadn't nailed it
to the perch

479
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:45,379
It would be pushing up
the daisies.

480
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:49,049
It's rung down the curtain
and joined the choir invisible.

481
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:52,219
This is an ex-parrot.

482
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:56,256
Well, I'd better
replace it, then.

483
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,825
If you want to get
anything done in this country

484
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:01,662
You've got to complain
till you're blue in the mouth.

485
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,931
Sorry, guv, we're
right out of parrots.

486
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,800
I see, I see,
I get the picture.

487
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,235
I've got a slug.

488
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,271
Does it talk?

489
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,840
Not really, no.

490
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,242
Well, it's scarcely
a replacement, then, is it?

491
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,244
Listen, I'll tell you
what, tell you what

492
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,379
If you go to my brother's
pet shop in bolton

493
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,081
He'll replace
your parrot for you.

494
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,115
Bolton, eh?

495
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:23,317
Yeah.

496
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,351
All right.

497
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:46,240
Uh, excuse me.

498
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,008
This is bolton,
is it?

499
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,277
No, no, it's,
uh, ipswich.

500
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:52,880
That's inter-city rail for you.

501
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,189
I wish to make
a complaint.

502
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:04,691
I don't have
to do this, you know.

503
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:05,959
I beg your pardon?

504
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,594
I'm a qualified
brain surgeon.

505
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:10,163
I only do this because I like
being me own boss.

506
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,633
Uh, excuse me, this is
irrelevant, isn't it?

507
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,901
Oh, yeah, it's not easy

508
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,602
To pad these out
to 30 minutes.

509
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,638
Well, I wish
to make a complaint.

510
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,173
I got on
the bolton train

511
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:21,842
And found myself deposited
here in ipswich.

512
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,911
No, this is bolton.

513
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:26,713
The pet shop owner's
brother was lying.

514
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,149
Well, you can't blame
british rail for that.

515
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,784
If this is bolton

516
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,586
I shall return
to the pet shop.

517
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:45,232
<i>I understand
that this is bolton.</i>

518
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,500
Yeah.

519
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,702
Well, you told me
it was ipswich.

520
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:51,905
It was a pun.

521
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,641
A pun?

522
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,143
No, no, not a pun, no.

523
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,912
What's the other thing
which reads the same backwards

524
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,514
As forwards?

525
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,115
A palindrome?

526
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:03,684
Yeah, yeah.

527
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,185
It's not a palindrome.

528
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,788
The palindrome of bolton
would be "notlob."

529
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:09,256
It don't work.

530
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,757
Look, what do you want?

531
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,259
No, I'm sorry.

532
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:15,229
I'm not prepared to pursue
my line of inquiry any further

533
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:17,164
As I think
this is getting too silly.

534
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:18,966
Quite agree,
quite agree.

535
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:20,467
Silly,
silly, silly.

536
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,870
Right, get on
with it.

537
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,104
Get on
with it!

538
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:30,110
Oh... uh... oh, I'm sorry.

539
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:32,880
Uh... and now, um...

540
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:35,349
Frontal nudity.

541
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:02,109
Oh, oh, I'm sorry,
I thought the film was longer.

542
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:04,811
Uh... uh, now, notlob...
uh, bolton.

543
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,216
This is a frightened city.

544
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:13,854
Over these houses, over these
streets hangs a pall of fear

545
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:18,692
Fear of a new kind of violence
which is terrorizing the city.

546
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,099
Yes, gangs of old ladies

547
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,936
Attacking defenseless,
fit young men.

548
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,042
Take that!

549
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:43,483
Well, they come up to you,
like, and push you, you know

550
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,719
Shove you off
the pavement, like.

551
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:48,255
There's usually
four or five of them.

552
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:51,725
Yeah, this... this used to be
a nice neighborhood

553
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,294
Before the old ladies
started moving in.

554
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:57,798
Nowadays some of us daren't
even go down to the shops.

555
00:24:57,865 --> 00:25:01,068
Well, mr. johnson's son kevin,
he don't go out anymore.

556
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:04,638
He comes back from wrestling
and locks himself in his room.

557
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,621
What are they in it for

558
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:23,290
These old hoodlums,
these layabouts in lace?

559
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:26,426
Well, it... it's
something to do, isn't it?

560
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:28,629
It's good fun.

561
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:32,499
It's... it's like, uh...
you know...

562
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:35,035
Well, isn't it, eh?

563
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:39,573
Favorite targets for the
old ladies are telephone kiosks.

564
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:48,482
Well, come on,
come on, off with you.

565
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:51,218
Clear out, come on,
get out of it.

566
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:56,123
We have a lot of trouble
with these oldies.

567
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:58,292
Pension day's the worst--
they go mad.

568
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:00,894
As soon as they get
their hands on their money

569
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:04,631
They blow it all on milk, bread,
tea, tin of meat for the cat.

570
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:07,734
Well, yes, well, of course,
come the 2:00 matinee

571
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:09,369
All the old bags are in there

572
00:26:09,436 --> 00:26:12,372
<i>Especially if it's something
like the sound of music.</i>

573
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,741
We get seats ripped up,
hearing aids broken

574
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:16,610
All that sort of thing.

575
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:24,852
The whole problem
of these senile delinquents

576
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:27,221
Lies in their complete rejection

577
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,923
Of the values
of contemporary society.

578
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,127
They've seen their children
grow up and become accountants

579
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:36,597
Stockbrokers
and even sociologists

580
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,933
And they begin to wonder,
is it all really...

581
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:49,042
Oh, well, we sometimes feel
we're to blame in some way

582
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,744
For what our gran's become.

583
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:53,213
I mean, she used
to be quite happy here

584
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:55,716
Until she... she started
on the crochet.

585
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:56,850
Crochet?

586
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,685
Yeah, now she
can't do without it.

587
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,721
20 balls of wool
a day, sometimes.

588
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:03,090
If she can't get the wool,
she gets violent.

589
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,458
What can we do about it?

590
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,978
But this is not just
an old ladies' town.

591
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:27,247
There are other
equally dangerous gangs

592
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,983
Such as the baby snatchers.

593
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:40,460
I just left my husband
outside here

594
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:42,462
While I went in
to do some shopping

595
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,298
And I came back and he was gone.

596
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,300
He was only 47.

597
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:54,308
And on the roads, too, vicious
gangs of "keep left" signs.

598
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,379
Right, right, stop it.

599
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:00,781
This film's got silly.

600
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:02,716
Started off with
a nice little idea

601
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,618
About grannies
attacking young men

602
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,019
But now it's got silly.

603
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,422
This man's hair is too long
for a vicar, too.

604
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:10,224
These signs are
pretty badly made.

605
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,126
Right, now for
a complete change of mood.

606
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,063
I've heard of unisex
but I've never had it.

607
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:21,001
David hemmings appeared

608
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:23,804

national forestry commission.
