1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,744
It's...

2
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:14,381
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

3
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,979
I know you're down there.

4
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,999
Hey, did you see that?

5
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,402
Hmm?

6
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,637
Did you see somebody
go past the window?

7
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,972
What?

8
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,642
Somebody just went
past the window, that way.

9
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:16,777
Oh.

10
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,580
Oh.

11
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,417
Another one.

12
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,618
Hmm?

13
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,920
Another one
just went past downwards.

14
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:27,955
What?

15
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,456
Two people have just fallen

16
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,558
Out of that window
to their almost certain death.

17
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,662
Fine, fine, fine.

18
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:36,697
Look!

19
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,498
Two people...

20
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,533
Three people

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,501
Have just fallen

22
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,502
Past that window.

23
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,804
Must be a board meeting.

24
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,906
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,611
Hey, that was wilkins
of finance.

26
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,012
Oh, no,
that was robertson.

27
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,013
Wilkins.

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,114
Robertson.

29
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:54,982
Wilkins.

30
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:55,916
Robertson.

31
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,118
That was wilkins.

32
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,353
That was wilkins.

33
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,255
He was a good,
uh, good golfer, wilkins.

34
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,390
Very good golfer,
very good golfer.

35
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,558
Rotten at finance.

36
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,959
It'll be parkinson next.

37
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,161
Bet you it won't.

38
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,564
How much?

39
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,698
What?

40
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,768
How much do you
bet it won't?

41
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:15,802
Fiver?

42
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,837
All right.

43
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,838
Done.

44
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,839
You're on.

45
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,641
Fine.

46
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,242
Come on, parky.

47
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,744
Don't do it, parky.

48
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,946
Jump, parky, jump. come on, now,
be sensible, parky.

49
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,548
Dear sir,
I am writing to complain

50
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,983
About that sketch about people
falling out of a high building.

51
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,785
I have worked all my life
in such a building

52
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,786
And have never once...

53
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,558
Parkinson!

54
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,659
Johnson!

55
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,635
My god, this is terrible!

56
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,470
Would somebody please stop it?!

57
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,538
Lord knows that.

58
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,639
Let's try it this way.

59
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:07,855
Alakazam!

60
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:08,856
Alacadabra! alakazam!

61
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,390
Alacadabra! alakazam!

62
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,125
Alacadabra! alakazam!

63
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,861
Alacadabra...

64
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,374
Hello!

65
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,924
<i>tonight, spectrum looks
at one of the major problems</i>

66
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,092
In the world today--

67
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,261
The whole vexed question
of what is going on.

68
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,829
Is there still time
to confront it

69
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,564
Let alone solve it,
or is it too late?

70
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,099
What are the figures,
what are the facts?

71
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,867
What do people mean
when they talk about things?

72
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,170
Alexander hardacre
of the economic affairs bureau.

73
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,337
In this graph

74
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,439
This column represents
23% of the population.

75
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,508
This column represents
28% of the population

76
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,344
And this column represents
43% of the population.

77
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,713
Telling figures indeed,
but what do they mean to you?

78
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,915
What do they mean to me?

79
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,750
What do they mean to
the average man in the street?

80
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,619
With me now is professor tiddles
of leeds university.

81
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,322
Professor, you've
spent many years
researching into things.

82
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,356
What do you think?

83
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,591
I think it's too early to tell.

84
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,326
Too early to tell,
too early to say.

85
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:20,727
It means the same thing.

86
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,329
The word "say" is the same
as the word "tell."

87
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,597
They're not spelled the same,
but they mean the same.

88
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,066
It's an identical situation
we have with "ship" and "boat"

89
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,135
But not the same as we have
with "bow" and "bough"--

90
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,437
Different spellings and
meanings, but sound the same.

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,841
But the real question remains:

92
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,576
What is the solution,
if any, to this problem?

93
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,810
What can we do?
what am I saying?

94
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,078
Why am I sitting in this chair?

95
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,513
Why am I here
and what will I say next?

96
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,281
Here to answer this is
a professional cricketer.

97
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,950
I can say nothing at this point.

98
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,084
You were wrong.
professor?

99
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:44,852
Hello.

100
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:45,953
Hello.

101
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,087
So, where do we stand?
where do we sit?

102
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:47,988
Where do we come?
where do we go?

103
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:48,889
What do we do?
what do we say?

104
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:49,823
What do we eat?
what do we drink?

105
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:50,791
What do we think?
what do we do?

106
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,267
Sorry!

107
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,148
Hello.

108
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,717
Mr. and mrs. johnson, isn't it?

109
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:17,784
That's right, yes.

110
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,852
Well,
come on in.

111
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,420
Excuse me not
shaking hands

112
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,955
But I've just
been putting

113
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,891
A bit of lard on
the cat's boil.

114
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:24,892
Very nice.

115
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,159
Well, you
must be tired.

116
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,094
It's a
long drive

117
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,328
From coventry,
isn't it?

118
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,230
Yes, well, we usually
reckon on 51/2 hours

119
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,065
And it took us
six hours and
53 minutes

120
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,067
With a 25-minute wait
at frampton cottrell

121
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,068
To stretch our legs

122
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,537
Only we had to wait
half an hour

123
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,172
To get on to the m5
near droitwich.

124
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:38,839
Really?

125
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:39,940
There was

126
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,342
A three-mile queue just
before bridgwater on the a38

127
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,144
Only normally we come
round on the b3339

128
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,579
Just before bridgwater,
you see.

129
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,280
Really?

130
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:46,947
We risked it

131
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:47,948
Because they say

132
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,883
They're going
to widen it there.

133
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:50,450
Are they?

134
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,552
Just there

135
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,187
At the intersection
where the a372 joins up

136
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,988
There's plenty of room
to widen it there.

137
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,356
There's only
the grass verges.

138
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,758
They could get
another six feet

139
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,959
Knock down that hospital.

140
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,827
Then we took the coast road
through williton

141
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,563
And got all the taunton traffic
on the a358

142
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,797
From crowcombe and stogumber.

143
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,465
Well, you must be dying
for a cup of tea.

144
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,869
Well, wouldn't say "no,"
not if it's warm and wet.

145
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,370
Well, come on
in the lounge.

146
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,406
I'm just
about to serve
afternoon tea.

147
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,774
Very nice.

148
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,610
Come on in,
mr. and mrs. johnson.

149
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,611
Oh, this is

150
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,580
Mr. and mrs. phillips.

151
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,948
Good afternoon.

152
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,817
It's their third
year with us.

153
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,753
We can't keep
you away, can we?

154
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:27,754
And over here

155
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,590
Is mr. hilter.

156
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,961
Ah, good time,
good afternoon.

157
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,195
Planning a little excursion

158
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,230
Are we, mr. hilter?

159
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,231
<i>uh, ja, ja!</i>

160
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,232
We make a little...

161
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,733
<i>was ist ruckweise
bewegen?</i>

162
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,767
"hike."

163
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:41,768
Hiking.

164
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,270
We make a little
hike for...

165
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:44,538
For bideford.

166
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,441
Oh, well, you'll
be wanting
the a39 then.

167
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,943
No, no, you've
got the wrong
map there.

168
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,345
This is
stalingrad.

169
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:52,813
You want
the ilfracombe

170
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,314
And barnstaple
section.

171
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,816
Ah, hein... reginald

172
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,818
You have the
wrong map here

173
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:01,455
You silly old
leg-before-wicket
english person.

174
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,923
<i>i'm sorry, mein fuhrer.</i>

175
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:03,924
I did not...

176
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,226
<i>mein dickie, old chum.</i>

177
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,361
Lucky
mr. johnson

178
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,829
Pointed that
out, eh?

179
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,898
You wouldn't
have had
much fun

180
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,699
In stalingrad,
would you?

181
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,202
I said you
wouldn't have
had much fun

182
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,837
In stalingrad,
would you?

183
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,773
Not much fun in stalingrad, no.

184
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,774
Oh, I'm sorry

185
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:21,775
I didn't
introduce you.

186
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,210
This is ron...

187
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,512
Oh, not

188
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,114
<i>nein! nein! nein!</i>

Oh... no, he different

00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,958
So they say!

194
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,561
And this is the quiet
one, mr. bimmler.

195
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,528
Heimlich bimmler.

196
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,729
How do you
do there, squire?

197
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,931
Also I am not minehead lad

Was given birth to

00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,435
But stay in peterborough,
lincolnshire house

201
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,270
All during war,
owing to nasty running sores

202
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,372
And was unable
to go in the streets

203
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,408
<i>play fussball
or go to nurnberg.</i>

204
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,578
I am retired window cleaner
and pacifist

205
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,479
Without doing war crimes.

206
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,449
And am very glad england
win world cup

207
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,617
Bobby charlton

208
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,118
And eating lots
of chips and fish

209
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,320
And toad in the holes

210
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,355
And dundee cake
on piccadilly line

211
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,489
Don't you know, old chap

212
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,225
And was head of gestapo
for ten years...

213
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:13,493
Five years!

214
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,696
<i>oh! no, no, nein</i>

215
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,165
I was not head
of gestapo at all.

216
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,667
I make joke.

217
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,170
Oh,
mr. bimmler

218
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,171
You do
have us on.

219
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,173
Oh, excuse me

220
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,674
I must just go
and answer that.

221
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,843
Uh, how long you
down here for,
mr. hilter?

222
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,878
Just the
fortnight?

223
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:31,879
Why do you
ask that?

224
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,247
You a spy
or something?

225
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,749
Get over there
against the wall,
britischer pig.

226
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:36,817
You're going to die.

227
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,619
Take it easy,
dickie, old chum.

228
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,153
I'm sorry,
mr. johnson.

229
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,455
He's a bit
on edge.

230
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,357
He hasn't slept
since 1945.

231
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,859
Shut your cake hole,
you nazi.

232
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,694
<i>cool it,
fuhrer cat.</i>

233
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,963
The fun we have.

234
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,964
Haven't I seen him

235
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:51,965
On the
television?

236
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,535
<i>nicht, nein,
nein... oh, no.</i>

237
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,036
Television

238
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,070
No! no!

239
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,205
Telephone,
mr. hilter.

240
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,740
It's that nice
mr. mcgoering

241
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,241
From the bell
and compasses.

242
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,409
He says he's found a place

243
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,144
Where you can hire bombers
by the hour.

244
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,814
If he opens his big mouth again,
it's lampshade time!

245
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,349
Shut up!

246
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,452
Hire bombers by the hour.

247
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,088
What a laugh he is,
that scottish person!

248
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,323
Good old norman.

249
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,725
He's on the telephone
the whole time nowadays.

250
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,726
In business, is he?

251
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,161
Soon, baby.

252
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:22,696
Course, it's his
big day, thursday.

253
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,598
Oh, they've been planning
it for months.

254
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,866
What happens
then?

255
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,202
Oh, it's the north minehead
by-election.

256
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,638
Mr. hilter's standing as a
national bocialist candidate.

257
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,941
He's got wonderful plans
for minehead.

258
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:34,675
Like what?

259
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,709
Well, for a start

260
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,044
He wants to annex poland.

261
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,278
Oh, north
minehead's

262
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,813
Conservative,
isn't it?

263
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,849
Well, they get a lot of people
at their rallies.

264
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,883
Rallies?

265
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,885
Well, their bocialist meetings

266
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,287
Down at the axis cafe
in rosedale road.

267
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,925
<i>achtung, achtung!</i>

268
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,086
<i>uber alles!</i>

269
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:23,090
<i>die eltern im mittelalter

270
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:28,428
<i>alles muss mit dem
mittelschmerz gestoppen sein!</i>

271
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,938
I... am not a racialist...

272
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:46,113
<i>but-- und this is a big "but"--</i>

273
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,953
We in the national
bocialist party believe

274
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,924
<i>das uberleben...</i>

275
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:01,962
<i>muss gestammen sein mit der

276
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:14,608
<i>historische taunton ist
volkermeinig von meinhead.</i>

277
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,347
Mr. hitler...

278
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,717
Hilter... he says
that historically

279
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,219
Taunton...

280
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,621
Is part
of minehead already.

281
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,389
He's right,
do you know that?

282
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:36,964
<i>und bridgwater ist
die letzte fuhlung</i>

283
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:40,534
<i>das wir haben in somerset!</i>

284
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,048
<i>sieg heil! sieg heil!</i>

285
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,791
What do you think
of mr. hilter's policies?

286
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,860
Well, I don't like the sound

287
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,429
Of these here
boncentration bamps.

288
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:14,568
Well, I gave him my baby to kiss
and he bit it on the head.

289
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:17,171
Well, I think he'd do a lot
of good for the stock exchange.

290
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,405
No, no.

291
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,340
Oh, yes, britischer pals

292
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:22,609
<i>he is wunderbar... ful, ja.</i>

293
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,213
I think he's right
about the coons

294
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,215
But then I'm a bit mental.

295
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,186
I think he's got beautiful legs.

296
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,122
Well, speaking
as conservative candidate

297
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,724
I just drone on and on
and on and on

298
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,627
Never letting anyone else
get a word in edgewise

299
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:42,629
Until I start foaming
at the mouth

300
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,165
And falling over backwards.

301
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,767
Foam at the mouth
and fall over backwards.

302
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,702
Is he foaming at the mouth
to fall over backwards

303
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,537
Or falling over backwards
to foam at the mouth?

304
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,005
<i>tonight's spectrum examines
the whole question</i>

305
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,574
Of frothing and falling,
coughing and calling

306
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,175
Screaming and bawling,
walling and stalling

307
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,710
Galling and mauling,
palling and hauling

308
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,978
Trawling and squalling
and zalling.

309
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,646
Zalling?
is there a word "zalling?"

310
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:00,681
If there is, what does it mean?

311
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,149
If there isn't,
what does it mean?

312
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,317
Perhaps both, maybe neither.

313
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,484
What do I mean
by the word "mean"?

314
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:05,519
What do I mean
by the word "word"?

315
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,520
What do I mean
by "what do I mean?"

316
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:08,055
What do I mean by "do"
and what do I do by "mean"?

317
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:08,822
What do I do by do by do?

318
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,791
And what do I mean by wasting
your time like this? good night.

319
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,726
Good night.

320
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,362
Good evening, I wish
to report a burglary.

321
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,463
Speak up, please, sir.

322
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,166
I wish to report a burglary.

323
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,201
I can't hear you, sir.

324
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,972
I wish to report a burglary!

325
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,573
That's a little
bit too loud.

326
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,608
Could you say it

327
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,176
Just a little
less loud than that?

328
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:32,212
I wish to report a burglary!

329
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,783
No, I'm still
not getting anything.

330
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,086
Uh, could you try it
in a higher register?

331
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,921
What do you mean,
in a higher register?

332
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:41,622
What?

333
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,825
I wish to report a burglary.

334
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,226
That's it, wait a moment.

335
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,828
Now, a little
bit louder.

336
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:50,797
I wish to report a burglary!

337
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,798
Report a what?

338
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,400
Burglary!!

339
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,969
That's it, now keep it there.

340
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,538
Hello, sarge!

341
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:58,906
Evening, charlie.

342
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,874
I was sitting
at home

343
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,776
With a friend of mine
from camber sands

344
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,779
When we heard a noise
in the bedroom!

345
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:09,783
We went to investigate
and found £5,000 stolen!

346
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,885
Well, I'm afraid
I'm off duty now, sir.

347
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,820
Uh, could you tell
sergeant foster?

348
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,790
I was sitting at home

349
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,259
With a friend of mine
from camber sands!

350
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,129
Excuse me, sir, but, uh,
why the funny voice?

351
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,864
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

352
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,533
I'd just got used to talking
like that to the other sergeant.

353
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,168
I'm terribly sorry,
I can't hear you, sir.

354
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,903
Could you try speaking
in a lower register?

355
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,939
What? oh.

356
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:38,111
I wish to report the loss
of £5,000.

357
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,513
£5,000? that's serious.

358
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,181
You'd better speak
to the detective inspector.

359
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:44,117
What seems to be the trouble,
sergeant?

360
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,719
Well, this gentleman, sir,
has come in

361
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:46,887
To report that he was sitting
at home with a friend

362
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:47,921
When he heard a noise
in the back room

363
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,256
Went round to investigate

364
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:49,957
And found that £5,000 in savings
had been stolen.

365
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,658
I see.

366
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,726
Where do you live, sir?

367
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:57,130
121 halliwell road,
dulwich, se21.

368
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:59,933
121 halliwell road,
dulwich, se21.

369
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,269
Another halliwell road
job, eh, sergeant?

370
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,303
Yes, I can't
believe it.

371
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,338
I thought the bloke
who'd done that

372
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,506
Was put inside
last year.

373
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,940
Yes, in parkhurst.

374
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,075
Well, it must have been
somebody else.

375
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,810
Thank you, sergeant.

376
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:10,844
We'll get things
moving right away.

377
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,713
You take over here,
sergeant.

378
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,814
Alert all squad cars
in the area.

379
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,282
Hello, darling

380
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,683
I'm afraid
I shall be late.

381
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:22,089
Calling all squad cars
in the area.

382
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:26,627
I think that's
in very bad taste.

383
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:37,171
Some people do talk
in the most extraordinary way.

384
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:41,575
Good afternoon, and welcome
to hurlingham park.

385
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,711
You join us just as the
competitors are running out

386
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,081
Onto the field on this
lovely winter's afternoon here

387
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,919
With the going firm underfoot
and very little sign of rain.

388
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,787
Well, it certainly looks

389
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,924
As though we're in
for a splendid afternoon's sport

390
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,427
In this, the 127th "upper-class
twit of the year" show.

391
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,729
Well, the competitors
will be off any moment

392
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,698
So let me just identify them
for you.

393
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,635
Vivian smith-smythe-smith
has o-level in chemo-hygiene.

394
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,404
Simon-zinc-trumpet-harris

395
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,873
Married to
a very attractive table lamp.

396
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:15,309
Nigel incubator-jones--
his best friend is a tree

397
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,377
And in his spare time,
he's a stockbroker.

398
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,546
Gervaise brook-hampster is
in the guards

399
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,115
And his father uses him
as a wastepaper basket.

400
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,552
And finally, oliver st. john-
mollusc, harrow and the guards

401
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,488
Thought by many to be
this year's outstanding twit.

402
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,791
Now they're moving out
to the starting line.

403
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,193
There's a jolly good crowd
here today.

404
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:36,830
Now they're under
starter's orders

405
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:38,732
And...

406
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,369
They're off!

407
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:44,538
Oh, no, they're not.

408
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:47,074
No, they didn't realize
they were supposed to start.

409
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,876
Never mind,
we'll soon sort that out.

410
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,811
The judge is explaining it
to them now.

411
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,946
I think nigel and gervaise
have got the idea.

412
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,081
All set to go.

413
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,450
Oh, and they're off.

414
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,851
And it's a fast start this year.

415
00:16:57,885 --> 00:16:59,853
Oliver st. john-mollusc running
a bit wide there

416
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,989
And now they're coming
into their first test--

417
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,290
The straight line.

418
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,425
They've got to walk
along this straight line

419
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,660
Without falling over.

420
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,562
And oliver's over
at the back there...

421
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:11,131
Uh, simon's coming through
quite fast on the outside.

422
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,232
I think simon and nigel...

423
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,767
Both of them coming through
very fast.

424
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,636
There's nigel there,
number three, I'm sorry.

425
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,137
And on the outside,
there's gervaise

426
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,572
Coming through just out of shot.

427
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,040
And now, the positions:

428
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,409
Simon and vivian at the front
coming to the matchbox jump--

429
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,545
Three layers
of matchboxes to clear.

430
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:28,048
And simon's over and
vivian's over beautifully.

431
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,149
Oh, the jump of a lifetime--

432
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,584
If only his father
could understand.

433
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,586
Here's nigel...
he's confused.

434
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,087
No, gervaise is over.

435
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,956
He's, uh... nigel is over...

436
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,925
He's only just hit the top.

437
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,026
And now it's gervaise.

438
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,427
Gervaise is going to jump.

439
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,429
Is it... no, he's jumped
the wrong way.

440
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,564
There he goes.

441
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,932
Nigel's over beautifully.

442
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,434
Now it's only oliver,
oliver and gervaise...

443
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,802
Oh, bad luck.

444
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:50,470
And now it's
"kicking the beggar."

445
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,639
Simon's there,
and he's putting the boot in

446
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:53,941
And not terribly hard

447
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,176
But he's going down,
so simon can move on.

448
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,611
Now vivian's there.

449
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,980
Vivian is there and waiting
for a chance.

450
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,515
Here he comes.

451
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,550
Oh, a real pile driver,
a real pile driver.

452
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,686
And now simon's at number one;
vivian, two;

453
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,889
Nigel, three; gervaise at four;
and oliver bringing up the rear.

454
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,058
Uh... there's oliver,
there's oliver now.

455
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,359
He's at the back.

456
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,228
I think he's having
a little trouble

457
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,596
With his old brain in jury.

458
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:16,930
He's going to have a go...

459
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:18,298
No, no, bad luck.

460
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:20,400
He's up, he doesn't know
when he's beaten, this boy.

461
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,069
He doesn't know
when he's winning either.

462
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,471
He doesn't have any sort of
sensory apparatus known to man.

463
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:25,939
He's now standing up...
oh, bad luck.

464
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,075
Oh, there's gervaise
putting the boot in there.

465
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,643
There's no need for him
to do this.

466
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,911
He's got the beggar down.

467
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,113
The steward's giving him
a little bit of advice.

468
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,214
Yes, he can move on now.

469
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,916
He can move on
to the hunt photograph.

470
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,085
There's gerv... I think he's...
yes, he's off.

471
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,754
Gervaise is there,
and oliver's still at the back

472
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:42,322
Having trouble
with the matchboxes.

473
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,324
Now, here's
the hunt ball photograph.

474
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:45,826
And the first here is simon.

475
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,829
He's going to en joy a joke
with lady arabella plunkett.

476
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,297
She hopes to go into films.

477
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,732
And vivian's through there

478
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,467
And nigel's there
en joying a joke

479
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,236
With lady sarah pencil farthing
vivian steamroller

480
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,805
Adams pie biscuit aftershave
gore stringbottom smith.

481
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,175
And there's... and there's simon
now in the sports car.

482
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,576
He's reversed
into the old woman.

483
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,211
He's caught her
absolutely beautifully.

484
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,013
Now he's going to accelerate
forward there

485
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,447
To wake up the neighbor.

486
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,650
There's vivian, I think...
no, vivian's lost his keys...

487
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:10,684
No, there's vivian!

488
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,686
He's got the old woman,
slowly but surely

489
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,321
Right in the midriff,
and here he is.

490
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:16,123
Here he is to wake up
the neighbor now.

491
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,325
Simon right in the lead,
comfortably in the lead

492
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:20,194
But he can't get this neighbor
woken up.

493
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,995
He's slamming away there
as best he can.

494
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:24,031
He's getting absolutely
no reaction at all.

495
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,934
There! there, he's woken him up
and simon's through.

496
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,436
Here comes vivian...
vivian to slam the door.

497
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,138
And there we are
back at the hunt ball.

498
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:32,406
I think that's gervaise.

499
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,274
Yes, that's gervaise
going through there.

500
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:36,276
And here... here comes oliver,
brave oliver.

501
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,845
Is he going to make it
to the table?

502
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:38,912
No, I don't think he is.

503
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,013
Yes, he is.

504
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,749
Oh! what a great twit!

505
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,718
And the crowd are really rising
to him there.

506
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,587
And there, I can see...
who is that there?

507
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,721
Yes, that's nigel.

508
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:48,922
Nigel has woken the neighbor.

509
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,123
My god, this is exciting!

510
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,959
Nigel's very excited,
he's going through.

511
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,160
Here comes gervaise.

512
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,528
Gervaise...
oh, no, this is, uh...

513
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:55,762
Out in the front there is simon

514
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,197
Who is supposed
to insult the waiter

515
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:58,298
And he's forgotten.

516
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,935
And oliver has run himself over.

517
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,971
What a great twit!

518
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,639
And there...
now here comes vivian.

519
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:08,442
Vivian to insult the waiter,
and he is heaping abuse on him

520
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:09,977
And he is humiliating him there.

521
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,411
And he's gone into the lead.

522
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,646
Simon's not with him.

523
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,081
No, vivian's...
has hit the bar.

524
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:15,649
Now they've got to get
over this bar.

525
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,850
This is extremely difficult

526
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,852
As it requires
absolutely expert coordination

527
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:19,953
Between mind and body.

528
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,522
No, they're hitting it there.

529
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:22,856
Here we go again.

530
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,124
Simon's fallen backwards.

531
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,759
Here's nigel, and he's tripped.

532
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,427
Nigel has tripped,
and he's under

533
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:28,862
And simon fails again.

534
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,597
Now here is gervaise,
going to jump through

535
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,099
And simon is through
by accident.

536
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,634
Here's gervaise
to be the last one over.

537
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,801
Here we are.

538
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:36,236
Here's nigel right at the head
of the field

539
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,738
And now he's going
to shoot the rabbit.

540
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,439
These rabbits have been tied
to the ground

541
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,941
And they're going
to be a bit frisky.

542
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,176
And this is only
a one-day event.

543
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,577
And they're blazing away there.

544
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,646
They're not getting quite
the results that they might.

545
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,014
Gervaise is in there

546
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,916
Trying to bash it to death
with the butt of his rifle.

547
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,851
And I think nigel's in there
with his bare hands

548
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,686
But they're not getting
the results they might

549
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,121
But it is a little bit
misty today

550
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,690
And they must be shooting
from a range of at least a foot.

551
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,825
But there's a couple
of hits there, I think.

552
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:00,327
Yes, they've had
a couple of hits

553
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,563
And the whole field is up again
and here they are.

554
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,064
They're coming up to the debs--

555
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,066
Gervaise first, vivian second,
simon third.

556
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,669
And now they've got to take
the bras off from the front.

557
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,103
This is really difficult.

558
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:11,839
This is really
the most difficult part

559
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:13,240
Of the entire competition.

560
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,676
And they're having a bit
of trouble in there, I think.

561
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,812
They're really trying now and
the crowd is getting excited

562
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,882
And I think some of the twits
are getting rather excited, too.

563
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,551
But anyway, vivian is there,
vivian is coming through.

564
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:27,988
Simon's in second place and...
oh, there's oliver.

565
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,090
He's dead, but he's not
necessarily out of it.

566
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:31,124
There goes nigel.

567
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:32,492
No, he's lost something.

568
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:34,828
And gervaise running through
to this final obstacle.

569
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:36,964
Now, all they have to do here
to win the title is

570
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,098
To shoot themselves.

571
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:39,399
Simon has a go--
bad luck, he misses.

572
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,767
Nigel misses.

573
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,103
Now, there's gervaise,
and gervaise has shot himself.

574
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,273
Gervaise is upper-class twit
of the year.

575
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,976
There's nigel--
he's shot simon by mistake.

576
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:51,178
Simon is second
and there's nigel.

577
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:52,813
Nigel's shot himself.

578
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,748
Nigel is third in this fine

579
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,951
And most exciting upper-class
twit of the year I've ever seen.

580
00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:01,455
Wait-- nigel's clubbed himself
into fourth place.

581
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:04,958
And so the final result: the
upper-class twit of the year--

582
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:08,128
Gervaise brook-hampster
of kensington and weybridge;

583
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:10,931
Runner-up-- vivian smith-
smythe-smith of kensington;

584
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:13,500
And third-- nigel incubator-
jones of henley.

585
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:16,270
Well, there'll certainly be
some car door slamming

586
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,338
In the streets
of kensington tonight.

587
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:20,741
Dear sir, how splendid it is

588
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:23,343
To see the flower
of british manhood

589
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,847
Wiping itself out
with such pluck and tenacity.

590
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,950
Britain need have no fear
with leaders of this caliber.

591
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,886
If only a few of
the so-called working classes

592
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,355
Would destroy themselves
so sportingly.

593
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:36,723
Yours, etc.

594
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:39,326
Brigadier mainwaring
smith smith smith, etc.

595
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:41,261
(deceased, etc.)

596
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:44,765
P.s., etc. come on, other ranks,
show your stuff.

597
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:48,168
Yes, sir, I'll do me best, sir!

598
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:52,806
No, not
good enough.

599
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,978
No, still
not good enough.

600
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:03,283
Yes, that's better.

601
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,287
Hallelu jah, hallelu jah...

602
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:16,663
Okay, all clear.

603
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,297
Now, I understand

604
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,299
That you want to
marry my daughter.

605
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:55,936
That's right, yeah, yeah.

606
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:57,471
Yes, you realize,
of course

607
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,506
That rosamund is
still rather young?

608
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:01,808
Daddy, you make me feel
like a child.

609
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,310
Oh, yeah, you know...

610
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:05,479
Get them when
they're young, eh... eh?

611
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:06,780
You know what I mean?!

612
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:11,185
I'm sure you know
what I mean, mister...

613
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:14,354
Uh... shabby, ken shabby.

614
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,923
Mr. shabby, I just
want to make sure

615
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,958
That you'll be able to
look after my daughter.

616
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,426
Oh, yeah, yeah.

617
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,396
I'll be able
to look after her,
all right, sport.

618
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,131
Eh? you know
what I mean, eh?

619
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:25,232
And, uh...

620
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,734
What job do you do?

621
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:30,304
I clean out public lavatories.

622
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:34,041
Is there a promotion involved?

623
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,642
Oh, yeah, yeah.

624
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:41,348
After five years,
they give me a brush.

625
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,955
I'm sorry, squire,
I've gobbed on your carpet.

626
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,724
And, uh... where are
you going to live?

627
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:53,393
Well, round
at my gran's.

628
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,928
She trains polecats

629
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,730
But most of them
have suffocated

630
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:59,833
So there should be
a bit of spare room
in the attic, eh?

631
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,335
Know what I mean?

632
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:02,569
I see.

633
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,771
And when do you expect
to get married?

634
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,841
Oh, right away, sport,
right away, you know?

635
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,810
I haven't had it for weeks.

636
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:14,481
Well, look,
I'll phone the bishop

637
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,316
And see if we can get the abbey.

638
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,318
Oh, diarrhea.

639
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,256
<i>the story so far...</i>

640
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,191
<i>rosamund's father

641
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,827

<i>on behalf of the wood party.</i>

657
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,200
Good evening.

658
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,735
We in the wood party
feel very strongly

659
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:12,706
That the present weak drafting
of the local government bill

660
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,175
Leaves a lot to be desired

661
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,344
And we intend to fight.

662
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,351
Hello?

663
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:27,020
Hello?!

664
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:31,225
I'm afraid the minister's fallen
through the earth's crust.

665
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,227
Excuse me a moment.

666
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,228
Hello?

667
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,596
Hello.

668
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:37,197
Are you all right,
minister?

669
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:40,367
I appear to have landed
on this kind of ledge thing.

670
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,903
Shall we lower down
one of the bbc ropes?

671
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,471
If you'd be so kind.

672
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:45,906
What length
of bbc rope

673
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,474
Will we be likely
to need?

674
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,610
I should use
the longest bbc rope.

675
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:52,312
That would be a good idea,
I would imagine.

676
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:54,348
Okey-doke, chief.

677
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:57,684
Tex, get the longest bbc rope
and bring it here pronto.

678
00:26:57,718 --> 00:26:59,987
In the meantime, since
I am on all channels

679
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,523
Perhaps I'd better carry on
with this broadcast

680
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:04,458
By shouting about
our housing plans

681
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:06,126
From down here
as best as I can.

682
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:08,195
Could someone throw me down
a script?

683
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,431
The script would appear

684
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:13,467
To have landed
on a different ledge

685
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,869
Somewhat out of my grasp,
don't you know.

686
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:18,338
Well, perhaps when
the rope reaches you,
minister

687
00:27:18,372 --> 00:27:19,773
You could kind
of swing over

688
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,008
To the ledge
and grab it.

689
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:22,142
Good idea.

690
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,844
Well, I'm going to carry on

691
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:25,479
If I can read the script.

692
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:28,916
Good evening.

693
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:30,350
We in the wood party...

694
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:32,986
Feel very strongly about...

695
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:38,825
The present weak drafting
of the local government bill.

696
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,295
And... no, it's no good,
it's not working.

697
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,164
I think I'll have to try
and make a grab for it.

698
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:46,500
Ah! there we are.

699
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:49,570
Good evening.

700
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:52,806
We in the wood party feel very
strongly about the present...

701
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,977
Oh, dear.

702
00:27:57,044 --> 00:27:57,978
Hello!

703
00:27:58,045 --> 00:27:59,146
Hello!

704
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,215
Look, I must look
a bit of a chump

705
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:03,183
Hanging upside down like this.

706
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:04,885
Don't worry,
minister.

707
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:07,487
I think, love, if we turn
the picture upside down

708
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,256
We should help
the minister, then.

709
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:10,624
Oh, good.

710
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,292
Look, I'm sorry about this.

711
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,761
There seems to be
a few gremlins about.

712
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,497
I think I'd better start
from the beginning.

713
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:19,132
Good evening.

714
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,836
We in the wood party
feel very strongly about...

715
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:24,505
Oh, bloody heck!

716
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:25,672
Oh!

717
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:28,208
Oh, dear.

718
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:31,044
Terribly sorry about this...

719
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:33,514
About saying "bloody heck"
on all channels, but...

720
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,883
There's another
script on the way
down, minister.

721
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,885
Oh, good, good.

722
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:41,221
Well, um... good evening.

723
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:45,459
Well, how are you?

724
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:48,462
Oh, look, I don't want you
to think of the wood party

725
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:51,465
As a load of old men that
like hanging around on ropes

726
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:54,301
Only i... oh...

727
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:55,702
Thank you.

728
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:57,938
Good evening.

729
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,407
We in the wood party
feel very strongly

730
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,476
About the present
weak drafting...

731
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,079
Look, I think we'd better
call it a day.

732
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:07,748
Is this the furthest distance

733
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,683
That a minister
has fallen? robert.

734
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:10,884
Surprisingly not.

735
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:13,153
The canadian minister
for external affairs

736
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,721
Fell nearly seven miles

737
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:17,758
During a liberal conference
in ottawa about six years ago.

738
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,092
And then quite recently

739
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:20,894
The kenyan minister
for agric. and fish

740
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:22,129
Fell nearly 12 miles

741
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:23,897
During a nairobi debate
in parliament

742
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,799
Although this hasn't been
ratified yet.

743
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:28,502
How far did the filipino cabinet
fall last march?

744
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,070
Well, they fell nearly 39 miles

745
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:32,606
But it's not nearly
so remarkable, as that was due

746
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:34,808
To their combined weight,
of course, robert.

747
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,276
Yes, well, thank you, robert.

748
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,645
Well now, what are your
reactions to all this? robert.

749
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:39,913
Well... well, robert

750
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:41,515
The main thing is
that it's terribly exciting

751
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:42,683
Tremendously exciting.

752
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:44,251
You see, the minister is
quite clearly lodged

753
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:46,720
Between rocks we know terribly
little of, terribly little.

754
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:49,089
Of course, the main thing is
we're getting color pictures

755
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,490
Of an extraordinarily
high quality

756
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:51,658
Extraordinarily high quality.

757
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:52,860
But the important thing is...

758
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:54,428
The really exciting thing is

759
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:56,663
The minister will be bringing
back samples of the earth's core

760
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,931
Which will give us a tremendous

761
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,967
Really tremendous, tremendous,
tremendous clue

762
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,569
As to the origins of the earth
and what god himself is made of.

763
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:03,737
Oh, oh, I needed that.

764
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:04,771
Thank you, robert.

765
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:05,772
Well, that seems to be

766
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,307
About all
we have time for tonight

767
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:09,109
Unless anyone has
anything else to say.

768
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:10,644
Has anyone anything else to say?

769
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:11,178
No.

770
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,212
Nope, nope.

771
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:12,746
No.

772
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,415
No.

773
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,450
No.

774
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:16,950
No.

775
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,518
No.

776
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:18,585
No!

777
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:19,119
No.

778
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:19,820
No.

779
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:20,921
Bloody fairy.

780
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:21,455
No.

781
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:22,489
No!

782
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:25,526
Uh... no.

783
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:26,193
No.

784
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,160
No.

785
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:28,095
<i>nein... no.</i>

786
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:29,763
No.

787
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,699
No, no, no, no.

788
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:33,767
What do we mean by "no"?

789
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:34,935
What do we mean by "yes"?

790
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:36,637
What do we mean by "no, no, no"?

791
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:39,439
<i>tonight spectrum looks at the
whole question of "what is no?"</i>
