00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,009

<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

3
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,271
I thought you did that
so well, mr. figgis.

4
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,739
Could I have
your autograph?

5
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,107
Certainly, yes.

00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,116
Beethoven, mozart, chopin,
liszt, brahms, panties--

7
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,151
I'm sorry.

00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,522
Schumann, schubert,
mendelssohn and bach.

9

Names that will live forever.

10
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,993
But there is one composer

11
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,029
Whose name is never
included with the greats.

12
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,465
Why is it the world
never remembered

13
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,534

All clear,
boss.

104
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,784
Right, this is
the plan, then.

105
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,554
At 10:45 you, reg, collect
me and ken in the van

106
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,290
And take us around to the
british jewelry center

107
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,691
In the high street.

108
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,261
We arrive outside

At 10:50 a of m.

110
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,197
I shall then get out of the car.

111
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,932
You, reg, take it and park it

112
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,001
Back here
in denver street, right?

113
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,671
At 10:51 I shall enter
the british jewelry center

114
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:21,675
Where you, vic, disguised
as a customer, will meet me

115
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,177
And hand me £5.18.3.

116
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:27,447
At 10:52 I shall
approach the counter

117
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,584
And purchase a watch
costing £5.18.3.

118
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,319
I shall then give
the watch to you, vic.

119
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,788
You'll go straight to norman's
garage in east street.

120
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,890
You lads come and pick me
back up here at 10:56

121
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,426
And we rendezvous in the back
room of the cow and sickle

At 11:15.

123
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,929
All right, any questions?

124
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,032
We don't seem to be doing
anything illegal.

125
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,367
What do you mean?

126
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,003
Well, we're paying
for the watch.

127
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,472
Yeah?

128
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,942
Well, why are we paying
for the watch?

129
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,110
They wouldn't give it to us

130
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:00,047
If we didn't pay
for it, would they?

131
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,683
I don't like this outfit.

132
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:03,217
Why not?

133
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,284
Well, we never break

134
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,319
The bloody law!

135
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,387
What do you mean?!

136
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,122
Well, look at that
bank job last week.

137
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,524
What was wrong
with that?

138
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,025
Well, having to
go in there

139
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,660
With a mask on
and ask for £15

140
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,195
Out of my
deposit account--

141
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,396
That's what
was wrong.

142
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,332
What are you trying
to say, larry?

143
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,567
Couldn't we just steal
the watch, boss?

144
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:21,735
Oh, you dumb cluck!

145
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,437
We spent weeks
organizing this job!

146
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,038
Reg rented a room
across the road

147
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,274
And filmed people going
in and out every day.

148
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,643
Vic spent three weeks
looking at watch catalogs

149
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,812
Till he knew the price
of each one backwards.

150
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,847
And I'm not going
to risk the whole raid

151
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,782
Just for the sake
of breaking the law!

152
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,150
Couldn't we park
in the double yellow line?

153
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,151
No!

154
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,152
Couldn't
we get

155
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,153
A dog to foul
the foot?

156
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,154
What's the matter
with you?

157
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,322
I just thought I've...

158
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,157
I left the car on a meter
and it's...

159
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,527
Overdue?

160
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,529
Yes, boss.

161
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,530
How much?

162
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:50,764
I don't know, boss

163
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,933
Maybe two...
maybe five minutes.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,369
Five minutes
overdue?!

165
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,572
You fool!

166
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,607
You fool!

167
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,042
All right, we have
no time to lose.

168
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,977
Ken, shave all your hair off,
get your passport

169
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,045
And meet me
at this address

170
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,280

tuesday night.

171
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,447

172
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,049
Have plastic surgery
and meet me there.

173
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,285
Reg, go to canada, work your
way south to nicaragua by july.

174
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,653
Larry, you stay here
as front man.

175
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,388
Give us 15 minutes,
then blow the building up.

176
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,656
All right, make it fast.

177
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,224
Hey, boss, I can't
blow the building up.

178
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:17,925
Why not?

179
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,560
It's illegal.

180
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,628
Oh, bloody hell.

181
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,530
Well, we'd better
give ourselves up, then.

182
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,164
We can't boss.

183
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,265
Why not?

184
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,800
We haven't done
anything illegal.

185
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,739
Excuse me.

186
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:37,244
No, well, I think being illegal
makes it more exciting.

187
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,312
Yeah, I agree.

188
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,948
I mean, if you're going
to go straight

189
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,951
You might as well be
a vicar or something.

190
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,787
What?

191
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:47,754
I agree.

192
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,256
If there were fewer robbers

193
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,625
There wouldn't be so many of
them, numerically speaking.

194
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,827
I think sexual ecstasy
is overrated.

195
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,829
Well, how very interesting

196
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,599
Because I'm now made
entirely of tin.

197
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,934
After a few more
of these remarks

198
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:04,371
I shall be appearing
in a sketch, so stay tuned.

199
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:08,442
It's the uniform that puts them
off-- that and my bad breath.

200
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,314
We like
dressing up, yes.

201
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,718
Hello again.

202
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,354
I am at present still on film,
but in a few seconds

203
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,322
I shall be appearing
in the studio.

204
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:22,990
Thank you.

205
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,225
Hello.

206
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,697
Mr. milton, you are
sole proprietor and owner

207
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,599
Of the whizzo chocolate company?

208
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,233
I am.

209
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,801
Superintendent parrot and i

210
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,303
Are from the hygiene squad.

211
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,640
We want to have a word with you
about your box of chocolates

212
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,942
Entitled "the whizzo
quality assortment."

213
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:42,943
Ah, yes.

214
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,412
If I may begin
at the beginning.

215
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,182
First there is
the "cherry fondue."

216
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,618
This is extremely nasty, but we
can't prosecute you for that.

217
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:52,186
Agreed.

218
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,220
Next, we have

219
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,789
Number four-- "crunchy frog."

220
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:56,390
Ah, yes.

221
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,691
Am I right

222
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,393
In thinking
there's a real frog in here?

223
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,594
Yes, a little one.

224
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,929
What sort of frog?

225
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:02,996
A dead frog.

226
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,199
Is it cooked?

227
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,200
No.

228
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,267
What, a raw frog?

229
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,270
We use only the finest
baby frogs

230
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,272
Dew picked and flown from iraq

231
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:16,210
Cleansed in the finest quality
spring water, lightly killed

232
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:19,279
And then sealed in a succulent
swiss quintuple smooth

233
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,348
Treble cream
milk chocolate envelope

234
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,383
And lovingly frosted
with glucose.

235
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,385
That's as maybe,
it's still a frog.

236
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,353
Oh, what else?

237
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,521
Well, don't you even take

238
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,355
The bones out?

239
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,489
If we took the bones out

240
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,858
It wouldn't be crunchy,
would it?

241
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,496
Superintendent parrot
ate one of those.

242
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,867
Excuse me a moment.

243
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,035
It says "crunchy frog"
quite clearly.

244
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,805
Well, the superintendent
thought it was an almond whirl.

245
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,207
People won't expect there
to be a frog in there.

246
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,710
They're bound to think
it's some form of mock frog.

247
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:50,777
Mock frog?

248
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,713
We use no artificial
preservatives

249
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,147
Or additives
of any kind.

250
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,750
Nevertheless, I must
warn you that in future

251
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,286
You should delete
the words "crunchy frog"

252
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,054
And replace them
with the legend

253
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,223
"crunchy, raw, unboned,
real dead frog"

254
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,125
If you want to avoid
prosecution.

255
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,260
What about our sales?

256
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,328
I'm not interested
in your sales.

257
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,898
I have to protect
the general public.

258
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,432
Now, how about this one?

259
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,035
It was number five,
wasn't it?

260
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,671
Number five--
"ram's bladder cup."

261
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,807
What kind of
confection is this?

262
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,778
We use choicest, juicy chunks
of fresh cornish ram's bladder

263
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,681
Emptied, steamed,
flavored with sesame seeds

264
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:31,251
Whipped into a fondue
and garnished with lark's vomit.

265
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,687
Lark's vomit?

266
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,821
Correct.

267
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,790
Well, it don't say
nothing about that here.

268
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,960
Oh, yes, it does,
on the bottom of the box

269
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,595
After monosodium
glutamate.

270
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,830
Well, I hardly think
this is good enough.

271
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,832
I think it would be
more appropriate

272
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:49,136
If the box bore a large red
label warning, "lark's vomit."

273
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,571
Our sales would plummet.

274
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,939
Well, why don't you move

275
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,474
Into more conventional areas
of confectionery

276
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,176
Like praline or lime cream?--

277
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,712
A very popular flavor
I'm led to understand.

278
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,381
I mean, look at this one--
"cockroach cluster."

279
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,286
"anthrax ripple."

280
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,322
What's this one--
"spring surprise"?

281
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,923
Ah, now, that's our specialty--

282
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,792
Covered in darkest
creamy chocolate

283
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,595
When you pop it in your mouth,
steel bolts spring out

284
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,663
And plunge straight
through both cheeks.

285
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,533
Well, where's
the pleasure in that?

286
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,735
If people place a nice chocky
in their mouths

287
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:22,903
They don't want
their cheeks pierced.

288
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,371
In any case

289
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,573
This is an inadequate
description of the sweetmeat.

290
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,941
I should have
to ask you

291
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,643
To accompany me
to the station.

292
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,611
It's a fair cop.

293
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,179
Stop talking to the camera.

294
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,213
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,286
If only the general public
would take more care

296
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,821
When buying its sweeties

297
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:44,124
It would reduce the number
of man-hours lost to the nation

298
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,494
And they would spend less time
having their stomachs pumped

299
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:49,796
And sitting around
in public lavatories.

300
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,833
The bbc would like to apologize

301
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,969
For the extremely poor quality
of the next announcement

302
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,571
Only he is not at all well.

303
00:13:57,638 --> 00:14:01,675
We present "the dull life
of a city stockbroker."

304
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:18,038
Yes, sir, coming right up, the
theater sketch, so don't move.

00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,860

Yes, she's

She fine actress.

311
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,975
She make interpretation
heap subtle.

312
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:57,377
She heap good diction
and timing.

313
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,614
She make part really live
for indian brave.

314

Yes, yes,
she's marvelous.

315
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:07,254
My father-- chief running stag,
leader of mighty redfoot tribe--

00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,457
Him heap keen on michael
denison and dulcie gray.

317
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,895
Um, do you go to
the theater a lot?

318
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,932
When moon high over prairie,
when wolf howl over mountain

319
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,869
When mighty wind roar
through yellow valley

320
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,437
We go leatherhead rep.

321
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,740

Whole tribe get in
on 3/6d each.

323

That's very good.

324

Stage manager, stan wilson,

325

After show, we go powwow,
speakum with director sandy camp

Him heap famous.

329
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,694
Yes, I don't
know him myself.

330
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,530
Him say leatherhead rep

331
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:52,032
Like to play
with redfoot tribe.

332
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:52,966
Oh, that's good.

333
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,469
<i>We do dial m for murder.</i>

334
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:59,006
Chief running elk, him kill
buffalo with bare hands

335
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,775
Run thousand paces

You do a lot

339
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:11,818
Yes, redfoot tribe live
by acting and hunting.

340
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,287
You don't fight anymore?

341
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,455
Yes! redfoot make war.

342
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,791
When chief yellow snake
was leader

343
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,094
And mighty eagle was
in land of forefather

344
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,097
We fight pawnee

345
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:27,701
<i>When pawnee steal our rehearsal
copies of reluctant debutante...</i>

We kill 50 pawnee.

347
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,706
Houses heap full every night.

348
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,308
Heap good publicity.

349
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,510
I think it's
about to start now.

350
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:37,878
Thank god for that.

351
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,713
Paleface like
eat chocolate?

352
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,315
No, thank you
very much.

353
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,717
Mmm, crunchy frog,
heap good.

354
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,756
Ladies and gentlemen,
before the play starts

355
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,859
I would like to apologize
to you all

356
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:55,095
But unfortunately, miss cicely
courtneidge is unable to appear

357
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:55,896
Owing to...

358
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,136
Oh, did you
read that, edgar?

359
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,338
What was that, dear?

360
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:06,573
There's been another
indian massacre

361
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,175
At dorking civic theater.

362
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:09,676
About time,
too, dear.

363
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,446
"those who were
left alive at the end

364
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,181
Got their money back."

365
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,849
That's what
live theater needs--

366
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,351
A few more
massacres.

367
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,486
"the police are
anxious to speak

368
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,388
"to anyone
who saw the crime

369
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,257
"ladies with large breasts

370
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,759
Or just anyone
who likes policemen."

371
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,032
Yes, policemen make
wonderful friends.

372
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:35,269
So if you are over six feet tall
and would like a friend--

373
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,304
A pen friend--
in the police force

374
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,007
Here is the address to write to:
mrs. ena frog

375
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,409
8 masonic apron street,
cowdenbeath.

376
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,978
Remember, policemen make
wonderful friends

377
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:48,415
So write today and take
advantage of our free officer.

378
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:49,416
Thank you.

379
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,485
Now for the next sketch.

380
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:56,490
Ooh...

381
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:58,358
Oh, thank you.

382
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,930
Ooh, a scotsman on a horse!

383
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,932
For mrs. emma hamilton
of nelson

384
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:06,934
A scotsman on a horse.

385
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:25,812
Oh, I liked that.

386
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:29,216
I want to get one of those
for myself, too, peachy-face.

387
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,690
Ooh!

388
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,060
Whoa!

389
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:42,262
Whoa!

390
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,199
The police, percy!

391
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:46,266
We know
you're in there

392
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,734
So come out
with your hands up

393
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,102
And there'll be no trouble.

394
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:51,738
You'll never take
me alive, copper.

395
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:54,308
Ooh, all right.

396
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,676
Good morning, boys.

397
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,211
Good morning,
mr. saltzberg.

398
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,747
Sit down, sit down,
sit down, sit down.

399
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:35,716
Well, boys,
I want you to know

400
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,520
That I think you're the best
six writers in movies today.

401
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:41,889
And I want you to know
that I've had an idea

402
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,957
For the next movie
I'm going to produce

403
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:45,926
And I want you boys
to write it.

404
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,932
Oh, sit down, sit down,
sit down, sit down.

405
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:54,935
There'll be plenty of time
for that later on.

406
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:58,672
Now, here's my idea.

407
00:23:58,705 --> 00:23:59,273
It's great.

408
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,641
You like it?

409
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,545
Do you like it?

410
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,880
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

411
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:09,082
What do you like
best about it?

412
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:11,885
Oh, well, you haven't told us
what it is yet.

413
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,287
What?

414
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,022
Um... I like
what he likes.

415
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,056
What do you like?

416
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,057
Oh, I like
what he likes.

417
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,058
I like what he likes.

418
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:19,026
I like what he likes.

419
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,027
I'm just crazy
about what he likes.

420
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,128
What do you
like about it?

421
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:22,229
I agree
with them.

422
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,565
Good, now we're
getting somewhere.

423
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:27,134
Now, here's the start
of the movie.

424
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:30,037
I see snow...

425
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:32,639
White snow.

426
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:33,640
Think of the colors!

427
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:36,844
And in the snow,
I see a tree.

428
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,680
Wait, wait,
I haven't finished yet.

429
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:40,681
There's more?

430
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:42,850
And by this tree, gentlemen

431
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:43,884
I see a dog.

432
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,385
<i>ole!</i>

433
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,456
And, gentlemen,
this dog goes up to the tree

434
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:51,525
And he piddles on it.

435
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:53,293
Hallelu jah!

436
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,362
Have we got a movie!

437
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:57,264
He tells it
the way it is.

438
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,031
It's where it's at.

439
00:24:58,098 --> 00:24:59,032
This is
something else.

440
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,267
It's out
of sight!

441
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,603
I like it,
I like it!

442
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,104
Oh, yeah?

443
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:05,873
Yeah, yeah,
I promise I like it.

444
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:08,275
Sir, I don't know
how to say this

445
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:10,844
But I've got to be
perfectly frank.

446
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:14,982
I really and truly believe
this story of yours

447
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:17,518
Is the greatest story
in motion picture history.

448
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,152
Get out!

449
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:21,855
If there's one thing I can't
stand, it's a yes-man.

450
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:22,890
Get out!

451
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:24,491
I'll see you
never work again!

452
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:25,325
What do you think?

453
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,560
Well, I uh...

454
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:27,861
Just because I have an idea

455
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:29,162
It doesn't mean it's great.

456
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,097
It could be lousy.

457
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,698
It could?

458
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:33,734
Yeah, what do you think?

459
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,636
It's lousy.

460
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:37,604
There you are, you see,
he spoke his mind.

461
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:38,839
He said my idea was lousy.

462
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:41,308
Just so happens my idea
isn't lousy.

463
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:44,778
So get out, you goddamn pinko
subversive, get out!

464
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:45,879
You!

465
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:50,751
Well, i... I think it's
an excellent idea.

466
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:52,119
Are you a yes-man?

467
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,588
No... I mean, there may be
things against it.

468
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,923
You think it's lousy?

469
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:58,525
No, no... I mean, it takes time.

470
00:25:58,592 --> 00:25:59,960
Are you being indecisive?

471
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:01,028
Yo...

472
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:02,963
Nes... perhaps.

473
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:08,235
Now, I hope you three gentlemen
aren't going to be indecis...

474
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:10,671
What the hell are you doing
under that table?

475
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:11,905
We dropped our pencils.

476
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:13,473
Pencil-droppers, eh?

477
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,675
No, no, no.

478
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:15,876
Right.

479
00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:19,746
Now, I want your
opinion of my idea.

480
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,747
You!

481
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:24,918
Has he had a heart attack?

482
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:26,486
If there's one thing
I can't stand

483
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:28,188
It's people
who have heart attacks!

484
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:29,623
I feel fine now.

485
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,491
Well, what do you think?

486
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:33,694
Uh... you didn't
ask me, you asked him.

487
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,029
Oh... you didn't
ask me, you asked him.

488
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:37,164
Uh... him.

489
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:39,633
I've changed my mind.

490
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,335
I'm asking you,
the one in the middle.

491
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:42,336
The one in the middle?

492
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,337
Yes, the one
in the middle!

493
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,139
Hello?

494
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:47,241
Yes, dmitri.

495
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:48,342
No, no,
it's all right.

496
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:49,543
Just a second...

497
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,178
What the hell
are you doing?

498
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:52,446
Uh, thinking.

499
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:54,381
Get back in those seats
immediately.

500
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,350
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

501
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:58,318
Right, you, the one
in the middle.

502
00:26:58,352 --> 00:26:59,353
What do you think?

503
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:03,690
Come on!

504
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:04,858
Splunge!

505
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:07,261
Did he say "splunge"?

506
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,295
Yeah.

507
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:09,763
What does "splunge" mean?

508
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,132
It means it's a great idea

509
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:13,667
But possibly not.

510
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:15,169
And I'm not being indecisive.

511
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:17,571
Good, all right,
what do you think?

512
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,173
Uh, splunge?

513
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,107
Okay.

514
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,309
Yeah, splunge for me, too.

515
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:25,479
So all three of you
think splunge.

516
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:27,347
Well, now we're
getting somewhere.

517
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,783
No, wait, a new angle:

518
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,587
In the snow, instead
of the tree, I see...

519
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,588
Rock hudson.

520
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:35,722
Yeah.

521
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:39,259
And instead of the dog,
I see doris day.

522
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,494
Oh, yes.

523
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:44,498
And gentlemen, doris day
goes up to rock hudson

524
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:46,366
And she kisses on him.

525
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,368
It's a love story.

526
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:50,037

00:27:58,512 --> 00:27:59,479

533
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:00,514
Like...

534
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,851
Good evening?

535
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:07,087
Doris day's a comedienne,

536
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:08,222

543
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,773
I like that, I like that--
"I can't take it anymore."

544
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,242
And then rock hudson says

545
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:30,744
"I'm a very rich film producer
and I need a lobotomy."

546
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:32,946
And then doris dog says,
"I think you're very handsome

547
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:34,681
And I'm going to take
all my clothes off."

548
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:36,283
And then doris dog turns
into a yak

549
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,318
And goes to the bathroom

550
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,454
