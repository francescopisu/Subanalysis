1
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,562
It's...

2
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,063
It's...

3
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,599
It's!

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,868
No, no!

5
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,203
<i>it's...</i>

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,673
It's!

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,176
It's...

8
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:46,480
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

9
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,710
Good evening.

10
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,111
Tonight we're
going to take

11
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,581
A hard, tough, abrasive look
at camel spotting.

12
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:21,582
Hello.

13
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:22,783
Hello, peter.

14
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,852
Now, tell me, what exactly
are you doing?

15
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,053
Well, I'm
camel spotting.

16
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,921
I'm spotting to see
if there are any camels

17
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,323
That I can spot
and put them down

18
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,757
In my camel-
spotting book.

19
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,660
Good, and how many camels
have you spotted so far?

20
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,396
Well, so far, peter,
up to the present moment

21
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,232
I've spotted nearly... oh...

22
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,900
Nearly one.

23
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:40,734
Nearly one.

24
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,969
Uh, call it none.

25
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,003
Fine.

26
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,838
And how long have you been here?

27
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:45,672
Three years.

28
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,007
So in three years

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,976
You've spotted no camels.

30
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,511
Yes, in only three years.

31
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,546
Uh, I tell a lie, four.

32
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,047
Be fair, five.

33
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,884
I've been camel spotting
for just the seven years.

34
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,585
Before that, of course,
I was a yeti spotter.

35
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,121
A yeti spotter, that must have
been extremely interesting.

36
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,490
Oh, it was extremely
interesting.

37
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,958
Very, very, quite...

38
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,393
It was dull.

39
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,696
Dull, dull, dull,
oh, god, it was dull!

40
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,799
Sitting in
the waterloo waiting room.

41
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,002
Course once you've seen one yeti
you've seen them all.

42
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,036
And have you seen them all?

43
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,137
Well, I've seen one...

44
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,405
Well, a little one...

45
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,340
A picture of a...
I've heard about them.

46
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,510
Well, now, tell me, what do
you do when you spot a camel?

47
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,611
I take its number.

48
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,281
Uh, camels don't have numbers.

49
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,116
Oh, well, you've got to know
where to look.

50
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,684
They're on the side
of the engine

51
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:31,785
Above the piston box.

52
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,986
What?

53
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,688
You've got to make sure
it's not a dromedary

54
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,722
Cause if
it's a dromedary

55
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,857
It goes in
the dromedary book.

56
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,525
Well, how do you tell
if it's a dromedary?

57
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,294
Well, a dromedary
has one hump

58
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,229
And a camel has
a refreshment car

59
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,931
Buffet and
ticket collector.

60
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,503
Mr. sopwith, aren't you
in fact a train spotter?

61
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,004
What?

62
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,140
Don't you
in fact spot trains?

63
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,542
Oh, you're
no fun anymore!

64
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,193
Oh, no, rashid, we can't
go on meeting like this.

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,096
Oh, you are no fun anymore!

66
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,173
Oh, you're
no fun anymore.

67
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,742
29... 30!

68
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,212
All right, cut him down,
mr. fuller.

69
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,315
Oh, you're
no fun anymore!

70
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,951
Now, look, if anybody else
pinches my phrase

71
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,786
I'll throw them
under a camel.

72
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,588
If you can spot one.

73
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,424
What?

74
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,427
Lady chairman,
sir, shareholders

75
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,363
Ladies and gentlemen

76
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,231
I have great pleasure
in announcing

77
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,800
That owing to a cutback
on surplus expenditure

78
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,135
Of $12 million canadian

79
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,571
Plus a refund of
71/2 million deutschemarks

80
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,640
From the swiss branch,
and in addition

81
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,241
Adding the debenture preference
stock of 3 3/4 million

82
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,743
To the directors' reserve
currency account

83
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,144
Of 71/2 million

84
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,314
Plus an upward expenditure
margin of 11,500 lire

85
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:10,184
Due to rising capital investment
of ten million pounds

86
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:13,320
This firm last year made
a complete profit of a shilling.

87
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,190
A shilling, wilkins?

88
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,558
Roughly, yes, sir.

89
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,092
Wilkins, I am the chairman

90
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,128
Of a multimillion-pound
corporation

91
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,764
And you are a very new
chartered accountant.

92
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,567
Isn't it possible there
may have been some mistake?

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,568
Well, that's
very kind of you, sir

94
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,969
But I don't think
I'm ready to be chairman yet.

95
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,639
Wilkins, this shilling,
is it net or gross?

96
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,608
It's british, sir.

97
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,710
Has tax been paid on it?

98
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,145
Yes, this is after tax.

99
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,280
Owing to the rigorous bite
of the income tax

100
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,150
Five pence of a further sixpence
was swallowed up in tax.

101
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,853
Five pence
of a further sixpence?

102
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,687
Yes, sir.

103
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,755
Five pence
of a further sixpence?

104
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:49,790
That's right, sir.

105
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,793
Then where is
the other penny?

106
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,098
Uh...

107
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,200
That makes you a penny
short, wilkins.

108
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,502
Where is it?

109
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,340
Uh...

110
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,174
Wilkins!

111
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,977
I embezzled it, sir!

112
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,645
What, all of it?

113
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:12,679
Yes, all of it.

114
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,081
You naughty person!

115
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:16,917
It's my first.

116
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,018
Please be
gentle with me.

117
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,887
I'm afraid it's
my unpleasant duty

118
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,421
To inform you
that you're fired.

119
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,456
Oh, please, please.

120
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,457
No, out!

121
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,894
There's no place
for sentiment

122
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,395
In big business!

123
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,300
Oh, you're
no fun anymore.

124
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,801
I heard that!
who said that?

125
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,802
He did!
he did!

126
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,803
No, I didn't.

127
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,838
Ooh!

128
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,039
Right!

129
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,950
Here is the address
to complain to:

130
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,719
The royal
frog tramping institute

131
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,722
16 rayners lane,
london, w.c. fields.

132
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,324
I'll just repeat that:

133
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,626
Tristram and isolde phillips

134
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,696
7.30 covent garden
saturday near sunday

135
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,465
And afterwards at
the inigo jones fish emporium.

136
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,569
And they want to put
the license fee up?

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,075
And now here is a reminder

138
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,845
About leaving your radio on
during the night.

139
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,447
Leave your radio on
during the night.

140
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,919
A little joke, a little jest!

141
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,655
Nothing to worry about,
ladies and gentlemen!

142
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,092
Now we've got some science
fiction for you, some ski-fi

143
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,661
Something to send the shivers
up your spine

144
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,831
Send the creepy crawlies
down your lager and limes.

145
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,967
All the lads
have contributed to it.

146
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,704
Here's a little number entitled,
"science fiction sketch."

147
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:50,210
<i>the universe consists of
a billion billion galaxies</i>

148
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,213
<i>77 billion miles across</i>

149
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:58,151
<i>and every galaxy is made up
of a billion zillion stars</i>

150
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,822
<i>and around these stars
circle a billion planets</i>

151
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,957
<i>and of all these planets</i>

152
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:08,495
<i>the greenestand the
pleasantest is the planet earth</i>

153
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:14,134
<i>in the system of sol in the
galaxy known as the milky way.</i>

154
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,370
<i>and it was to this world</i>

155
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,873
<i>that creatures
of an alien planet came</i>

156
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,680
<i>to conquer and destroy
the very heart of civilization.</i>

157
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,117
<i>it was a da y like manyanother</i>

158
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,286
<i>and mr. and mrs.
samuel brainsample</i>

159
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,321
<i>were a perfectly
ordinary couple</i>

160
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,390
<i>leading perfectly
ordinary lives</i>

161
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,458
<i>the sort of people</i>

162
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,595
<i>to whom nothing extraordinary
ever happened.</i>

163
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,631
<i>and not the kind of people
to be the center</i>

164
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,367
<i>of one of the most
astounding incidents</i>

165
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,902
<i>in the history of mankind.</i>

166
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,437
<i>so let's forgetabout them...</i>

167
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,441
<i>and follow instead
the destiny of this man:</i>

168
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:59,213
<i>harold potter, gardener
and tax official</i>

169
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:03,917
<i>first victim of creatures
from another planet.</i>

170
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,189
Read all about it!
read all about it!

171
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,724
Man turns into scotsman!

172
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,360
Mrs. potter, you knew mr. potter
quite well, I believe.

173
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,195
Oh, yes, quite well,
he was me husband.

174
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,264
Yes, and he never showed
any inclination

175
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,699
Towards being a scotsman
before this happened?

176
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,700
No, no, not at all.

177
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,868
He was not
that sort of person.

178
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,637
He didn't wear a kilt
or play the bagpipes?

179
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,671
No, no, no, no.

180
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,705
He never
got drunk at night

181
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,007
Or brought home
black puddings?

182
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,375
No, no, not at all.

183
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,710
He didn't have
an inadequate brain capacity?

184
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,012
No, no, not at all.

185
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,446
I see, so by your account

186
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,249
Harold potter was
a perfectly ordinary englishman

187
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,619
Without any tendency towards
being a scotsman whatsoever?

188
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,121
Absolutely, yes.

189
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,624
Mind you, he did always watch
dr. finlay on the television.

190
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,026
Aha!

191
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,029
Well, that's it, you see;
that's how it starts.

192
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:22,829
I beg your pardon?

193
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,998
Well, you see,
scottishness starts

194
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,835
With little things like that
and works up.

195
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,470
You see, people don't just
turn into a scotsman

196
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,705
For no reason at all.

197
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,541
No further questions!

198
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,736
Halt!

199
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,471
Left turn!

200
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,094
Charles?

201
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,362
Darling.

202
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,063
Charles?

203
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,431
Darling, darling.

204
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,834
Charles, there's something
I've got to tell you.

205
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,169
What is it, darling?

206
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,539
It's daddy; he's turned
into a scotsman.

207
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,008
What? mr. llewellyn?

208
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,609
Yes, charles.

209
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,211
Help me, please help me.

210
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,612
But what can I do?

211
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,215
Surely, charles,
you're the chief scientist

212
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,851
At the anthropological
research institute

213
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,786
At butley downe--

214
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,088
An expert in
what makes people change

215
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,090
From one nationality
to another.

216
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,125
So I am!

217
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,028
This is right up
my street.

218
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,963
Oh, good.

219
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,064
Now, first of all

220
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,133
Why would anyone
turn into a scotsman?

221
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,168
Um, for business reasons?

222
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:11,672
No, no, only because he has
no control over his own destiny.

223
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:12,906
Look, I'll show you.

224
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,111
I see!

225
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:22,182
Yes, so this means that
some person or persons unknown

226
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,385
Is turning all these people
into scotsmen.

227
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,955
Oh, what kind of
heartless fiend

228
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,823
Could do that
to a man?

229
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,992
I don't know,
I don't know.

230
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,527
All I know is
that these people

231
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:35,195
Are streaming north
of the border

232
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,030
At the rate of
thousands every hour.

233
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,131
If we don't act fast

234
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,100
Scotland will be choked
with scotsmen!

235
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,337
Ooh!

236
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:29,650
<i>soon, scotland was
full of scotsmen.</i>

237
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:33,620
<i>the overcrowding was pitiful.</i>

238
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,422
<i>three men to a caber.</i>

239
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:08,956
<i>for the few who remained</i>

240
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,159
<i>life was increasingly
difficult.</i>

241
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:12,853
Charles!

242
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,721
Thank goodness
I've found you.

243
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:15,722
It's mummy.

244
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:17,191
Hello, mummy.

245
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,194
No, no, mummy's
turned into a scotsman.

246
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,095
Oh, how horrible!

247
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,602
Will they stop
at nothing?

248
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:29,603
I don't know.

249
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:30,771
Do you think
they will?

250
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,306
I meant that rhetorically.

251
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,374
What does "rhetorically" mean?

252
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:35,843
It means I didn't
expect an answer.

253
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,177
Oh, I see.

254
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,313
Oh, you're so
clever, charles.

255
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,317
Did mummy say anything as
she changed?

256
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,486
Yes, she did, now you come
to mention it.

257
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,530
Well, what was it?

258
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,032
Oh, she said "them."

259
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,104
Is that someone
at the door?

260
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,540
No, it's just the incidental
music for the scene.

261
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,674
Oh, I see.

262
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,843
Them-- wait
a minute!

263
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,012
A whole minute?

264
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,381
No, I meant that metaphorically.

265
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,616
Them... them...

266
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,117
She was obviously
referring

267
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,620
To the people who turned
her into a scotsman.

268
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:22,556
<i>If only we knew
who they were</i>

269
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,292
<i>And why they
were doing it.</i>

270
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,932
Who are "them"?

271
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:37,037
<i>then suddenly, a clue
turned up in scotland.</i>

272
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:41,675
<i>mr. angus podgorny,
owner of a dunbar menswear shop</i>

273
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:45,179
<i>received an order
for 48 million kilts</i>

274
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:49,716
<i>from the planet skyron
in the galaxy of andromeda.</i>

275
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,219
Angus, how are you going to get

276
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,621
48 million kilts
into the van?

277
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:57,090
I'll have to do
it in two goes.

278
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,561
Do you not ken that
the galaxy of andromeda

279
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,996
Is 2,200,000
light-years away?

280
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,565
Is that so?

281
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,500
Aye, and you've
never been further

282
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:07,734
Than berwick-on-tweed.

283
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,369
Aye.

284
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,506
But think of the money, dear--
£18.10 a kilt.

285
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:13,774
That's...

286
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,879
£900 million!

287
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,447
And that's
without sporrans.

288
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:22,683
Aye, I think you ought
not to go, angus.

289
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,751
Aye, we'd be able
to afford writing paper

290
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,119
With our names on it.

291
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,622
We'd be able to buy that
extension to the toilet.

292
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,890
Yeah, but he
hasn't signed

293
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:31,024
The order
yet, has he?

294
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,159
Who?

295
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,561
Och, the man
from andromeda.

296
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:37,431
Och, well...

297
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:42,336
He wasn't really a man,
do you ken?

298
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,471
<i>Not really a man?</i>

299
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:48,342
He was as strange a
thing as ever I saw

300
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,844
Or ever I hope to
see, god willing.

301
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:54,181
He were a strange,
unearthly creature

302
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:58,018
A quivering,
glistening mass.

303
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:02,122
Angus podgorny,
what do you mean?

304
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,858
He wasn't
so much a man as...

305
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,994
A blancmange!

306
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:12,132
A blancmange, eh?

307
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,166
Yes, that's right.

308
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,169
I was just having
a game of doubles

309
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,571
With sandra and jocasta,
alec and david...

310
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,572
Hang on.

311
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:19,640
What?

312
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,674
There's five.

313
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,808
What?

314
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,077
Five people--
how do you play doubles

315
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,145
With five people?

316
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,313
Ah, well,
we were...

317
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,848
Sounds a bit funny
if you ask me

318
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,416
Playing doubles
with five people.

319
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,151
Well, we often
play like that.

320
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,954
Jocasta plays on the side
receiving service.

321
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,122
Oh, yes?

322
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:36,757
Yes, it helps
to speed the game up

323
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:37,991
And make it a lot faster

324
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,927
And it means jocasta
isn't left out.

325
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,728
Look, are you asking
me to believe

326
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:43,864
That the five of you
was playing doubles

327
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,399
When on the very next court

328
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,601
There was a blancmange
playing by itself?

329
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:48,836
That's right, yes.

330
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,204
Well, answer me
this then.

331
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,574
Why didn't jocasta play
the blancmange at singles

332
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:56,176
While you and sandra
and alec and david

333
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,712
Had a proper game of doubles
with four people?

334
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,480
<i>Because jocasta
always plays with us.</i>

335
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:01,915
<i>She's a friend of ours.</i>

336
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,283
Call that friendship?

337
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,719
Messing up a perfectly
good game of doubles?

338
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,888
It's not messing
it up, officer.

339
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,690
We like to play
with five.

340
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,458
Look, it's your affair

341
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,994
If you want to play
with five people

342
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,363
But don't go
calling it doubles.

343
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,698
Well, no...

344
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:19,566
Look, at wimbledon-- right?

345
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,635
If fred stolle and tony roche

346
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:24,638
Played charlie pasarell
and cliff drysdale

347
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,607
<i>and peaches bartcowitz</i>

348
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,142
They wouldn't go
calling it doubles.

349
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,445
But what about
the blancmange?

350
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:34,515
That could play ann haydon-jones
and her husband, pip.

351
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,651
Oh, a blancmange
gave you

352
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,620
An order for
48 million kilts?

353
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:40,754
Aye.

354
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:42,289
And you believed it?

355
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,423
Aye, I did.

356
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,692
Och, you're a stupid
man, angus podgorny.

357
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,994
Oh, look, woman!

358
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,029
How many kilts
did we sell last year?

359
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,597
Nine and a half,
that's all.

360
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,533
So when I get an order
for 48 million

361
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,634
I believe it.

362
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,135
You'd better believe it.

363
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:56,803
Even if it's
from a blancmange?

364
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,006
Och, woman, if a
blancmange is prepared

365
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,742
To come 2,200,000 light-years
to purchase a kilt

366
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,510
He must be fairly
keen on kilts.

367
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:06,113
So cease your prattling,
woman, and get sewing.

368
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,849
This could be the biggest
breakthrough in kilts

369
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,385
Since the provost of
edinburgh sat on a spike.

370
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,254
Mary, we'll be rich,
we'll be rich.

371
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:16,757
Oh, but, angus, he
hasn't even given you

372
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,592
An earnest of
his good faith.

373
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,728
Ah, maybe not, but
he has give me this.

374
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,163
Och, what is it now?

375
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:26,633
An entry form for the british
open tennis championships

376
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,102
At wimbledon toon,
signed and seconded.

377
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,137
Och, but, angus

378
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,139
You ken full well
that scotsfolk

379
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,141
Don't know how
to play the tennis

380
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,609
To save their lives.

381
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,377
Aye, but I must go,
though, dear.

382
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,146
I didn't want to
seem ungrateful.

383
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,848
Och, angus,
I will not let you

384
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,282
Make a fool
of yourself.

385
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:43,650
But I must.

386
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,118
Och, no, you'll not.

387
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,453
Oh, mary, mary.

388
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,393
Mary, look out!
look out!

389
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,864
It's the blancmange!

390
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,778
Oh, now this is

391
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,681
Where mr. podgorny could
have saved his wife's life.

392
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,917
If he'd gone to the police
and told them

393
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,486
That he'd been approached
by unearthly beings

394
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,121
From the galaxy of andromeda

395
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:23,757
We'd have sent a man
round to investigate.

396
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,426
As it was, he did a deal
with a blancmange

397
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,462
And the blancmange
ate his wife.

398
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:32,132
So if you're going out
or going on holiday

399
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:35,202
Or anything strange happens
involving other galaxies

400
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:37,804
Just nip round
to your local police station

401
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:40,340
And tell the sergeant on duty,
or his wife

402
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:41,975
Of your suspicions.

403
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,645
And the same goes for dogs.

404
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,713
So I'm sorry to have interrupted

405
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,916
Your exciting
science fiction story

406
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,451
But then, crime's
our business, you know

407
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:54,221
So carry on viewing,
and my thanks to the bbc

408
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,457
For allowing me to have
this little chat with you.

409
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:00,394
Good night, god bless,
look after yourselves.

410
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,864
Do sit down,
mr. podgorny.

411
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:06,200
I... I think
what's happened is

412
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,101
Terribly, terribly funny...

413
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:09,169
Tragic.

414
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:12,406
You must understand
that we have to catch

415
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,074
The creature
that ate your wife.

416
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:16,844
And if you could just help
us answer a few questions

417
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,946
We may be able to help
save a few lives.

418
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:20,113
I know this is the way

419
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,849
Your wife would
have wanted it.

420
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:23,750
Aye.

421
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,219
I'll do my best, sergeant.

422
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,554
Detective inspector.

423
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:29,022
Detective inspector.

424
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:30,490
Now then,
the facts are these:

425
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,559
You received an order
for 48 million kilts

426
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,595
From a blancmange
from the planet skyron

427
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:35,996
In the galaxy
of andromeda;

428
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,197
You'd just shown
your wife

429
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:39,800
An entry form for wimbledon
which you'd filled in

430
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,134
When you turned round

431
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:43,303
And saw her legs disappearing into
a blancmange.

432
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,371
Is that correct?

433
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:45,405
Yes, sir.

434
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:46,406
Are you mad?

435
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,407
No, sir.

436
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:48,842
Well, that's a relief.

437
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,043
Because if you were

438
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,212
Your story would be
less plausible.

439
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,348
Now then, do you
recognize this?

440
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,382
Oh, yes!

441
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:57,918
That's the one that ate my mary.

442
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:58,919
Good.

443
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,854
His name's riley...
jack riley.

444
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,956
He's that most rare
of criminals--

445
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:05,425
A blancmange impersonator
and cannibal.

446
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,361
What about the
48 million kilts

447
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,062
And the galaxy
of andromeda?

448
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:11,632
I'm afraid that's just
one of his stories.

449
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,000
You must understand

450
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:15,569
That a blancmange
impersonator and cannibal

451
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:17,538
Has to use some
pretty clever stories

452
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:18,539
To allay suspicion.

453
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:19,573
Then you mean...

454
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,741
Yes.
but...

455
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:21,441
Yes.
how?

456
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,309
Well...
not...

457
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,143
Why?
I'm afraid so.

458
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,111
Who knows?
do you think...

459
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:24,711
But...
could be.

460
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:25,445
I know. she was...

461
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,313
Yes.

462
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,016
Good lord, what's that?

463
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,619
Ah, riley!

464
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:35,155
Come to give yourself up,
have you, riley?

465
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:36,190
Eh, riley?

466
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:38,659
Riley? riley?

467
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,160
It's not riley.

468
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:43,197
It's an extraterrestrial being.

469
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,376
So everyone
in england

470
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:59,413
Is being turned
into scotsmen, right?

471
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:00,614
Yes.

472
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:03,483
Now, which is the worst
tennis-playing nation

473
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:04,484
In the world?

474
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:06,386
Um... australia.

475
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,154
No, try again.

476
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:08,288
Australia?

477
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:10,557
No, try again
but say a different place.

478
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,960
I thought you meant
I said it badly.

479
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:15,562
No, of course you didn't
say it badly-- now, hurry!

480
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:16,697
Um... czechoslovakia?

481
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:17,497
No, scotland!

482
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,532
Of course.

483
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,268
Now... now, these
blancmanges

484
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:25,439
Apart from the one that killed
mrs. podgorny

485
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:29,443
Have all appeared
in which london suburb?

486
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,477
Finchley.

487
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:31,678
No, wimbledon!

488
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,815
Now do you begin
to see the pattern?

489
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:39,219
With what sport is wimbledon
commonly associated?

490
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:40,587
<i>for viewers at home</i>

491
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:43,357
<i>the answer is coming up
on your screens.</i>

492
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:46,560
<i>those of you who wish
to play it the hard way</i>

493
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,028
<i>stand upside down</i>

494
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:51,031
<i>with your head in a bucket
of piranha fish.</i>

495
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:53,400
<i>here is the question
once again:</i>

496
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:57,538
With what sport is wimbledon
commonly associated?

497
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:00,674
Cricket.

498
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:01,508
No.

499
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,910
Pelote?

500
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:07,548
No, wimbledon is most commonly
associated with tennis.

501
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,316
Of course,
now I see.

502
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:11,785
Yes, it all falls
into place.

503
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:14,788
The blancmanges are
really australians

504
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:18,258
Trying to get the rights
of the pelote rules

505
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:20,394
From the czech publishers.

506
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,132
No, not quite,
but just look in here.

507
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:36,276
Yes... so these blancmanges...
blancmange-shaped creatures

508
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:40,214
Come from the planet skyron
in the galaxy of andromeda;

509
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,351
They order 48 million kilts
from a scottish menswear shop;

510
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:47,621
Turn the population
of england into scotsmen--

511
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:51,625
Well-known as the worst tennis-
playing nation on earth;

512
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:55,529
Thus leaving england empty
during wimbledon fortnight.

513
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:58,732
Empty during
wimbledon fortnight.

514
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,002
What's more, the papers are
full of reports of blancmanges

515
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:05,038
Appearing on tennis courts
up and down the country...

516
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:06,073
Practicing.

517
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:07,641
This can only mean one thing!

518
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:15,849
They mean to win wimbledon!

519
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,150
Well, here at wimbledon

520
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:19,453
It's been a most extraordinary
week's tennis.

521
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,321
The blancmanges
have swept the board

522
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:22,689
Winning match after match.

523
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,424
Here are just a few
of the results:

524
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:26,460
Billie jean king eaten
in straight sets;

525
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,029
Laver smothered whole
after winning the first set;

526
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:32,065
And pancho gonzales, serving
as well as I've ever seen him

527
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,433
With some superb volleys

528
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,669
And decisive return volleys
off the backhand

529
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:37,771
Was sucked through the net
at match point

530
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:40,140
And swallowed whole
in just under two minutes.

531
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:41,608
And so here on the final day

532
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,177
There seems to be
no players left

533
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,778
To challenge the blancmanges.

534
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,647
And this could be
their undoing, dan

535
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,583
As the rules of wimbledon
state quite clearly

536
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:50,817
That there must be

537
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:53,987
At least one human being
concerned in the final.

538
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,957
Well, the blancmange is
coming out onto the pitch now

539
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,492
And there's a human with it.

540
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,528
It's angus podgorny, the plucky
little scottish tailor

541
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,130
Upon whom everything depends.

542
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,232
And so it's podgorny
versus blancmange

543
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:07,734
In this first-ever
intergalactic wimbledon.

544
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:10,237
And it's blancmange to serve...

545
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,005
And it's a good one!

546
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,841
15 - love.

547
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:43,704
And podgorny fails
to even hit the ball.

548
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,205
But this is no surprise

549
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:48,675
As he hasn't hit the ball
once throughout this match.

550
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:51,645
So it's 72 match points
to the blancmange now.

551
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,780
Podgorny prepares
to serve again.

552
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:12,533
This is indeed a grim day
for the human race, dan.

553
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,800
But what's this?

554
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:16,336
Two spectators have rushed
onto the pitch

555
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:17,771
With spoons and forks.

556
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,406
What are they going to do?

557
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:23,644
They mean to eat
the blancmange.

558
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,690
And they're eating
the blancmange!

559
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,926
Yes, the blancmange is
leaving the court.

560
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,394
It's abandoning the game.

561
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:41,428
This is fantastic!

562
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,302
Mmm... mmm...

563
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:54,942
<i>yes, it was
mr. and mrs. samuel brainsample</i>

564
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,545
<i>who, after only a brief
and misleading appearance</i>

565
00:27:58,612 --> 00:28:02,649
<i>in the early part of the film,
return to sa ve the earth.</i>

566
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:03,750
<i>but why?</i>

567
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:05,786
Oh, well, you see,
we love blancmanges.

568
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:06,954
My wife makes them.

569
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,755
<i>she makes
blancmanges that size?</i>

570
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:11,158
Oh, yes, you see, we're from the
planet skyron

571
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:12,459
In the galaxy
of andromeda

572
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:14,127
And they're all
that size there.

573
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:15,262
We tried to tell you

574
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,797
At the beginning
of the film

575
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,165
But you just
panned off us.

576
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:24,338
<i>so the world was saved</i>

577
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:27,140
<i>and angus podgorny became
the first scotsman</i>

578
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:31,645
<i>to win wimbledon...
15 years later.</i>
