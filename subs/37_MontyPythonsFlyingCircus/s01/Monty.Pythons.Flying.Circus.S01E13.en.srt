1
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,348
It's...

2
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,185
There will now be
a short intermission.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,897
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

4
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,695
There will now be
a medium-sized intermission.

5
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,476
Not bad for a starter

6
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,447
But now perhaps something
a little more savory.

7
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,551
Ooh, I don't like this,
ooh, I don't like that.

8
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,986
Oh, I don't think
much to all this.

9
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:26,987
Oh, fancy using
that wallpaper.

10
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,222
Fancy using mustard.

11
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,157
Ooh, is that a proper one?
ooh, it's not real.

12
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,692
I don't think
it's a proper restaurant

13
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,160
Unless they give
you finger bowls.

14
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,261
Ooh, I don't like him.

15
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,996
I'm going to have
a baby in a few years.

16
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,532
Uh, please excuse
my wife.

17
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,300
She may appear
to be rather nasty

18
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,636
But underneath she has
a heart of formica.

19
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,839
Sorry about that.

20
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:48,141
That's all right, sir, we get
all sorts of lines in here.

21
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,577
The headwaiter will be along
to abuse you in a few moments

22
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,279
And now,
if you'll excuse me

23
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:53,680
I have to go
and commit suicide.

24
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,681
Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,716
It's all right.

26
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,284
It's not because
of anything serious.

27
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,318
Oh, good.

28
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,356
Quite frankly, I'm against
people who commit suicide.

29
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,258
I don't like
that sort of person at all.

30
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,893
I'm plain people
and I'm proud of it.

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,427
My mother's the salt
of the earth

32
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,496
And I don't take
the pill 'cause
it's nasty.

33
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,597
Please excuse my wife

34
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,132
She may not be
very beautiful

35
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,433
And she may
have no money

36
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,169
And she may be
a little talentless

37
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,371
Boring and dull,
but on the other hand...

38
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,515
Sorry, I can't
think of anything.

39
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,984
Fine... I'm the headwaiter.

40
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,953
This is a vegetarian
restaurant only.

41
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,922
We serve no animal
flesh of any kind.

42
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,423
We're not only
proud of that

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,457
We're smug about it.

44
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,892
So, if you were to come in here

45
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,994
Asking me to rip open
a small, defenseless chicken

46
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,197
So you could chew its skin
and eat its intestines

47
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,165
I'm afraid I would
have to ask you to leave.

48
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,933
No, no, no, no.

49
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,367
Likewise if you were to ask me

50
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,702
To slice the sides off a cow

51
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,737
And serve it
with small pieces of its liver

52
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,272
Or, indeed, drain
the lifeblood from a pig

53
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,507
Before cutting off
one of its legs

54
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,475
Or carve the
living giblets

55
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,810
From a sheep
and serve them

56
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,212
With the fresh
brains, bowels

57
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,813
Guts and spleen
of a small rabbit

58
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,381
We wouldn't do it!

59
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,184
Not for food, anyway.

60
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,986
Quite frankly,
I'm against people

61
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,888
Who give vent
to their loquacity

62
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,157
By extraneous
bombastic
circumlocution.

63
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,260
Oh, I don't
like that.

64
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,263
Sometimes, shirley,
I think you're almost human.

65
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,499
Do you know I still wet my bed.

66
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,837
Once, I married someone
who was beautiful

67
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,739
And young
and gay and free.

68
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,541
Whatever happened to her?

69
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,877
You divorced her
and married me.

70
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,246
I met my second wife

71
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,981
At a second-wife-
swapping party.

72
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,382
Trust me to arrive late.

73
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,384
Always were late,
weren't you, thompson?

74
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,385
Hello, headmaster.

75
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,686
What are you doing here?

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,988
Fine, fine, fine,
thank you.

77
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,989
Fine, thank you.

78
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,957
No more sherry for me,
don't you know.

79
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,425
Warner house beat
badger house

80
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,994
For the second
cuppa, remarkable.

81
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,329
We had to put most
of the second form
to sleep.

82
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,497
No padre-- bad business.

83
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,699
They were beginning
to play with themselves.

84
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,769
Still... you haven't
seen my wife anywhere,
have you?

85
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,004
No.
oh, thank

86
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,272
Oh, I don't
like him.

87
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,840
Do you know what I mean?
do you know what I mean?

88
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,108
I mean, do you know what I mean?

89
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,643
Do you know what I mean?
do you know what I mean?

90
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,677
I mean, do you
know what I mean?

91
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,845
All men are
the same.

92
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,548
Imagine not
that these four walls

93
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,250
Contain the mighty owl
of thebes

94
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,754
For, gentles all,
beauty sits most closely

95
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,722
To them it can construe.

96
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,857
No, it
doesn't.

97
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,058
Sorry.

98
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,564
Fine... would you care
for a glass of blood?

99
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,665
Oh, what a giveaway.

100
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,200
No, we'd like to see
the menu please.

101
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,701
I don't think
it's a proper restaurant

102
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:28,869
Unless you have
a proper menu

103
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,204
And anyway, i
might be pregnant.

104
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,005
Perhaps you'd care
for a drink?

105
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,141
Ever since you've
married me, douglas

106
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,175
You've treated me

107
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,310
Like an
albatross.

108
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,344
Evening.

109
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,345
Good evening.

110
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,379
I hope you're going

111
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,881
To en joy me this evening.

112
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:41,882
I'm the special.

113
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,150
Try me with some rice.

114
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,351
I beg your
pardon?

115
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,119
A hopkins au gratin
a la chef.

116
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,154
Ah, how do you?

117
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,655
Don't play
with your food.

118
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,756
I don't like that.

119
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,158
There's dust on here.

120
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,160
I don't think
it's a proper meal

121
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,294
Without pudding.

122
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,929
My husband's
an architect.

123
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,965
Oh, one word of warning,
sir, a little tip.

124
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,766
Don't have any
of the vicar over there.

125
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,901
He's been here two weeks

126
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,903
And nobody's touched him--
enough said?

127
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,904
Yes, thank you.

128
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,240
Well, I must get on
or I'll spoil.

129
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,774
Janet, to the kitchen.

130
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,516
There's a dead bishop
in the lobby, sir.

131
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,885
I don't know who keeps
bringing them in here.

132
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:18,919
Oh, I don't
like that.

133
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:19,953
I think it's silly.

134
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:20,954
It's not
a proper sketch

135
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:21,955
Without a proper
punch line.

136
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,991
I mean, I don't know much
about anything, I'm stupid.

137
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,459
I'm muggins,
nobody cares what I think.

138
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm always
the one that has
to do everything.

139
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:27,928
Nobody cares about me.

140
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:28,896
I'll have
bloody babies

141
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,330
And they can bloody
well care about me.

142
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,832
It makes you sick,
half this television.

143
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:32,766
They never
stop talking.

144
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,934
He'll be
the ruination
of her.

145
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,335
Rhythm method!

146
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,673
There will now be
a whopping great intermission

147
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,910
During which small ice creams in
very large boxes will be sold.

148
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,612
Another way we can drive
people away from the cinema

149
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,381
Is by showing you
advertisements.

150
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,061
Do you like this?

151
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,463
Or how about this?

152
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,400
Or perhaps you prefer
this latest model?

153
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,535
Then why not come to us?

154
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:12,406
We supply
only the very best models.

155
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,943
After the show, why not visit
the la gondola restaurant--

156
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,445
Just two minutes
from this performance.

157
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,448
The manager, mr. luigi vercotti,
will be pleased

158
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,517
To welcome you and introduce you

159
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,553
To a wide variety
of famous sicilian delicacies.

160
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,057
Here you can relax in comfort
in friendly surroundings.

161
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,527
Or if you wish, you may drink
and dance till midnight.

162
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,395
At the la gondola restaurant

163
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:39,333
You can sample all the spicy
pleasures of the mediterranean.

164
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:43,337
The headwaiter will be pleased
to show you his specialities.

165
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,507
Or why not ask the cook
for something really hot?

166
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,142
Yes, for an evening
you'll never forget

167
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,278
It's the la gondola restaurant

168
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:57,784
Chelsea, parkhurst, dartmoor
and the scrubs.

169
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,029
Albatross!

170
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,799
Albatross!

171
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,103
Albatross?

172
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,671
Two choc ices,
please.

173
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,506
I haven't got
choc ices.

174
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,408
I've only got
the albatross.

175
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,743
Albatross!

176
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,111
What flavor is it?

177
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,746
It's a bird, isn't it?

178
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,481
It's a bloody seabird.

179
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,483
It's not
any bloody flavor.

180
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,484
Albatross!

181
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,352
Do you get
wafers with it?

182
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,888
Of course you don't

183
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,957
Get bloody wafers
with it!

184
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,225
Albatross!

185
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,127
How much is it?

186
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,528
Nine pence.

187
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:44,131
I'll have two please.

188
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,499
Gannet on a stick.

189
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,468
There will now be
a very short...

190
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,935
Well, that's
quite enough of that.

191
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,972
And now a policeman
near rottingdeans.

192
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:25,939
Albatross!

193
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,307
Inspector,
inspector.

194
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,308
Mm-hmm.

195
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,476
I'm terribly sorry

196
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,678
But I was sitting
on a park bench
over there

197
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,146
Took my coat off
for a minute

198
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,182
And then I found my
wallet had been stolen

199
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,350
And £15 taken from it.

200
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,384
Well, did you, uh

201
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,685
Did you see
anyone take it

202
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,087
Anyone hanging
around or...

203
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,989
No, no, there was
no one there at all.

204
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:42,990
That's the trouble.

205
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,458
Well, there's
not very much

206
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,792
We can do
about that, sir.

207
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,795
Oh.

208
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,066
Do you want to come
back to my place?

209
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,137
Yeah, all right.

210
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,078
Albatross.

211
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,514
Mr. burtenshaw?

212
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,549
Me, doctor?

213
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,151
No, me doctor,
you mr. burtenshaw.

214
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,519
My wife, doctor?

215
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,288
No, your wife
patient--

216
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,455
Me doctor.

217
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,057
Come this way, please.

218
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,091
Me, sister?

219
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,093
No, she sister,
me doctor

220
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,595
You mr. burtenshaw.

221
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,330
Dr. walters?

222
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,364
Me nurse.

223
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,532
You mr. burtenshaw.

224
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,967
She sister,
you doctor.

225
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,968
No, doctor.

226
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,804
No doctor,
call ambulance,
keep warm.

227
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:31,805
Drink, doctor?

228
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,240
Drink doctor,
eat sister

229
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,908
Cook mr. burtenshaw,

230
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,943
You, doctor?

231
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:36,944
Me doctor.

232
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:37,945
You mr. burtenshaw.

233
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:38,979
She nurse.

234
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:39,980
But my wife,
nurse.

235
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,981
Your wife not nurse.

236
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,516
She nurse,
your wife patient.

237
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,084
Be patient, she
nurse your wife.

238
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,119
Me doctor,
yew tree.

239
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,955
Utrecht, utrillo

240
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,090
U thant, euphemism.

241
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,725
Me doctor.

242
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,665
Albatross!

243
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:05,439
I'd like to meet someone

244
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,976
Of superior intelligence.

245
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,513
I'd like to hear the sound

246
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:16,683
Of two bricks
being bashed together.

247
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,020
I'd like to see

248
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:25,659
John the baptist's impersonation
of graham hill.

249
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:28,328
Yes, it's
<i>historical impersonations</i>

250
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,264
When you in the present can make

251
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,432
Those in the past
stars of the future.

252
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,837
And here is your host
for tonight, wally wiggin.

253
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,975
Hello, good evening, and welcome
to <i>historical impersonations.</i>

254
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,811
And we kick off tonight
with cardinal richelieu

255
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,181
And his impersonation
of petula clark.

256
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:51,618
Oh, don't sleep
in the subway, darling

257
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,755
Don't stand
in the pouring rain...

258
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,993
Cardinal richelieu--
sixteen stone of pure man.

259
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,630
And now your favorite
roman emperor, julius caesar

260
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,132
As eddie waring.

261
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,503
<i>tota gallia divisa est</i>
<i>in tres partes</i>

262
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:14,074
Wigan, hunslett
and hull kingston rovers.

263
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,443
Well done indeed,
julius caesar--

264
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,813
A smile, a conquest
and a dagger up your strap.

265
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,717
Our next challenger comes
all the way from the crimea.

266
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,921
It's the very lovely florence
nightingale as brian london.

267
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:34,862
And now for our most
ambitious attempt tonight.

268
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,866
All the way from moscow in the
u.s.s. of r., ivan the terrible

269
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,135
As a sales assistant
in freeman, hardy and willis.

270
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,443
And now w.g. grace
as a music box.

271
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,881
And now it's france's turn.

272
00:11:53,914 --> 00:12:00,254
One of their top statesmen,
napoleon, as the r-101 disaster.

273
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,470
And now it's request time.

274
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:20,073
I would like to see

275
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,445
John the baptist's impersonation
of graham hill.

276
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,687
And now a short intermission

277
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,690
During which marcel marceau
will impersonate

278
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,892
A man walking against the wind.

279
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:50,003
And now marcel will mime a man

280
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,974
Being struck about the head
by a 16-ton weight.

281
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,151
What's your name?

282
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,821
Eric.

283
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,159
Would you like to have
a 16-ton weight

284
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,961
Dropped on top
of you, eric?

285
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,033
Don't know.

286
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,004
How about you?

287
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,942
I want
to have...

288
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,878
What do you
want to have?

289
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,748
I want
to have...

290
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,283
What?

291
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,253
I want to have
racquel welch...

292
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,321
Dropped on
top of me.

293
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,524
Dropped on
top of you?

294
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,026
Oh, yes, not
climbing.

295
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,929
She's got
a big bottom.

296
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,034
And what's your name?

297
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,202
Trevor atkinson.

298
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,237
And how old
are you, trevor?

299
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,739
I'm 42.

300
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,142
Are you a friend
of trevor's?

301
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,410
Yes, we're
all colleagues

302
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:05,646
From the empire and
general insurance
company.

303
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:06,780
And what
do you do?

304
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,881
Well, I deal
mainly

305
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,917
With mortgage-
protection policies

306
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,686
But I also do certain
types of life assurance.

307
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:15,756
Now, if you and
your pal had one
<i>big</i> wish, trevor

308
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,292
What would you like
to see on television?

309
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:23,964
I'd like to see more fairy
stories about the police.

310
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,667
And so
you shall.

311
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,817
Yes, we in the special crimes
squad have been using wands

312
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,186
For almost a year now.

313
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,555
You find it's easy to make
yourself invisible.

314
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,989
You can defy time and space

315
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,325
And you can turn violent
criminals into frogs

316
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,395
Something which you could never
do with the old truncheons.

317
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,776
Yes, tonight <i>probearound</i>
takes a look at crime.

318
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,081
I'm sorry about that

319
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,750
But <i>i</i> always introduce
this program, not him.

320
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,325
Yes, tonight <i>probearound</i>
takes a look at crime.

321
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:34,294
Is it true that the police
are using dachshunds

322
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,896
To combat the crime wave?

323
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:39,800
Can the head of the vice squad
turn himself into an albatross

324
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,168
Whenever he wants to?

325
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,170
Just what are the police up to?

326
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,705
Oh, I'm up to page 39

327
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,708
Where peter pan first
manifests himself.

328
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:51,645
With me now is inspector
harry h. "snapper" organs

329
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,913
Of "h" division.

330
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,314
Good evening.

331
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,817
Inspector, I believe
you are encouraging magic

332
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:57,985
In the police force.

333
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,219
That is correct.

334
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,354
The criminal mind's

335
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,589
A strange, contorted
one-- good evening.

336
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,892
The mind is subject to
severe mental stresses--

337
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:05,893
Good evening.

338
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,828
Guilt fears abound--
good evening--

339
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:08,929
In the subconscious.

340
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,564
In this state,
one of our lads

341
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,666
With a fair training
in the black arts

342
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,768
Can scare the
fertilizer out of them.

343
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:17,471
Just how are the police
combating the increase

344
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,072
With the use of the occult?

345
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,974
Ex-king zog of albania reports.

346
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,811
Well, we seem to have
lost ex-king zog there

347
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:26,180
But who cares?

348
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,782
Just what kinds of magic
are the police introducing

349
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,851
Into their crime-prevention
techniques?

350
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,927
U-p...

351
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,596
Y...

352
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:45,332
O...

353
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,968
U...

354
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,771
R...

355
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:52,172
S.

356
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,507
"up yours"!?

357
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,210
What a rude
ouija board!

358
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:28,575
Now, this is the kind of thing

359
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,744
That gives the police
a bad name, sergeant.

360
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:31,778
I know, sir.

361
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,082
Yes, beryl?

362
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,184
Attila the hun to see you, sir.

363
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,218
Who?

364
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,887
Attila the hun, sir.

365
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:40,954
Oh, botherkins!

366
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,990
Constable, go and see
to him, will you?

367
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,157
What? in <i>this</i> dress?

368
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,459
Oh, all right,
I'll go.

369
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:48,061
Oh, I've got a
little green pinny
I could wear.

370
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,196
No, no,
no, I'll go.

371
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:50,464
You stay here.

372
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,699
Oh, goody! I can get
on with the ironing.

373
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,234
Right... where is he?

374
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:56,103
Over there, sir.

375
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,206
All right, sergeant,
leave this to me.

376
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:02,309
Now, then, sir, you
are attila the hun.

377
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,911
That's right, yes, a.t. hun.

378
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,113
My parents were
mr. and mrs. norman hun

379
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,615
But they had a little
joke when I was born.

380
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,518
Yes... well,
mr. hun...

381
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:14,621
Oh, call me "the,"
for heaven's sake!

382
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:18,959
Oh... well, the,
what do you want
to see us about?

383
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,328
I've come to
give myself up.

384
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,663
What for?

385
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,532
Looting, pillaging
and sacking a major city.

386
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,767
I beg your
pardon?

387
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,403
Looting, pillaging,
sacking a major city

388
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,572
And I'd like 9,000 other charges

389
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,174
To be taken into
consideration, please.

390
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:37,878
I say, excuse
me, mr. hun.

391
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:41,815
Have you any objection
to taking a breath test?

392
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,183
Oh, no, no, no, no.

393
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,819
Right-- sergeant, will you
bring the analyzer, please?

394
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:46,854
Here we
are, sir.

395
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:47,888
How's it work?

396
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:49,523
Well, if
he breathes
into it, sir

397
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,625
And the white
crystals turn
lime green

398
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,327
Then he is
attila the
hun, sir.

399
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,529
I see-- well, would
you mind breathing

400
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:56,563
Into this,
mr. hun?

401
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:57,998
Right.

402
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,005
What if nothing
happens, sergeant?

403
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:07,708
He's alexander
the great, sir!

404
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,644
Aha! caught you,
mr. a.t. great!

405
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,012
Oh, curses, curses!

406
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,581
I thought I was safe,
disguised as attila the hun.

407
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,384
O-ho, perhaps so, but you
made one fatal mistake.

408
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:19,353
You see, this wasn't
a hunalyzer.

409
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,488
It was an alexander-
the-greatalyzer.

410
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,458
Take him away, beryl!

411
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:27,961
"dear sir, I object very
strongly to that last scene

412
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:29,796
And to the next letter."

413
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:33,133
"dear sir, I object
to being objected to

414
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,234
"by the last letter

415
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,370
"before my drift has
become apparent.

416
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,139
"I spent many years in india
during the last war

417
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:41,175
"and am now a part-time
notice board

418
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,943
"in a prominent public school.

419
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,546
"yours etc.,
brigadier zoe la rue (deceased).

420
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,114
P.s. aghhh!"

421
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:50,150
"dear sir, when I was at school

422
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,586
"I was beaten regularly
every 30 minutes

423
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,488
"and it never did me any harm--

424
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,823
"except for psychological
maladjustment

425
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,325
"and blurred vision.

426
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:01,695
Yours truly, flight lieutenant
ken frankenstein (mrs.)."

427
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:13,507
Huh?

428
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:36,864
I want to see the doctor.

429
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:47,007
Dr. larch, there's
a mr. phelps to see you.

430
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,041
Uh, nurse?

431
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,776
Yes?

432
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,012
You don't think you
should make it clear

433
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,580
That I'm a psychiatrist?

434
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:55,983
What?

435
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,752
Well, I could be
any type of doctor.

436
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,689
Well, I can't come in and
say "psychiatrist larch"

437
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:05,659
Or "dr. larch, who
is a psychiatrist."

438
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:08,896
Oh, anyway, look, it's
written on the door.

439
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:10,497
That's outside.

440
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:12,599
Well, I don't care.

441
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,436
You'll just have
to do it yourself.

442
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:26,013
Hello?

443
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,015
No, wrong number, I'm afraid.

444
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:30,350
This is a psychiatrist speaking.

445
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,385
Next, please.

446
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,387
Come in.

447
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:37,691
Bow wow wow.

448
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,760
Ah, mr. phelps--
come on in,
take a seat.

449
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,428
Now, what seems
to be the matter?

450
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:42,462
No, no, no, no, no.

451
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:43,463
I'm sorry?

452
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,199
Oh, can't you do
better than that?

453
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:46,600
I mean, it's
so predictable.

454
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,035
I've seen it
a million times.

455
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,570
Knock, knock, knock;
"come in;

456
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:51,038
Ah, mr. phelps,
take a seat."

457
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:52,339
I've seen it
and seen it.

458
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:54,241
Well, look, will you
please sit down

459
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:55,409
And do your
first line?

460
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,610
No, no, I've
had enough.

461
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:57,678
I've had enough.

462
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,882
I can't even get it started.

463
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,884
Albatross!

464
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,953
Shut up!

465
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:08,555
Oh, it drives me mad.

466
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:11,291
A mad psychiatrist,
that'd be new-- huh!

467
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:12,326
Next, please.

468
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:14,761
C... oh.

469
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:23,203
Cross the threshold,
arrive, ingress

470
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:25,572
Gain admittance, infiltrate.

471
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,109
Ah, mr. notlob,
uh, park your hips

472
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:30,577
On the sitting device.

473
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:31,912
It <i>is</i> a mad
psychiatrist.

474
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:32,913
I'm not, I'm not!

475
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:34,114
Come on in,
take a seat.

476
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:35,616
What's... what's
the matter?

477
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:38,218
Now, what's the matter?

478
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:39,353
Well, I keep
hearing

479
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,221
Guitars playing
and people singing

480
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,723
When there's no one around.

481
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,725
Yes, well,
this is not at
all uncommon.

482
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,460
In certain mental
states we find

483
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:48,595
That auditory
hallucinations occur

484
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:50,030
Which are
of a most...

485
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,498
We can stay all day

486
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:53,267
We're going to the zoo...

487
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,003
Is that "we're
all going to the
zoo tomorrow"?

488
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:57,037
Yes, yes.

489
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:58,038
Is it always that?

490
00:23:58,138 --> 00:23:59,039
No.

491
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:00,240
Well, that's
something.

492
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:02,376
But it's mainly folk songs.

493
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,479
Last night I had
"we'll never fall in love
again"-- for six hours!

494
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,515
Well, look, I think I'd better
have a second opinion on this.

495
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:10,350
I want you to see
a colleague of mine

496
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,186
A specialist in these
sort of things

497
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:14,254
Who has an office very
much like this one

498
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:15,322
As a matter
of fact.

499
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,356
Ooh...

500
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,535
Um, no, no, wrong number.

501
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:30,237
I'm a colleague of his--

502
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:33,740
A surgeon who specializes
in these kind of things.

503
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,542
Yes, thank you very much.

504
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,577
Next, please.

505
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:38,545
Come in.

506
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:42,249
Ah, come in,
please take a seat.

507
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:45,986
My colleague, who has
a similar office

508
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,554
Has explained
your case to me.

509
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,959
Mr. notlob, as you know

510
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,995
I am a leading
harley street surgeon...

511
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,333
As seen on television.

512
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:01,935
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to operate.

513
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,404
It's nothing
to worry about--

514
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:07,274
Although it is
extremely dangerous.

515
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:10,244
I shall be juggling
with your life.

516
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,112
I shall be playing
ducks and drakes

517
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:13,647
With your very existence.

518
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:16,650
I shall be running me mitts
over the pith of your marrow--

519
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,952
Yes, these hands

520
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,088
These fingers

521
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:25,893
These sophisticated organs of
touch, these bunches of five

522
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:28,529
These maulers,
these german bands

523
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:32,132
That have pulled many
a moribund unfortunate

524
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:35,602
Back from the very
brink of lazarus's box.

525
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:38,539
No, it was pandora's box,
wasn't it?

526
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:41,008
Well, anyway, these mitts
have earned yours truly

527
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:44,011
A lot of bread, so if you'll
just step through here

528
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,579
I'll slit you
up a treat.

529
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:46,747
What?

530
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:49,616
Mr. notlob, there's
nothing wrong with you

531
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,519
That an expensive
operation can't prolong.

532
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,862
Right, I'm ready
to make the incision.

533
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,597
Knife, please, sister.

534
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:05,065
What's that supposed to be?

535
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:06,066
Give me a big one.

536
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,674
Oh, I do en joy this!

537
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,044
Right.

538
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,685
Oh, what a great slit!

539
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:30,424
Now, gentlemen, I am
going to open the slit.

540
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:31,859
...all day

541
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:34,895
Too much, man!

542
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,230
Groovy,
great scene.

543
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:37,764
Great light
show, baby.

544
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:39,733
What are you
doing in there?

545
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,802
We're doing our
own thing, man.

546
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:44,304
Have you got mr.
notlob's permission

547
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:45,305
To be in there?

548
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:46,773
We're squatters,
baby.

549
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:48,108
Nurse, wake
him up.

550
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,010
Don't get
uptight, man.

551
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,112
Join the scene
and other phrases.

552
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,213
Money isn't real.

553
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,515
It is where
I'm standing

554
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:56,316
And it blows my
mind, young lad.

555
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:58,118
Good lord! is that
a nude woman?

556
00:26:58,185 --> 00:26:59,686
She's doing an
article on us

557
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:00,721
For <i>nova,</i> man.

558
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:01,722
Hi, everyone.

559
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,724
Are you part
of the scene?

560
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:07,394
Are you rolling your
own jelly babies in there?

561
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,930
What's going on?
who are they?

562
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:11,098
That's what we're
trying to find out.

563
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:12,533
What are they doing
in my stomach?

564
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:14,668
We don't know--
are they paying you any rent?

565
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:16,136
Course they're not
paying me rent!

566
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,971
You're not
furnished,
you fascist.

567
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:18,972
Get them out!

568
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:19,973
I can't.

569
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:20,974
Get them out!

570
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:21,975
No, I can't--

571
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,977
Not, not without
a court order.

572
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:25,913
Shut up, you're
keeping us awake.

573
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,416
You are hereby
ordered

574
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:33,387
To vacate mr. notlob
forthwith and/or.

575
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,922
Push off,
fuzz!

576
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,957
Right-- that's it,
we're going in!

577
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,559
Release the
vicious dogs.

578
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,863
What a terrible way
to end a series.

579
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:46,233
Why couldn't it end with
something like this?

580
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,501
Smile.

581
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,604
Smile.

582
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,106
Smile.

583
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:55,976
Smile.

584
00:27:57,811 --> 00:27:58,912
Smile.

585
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,121
Smile.

586
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:11,458
Now, there's an ending for
you-- romance, laughter...

587
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:58,172
When this series returns

588
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,208
It will be put out on
monday morning as a test card

589
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:03,610
And will be described
by the <i>radio times</i>

590
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:05,646
As a history
of irish agriculture.
