1
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,686
Yes, this looks
the sort of thing.

2
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,921
May I just try it?

3
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,389
Certainly, madam.

4
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,890
Oh, sorry, so sorry!

5
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,158
Yes, that's fine.

6
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,960
Is that on account,
madam?

7
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,329
Yes.

8
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,435
Hello?

9
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,971
Hello?

10
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,216
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

11
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,218
I thought you were
someone else.

12
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,519
Oh, I see, yes.

13
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,587
I'm sorry, sir.

14
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,855
Can I help you?

15
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,591
Yes, yes, as a matter of fact,
you can, actually.

16
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:14,328
I was interested in
the possibility of pur...

17
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,230
Can I ask you
who you thought I was?

18
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:16,997
What?

19
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,298
Who did you think I was

20
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,200
Just then, when you thought
I was somebody?

21
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,702
Oh, it's no one you'd know, sir.

22
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,403
Well, I might know them.

23
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,538
It's possible, obviously

24
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,039
But I think it's
really unlikely.

25
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,675
I mean, he's hardly likely to
move in your circles, sir.

26
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,310
Why, is he very rich?

27
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,012
Oh, no, I didn't mean that, sir.

28
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,547
Is he a lord or something?

29
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,181
Not at all.

30
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,916
What is his name?

31
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:36,550
What?

32
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,818
What is his name?

33
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,253
Well, uh...

34
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,188
Yes?

35
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,189
Michael ellis.

36
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,224
Who?

37
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,325
Michael ellis.

38
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,294
I see.

39
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,529
Do you know him, sir?

40
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,632
Uh, michael ellis.

41
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,666
Michael ellis.

42
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,667
You don't?

43
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,968
Well, I don't
remember the name.

44
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,470
I think you would
remember him, sir.

45
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,404
Why do you say that?

46
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,772
Well, would you remember

47
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,574
A man six foot nine inches high

48
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,143
40-ish, and he's got
a scar from here to here

49
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:06,480
And absolutely no nose?

50
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,982
Oh, I think I do remember
somebody like that.

51
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,685
Well, that's not michael ellis.

52
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,920
Right...

53
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,421
He's a small man
about this high

54
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,722
With a high-
pitched voice.

55
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,125
Right, I'm not going to
buy an ant from you now.

56
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,159
Oh, no, please.

57
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,460
You've not been
properly trained.

58
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:21,528
Come on, please.

59
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,629
I want another assistant.

60
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,298
All right, I'll get
another assistant.

61
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:24,998
Thank you.

62
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:25,999
Hello, sir.

63
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,534
Can I help you?

64
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,036
No, I want
a different assistant.

65
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,838
I am, sir-- I'm
mr. abanazar, sir.

66
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:31,939
Don't be silly.

67
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,640
Oh, no, please, please
let me help you.

68
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,875
No! I want
another assistant.

69
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:35,976
Oh, no, come on, please.

70
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:36,977
If you don't...

71
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,478
I'll be very good,
sir, really.

72
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,479
Good morning, sir.

73
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,614
How are you, sir?

74
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,449
Bit parky outside
today, isn't it, sir?

75
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,551
A very nice suit
you've got there, sir.

76
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,586
Right, I'm going.

77
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,587
No, no, please.

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,021
I'll get you
another assistant.

79
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,858
All right.

80
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,262
It's not him.

81
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,363
I don't want him.

82
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,898
Oh, please,
give him a chance.

83
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,999
No!

84
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,701
Yes, sir, can I be
of any assistance?

85
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,135
Oh, come on, don't try that.

86
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,270
Try what, sir?

87
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,271
You know

88
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,739
Perfectly well.

89
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,075
You were down behind there
with a silly mask on

90
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,209
Going

91
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,210
I don't think
I was, sir.

92
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,478
Get the manager.

93
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,947
There seems to have been
a misunderstanding, sir.

94
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,948
Manager!

95
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,216
This is the manager, sir.

96
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,217
What?

97
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,552
Yes, I'm
the manager.

98
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,820
Smashing store, this.

99
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,255
I can't recommend it too highly.

100
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,090
Well lit, rat-free,
it's a joy to manage.

101
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,493
Oh, yes, freshest haddock
in london, second floor

102
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,928
Third floor ribena, ants here

103
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,696
Behind there our
dinner wagon exhibition.

104
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,697
Manager!

105
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,065
Quick!

106
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,667
Yes, sir, can I help you, sir?

107
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,503
Yes, I want to complain about
the assistants on this counter.

108
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,804
I'm sorry, sir--
which ones?

109
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,406
Well, they're hiding now.

110
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,674
Sir?

111
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,809
They're hiding, down there
behind the counter.

112
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,712
I see, sir.

113
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,448
Well, there's nobody
down here, sir.

114
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,117
They must have crawled
through here

115
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,152
And made their escape
through "soft toys."

116
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,453
Yes, of course.

117
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,789
They were wearing masks
and making silly noises

118
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,958
And one of them pretended
to be the manager.

119
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:58,959
He spoke like this:

120
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,395
Oh, yes, I'm the manager.

121
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,996
Smashing store
to manage, this.

122
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,231
I think
I've got it, sir.

123
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,099
I think I've got it--
it's rag week.

124
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,534
Rag week?

125
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,036
Yes, you know,
for charity, sir.

126
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,305
Oh, I see, some local
college or university?

127
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,907
No, no, it's
the store's rag week.

128
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,075
The store's rag week?

129
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,077
Yes, the senior staff
don't join in much.

130
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,679
It's for the trainees,
really.

131
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,414
Not very good
for business, is it?

132
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,715
Oh, it's
for charity, sir.

133
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,951
People are awfully good
about it, you know.

134
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,152
Oh, I see.

135
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,287
Right, sir, I'll get
you a senior assistant.

136
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,388
Ants, was it?

137
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:29,756
Yes, please.

138
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,025
Mr. snetterton?

139
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,060
I don't want him!

140
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,595
Oh, please,
give me a chance.

141
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,629
No!

142
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,231
All right, mr. hartford.

143
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,800
Yes, good morning, sir,
can I help you?

144
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,069
Yes, please, I'm interested
in buying an ant.

145
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,905
Ah, yes, and what price were
you thinking of paying, sir?

146
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,407
Oh, well, I hadn't
actually got as far as that.

147
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,610
Well, sir, they start
about half a p

148
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,712
But they can go as high
as three p

149
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,514
Or even 31/2p for a champion.

150
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,915
Inflation, I'm afraid.

151
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,551
Well, I should think one
about 11/2p, please.

152
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,119
Ah, yes, well, you should get

153
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,588
A very serviceable little animal
for that, sir.

154
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,190
Quite frankly,
the half-p ones

155
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,658
Are a bit
on the mangy side.

156
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,127
What length was sir
thinking of?

157
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,162
Oh, medium?

158
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:12,266
Medium, medium,
medium, medium...

159
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,435
Yes, here we are.

160
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,805
Now, that one there
is an ayrshire

161
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:24,011
And that one there is a
king george bitch, I think.

162
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,281
And that one killing the little
flitbat is an afghan.

163
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,448
That's a nice one.

164
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:32,753
Let's see how you
get on with him, eh?

165
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,087
Ah, yes, he likes you.

166
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,189
He's taken to you.

167
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,523
What do you feed them on?

168
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,591
Uh, blancmange.

169
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,492
Blancmange?

170
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,493
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,794
I don't know why I said that.

172
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,196
No, you don't feed them at all.

173
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,198
Well, what do they live on?

174
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,332
They don't-- they die.

175
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,466
They die?

176
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,001
Well, of course
they do

177
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,369
If you don't feed them.

178
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,205
I don't understand.

179
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,806
You let them die, then you buy
another one.

180
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,141
It's much cheaper
than feeding them

181
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,709
And that way, you have
a constant variety

182
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:56,810
Of little companions.

183
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,145
That's the advantage
of owning an ant.

184
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,379
Right, well,
I'll take this one.

185
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:00,447
Oh, dear,
I've dropped it.

186
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,349
Never mind, here's
another one.

187
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,418
Is there anything
else I'll need?

188
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,620
Yes, sir, you'll need
an ant house.

189
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:11,525
This is the model
we recommend, sir.

190
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,493
Won't it get out
of there?

191
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,329
Yes.

192
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:19,566
What's the point
of having the cage?

193
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,101
Well, none
at all, really.

194
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,670
And then some little
pieces of cage furniture

195
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,506
Which will keep
him entertained.

196
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,741
There's an ant wheel,
and a little ant swing

197
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,210
And here's a very nice one
here, a little ladder.

198
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,145
He can run up there
and ring the bell.

199
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,580
That's a trick
he can learn.

200
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,082
Will he live
long enough?

201
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,084
Not really, no, but
it's best to have one.

202
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,687
And here's a two-way radio
he can play with

203
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,824
And then of course,
you'll need the book.

204
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,192
The book?

205
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,228
Yes, yes,
the book on ants.

206
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,696
I see.

207
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,868
So, sir, that is, if I may
say so, funt184 11/2p, sir.

208
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,904
Will you take a check?

209
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,373
Yes, sir, if you don't mind leaving
a blood sample

210
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,442
And a piece of skin off the back
of the scalp just here, sir.

211
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,278
Sorry, just for
identification.

212
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,979
Can't be
too careful.

213
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,582
Well, I think I'll put it
on account.

214
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,683
I should, sir.

215
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,851
Much less painful.

216
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,186
There we are.

217
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,555
Anyway, sir, you know what they
say about an ant--

218
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:15,689
A friend for life, eh?

219
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,724
Well, a friend for
its life, anyway.

220
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,527
Now, then, here we are.

221
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,596
His name is marcus.

222
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,565
Right, if the little
chap should go

223
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,733
To an early grave,
sir, give us a ring

224
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,469
And we'll stick a few in
an envelope, all right?

225
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,771
Thanks very much indeed.

226
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,472
Not at all,
thank you, mr. ellis.

227
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,473
What did you say?

228
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:34,808
"thank you, mr. ellis."

229
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:35,809
It's not him.

230
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:36,844
Why did you say "mr. ellis"?

231
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:37,845
Who?

232
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:38,979
No, he didn't
say that.

233
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,248
I heard him say,
"thank you, mr. ellis."

234
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,282
Ah, no, no.

235
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,084
He said,
"I'm jealous."

236
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,118
What?

237
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,620
I'm jealous
of your ant.

238
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,388
Good-bye.

239
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,556
Bye-bye!

240
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,258
I don't care
who michael ellis is.

241
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,260
Papism will be
stamped out

242
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,663
With the iron boot of punishment
and enlightenment.

243
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,966
Excuse me, I was
in the ant counter and...

244
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,467
Papism will be
stamped out

245
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:03,370
With the iron boot of punishment
and enlightenment.

246
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,005
...the lord
himself who said

247
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:09,209
Stamp out
the papist swine.

248
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:27,094
Will mr. michael ellis please go

249
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,862
straight to
the manager's office.

250
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:32,299
I'll repeat that--
will mr. nigel mellish

251
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:37,771
please go straight
to the manager's office.

252
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:41,808
What you got now?

253
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,945
I bought an ant, mother.

254
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,613
What do you want
one of them for?

255
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,215
I'm not going
to clean it out.

256
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,617
You said you'd clean the tiger
out, but do you? no.

257
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,653
Suppose you've lost
interest in it now.

258
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,924
Now it'll be ant-ant-ant
for a couple of days

259
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,292
Then all of a sudden

260
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,160
"oh, mum, I've bought
a sloth"

261
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:03,063
Or some other odd-toed
ungulate like a tapir.

262
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,232
No, it's really
different this time, mum.

263
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,401
I'm really going to
look after this ant.

264
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,804
That's what you said
about the sperm whale.

265
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,407
Now your papa's having
to use it as a garage.

266
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,242
Well, you didn't
feed it properly.

267
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,777
Where are we going to get

268
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,146
44 tons of plankton
from every morning?

269
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,281
Your papa was dead vexed
about that.

270
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:23,417
They thought he was mad
in the deli.

271
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,352
Well, at least he's
got a free garage.

272
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,753
That's no good to him.

273
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,690
His hillman smells
all fishy.

274
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,758
Oh, blimey, that's the tiger.

275
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,460
He wants his mandies.

276
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,963
Are you giving
that tiger drugs?

277
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,931
'course I'm giving it drugs.

278
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:38,966
It's illegal.

279
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,634
You try telling that
to the tiger.

280
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,736
Well, I think
it's dangerous.

281
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,505
Listen, before
he started fixing

282
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,774
He used to get through four
jehovah witnesses a day.

283
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,777
And he used to eat all of them,
except the pamphlets.

284
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,980
Well, he's not dim.

285
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,281
All right!

286
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,749
I'm going
to watch tv.

287
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:56,850
Come on, marcus.

288
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,752
Michael's been on the phone

289
00:11:58,785 --> 00:11:59,887
All day for you.

290
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,054
Michael?

291
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,757
Yeah, you know, michael...
michael!

292
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,925
Michael ellis.

293
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,894
Yeah, he's been
on the phone all day.

294
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:07,995
He came round twice.

295
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,263
What does
he look like?

296
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,764
Oh, I didn't
see him.

297
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,966
The orange-rumped agouti
answered the door.

298
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,102
Only useful animal
you ever bought, that.

299
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,170
Where is he now?

300
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,205
He's upstairs forging
prescriptions

301
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,540
For the sodding tiger.

302
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,109
No, no, where is
michael ellis now?

303
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,177
Oh, I don't know.

304
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,345
He said it wasn't
important, anyway.

305
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,549
All right, here I come.

306
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,984
Um...

307
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,264
Hello, and welcome

308
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,166
to the university
of the air.

309
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,601
And first
this afternoon

310
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,902
part 17
of our series

311
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,437
on animal
communications.

312
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,106
This afternoon, we look
at recent discoveries

313
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,943
in the field of intraspecific
signaling codes

314
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,411
in the family
formicidae.

315
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:02,416
Ooh, that's
a stroke of luck, marcus.

316
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,183
Turn that
bloody thing off!

317
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,317
We interrupt
this program

318
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,618
to bring you
the latest news

319
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:13,487
of the extraordinary
michael ellis saga.

320
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,855
Apparently michael ellis...

321
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,623
Hey, I was watching that!

322
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:17,624
Bloody thing.

323
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:19,760
It's upsetting
the tiger.

324
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:22,663
Oh, christ.

325
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:32,739
...nd of the announcement.

326
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:35,108
And now back to
university of the air

327
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,878
And our series for advanced
medical students

328
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,647
Elements of surgical
homeopathic practice.

329
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,482
Part 68, "ants."

330
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:47,087
Ah! we're in luck again, marcus.

331
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,123
Hello, formicidophiles.

332
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:53,727
Well, before all the blood
and guts you're waiting to see

333
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,930
let's have a look at the anatomy
of the little ant.

334
00:14:56,964 --> 00:15:01,935
The body of the ant is divided
into three sections--

335
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,605
the head, the thorax
and the abdomen.

336
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:07,908
They are enclosed in
a hard armorlike covering

337
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,810
called the exoskeleton

338
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:14,281
which provides some protection
from other nasty little insects

339
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:18,118
but, unfortunately, not
from the dissector's scalpel.

340
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,520
See, nothing to it.

341
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:20,988
He's not such a toughie.

342
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,422
And his legs--

343
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:25,559
they help him carry
hundreds of times his own weight

344
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,127
but look at this.

345
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,429
You're not so strong
compared with me.

346
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,098
Four, five, six... ha!

347
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,433
I didn't know ants had
six legs, marcus.

348
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,603
I assure you,
they do, mr. ellis.

349
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:39,039
Hey, you've got
two legs missing.

350
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,542
And that's a false feeler,
marcus.

351
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:44,144
Blimey!

352
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,784
I'm taking this ant
back, mother.

353
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,286
It's got two legs
missing.

354
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,154
Mrs. mcwong's been
on the phone.

355
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:56,657
The polar bear's been
in her garden again.

356
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,059
Well, I'll get it on the way back
from the store.

357
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,394
Well, mind you do.

358
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,762
His droppings
are enormous.

359
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,564
Oh, and by the way,
while you're out

360
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:05,799
Get us another couple
of tellies, would you?

361
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,102
Here's 180 quid.

362
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,283
Second floor.

363
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:27,120
Stationery, leather goods,
nasal injuries

364
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:32,359
Cricket bats, film stars,
dolphinariums.

365
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,637
Third floor.

366
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,641
Cosmetics, books,
irish massage

367
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,477
Tribal headgear, ants

368
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,880
But not complaints
about ants.

369
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:55,315
Oh, where do I go
to complain?

370
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:59,152
Straight on, then left,
then right past the thing

371
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,154
Then up the little stairs

372
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,491
Then right past the bit
where it's gone all soft

373
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,495
Then down the wobbly bit,
left past the nail

374
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,899
Past the brown stain
on the wall to your right

375
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:14,168
And it's the door
marked "exit"

376
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,603
Straight ahead of you
on the left.

377
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:19,106
Thank you.

378
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,774
Fourth floor.

379
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,743
Kiddies' vasectomies...

380
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,278
I don't want you.

381
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,813
Oh, something wrong with
your little ant friend?

382
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,382
No, I'm not going
to tell you.

383
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,551
Oh, something missing
in the leg department?

384
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:31,552
No.

385
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:32,986
Yes, sir, can i
help you, sir?

386
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,987
No, no, no, no, no.

387
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,189
It's all right, sir.

388
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,024
It's for the sack race
later on, sir.

389
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,560
No, no, no, I want to speak
to the general manager.

390
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:40,827
I want to complain.

391
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,197
Oh, you want the toupee hall,
in that case, sir.

392
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,298
The what?

393
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:48,502
The toupee hall,
mr. ellis.

394
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,537
Excuse me,
could you tell me

395
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,472
The way to
the toupee hall, please?

396
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:53,507
Sorry?

397
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,641
The toupee hall.

398
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:56,643
The what?!

399
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,612
The toupee hall.

400
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,981
Oh, the toupee hall.

401
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,984
Gladys, where are
toupees now?

402
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,419
Toupees?

403
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,753
Mm, this gentleman
wants one.

404
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:07,754
A toupee?

405
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:08,655
Mm.

406
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:09,890
Well, no, actually...

407
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,192
Oh, I think they're in surgical
appliances now.

408
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:13,727
Oh, that's right.

409
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,330
Yes, you go left at artificial limbs
and hearing aids

410
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,497
Right at dentures

411
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,566
And it's on your left
just by glass eyes.

412
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,202
It doesn't say toupees to
avoid embarrassing people

413
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:23,437
But you can smell them.

414
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,273
Thank you.

415
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,611
You can see the join.

416
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:32,446
Yes, you can.

417
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,049
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

418
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:40,888
It's so nice to see such
a large turnout this afternoon.

419
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,789
And I'd like to start off

420
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:46,560
By welcoming our guest speakers
for this afternoon

421
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:47,728
Mr. wadsworth...

422
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,029
Wordsworth.

423
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:50,898
Sorry, wordsworth.

424
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:53,834
Mr. john koots

425
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,202
And percy bysshe.

426
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,170
Shelley.

427
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:59,740
Just a little one,
medium dry.

428
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,108
And alfred lorde.

429
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,109
Tennyson.

430
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,343
Tennisball.

431
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,077
Son.

432
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:06,013
Sorry, alfred lord

433
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:09,249
Who is evidently
lord tennisball's son.

434
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:10,851
And to start off

435
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:14,254
I'm going to ask mr. wadswroth
to recite his latest offering

436
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:19,693
A little pram entitled
"I wandered lonely as a crab"

437
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:23,630
And it's all about ants.

438
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:26,633
I wandered lonely as a cloud...

439
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,634
Oh!

440
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,203
That floats on high

441
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,871
O'er vales and hills

442
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,707
When all at once,
I saw a crowd

443
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,045
A host of golden worker ants.

444
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:47,054
Thank you, thank you,
mr. bradlaugh.

445
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:48,488
Now, mr. bysshe...

446
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,323
Shelley.

447
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,592
Oh!

448
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:55,229
Is going to read one
of his latest psalms

449
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:59,266
Entitled "ode to a crab."

450
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,869
Well, it's not
about crabs, actually.

451
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:03,637
It's called
"ozymandias."

452
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,406
It's not an ode.

453
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,409
I met a traveler
in an antique land

454
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:12,579
Who said "six vast
and trunkless legs of stone

455
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,781
"stand in the desert.

456
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,684
"and on the pedestal,
these words appear--

457
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:21,054
"'my name is ozymandias,
king of ants.

458
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,457
"'look on
my feelers, termites

459
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,859
"'and despair

460
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,428
"'i am the biggest ant
you'll ever see.

461
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:32,933
"'the ants of old
weren't half as bold

462
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:37,137
And big and
fierce as me.'"

463
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,378
Thank you.

464
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,880
Thank you, mr. amontillado.

465
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:50,050
I'd like to ask one
or two of you at the back

466
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,985
Not to soil the carpet.

467
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:58,725
There is a restroom upstairs if
you find the poems too exciting.

468
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,561
Good afternoon.

469
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:05,732
Next, mr. dennis keat
will recite his latest problem

470
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:09,937
"ode to a glass of sherry."

471
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:12,840
My heart aches

472
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:15,843
And a drowsy numbness pains
my senses

473
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:18,579
As though an anteater
I'd seen...

474
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,347
A nasty long-nosed brute...

475
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,616
With furry legs and sticky
darting tongue.

476
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,551
I seem to feel its cruel jaws

477
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,753
Crunch! crunch! there go my legs

478
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,589
Snap! snap! my thorax, too.

479
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,458
My head's in a twain,
there goes my brain

480
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,126
Swallow, swallow...

481
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,661
It's true,
don't you see?

482
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,129
It's true.

483
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:37,631
It happens, it happens.

484
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,799
Please.

485
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:40,234
Ladies and gentlemen

486
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:42,436
I do apologize for that last...

487
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,838
Well, I hesitate to call it
a pram.

488
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:46,707
But I had no idea.

489
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,408
And talking of filth

490
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:51,111
I have asked you once
about the carpet.

491
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,813
Now, I do appreciate

492
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:56,316
That last poem was
very frightening, but please...

493
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,320
Now, before we move on
to tea and pramwiches

494
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:03,824
I would like to ask
arthur lord tenniscourt

495
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:06,493
To give us
his latest little plum

496
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:09,930
Entitled "the charge
of the ant brigade."

497
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:13,000
Half an inch...

498
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,334
Half an inch...

499
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:18,038
The queen,
the queen.

500
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:25,612
My loyal subjects,
we are here today

501
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:28,515
On a matter of
national import.

502
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:32,052
My late husband and we
are increasingly disturbed

503
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:34,955
By recent developments
in literary style

504
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:38,792
Vich have taken place
here in germany... er, england.

505
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,795
There seems to be an increasing
tendency for ze ent...

506
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,798
The ent... the ant

507
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,366
To become the dominant...

508
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,302
Was is der deutsches
entwicklungsbund...

509
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:49,403
Theme.

510
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:50,971
Theme of modern poetry
here in germany.

511
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:53,640
We are not... amusiert?

512
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:54,875
Entertained.

513
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:56,210
Entertained.

514
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:58,212
From now on,
ants is verboten.

515
00:22:58,245 --> 00:23:01,315
Instead, it's skylarks,
daffodils, nightingales

516
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:04,484
Light brigades and...

517
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:09,089
Was ist das
shcreckliche gepong?

518
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:12,159
Es schmecke wie
ein scheisshaus

519
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:13,727
Und so weiter.

520
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,262
Well, we must away now

521
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:17,464
Or we shall be late
for the races.

522
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:21,168
God bless you, alles.

523
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,380
Electric kettles
over here, sir.

524
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:36,350
Don't worry, sir.

525
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:37,885
You're amongst
friends now, sir.

526
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,319
Mr. bradford,
mr. crawley.

527
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:41,221
These are our
fitters, sir.

528
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:44,224
We've had a lot of experience
in this field

529
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,959
And we do
pride ourselves

530
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:49,796
We offer the best and most
discreet service available.

531
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,964
I don't know

532
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,499
Whether you believe this, sir

533
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,301
But one of us is
actually wearing

534
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:57,471
A toupee at
this moment.

535
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:01,909
Well, you all are,
aren't you?

536
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:03,477
Have you got one?

537
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,878
No, I thought you...

538
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:06,079
I didn't know
you two...

539
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:07,781
I thought it was me.
I thought it was me.

540
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:08,949
So did i.

541
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:11,618
That is good.

542
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,153
Actually, I only came in here

543
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:15,155
To ask where
the manager's office was.

544
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:16,223
Just a minute.

545
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:17,758
Someone told you
we all had toupees?

546
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,759
No.

547
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:19,760
Oh, yeah?

548
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:20,961
How did you know?

549
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,863
Well, it's pretty obvious,
isn't it?

550
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,665
What do you mean,
obvious?

551
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:26,667
His is
undetectable.

552
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,570
Well, it's a different color,
for a start.

553
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:30,737
Is it?

554
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:32,005
Of course, it isn't.

555
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,307
It doesn't fit in with the rest
of his hair.

556
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,408
It sort of sticks up in
the middle.

557
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:35,843
Well, it's better
than yours.

558
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:36,844
Yes.

559
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:39,213
I'm not wearing
one.

560
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:40,714
Why did you come
in here then?

561
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,883
They told me to find
the manager's office here.

562
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,251
Oh, no, not again.

563
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:46,353
That's a bit lame,
isn't it?

564
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:47,321
It's the truth.

565
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:49,590
Manager's office?

566
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:51,291
Where'd you
get that, eh?

567
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:52,593
Mac fisheries?

568
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:53,760
Dreadful,
isn't it?

569
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:54,862
Nylon?

570
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,597
It's not, it's real, look.

571
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,566
Yeah, anyone
can do that.

572
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,868
Come on, get it off.

573
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:02,536
Look, do you want
a proper one?

574
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:03,604
No, I don't
need one.

575
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,205
There's no need
to be ashamed.

576
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,607
Look, we've all owned up.

577
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,075
I'm not wearing one.

578
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:10,110
Don't you see,
this is something

579
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:12,212
You've got to come
to terms with.

580
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:13,447
I am not wearing a toupee.

581
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,948
They just told me
to come in here

582
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:17,484
To find the manager's office
to complain about my ant.

583
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,286
Complain about
an ant?

584
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,891
Look, this is
for your own good.

585
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:28,662
All right,
take a seat.

586
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,031
You see, it ought
to have a safety catch.

587
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:32,799
I mean...

588
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,067
Ooh!

589
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:36,336
I mean, what if this fell
into the wrong hands?

590
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,471
Yes, madam,
I'll speak

591
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:39,306
To the makers personally,
all right?

592
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,974
Oh, would you?

593
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:45,312
It would put my mind
at ease.

594
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:48,749
Sorry, oh, sorry.

595
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:50,717
Next.

596
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:53,153
He's still
molesting her.

597
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:55,989
Yes, yes, I'll see you in
a moment, sir.

598
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,624
I've got a complaint to make.

599
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:58,725
Ah, take a seat.

600
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,993
I'm sorry
it's on fire.

601
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:01,061
Oh, not at all.

602
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:02,329
I got used to this
out east.

603
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:04,198
Ah, where were you out east?

604
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh, norway, sweden,
places like that.

605
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:08,702
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

606
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,171
My suit seems
to be catching fire.

607
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:12,472
Extinguisher?

608
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:13,674
Oh, no, thank you.

609
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,843
I think we'd better
let it run its course.

610
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,110
I was just thinking

611
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:18,879
Norway is not
very east, is it?

612
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,548
No, I should have said,
"when I was out north."

613
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,617
Yes, are there
many fires in norway?

614
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,018
Oh, good lord, yes.

615
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:26,820
The place is
a constant blaze.

616
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:28,455
Wooden buildings,
you know.

617
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:29,790
Oh, yes.

618
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:31,425
I lost my wife
in norway.

619
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:32,693
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

620
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:33,694
Why, did you know her?

621
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,095
No, no, I don't...

622
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:36,930
No, she wasn't
a favorite of mine.

623
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:39,600
No, we were out strolling
across a fjord one day

624
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:42,769
When one of the local matadors
came out of his tree house

625
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:46,840
And flung a load of old scimitars
and guillotines out

626
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:48,909
That he'd got cluttering up
his wine cellar

627
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:51,311
And apparently, rather
a large proportion of them

628
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:52,546
Landed on my wife

629
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,815
Causing her to snuff it
without much more ado.

630
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,816
Yes, yes.

631
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:58,318
Well, look...

632
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:00,687
Here is an important
announcement

633
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:02,055
about michael ellis.

634
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,991
It is now the end
of "michael ellis" week.

635
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:06,093
From now on,
it is "chris quinn" week.

636
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,561
What a rotten ending.

637
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:09,563
Well, it is one
of our cheapest, sir.

638
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:10,964
What else have you got?

639
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:13,500
Well, there's
the long, slow pullout, sir

640
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:17,905
You know, the camera tracks
back and back and mixes...

641
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:18,972
No, no, no.

642
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:20,574
Have you got anything
more exciting?

643
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:21,775
Well, how about
a chase?

644
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,778
There he is!

645
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:29,750
Oh, no, no.

646
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:31,151
Walking into the sunset?

647
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:32,619
What's that one?

648
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:35,522
You know, two lone
figures silhouetted

649
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:38,759
Against the dying rays
of the setting sun.

650
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,427
The music swells

651
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,896
And you've got a lump
in your throat

652
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,531
And a tear in your eye.

653
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:45,799
Oh, no.

654
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,401
Pity, I rather like that one.

655
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,169
No, they're all a bit
off the point, you see.

656
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:50,470
Well, there is one

657
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:52,806
That ties up the whole
michael ellis thing, but...

658
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,874
But what?

659
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:55,142
Oh, no, nothing, nothing.

660
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,176
Look, who is this michael ellis?

661
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,845
How about a happy ending, sir?

662
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:59,646
Chris, thank god
you're safe.

663
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,648
No, you wouldn't want that,
would you?

664
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,317
Why wouldn't I want that?

665
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,085
What about summing up
from the panel?

666
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:06,253
That's cheap.

667
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:07,254
What?

668
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:08,789
You know, the big match experts.

669
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:12,459
Yes, that was quite
a good show, you know.

670
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:14,728
I think that the
michael ellis character

671
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:16,296
Was a little overdone.

672
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,233
Well, I don't agree
with that, malcolm.

673
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:22,269
Quite frankly,
the only bit I liked was

674
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:24,338
This bit with me
in it now.

675
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,740
No? slow fade?

676
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,876
Nnn... no.

677
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:33,480
Well, how about
a sudden ending?
