1
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:37,970
It's just that everywhere I go

2
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,438
It's the same
old thing--

3
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,107
All anyone
wants me to say is

4
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,375
"to be or not to be."

5
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:43,743
"that is the question.

6
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,145
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer..."

7
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,713
It's either that
or "oh, that this

8
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,382
Too, too solid
flesh would melt..."

9
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:52,118
"would melt, thaw and
resolve itself into a dew.

10
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:53,953
"or that the everlasting

11
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,822
Had not fixed his canon
'gainst self slaughter..."

12
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:57,990
Yes, all that sort of thing

13
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,392
And I'm just getting
really fed...

14
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:01,494
Do the bit about
"alas poor yorick."

15
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:02,628
No, I'm sick of it!

16
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,263
I want to do
something else.

17
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,365
I want to make
something of my life.

18
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,867
No, I don't
know that bit.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,603
I want to get away from all that,
be different.

20
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:14,540
Well, um...
what do you want to be?

21
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,842
A private dick!

22
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,510
A private dick?

23
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,045
Yes, a private dick!

24
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:20,713
Why do you want
to be a private dick?

25
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:23,482
Why does anyone want to be
a private dick?

26
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,952
Fame, money, glamour,
excitement, sex.

27
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,086
Ah! it's the sex, is it?

28
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,754
Well, that's one
of the things, yes.

29
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,056
What's the sex problem?

30
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,190
Well, there's
no problem.

31
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,225
Now, come on, come on.

32
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,659
You've got this girl
on the bed

33
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,961
And she's all ready
for it...

34
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,729
No, no, it's nothing
to do with that.

35
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:37,763
No, no, come on, come on.

36
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,031
There she is,
she's all ready for it

37
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,666
She's a real stunner,
she's got great big tits

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,034
She's really well stacked

39
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,736
And you've got her legs up
against the mantelpiece...

40
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,872
All right, mr. butler,
I'll take over.

41
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,241
Morning, mr. hamlet,
my name's natal.

42
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,775
Sorry to keep you waiting.

43
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,677
Now, what seems
to be the problem?

44
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,312
Well, I was telling
the other psychiatrist...

45
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,581
Uh, he's... he's not
a psychiatrist.

46
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,583
Oh, he said he was
a psychiatrist.

47
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,585
Well...

48
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,220
Yes.

49
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,855
Um... he is
a kind of psychiatrist

50
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,691
But he's, um...
he's not a proper psychiatrist.

51
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:10,997
He's not, uh...
fully qualified in, um...

52
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:16,235
Quite the sort of way
that we should want.

53
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,770
Anyway the problem,
I believe

54
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,071
Is basically
sexual, is it?

55
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,072
I asked him that!

56
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,341
Get out!

57
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,509
Now then, you've got
the girl on the bed

58
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,777
You've been having
a bit of a feel-up

59
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,045
You've got your tongue
down her throat.

60
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:27,647
She's got both her legs
up on the mantelpiece...

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,781
Dr. natal!
out, please!

62
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:30,016
I'm talking
to a patient!

63
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,918
Out, please!

64
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,452
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

65
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,022
We have a lot of trouble here
with bogus psychiatrists--

66
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,990
One of the risks
in psychiatry, I'm afraid.

67
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,326
Unfortunately, they do tend
to frighten the patient

68
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,361
And they can cause real
and permanent damage

69
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,362
To the treatment.

70
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,031
But I assure you

71
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,367
That I am a completely
bona fide psychiatrist.

72
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,368
Here's my diploma
in psychiatry

73
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,803
From the university
of oxford.

74
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,405
This here shows
that I'm a member

75
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,307
Of the british
psychiatric association--

76
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,741
A very important
body, indeed.

77
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,743
Here's a letter
from another psychiatrist

78
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,513
In which he mentions
that I'm a psychiatrist.

79
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:02,215
This is my
psychiatric club tie

80
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,383
And, as you can see,
the cufflinks match.

81
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,886
I've got a copy of
psychiatry today in my bag

82
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,754
Which I think
is pretty convincing

83
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,456
And a letter here
from my mother

84
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,925
In which she asks
how the psychiatry is going.

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,360
And I think you'll realize

86
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:17,063
The one person you can't fool
is your mother.

87
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,064
So if you'd like
to ask me

88
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,232
Any questions
about psychiatry

89
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,466
I bet I can answer them.

90
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,068
Okay, right, you've got
the girl on the bed

91
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,936
You've had a few drinks,
you've got her sweater up

92
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,506
And she's got her feet
on the mantelpiece.

93
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,374
Yes, what is it?

94
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:31,444
There's a proper psychiatrist
to see you, dr. rufus berg.

95
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:35,781
Oh, my god--
okay, thank you.

96
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,285
Right, thank you very much

97
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:41,220
For answering
the questions, sir.

98
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:46,459
We'll try not
to trouble you again, sir.

99
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,694
Right, you've got the girl
down on the bed.

100
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,263
You've got her legs
up on the mantelpiece

101
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,332
And then you...

102
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,901
Well, well done,
mr. hamlet.

103
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,671
You've done extremely well
in our disorientation tests.

104
00:03:58,704 --> 00:03:59,805
Oh... oh.

105
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,007
You see, I'm sorry

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,708
It might have
confused you a little

107
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,877
But we do this, you see,
to try and establish

108
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,280
A very good doctor-patient
relationship, you see.

109
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,748
We do it to sort of,
as it were

110
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,716
To break down the barriers,
all right?

111
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,385
Yes, fine.

112
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,686
Good-- well,
you've got her legs up

113
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,687
On the mantelpiece

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,955
She's really a knocker...

115
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:18,291
On behalf of
the psychiatric association

116
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,294
I should like to say
that we are taking firm action

117
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,497
To clamp down on the activities
of bogus psychiatrists.

118
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,999
In fact, in many areas
of modern psychiatry

119
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,368
Computers are now
being increasingly used

120
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,839
For the first basic diagnosis,
and this has gone a long way

121
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,075
Towards eliminating the danger
of unqualified impostors

122
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,110
You've had your tongue
down her throat

123
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,512
and she's got her legs...

124
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,881
Out!

125
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,151
Good evening and welcome
to nationwide

126
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:22,989
The program where we do
rather wet things nationally

127
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,057
And also give you a chance

128
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,561
To see some rather wet items
in the regions.

129
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:32,031
Well, everyone is talking today
about the third world war

130
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,799
Which broke out this morning.

131
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,434
But here on nationwide

132
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,770
We're going to get away
from that for a bit

133
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:40,006
And look instead
at the latest theory

134
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,042
That sitting down regularly
in a comfortable chair

135
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:44,744
Can rest your legs.

136
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:48,447
It sounds very nice, doesn't it,
but can it be done?

137
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,385
Is it possible or practical
for many of us, in our jobs

138
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,221
And with the sort
of busy lives we lead

139
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:59,091
To sit down in a comfortable
chair just when we want?

140
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:04,730
We sent our reporter,
john dull, to find out.

141
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,803
Well, here I am on london's
busy westminster bridge

142
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,173
Seeing just how much time
sitting down can take.

143
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,243
Well, I arrived here by train
at about 8:50.

144
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:21,280
It's now 9:05, so I've been here
approximately 12 minutes.

145
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,349
And if it's
any encouragement

146
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,018
I must say that my legs
do feel rested.

147
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,654
Is this your chair?

148
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,290
Uh... well,
no, it's a prop.

149
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,291
It's been stolen!

150
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,492
What?

151
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,162
This belongs to
a mrs. edgeworth of pinner.

152
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,997
She's standing over there.

153
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,099
Yoo-hoo!

154
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,935
Uh, well, it's nothing
to do with me.

155
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,606
I mean, it's just
a prop which the bbc...

156
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,210
It's got her name
on the bottom.

157
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,714
Well, uh, perhaps you'd better
give it back to her.

158
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,016
You don't believe
I'm a policeman, do you?

159
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,017
Yes, I do!

160
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,585
What am I wearing
on my head?

161
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,520
A helmet.

162
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,722
A policeman's helmet!

163
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,524
Yes.

164
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,525
You see that?

165
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,559
Yes.

166
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,227
That little number there?

167
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,495
Yes.

168
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,032
That is a metropolitan
area identification code.

169
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,269
No helmet is authentic
without that number.

170
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,004
I see.

171
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,440
Kids' helmets, helmets
you get at toy shops

172
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,809
Helmets you buy
at christmas--

173
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,145
None of them has
that number.

174
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,648
None of them is authentic.

175
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,649
Hang on.

176
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,650
Oh, could i...

177
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,319
Hang on!

178
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,421
Mind you, I didn't join
the police force

179
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,289
Just to wear the helmet,
you know.

180
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,557
Oh.

181
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,327
That just happens to be
one of the little perks.

182
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,162
There are plenty of jobs

183
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,564
Where I could have
worn a helmet

184
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,499
But not such
a nice helmet.

185
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,901
This helmet, I think

186
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,071
Beats even some of
the more elaborate helmets

187
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,206
Worn by the tsar's
private army

188
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,444
The so-called
axi red warriors.

189
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,612
You know about them?

190
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,946
Well, no, I don't.

191
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,148
Ah! their helmets
used to look like...

192
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,216
You got any paper?

193
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,852
Well, only
these scripts.

194
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,522
Hold on.

195
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,028
Hey!

196
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,701
I'll have that.

197
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,204
I say.

198
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,344
Now then... their helmet
was not unlike

199
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,680
The bobby's helmet
in basic shape.

200
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,349
It had an emblem here
and three gold--

201
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,785
And in those days
it really was gold.

202
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,455
That's part of the reason
why the tsar was so unpopular--

203
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,391
Three gold bands

204
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:22,028
Surmounted by a golden
eagle on the apex here.

205
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,896
Pretty nice helmet, eh?

206
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,064
Yes.

207
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,099
I think the domed helmet
wins every time

208
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,868
Over the flattened job,
you know

209
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,872
Even when they're
three-cornered or...

210
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,006
You want
something to eat?

211
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,209
Well, no, uh,
I mean, really...

212
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,878
Hang on.

213
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,314
You can't park here, you know.

214
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,748
We're not parked.

215
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,749
Not parked!

216
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,750
What's that then?

217
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,751
That's our lunch.

218
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,019
Right.

219
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,555
I'm taking that in for a
forensic examination.

220
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,590
Why?

221
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,024
Because it might

222
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,794
Have been used as
a murder weapon, that's why!

223
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,030
Now, clear off!

224
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,505
Yeah, not bad.

225
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,440
Could be worse.

226
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,441
Beer?

227
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,276
No, no, please!

228
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,813
Honestly, please...

229
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:30,229
Now then, the chaldeans,
who used to inhabit the area

230
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,932
In between the tigris
and euphrates rivers--

231
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,434
Their helmets was
of the modular

232
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,539
Restrained kind
of type...

233
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,311
Oh, robert, tell me
I'm beautiful.

234
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,746
Oh, you are, you are.

235
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,648
Oh, robert,
do you mean that?

236
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,949
Of course I do.

237
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,717
You're not
just saying it

238
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,286
Because I asked you to?

239
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,687
Of course not.

240
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,226
Oh, robert, are you sure it
doesn't put you off?

241
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,827
What?

242
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,263
My father wanting to come and
live with us.

243
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,665
No, of course
I don't mind

244
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,600
Your father coming
to live with us.

245
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,569
He wouldn't just be
living with us.

246
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,572
What do you mean?

247
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,774
Well, he finds it
very difficult

248
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,576
To get to sleep
on his own

249
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,744
So I said he could
sleep with us.

250
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,746
He wants to put
his bed in our room?!

251
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,081
No, no, of course not.

252
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,216
Oh, good.

253
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,117
Our bed is plenty
big enough for three.

254
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,219
What?

255
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,087
He'd just get into bed
and go to sleep.

256
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,622
No, I'm not having that!

257
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,924
Oh, robert, I thought
you loved me!

258
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,659
Well, I do, but...

259
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,228
Well, he wouldn't look.

260
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,495
He's bound to peek.

261
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,464
No, no, he wouldn't,
honestly.

262
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,832
No! no! no!

263
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,934
You young couple
just carry on.

264
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,638
Take no notice of me.

265
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,308
I don't want to feel

266
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,310
As though I'm
getting in the way.

267
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,745
Oh, no, dad,
you're not.

268
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,913
No, no...

269
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,349
Good!

270
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,924
Well... I think
I'll get to sleep.

271
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,759
Are you sure?

272
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,595
Oh, yes, I'm a bit tired
after the wedding.

273
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,230
Bob, what about you?

274
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,099
Oh, yes,
all right, yes.

275
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,902
Oh, well, I seem
to be o.c. lights.

276
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,570
Good night,
darling.

277
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,638
Good night.

278
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,541
Good night!

279
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,280
Father?

280
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,249
Father, what
are you doing?

281
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,617
I'm making a boat.

282
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,918
What?

283
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:06,919
It's a cutty sark.

284
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,387
It's a model
I've been making

285
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,989
In the dark for
some years now.

286
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,257
Well, wouldn't
it be better

287
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,325
With the light on?

288
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,160
No, no, I'm
making it in the dark--

289
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,528
That's the point.

290
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,197
Oh, dear...

291
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,966
It's not as accurate
as I thought.

292
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,434
It's not
the cutty sark!

293
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,703
Well, it hasn't got
its sails on yet.

294
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,804
Oh, well, I'll...

295
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,205
I'll have a look at it

296
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,241
In the dark room
in the morning.

297
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,143
Good night!

298
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,980
Will you shut up in there?

299
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,817
Shut up!

300
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:17,023
Shut... that's better.

301
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,927
I am myself indifferent honest,
but yet, I could accuse me

302
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,862
Of such things
that it were better

303
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,397
My mother
had not borne me.

304
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,134
O fair ophelia, nymph,
in thy orisons

305
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,903
Be all my sins
remembered.

306
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,039
So anyway, you've
got the girl on the bed

307
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,074
And her legs are
on the mantelpiece...

308
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,443
Out!

309
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,782
We're hit! jump!

310
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,452
Good god, sir,
look at that.

311
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,954
Quiet, you'll
wake him.

312
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,590
Sorry, sir.

313
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,191
Let's try to reach
the city walls

314
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,125
Before he
wakes up.

315
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:53,793
Yes, sir!

316
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,594
Shh! quiet.

317
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,064
Right,
sorry, sir.

318
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,131
Sorry, sir.

319
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,901
Too late!

320
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,573
We're saved!

321
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,309
That was a great fight, champ

322
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,611
A great fight, you hear?

323
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,112
Oh, boy, what a fight,
champ!

324
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,380
What a great fight!

325
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,883
You nearly had him, champ,
you nearly had him...

326
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,917
Where's his head?

327
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,653
I got it in here,
mr. gabriello.

328
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,421
You were great,
champ, do you hear?

329
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,422
You were great!

330
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,091
He got a nasty
cut over his eye.

331
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,659
Yeah, I think
it was a mistake

332
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,827
Him wearing
spectacles.

333
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,729
Oh, well, get that
sewn onto his body

334
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,364
In time for
the press pictures!

335
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,365
Okay, mr. gabriello.

336
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,799
Ah, wasn't he
great, my boy?

337
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,234
He was great,
mr. gabriello.

338
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,636
The way he kept
on fighting

339
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,037
After his
head came off.

340
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,673
He was better when the head
came off, mr. gabriello.

341
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,241
He was really dodging the guy.

342
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,076
Yeah, I reckon
if he could've lasted

343
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,745
Till the end of
that first minute

344
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,547
He would've had
the killer worried.

345
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,614
Sure, mr. gabriello.

346
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:49,615
Oh, he was great!

347
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,883
Did you see
his left arm?

348
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:51,884
No.

349
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,486
Okay, we'll look
around the hall

350
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,620
After everyone's gone.

351
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,088
Do you realize,
mr. gabriello

352
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,490
Some of those
guys out there

353
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,358
Paid over $2,000
for a ringside seat?

354
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,893
And where does
the head land?

355
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,762
Right at the back--
that's justice.

356
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,297
Oh, boy.

357
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,331
What do you want?

358
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,899
This your
boy's head?

359
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,734
No, no, we got
his head!

360
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,503
He ain't hurt
that bad.

361
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,271
Hey, that's
jerry marinello.

362
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,273
He fought the killer last week.

363
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,508
Okay, give it
to me.

364
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,076
I'm seeing his
trainer tomorrow.

365
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,645
I'll give it to him.

366
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,215
Hey, mr. gabriello,
the press is still outside.

367
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,249
You ready for them?

368
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,250
How's the champ?

369
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,484
Well, the head's
on okay

370
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,486
But there's still
a left arm missing.

371
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,288
Okay, well, keep
the dressing gown

372
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,356
Kind of
loose, okay?

373
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,625
Okay, boys, come on in!

374
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,493
Mr. gabriello!

375
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,295
Did you expect
your boy to last

376
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,530
The full 28 seconds?

377
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,098
This boy has never
let me down.

378
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,601
He's the pluckiest goddamn
fighter I ever trained.

379
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,736
Were you worried when his head
started to come loose?

380
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,037
No, no, we was
expecting that.

381
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,572
I told him to expect
it and he did.

382
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,740
He ain't stupid.

383
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,342
Hey, can we have a word with
the champ?

384
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,577
Yeah, okay, but keep
the questions simple.

385
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,112
Hey, champ,
how you feeling?

386
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,714
I said keep the questions
simple!

387
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,748
Mr. gabriello

388
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,749
People are
saying

389
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,084
The kid ought
to be buried.

390
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,085
His head's
come off

391
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,186
In the last
six fights.

392
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,154
There's no question
of burying the kid!

393
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,155
He's just reaching
the top.

394
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,290
Well, shouldn't
he just stay

395
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,391
In the
hospital?

396
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,792
No, he ain't going
to no hospital.

397
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,695
He's got the return
fight next week.

398
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,765
And there's frank sinatra
leaving the ring.

399
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,434
Behind him is george raft,
another great boxing fan

400
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,603
Martin bormann, acknowledging
the applause

401
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,639
and with him, of course,
is gus himmler

402
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,208
who did an awful lot
for the sport in his country

403
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,376
in the early 1940s.

404
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,977
And here comes the champ now.

405
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,014
He really seems in good shape
to meet the killer once again

406
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,382
before an audience--

407
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,784
some of whom have paid
$920,000 million

408
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,621
for the privilege of seeing
this boy get beaten up.

409
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,691
And there's the bell.

410
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,859
Quiet!

411
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,194
...and a left and a right jab

412
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,762
that's taken half
the champ's shoulder off.

413
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,031
and here's the killer again
with a right and another left

414
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,832
and a bash with a hammer
and a terrific smack

415
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,401
with a heavy thud
right into the skull

416
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,903
and there's a gaping hole right
through the champ's body now.

417
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,572
And now the killer's
working on the cut eye

418
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,841
with a series of
beautifully placed punches

419
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,375
and the head's coming loose!

420
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,544
The champ must try
and keep his head on.

421
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,879
The killer's kicked him
in the groin

422
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,380
and he's bitten half
his left buttock off

423
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,316
and the referee's stepped in
with a warning there.

424
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,051
What a plucky fighter
this champ is.

425
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,186
He's fighting as well
as I've ever seen him.

426
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,089
He must be losing blood at
the rate of a pint a second now.

427
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,090
It's everywhere.

428
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,059
Certainly those
who paid $1.5 million

429
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,393
for those ringside seats

430
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,529
are really getting
their money's worth.

431
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,030
They're covered in it.

432
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,567
And his head's off!

433
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:25,304
...in so many fights is
off in the 31st second.

434
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,139
It's rolled away down
to the left.

435
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,608
But what's happening?

436
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,710
The killer's being talked to
by the referee.

437
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,512
There's the champ's
plucky little body

438
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,047
racing around the ring,
trying to find his opponent.

439
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,351
And the killer has
been disqualified!

440
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,488
This great fighter, who has
killed more than 50 people

441
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:46,125
in his boxing career,
has at last been defeated

442
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,061
by this courageous, headless
little southpaw from new york.

443
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:52,031
And there's a great roar here
as the referee raises the arm

444
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,933
of the new
world heavyweight champion.

445
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,304
What a pity the rest of his body
wasn't here to see it.

446
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,339
Well, here in london

447
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,875
it's 12:30 and time
for the robinsons

448
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,412
an everyday story of blah-di-
blah-di-blah-di-blah.

449
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,314
Da-di-da-di-da-di-da

450
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,116
da-di-da-di-da...

451
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,117
and so on.

452
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:13,819
Morning, mrs. robinson.

453
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,755
Morning, mrs. non-robinson.

454
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,622
Been shopping?

455
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,124
No... I've been shopping.

456
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,325
What'd you buy?

457
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,326
A piston engine.

458
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,527
What did you buy that for?

459
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,163
Bloody rubbish!

460
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:28,234
I wanted to listen to that.

461
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,535
Morning,
mrs. gorilla.

462
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,537
Morning,
mrs. non-gorilla.

463
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,705
Have you been
shopping?

464
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,041
No... been shopping.

465
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,043
Did you buy
anything?

466
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,644
A piston engine.

467
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,380
What did you
buy that for?

468
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,716
Ooh! it was
a bargain.

469
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,985
Ooh!

470
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,587
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

471
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,755
Come on, little birdies,
come on.

472
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:53,059
Nice little birdies.

473
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,696
Come on, little birdies.

474
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,298
Come on, little birdies.

475
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,568
Come and see
what mommy's got for you.

476
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,437
Come on, little birdies.

477
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,572
Tweety, tweety,
come on, tweety, tweety.

478
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,508
Ooh, look at this,
tweety, tweety.

479
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,712
Nice one, come on, come on.

480
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,249
Tweet, tweet.

481
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,052
Come on, little birdies,
tweet, tweet.

482
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,221
Oh. hello,
mrs. smoker.

483
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,423
Hello,
mrs. non-smoker.

484
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,792
What, you been
shopping, then?

485
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,494
No, I've
been shopping.

486
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,129
Oh, what
did you buy?

487
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,430
A piston engine.

488
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,499
What did you
buy that for?

489
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,667
It was a bargain!

490
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,569
How much do
you want for it?

491
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,570
Three quid.

492
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,571
Done.

493
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,540
Right.

494
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,541
Thank you.

495
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,842
How do you
cook it?

496
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,177
You don't cook it.

497
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,811
You can't eat
that raw!

498
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,813
Ooh, never
thought of that.

499
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,517
Oh, day and night, but
this is wondrous strange.

500
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,487
And therefore is
a stranger welcome it.

501
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,257
There are more things
in heaven and earth, horatio

502
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,060
Than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.

503
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,696
But come, the time
is out of joint.

504
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:07,834
O cursed spite, that ever
I was born to set it right.

505
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,304
Let's go together.

506
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,779
Hello, and welcome
to a room in polonius's house.

507
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,814
Well, tonight is
european cup night.

508
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:23,749
One result in already
from munich.

509
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,252
The european cup,
first round, second leg

510
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,857
Bayern munchen 4,397;
wrexham 1.

511
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,960
So wrexham going
through there on aggregate.

512
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,461
Well, now it's time for racing

513
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,164
So let's go straight over
to epsom and brian mcnulty.

514
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,433
Well, over here at epsom,
there are chances aplenty

515
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,435
For those who want to make
a good start in...

516
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,436
Dentistry.

517
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,437
Dentistry.

518
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,505
It's a well-off
suburb

519
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,106
So most people have
their own teeth

520
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,207
And surgeries
are opening

521
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,909
At the rate of four
or five a week.

522
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:53,279
Well, it's only 44 minutes
from the west end on the train

523
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,682
And it's not too built up,
so you can have a nice garden.

524
00:21:56,716 --> 00:22:00,019
And the people of epsom are
a very nice class of person.

525
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,654
Well, here in high street, epsom

526
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,724
There are ample opportunities
for all kinds of redevelopment.

527
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,459
As you can see, behind me now

528
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,629
There are a high level
of low-density consumer units

529
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,898
Still not fully
maximizing site value.

530
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,833
This could be radically improved

531
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,502
By a carefully planned program
of demolition

532
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,672
And of course, most of
the occupants are elderly folks

533
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,074
So they wouldn't put up
much of a fight.

534
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,476
Good afternoon.

535
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,444
Well, in fact, there's still
a few minutes to go

536
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,713
Before the main race
on the card this afternoon

537
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,248
The queen victoria handicap.

538
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:32,185
So let's have a quick word
with the winner of the last race

539
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,587
One of the season's top jockeys,
ronnie mau-mau.

540
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,788
Good afternoon, ronnie.

541
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:36,923
Good afternoon,
brian.

542
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,524
A very fine ride
there, ronnie.

543
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:39,659
Well, a fine
horse, brian

544
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,993
You know, you
can't go wrong.

545
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,895
Do you fancy your
chances for the derby?

546
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:43,896
Oh, very
definitely.

547
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,064
Very definitely,
indeed.

548
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,065
Certainly, brian.

549
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,066
Well, let's just see

550
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,668
If a colleague of yours
agrees with that.

551
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,836
Let's just have
a quick word

552
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,237
With desmond willet--
afternoon, des.

553
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,171
Good afternoon,
brian.

554
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,372
No chance,
no chance at all.

555
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,074
No, no, I think you're wrong
there, des.

556
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,642
I think with the
right kind of going

557
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,577
He's going
to be in there

558
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,578
At the finish, des.

559
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,213
No chance,
there's no chance.

560
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,681
Well, in fact,
I can see

561
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,150
Last season's top jockey,
johnny knowles.

562
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,551
Good afternoon, johnny.

563
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:07,086
Hello, brian.

564
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,689
Uh, could we have a box
for johnny, please?

565
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,690
Thank you.

566
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,924
Hello, brian,
thank you.

567
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:12,925
That's better.

568
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,360
Well, there you are--

569
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,996
Three very well-known faces
from the racing world.

570
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,932
Thanks very much for coming
along this afternoon, lads.

571
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:20,967
Not at all.

572
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,535
And best wishes for the derby.

573
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,870
Thank you, brian.

574
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,171
Thank you very much.

575
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,573
Well, in fact, I hear
they're ready for us now

576
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,976
At the start of the main
race this afternoon

577
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,778
So let's go right away
and join peter at the start.

578
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,447
Well, they're
under starter's orders

579
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,449
For this very valuable
queen victoria handicap.

580
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:39,118
And they're off.

581
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,320
And queen victoria...
a good clean jump off

582
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:42,688
Followed by queen victoria

583
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,423
Queen victoria
and queen victoria.

584
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:46,125
It's queen victoria
from queen victoria

585
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,361
With queen victoria making
the early running on the inside.

586
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,996
And at the back, queen victoria

587
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,797
Already a couple of lengths
behind the leaders.

588
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,933
Queen victoria now moved up
to challenge queen victoria

589
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,168
With queen victoria
losing ground.

590
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,502
Queen victoria tucked in neatly

591
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:57,904
On the stand side
with a clear view.

592
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,205
Queen victoria
still the back marker

593
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,473
As they approach
the halfway mark

594
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,341
But making ground now and
starting to pass queen victoria

595
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,342
With queen victoria

596
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,211
Queen victoria and queen
victoria still well placed

597
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,579
As they approach
the first fence.

598
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,947
And at the first fence,
it's queen victoria

599
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,215
Just ahead of queen victoria

600
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,350
With queen victoria
falling away in third place.

601
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:12,852
And queen victoria
in the rear...

602
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,054
Well, a very exciting race
there at epsom.

603
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,423
And now over to the european cup
at barcelona

604
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,958
Where the latest news is

605
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:22,161
That miguel otana, the burly
real madrid striker was sent off

606
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:24,130
For breaking wind
in the 43rd minute.

607
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,698
He'd already been cautioned

608
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:28,968
For pursing his lips earlier on
in the game and now he's off.

609
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,237
So let's see a playback
of that... brian.

610
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,609
Yes, uh, well, as you can see,
there's otana now.

611
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:41,814
Uh, he gets the, uh,
the through ball from gomez

612
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:45,184
And, uh, he makes no attempt
to play the ball.

613
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,486
He quite deliberately lets off.

614
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,189
And to my mind,
he was within the box

615
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:54,694
And the referee had no option
whatsoever but to send him off.

616
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,394
Jimmy?

617
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:56,262
Good evening.

618
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,563
What do you make of that?

619
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,398
Well, the referees really are

620
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:00,900
Clamping down these days.

621
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,870
Only last week, the belgian
captain was sent off

622
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,339
For having a sony
radio cassette player.

623
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:10,276
And gonerelli, that huge italian
defender, was sent off in turin

624
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:13,613
For having his sitting and
dining room knocked through

625
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,481
To form an open living area.

626
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:15,982
Hamlet?

627
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:16,849
Good evening.

628
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,384
You've got the girl
on the bed.

629
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,752
Her legs are up on
the mantelpiece...

630
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:23,389
Come on, go on, out.

631
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:30,863
Wait, I'm gettin' out of here.

632
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,766
I got away.

633
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,837
Missed.

634
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,839
Missed, missed again.

635
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:40,873
Ugh!

636
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:45,378
Ooh, wait a minute.
wait, wait!

637
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,253
Let four captains
bear hamlet

638
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,155
Like a soldier
to the stage

639
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:58,691
For he was likely,
had he been put on

640
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:02,228
To have proved
most royally...

641
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:11,898
And then...
