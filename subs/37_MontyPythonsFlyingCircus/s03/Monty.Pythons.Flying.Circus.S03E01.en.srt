I, eric, um...

2
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:25,190
And now...

3
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:27,793
It's...

4
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:35,300
Monty python's flying circus.

and felix james bennett

23
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,663
On or about the morning
of the 19th of december, 1972.

24
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:14,666
Have you anything to say
before I pass sentence?

25
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,568
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.

26
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,504
"very sorry"?!

27
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:21,173
Yes, sir. it was a very,
very bad thing to have done

28
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:23,509
And I'm really very ashamed
of myself.

29
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:26,211
I can only say
it won't happen again.

30
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:29,314
To have murdered so many people
in such a short space of time

31
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:30,949
Is really awful

32
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:34,053
And I really am very,
very, very sorry that I did it

33
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,888
And also that I've
taken up so much

34
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,322
Of the court's
valuable time

35
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:38,924
Listening to the sordid details

36
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,693
Of these senseless
killings of mine.

37
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:42,194
I'd particularly like to say

38
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:44,563
A very personal and sincere
sorry to you, m'lord

39
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:47,666
For my appalling behavior
throughout this trial.

40
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,968
I'd also like to say
sorry, too, for the police

41
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:52,004
For putting them
to so much trouble--

42
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:54,873
For the literally hours of
work they've had to put in

43
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:55,974
Collecting evidence

44
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,077
And identifying corpses
and so forth.

45
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,746
You know, I think sometimes
we ought to realize

46
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,915
The difficult
and often dangerous work

47
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:05,951
Involved in tracking down
violent criminals like myself

48
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,853
And I'd just like them to know

49
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,688
That their fine work is at least
appreciated by me.

50
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,723
Oh, no, no.

51
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:12,124
We were only
doing our job.

52
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:13,158
No, no, really.

53
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,827
That's very good
of you to say that

54
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,795
But I know what
you've been through.

55
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,497
Oh, no, no.
we've had worse.

56
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,532
It was plain sailing,
apart from the arrest.

57
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,001
I know and
I'm grateful.

58
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:24,903
I'd like to apologize, too,
to the prosecuting counsel

59
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:27,373
For dragging him in here
morning after morning

60
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:28,640
In such lovely weather.

61
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:30,876
Well, I would have had
to come in anyway.

62
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:34,346
Ah, good. but what
a presentation of a case.

63
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,614
Oh. thank you.

64
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:38,484
Oh, no. it's a privilege
to watch you in action.

65
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:39,685
I never had a chance.

66
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:40,786
Oh, yes, you did.

67
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,588
Oh, not after that
summing up. great.

68
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:43,856
Oh. thank you.

69
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,524
And now I must come
to the jury.

70
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:46,692
What can I say?

71
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:49,094
I've dragged you in here
day after day

72
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,163
Keeping you away
from your homes

73
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,798
Your jobs,
your loved ones

74
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:54,800
Just to hear
the private details

75
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,368
Of my petty atrocities.

76
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,403
No, no.

77
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:58,737
It was very
interesting.

78
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,205
But you could have had
a much nicer case.

79
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,508
Oh, no, no, no.
murder's much more fun.

80
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,176
Yes. and so many of them.

81
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,177
Excellent.

82
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,213
We've had a terrific time.

83
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,015
I'm sorry. I'm very moved.

84
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,583
So, m'lord it only remains

85
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:14,420
For you to pass the most savage
sentence on me

86
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,021
That the law can provide.

87
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,956
Well, uh, not necessarily.

88
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,060
Uh, no, m'lord. the full penalty
of the law is hardly sufficient.

89
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,928
I insist I must be made
an example of.

90
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,229
Well, yes and no.

91
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,298
I mean, society at large...

92
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:27,366
Oh, no, m'lord!

93
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,701
Not with mass murder.

94
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,569
Oh, but in this case,
don't you think...?

95
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:31,804
Yes, yes.

96
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:32,805
Oh, come on, m'lord!

97
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:33,939
You've got to give me life.

98
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:35,641
No!
no. no.

99
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:37,142
Well, ten years at least.
come on.

100
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,610
Ten years?

101
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:39,812
Shame, shame.

102
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:40,879
Well, five then.
be fair.

103
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,880
No, no,
no, no.

104
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,449
I'm giving you three months.

105
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,951
Oh, my god, that's
so embarrassing.

106
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:47,319
I won't hear of it.

107
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,088
Give me six. please.

108
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,889
Well... all right.

109
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,124
Six months.

110
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:52,858
Thank you, m'lord.

111
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:54,159
But suspended.

112
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,428
Oh!

113
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,963
Three cheers
for the defendant!

114
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:58,964
Hip-hip...

115
00:04:58,997 --> 00:04:59,965
Hooray!

116
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:00,999
Hip-hip...

117
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,001
Hooray!

118
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,002
Hip-hip...

119
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:04,103
Hooray!

120
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,671
For he's
a jolly good felon

121
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,606
For he's
a jolly good felon

122
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,044
For he's
a jolly good felon...

123
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:16,582
Which nobody can deny...

124
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,130
It's no good, spider.

125
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,831
You can't escape
that easily.

126
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,935
We're coming in
after you.

127
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,679
This way, davis.

128
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,758
Hmm. we'd best separate.

129
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,293
I'm going down there.

130
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:05,731
You check the
right ventricle.

131
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,903
Any sign of him, davis?

132
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:13,305
Why, no. nothing here.

133
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,406
All right.

134
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,277
We'll check the spleen.

135
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,652
Wait!

136
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,687
Oh, my god! he's down
the back of us!

137
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,055
Quick! we've got
to catch him

138
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:34,259
Before he
reaches the neck.

139
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,001
Oh, no.
too late, davis!

140
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,070
He's got out!

141
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,339
Oh! he's eating!

142
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,242
Run for it!

143
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,290
Ah!

144
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:07,359
Oh, my god!

145
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,994
We're here
in the stomach!

146
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,430
Oh...

147
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,379
This little-known
icelandic saga

148
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,283
Written by an unknown hand
in the late 13th century

149
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:34,553
Has remained undiscovered
until today.

150
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:37,690
Now it comes to your screens
for the first time

151
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,559
Fresh from the leaves
of iceland's history.

152
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:43,562
The terrible njorl's saga...

153
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:44,963
It's not that terrible.

154
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,665
No, I meant
terribly violent.

155
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,800
Oh, yeah.

156
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,235
Yeah.

157
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,908
Erik njorl, son of frothgar

158
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:58,444
Leaves his home to seek
hangar the elder

159
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,146
At the house
of thorvald nlodvisson

160
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,748
The son of gudleif

161
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:07,319
Half-brother of thorgier,
the priest of ljosa water

162
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,489
Who took to wife thurunn,
the mother of thorkel braggart

163
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:12,558
The slayer of gudmund
the powerful

164
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:16,562
Who knew howal, son of geernon,
son of erik from vadalesc

165
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,098
Son arval gristlebeard,
son of harken

166
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,567
Who killed bjortguaard
in sochnadale in norway

167
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,869
Over gudreed, daughter
of thorkel long

168
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,371
The son of kettle-trout

169
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,439
The half-son
of harviyoun half-troll

170
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,241
Father of ingbare the brave

171
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,909
Who wed isenbert
of gottenberg

172
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,845
The daughter of hangbard
the fierce...

173
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:35,214
We apologize for an error
in the saga.

174
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:38,350
Evidently thorgier,
the priest of ljosa water

175
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,253
Who took to wife thurunn,
the mother of thorkel braggart

176
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:43,188
The slayer
of gudmund the powerful

177
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,158
Who knew howal, son of geernon,
son of erik from vadalesc...

178
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:49,128
Well, I'm afraid we're having
a little trouble

179
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,663
Getting this very exciting
icelandic saga started.

180
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,599
If any of you at home
have any ideas

181
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:56,001
About how to get this
exciting saga started again

182
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,670
Here's the address to write to:

183
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,304
Help the exciting
icelandic saga

184
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:03,809
18-b macnorten buildings, oban.

185
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,384
Hello, um, well

186
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,820
I was the third voice
you heard just now.

187
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,189
Uh, I'm sorry
about that terrible mess.

188
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,524
It wasn't all that terrible.

189
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,826
No, no, I meant terrible
in the sense of unfortunate.

190
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:21,460
Oh.

191
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:22,594
Anyway, um, our plea

192
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,430
For assistance has been answered

193
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,799
By the north malden
icelandic saga society

194
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,135
Who've given us some very useful
information about the saga

195
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,504
And so we carry on now
with "njorl's saga"

196
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,340
With our thanks going once again

197
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,775
To the north malden
icelandic saga society.

198
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,144
Erik njorl, son of frothgar

199
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:43,816
Rode off
into the desolate plain.

200
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,955
Day and night he rode

201
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:52,157
Looking neither
to right nor left

202
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,526
Stopping neither
for food nor rest.

203
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,996
12 days and nights he rode,
through rain and storm

204
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,598
Through wind and snow

205
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:01,867
Beyond the enchanted waterfall

206
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,469
Through the elfin glades

207
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,573
Until he reached his goal.

208
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,176
He had found
the rich and pleasant land

209
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,511
Beyond the mountains...

210
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:14,179
The land where golden streams

211
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,316
Sang their way
through fresh, green meadows

212
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,151
Where there were
halls and palaces

213
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:20,552
An excellent swimming pool

214
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,187
And one of the most attractive

215
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,455
Bonus incentive schemes

216
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,158
For industrial development
in the city.

217
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,160
Only 15 miles from excellent

218
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:29,895
Thames-side docking facilities

219
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:32,364
And within easy reach
of the proposed m25.

220
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,334
Here it was that eric njorl,
son of frothgar

221
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,568
Met the mayor

222
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,905
Mr. arthur huddinut,
a local solicitor.

223
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:42,241
Welcome to north malden.

224
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,243
Yes, everyone is welcome
to north malden

225
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,812
But none more so than the
businessmen and investors

226
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,614
Who shape our society
of the future.

227
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,517
Here at north malden...

228
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,386
And we apologize to viewers
of njorl's saga

229
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,621
Who may be confused

230
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,690
By so many references
to north malden.

231
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,459
And after a frank exchange
of views, we have agreed

232
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,928
To carry on showing
this version supplied to us

233
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,130
By the north malden
icelandic saga society

234
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,132
On the undertaking
that future scenes

235
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,400
Will adhere more closely

236
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:13,472
To the spirit
of 12th century iceland.

237
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:16,709
With moist eyes,
eric leaves this happy land

238
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,545
To return to the harsh
uneconomic realities

239
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,715
Of life in the land
of ljosa waters.

240
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,883
On his way,
eric rested a while

241
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,620
In the land of bjornsstrand--
the land of dark forces

242
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,424
Where gildor was king.

243
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,529
These were the dukes
of the land of bjornsstrand.

244
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,032
Proud warriors
who bore on their chests

245
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:44,636
The letters
of their dread name.

246
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,940
Uh, hello?

247
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,642
Is that the north malden
icelandic society?

248
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,710
Yes, that's right.

249
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,745
It's about this saga.

250
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,979
Oh, yes, the
icelandic saga.

251
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:54,980
Yes.
good, isn't it?

252
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,248
Well, uh,
well, I don't know

253
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:58,117
but, I mean, you promised us
that you would stick

254
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,451
to the spirit
of the original text.

255
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,853
Yes, that's right.

256
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,955
Well, I mean, a lot of these
things that are happening--

257
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,690
I mean, well, they just
don't quite ring true.

258
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,191
Well, it's a new
interpretation, really.

259
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,459
Well, we didn't want
a new int...

260
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,861
I mean, we wanted
the proper thing.

261
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,462
I mean, just look
what's happening now.

262
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,697
Banners were a
very important part

263
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,798
of icelandic
lore, mr. mills.

264
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,099
Well, then, I mean,
no, no, I'm sorry.

265
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,768
I just can't accept that.
it's gone too far.

266
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,037
I'm very sorry, but we'll have
to terminate the agreement.

267
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,204
Oh!

268
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,839
Well, you're just trying
to cash in

269
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,608
on the bbc's
exciting icelandic saga.

270
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,876
That's business,
mr. mills.

271
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,044
Well, that's as may be

272
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,712
but it's not the way
the bbc works.

273
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,514
Well, I'm very sorry
you feel that way

274
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,182
but, uh, you know,
if you ever want

275
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:33,819
to come to malden...

276
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,058
8:00 is a peak viewing hour

277
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,760
So naturally, we tend to stick
to our comedy output.

278
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,429
Unless, of course,
there's sport

279
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,497
Because, of course,
we know this is popular

280
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,566
And popularity
is what television is about.

281
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,168
Quite frankly,
I'm sick and tired

282
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,570
Of people accusing us
of being ratings conscious.

283
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:52,671
"ratings conscious"?

284
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,540
Transmitting bland garbage,
m'lord.

285
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,708
Mmm. thank you.

286
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,942
Now I'm really cheesed off!

287
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,944
I mean, it's not
your highbrow, bleeding plays

288
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,446
That pull in the viewers,
you know.

289
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,347
Thank you.

290
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,581
I mean, joe public

291
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,116
Doesn't want to sit down
and watch three hours

292
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,184
Of documentaries every evening.

293
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,518
Thank you.
he wants to sit down

294
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,786
And he wants to be entertained!

295
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,954
He doesn't want a load of...

296
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:11,657
No, really!
I'm absolutely fed up with it!

297
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,860
I really am!
case dismissed.

298
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:16,362
"case dismissed," m'lord?

299
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,263
All right-- five years.

300
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,965
Thank you, m'lord.

301
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:21,567
Call the next
case, please.

302
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,102
Call erik njorl

303
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,972
Son of frothgar,
brother of hangnor...

304
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,607
Call erik njorl

305
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,745
Son of frothgar,
brother of hangnor...

306
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,680
Call erik njorl

307
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:39,752
Son of frothgar,
brother of hangnor...

308
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:59,605
...the slayer of
gudmund's son...

309
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,008
You are erik njorl,
son of frothgar...

310
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,410
Get on with it.

311
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,478
Would you raise
your right hand?

312
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,348
He obviously can't
raise his right hand

313
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,183
You silly usher person.

314
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:15,354
Can you raise your right leg,
mr. njorl?

315
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:21,160
Can you raise any part
of your body, mr. njorl?

316
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,297
I see. well,
we'll skip that.

317
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,699
Well, just
take the book

318
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,334
In your right
hand, mr. njorl

319
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,636
Without raising any
part of your body.

320
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,737
Oh.

321
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,905
What is it now

322
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,907
You persistently silly usher?

323
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,742
He can't hold the bible, m'lord.

324
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,943
Oh, screw the bible!

325
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,245
Let's get on
with this bleeding trial!

326
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,314
I've got a gay lib meeting
at 6:00.

327
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,851
Superintendent lufthansa,
will you please read the charge?

328
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,687
Is a charge strictly necessary,
m'lord?

329
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,023
The press is here.

330
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,191
Oh! oh, sorry.

331
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,392
Um...

332
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,827
Right! here we go.

333
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,662
You are hereby charged:

334
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,398
One, that you did,
on or about 1126

335
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,301
Conspire to publicize a
london borough

336
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,503
In the course
of a bbc saga;

337
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,738
Two, that you were

338
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,340
Willfully and persistently
a foreigner;

339
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,843
Three, that you conspired
to do things

340
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,012
Not normally
considered illegal;

341
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,014
Four, that you were
caught in possession

342
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,382
Of an offensive weapon

343
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,084
Viz, the big, brown table
down at the police station.

344
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,920
The big, brown table
down at the police station?

345
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,523
It's the best we
could find, m'lord.

346
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,525
And five: all
together now!

347
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,927
Assaulting a police officer!

348
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,062
Thank you!

349
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,400
Call police constable pan-am.

350
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,839
Into the
witness box

351
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,676
Constable!

352
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,114
There'll be plenty of
time for that later on.

353
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,283
Now...

354
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,385
You are police
constable pan-am?

355
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,855
No! I deny that
to the last breath in my body!

356
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,624
Oh! sorry. yes.

357
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:02,027
Police constable, do you recognize
the defendant?

358
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,897
No! never seen him
before in my life!

359
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,031
Oh! yes! yes!

360
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,099
He's the one!

361
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,167
He done it!

362
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,635
I'd recognize
him anywhere.

363
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,869
Sorry, super.

364
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,038
Constable, will you please tell
the court

365
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,740
In your own words
what happened.

366
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,343
Oh, yes!

367
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,879
I was proceeding
in a northerly direction

368
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,748
Up alitalia street...

369
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,084
When I saw the deceased...

370
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,020
Standing at an
upstairs window

371
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,723
Baring her bosom
at the general public.

372
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,458
She then took off her...

373
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,226
Wait a tick!

374
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,229
Wrong story.

375
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,164
Oh, yes!

376
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,434
There were three nuns
in a railway compartment

377
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,902
And the ticket in...

378
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,839
No? anyway, I clearly
saw the deceased...

379
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:47,706
The defendant!

380
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,041
Defendant! sorry.

381
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,075
Sorry, super.

382
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,144
I clearly saw
the defendant

383
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,446
Doing whatever
he's accused of

384
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,647
Uh, red-handed.

385
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,318
When kicked, uh,
cautioned, he said...

386
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,488
"it's a fair...
cop, I done it all.

387
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,591
Right. no... doubt
about... that."

388
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,926
Then, bound as he
was to the chair

389
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,294
He assaulted myself

390
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,130
And three other
constables

391
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,298
While bouncing
around the cell.

392
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,968
The end.

393
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,137
Thank you,
thank you.

394
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,805
And for my next
piece of evidence...

395
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,107
I-i think you'd better
leave it there, constable.

396
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,475
Excellent evidence,
constable.

397
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:27,112
Thank you
very much.

398
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:32,151
Now, mr. njorl, will you
tell the court, please

399
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:37,056
Where were you on
the night of 1126?

400
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,892
Move any part of your body

401
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:45,197
If you were north of a line
from the humber to the mersey.

402
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,199
Is he in there,
do you think?

403
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,967
Hello, hello, defendant?

404
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,169
Are you there?

405
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,670
Coo-ee!

406
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,905
Defendant?

407
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,374
I think we better go
and have a look, maurice.

408
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,878
Don't call me maurice
in court!

409
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,048
Are you in there?

410
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,884
Mr. njorl?

411
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,555
This way, davis.

412
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,491
He's not getting away
this time.

413
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,427
We'll go down there and
through the left lung.

414
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:19,298
It was around
the left lung that...

415
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:24,003
Once again,
I've proved too clever for...

416
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,372
And now,
the stock market report

417
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,673
By exchange telegraph.

418
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,908
Trading was crisp
at the start of the day

419
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,011
With some brisk business
on the floor.

420
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,613
Rubber hardened,
and string remained confident.

421
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,348
Little bits of tin consolidated

422
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,650
Although biscuits sank
after an early gain

423
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,386
And stools remained anonymous.

424
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,621
Armpits rallied well
after a poor start.

425
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,124
Nipples rose dramatically
during the morning

426
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,959
But had declined
by mid-afternoon

427
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,728
While teeth clenched,
and buttocks remained firm.

428
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,598
Small, dark, furry things
increased severely on the floor

429
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,566
Whilst rude jellies
wobbled up and down

430
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,201
And bounced
against rising thighs

431
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,371
Which had spread to all parts
of the country by mid-afternoon.

432
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,507
After lunch,
naughty things dipped sharply

433
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,043
Forcing giblets upwards
with the nicky nacky noo.

434
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,779
Ting tang tong rankled dithely,
little tipples pooped

435
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,180
And poppy things went pong!

436
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,314
Gibble gabble gobble

437
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,718
Went the rickety rackety roo,
as the...

438
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:17,556
Eh, that'll teach you
to be normal.

439
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,799
Hmm?

440
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,045
Hmm.

441
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,348
Hello, mrs. premise.

442
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,650
Hello, mrs. conclusion.

443
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,651
Busy day?

444
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,487
Busy? I just spent
four hours

445
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,089
Burying the cat.

446
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,558
Four hours to
bury a cat?

447
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,360
Yes. he wouldn't
keep still.

448
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,895
Wriggling about,
howling its head off.

449
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,263
Oh, it wasn't
dead then?

450
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,264
Well, no, no.

451
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,866
But it's not at all
a well cat.

452
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,702
So as we were going away
for a fortnight's holiday

453
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,538
I thought I better bury it
just to be on the safe side.

454
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,940
Quite right.

455
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,276
You don't want to come back
from sorrento to a dead cat.

456
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,078
It would be so anticlimactic.

457
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,146
Yes, kill it now.

458
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,280
That's what I say.

459
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,081
Yes.

460
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,082
We're going to have

461
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,584
To have our budgie put down.

462
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,786
Really? is he very old?

463
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,688
No. we just don't like it.

464
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,189
We're going
to take it

465
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,591
To the vet tomorrow.

466
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,627
Tell me, how do they
put budgies down then?

467
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,362
Well, it's funny
you should ask that

468
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,464
But I've just been
reading a great big book

469
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,066
About how to put
your budgie down

470
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,302
And apparently, you can either
hit them with a book

471
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,405
Or you can shoot
them just there

472
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,773
Just above the beak.

473
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,874
Just there?
yes.

474
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,075
Well, well, well.

475
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,511
Of course, mrs. essence
flushed hers

476
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,512
Down the loo.

477
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,447
Oh, no, you
shouldn't do that.

478
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,948
No, that's dangerous.

479
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,885
Yes, they breed
in the sewers

480
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,654
And eventually you get
evil-smelling flocks

481
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,122
Of huge,
soiled budgies

482
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,258
Flying out of
people's lavatories

483
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,460
Infringing their
personal freedom.

484
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,129
Good morning,
mrs. cut-out.

485
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,432
Morning, mrs. cut-out.

486
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,900
It's a funny thing,
freedom.

487
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,001
I mean

488
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,502
How can any of us
be really free

489
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,471
When we still have
personal possessions?

490
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:13,605
You can't. you can't.

491
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,574
I mean, how can I go off
and join frelimo

492
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,309
When I've got nine
more installments

493
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,377
To pay on the fridge?

494
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,511
No, you can't. you can't.

495
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,347
Well, this, of course,
is the whole crux

496
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,215
Of jean-paul sartre's
roads to freedom.

497
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,318
No, it bloody isn't.

498
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,187
The nub of that is
his characters stand

499
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,622
For all of us in their desire
to avoid action.

500
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,458
Mind you, the man
at the off-license

501
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,826
Says it's an
everyday story

502
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,027
Of french
country folk.

503
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,295
What do they know?
nothing.

504
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,665
60 new pence
for a bottle of maltese claret.

505
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,801
I personally think that--
oh, beg your pardon--

506
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,304
I personally think that
jean-paul's masterwork

507
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,806
Is an allegory of man's
search for commitment.

508
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,241
No, it isn't.
yes, it is.

509
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,342
'tisn't!
'tis!

510
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,410
No, it isn't!

511
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,479
All right. we can
soon settle this.

512
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,480
We'll ask him.

513
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,647
Do you know him?
yes.

514
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,082
We met on holiday
last year.

515
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,217
In ibiza?

516
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,419
Yes. he was staying
there with his wife

517
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,754
And mr. and mrs. genet.

518
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,024
Oh, I did get on well
with madam s.

519
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,792
We were like that.

520
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,193
What was jean-paul like?

521
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,762
Well, you know,
a bit moody.

522
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,796
Yes.
yes.

523
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,898
He didn't join
in the fun much.

524
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,433
Just sat there
thinking.

525
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,036
Still, mr. rotter
caught him a few times

526
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,604
With a whoopee cushion.

527
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,639
Le captitalisme
et la bourgeoisie

528
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,476
Ils sont la meme chose...

529
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,178
Oh, we did laugh.

530
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,312
Oh, dear.

531
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,048
Well, we'll give
him a tinkle then.

532
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,049
Yes, all right.

533
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,417
She said they were
in the book.

534
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,020
Where's the paris
telephone directory?

535
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,855
It's on the dryer.

536
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,691
No, no.
that's budapest.

537
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,925
Oh, here we are.

538
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,627
Sartre, sartre...

539
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,630
It's 621036.

540
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,332
Oh, thank you, mrs. farley.

541
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,035
Hello? paris 621036, please.

542
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,905
And make it snappy, buster.

543
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:58,143
Bthe girl from ipanema
goes walking

544
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,947
Tall and young and tan...

545
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,050
Hello. hello, mrs. sartre.

546
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,652
It's beulagh premise here.

547
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,653
Oh, pardon.

548
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,022
C'est beulagh premise ici.

549
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,124
Oui, oui, dans ibiza.

550
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,492
Oui. we met...

551
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:17,162
Nous nous recontrons
au hotel miramar.

552
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:20,232
Oui, a la barbeque,
c'est vrai.

553
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:24,670
Est-ce que jean
est chez vouz?

554
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,673
Oh, merde.

555
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,478
When will he be free?

556
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,479
Oh, pardon.

557
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:37,282
Quand sera t'il libre?

558
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,787
She says he's spent
the last 60 years

559
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,956
Trying to work
that one out.

560
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,026
Oh, trez amusant,
madame s.

561
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,128
Oui, absolument.

562
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,829
A bientot.

563
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:54,433
Well, he's out distributing
pamphlets to the masses

564
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,101
But he'll be in
at 6:00.

565
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,103
Oh, well, I'll
ring b.e.a. then.

566
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,407
Oh, look! paris!

567
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,242
That's not paris.

568
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,044
Jean-paul wouldn't

569
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,412
Live here.

570
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,215
It's a right
old dump.

571
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,320
But this is
where they were wrong.

572
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:19,525
For this was no old dump,
but a town with a future

573
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,462
An urban eldorado where the
businessman of today can enjoy

574
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:27,299
The facilities of tomorrow
in the comfort of yesterday.

575
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,436
Provided by a go-getting,
go-ahead council

576
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,272
Who know just how loud
money can talk.

577
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,273
Interest rates...

578
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,808
Well, it's none
of my business

579
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,142
But we had
the same trouble

580
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,777
With one
of our icelandic sagas.

581
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,112
These people are terribly keen

582
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,780
But they do rather
tend to take over.

583
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,717
I think I'd stick to caribbean
islands if I were you.

584
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,218
Fine.

585
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,322
And now, back to the saga.

586
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,939
Here-- this is
not paris.

587
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,007
This is iceland.

588
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,909
Oh... well.

589
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,079
Paris must be
over there then.

590
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,781
Oh.

591
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:20,786
The girl from ipanema
goes walking...

592
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,039
Ooh, here we are.

593
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,173
Number 25.

594
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,008
Oh, yes.
flat one

595
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,912
Yves montand, flat three,
jacques cousteau

596
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,082
Flat four, jean genet
and friend...

597
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,350
Ooh, yes.

598
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,352
Flat five,
maurice laroux.

599
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,353
Who's he?

600
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,654
Never heard of him.

601
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,189
Flat six, marcel marceau

602
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,358
Walking against the wind,
limited.

603
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,993
Flat seven, indira gandhi.

604
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,661
She gets about
a bit, doesn't she?

605
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:03,896
Yes.
yes.

606
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:09,601
Flat eight, jean-paul
and betty-muriel sartre.

607
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,303
Oui?

608
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,672
C'est nous,
betty-muriel.

609
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,909
Excusez que nous
sommes en retard.

610
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,110
Entrez.

611
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:21,013
Oui, merci.

612
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,820
...mais je suis forte...

613
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:32,791
Oh, rubbish.

614
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,593
Bonjour.

615
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,695
Parlez vouz anglais?

616
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,697
Oh, yes. good day.

617
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,165
Hello, love.

618
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,300
How are you?

619
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,836
This is mrs. conclusion
from number 46.

620
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,571
Oh, nice to
meet you, dear.

621
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,572
Hello.

622
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,740
How's the old
man been?

623
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,841
Oh, don't ask.

624
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:51,510
He's in one
of his bleeding moods.

625
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,413
The bourgeoisie this,
it's the bourgeoisie that.

626
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,783
He's like a little child
sometimes.

627
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,219
I was only telling the raniers
the other day--

628
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,254
Of course,
he's always rude to them

629
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,722
Only classy friends we got--

630
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:06,125
I was saying,
"solidarity with the masses"

631
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,861
I said, "pie in the sky."

632
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,563
Ooh, you're not a marxist,
are you, mrs. conclusion?

633
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,265
No, I'm a revisionist.

634
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,266
Oh, good.

635
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,801
I mean, look at this place!

636
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,002
I'm at my wits' end--

637
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,871
Revolutionary leaflets
everywhere.

638
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:22,908
One of these days,
I'll revolutionary leaflets him.

639
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,510
If it wasn't for the goat

640
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:27,212
You couldn't get in here
for propaganda.

641
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,213
Well, very well.

642
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,214
Can we, uh, pop in

643
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,482
And have a word
with him?

644
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,483
Yes, come along.

645
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,484
Thank you.

646
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,086
But be careful.
he's had a few.

647
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,287
Oh.

648
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,823
Mind you, he's good as
gold in the morning--

649
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,425
I've got to
hand it to him--

650
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,394
But come lunchtime, it's
a bottle of vin ordinaire.

651
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,596
Six glasses and he's
ready to agitate.

652
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,365
Uh, coo-ee!

653
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,068
Jean-paul?

654
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,069
Jean-paul?

655
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,136
Ah, it's only us.

656
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,005
Oh, pardon,
c'est meme nous.

657
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,273
Oui.

658
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,842
Jean-paul, your famous
trilogy, rues a liberte

659
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,611
Is it an allegory of man's
search for commitment?

660
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,612
Oui.

661
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:01,613
Told you so.

662
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:04,516
Oh, coitus.

663
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,865
Today, we look
at a vanishing race

664
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,901
A problem people
who are fast disappearing

665
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,970
Off the face of the earth...

666
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:29,475
A race who one might say
are losing a winning battle.

667
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,810
They live
in a sunshine paradise

668
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:35,581
A caribbean dream
where only reality is missing...

669
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:38,150
For this is whicker island...

670
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:42,621
An island inhabited entirely
by ex-international interviewers

671
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,157
In pursuit
of the impossible dream.

672
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,993
The whole problem
of whicker island

673
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,828
Is here in a nutshell.

674
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,830
There are
just too many whickers.

675
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,165
The light-weight suits...

676
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:56,001
The old school ties...

677
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:59,004
The practiced voice
of the seasoned campaigner...

678
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,674
Cannot hide
the basic tragedy here.

679
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,076
There just aren't
enough rich people left

680
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,277
To interview.

681
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,980
You can't teach
an old dog new tricks

682
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,748
And so you find them...

683
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,885
Sitting beside
elegant swimming pools...

684
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,586
Sipping martinis...

685
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,157
And waiting
for the inevitable interview.

686
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,995
I talked to the island's
only white man, father pierre.

687
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,130
Father pierre, why
did you stay on

688
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:26,932
In this colonial
campari-land

689
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,068
Where the clink
of glasses mingles

690
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,537
With the murmur of
a million mosquitoes

691
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,573
Where waterfalls of whisky
wash away the worries

692
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,141
Of a world-weary whicker

693
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:39,378
Where gin and tonics jingle
in a gyroscopic jubilee

694
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,380
Of something
beginning with "j"?

695
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:44,049
Father pierre, why
did you stay on here?

696
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,050
Well...

697
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,186
Mainly for the interviews.

698
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,688
Well, there you have it.

699
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,724
A crumbling...

700
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:53,726
Empire in the sun-drenched...

701
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,729
Caribbean, where the cliches
sparkle on the waters...

702
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,731
Like the music of repeat fees...

703
00:29:58,764 --> 00:29:59,732
And so...

704
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:00,833
From whicker island...

705
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:01,433
It's...

706
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,001
Fare...

707
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:02,735
Well, and...

708
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:03,569
Bon...

709
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:04,203
Voy...

710
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,572
Age.
