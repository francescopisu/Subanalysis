1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,170
In the modern britain,
united under a great leader

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,773
It's the housewives of britain
who are getting things moving.

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,142
Here, a coach load of
lovely ladies are on their way

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,978
To speed up production
in a car factory.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,380
And here we are, boys,
it's the no-hurry brigade

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,815
Hanging around
for endless overtime.

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,888
And just watch these gallant
girls go into action.

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,857
Not working fast enough?

9
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:27,361
Well, there's
an answer for that.

10
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,963
Yes, this is certainly
the way to speed up production.

11
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,533
This is the recipe for
increased productivity

12
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,501
To meet the threat
of those nasty foreigners

13
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,103
When britain takes
her natural place

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,938
At the head
of the british common market.

15
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:43,343
And how's this for a way
to beat strikers?

16
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,813
Those spotty continental boys

17
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,183
Will soon have to look out
for mrs. britain.

18
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,884
And talking of windmills

19
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:55,088
These girls aren't afraid to
tilt at the permissive society.

20
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,291
Business is booming
in the so-called arts

21
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:02,196
But two can play
at that game, chum.

22
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,365
And it's not just the modern
so-called plastic arts

23
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,100
That get the clean-up treatment.

24
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,168
Desdemona...

25
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,438
Come on, dears!

26
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,908
And those continentals
had better watch out

27
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,810
For their dirty
foreign literature.

28
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:20,047
Jean-paul sartre and jean genet
won't know what's hit them.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,382
Never mind the foulness
of their language--

30
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,753
Come '73, they'll all
have to write in british.

31
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:30,057
You can keep your fastidious continental
bidets, mrs. foreigner--

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,459
Mrs. britain knows
how to keep her feet clean.

33
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,161
But she'll battle
like bingo, boys

34
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,897
When it comes to keeping
the tv screen clean.

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,933
Better watch out for
those nasty continental shows

36
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,301
On the sneaky second channel.

37
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,736
But apart from attacking

38
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,938
That prurient hotbed
of left-wing continentalism

39
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,106
At shepherds bush

40
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,374
What else do these
ordinary mums think?

41
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,442
Do they accept hegelianism?

42
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,877
No!

43
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,045
Do they prefer leibnitz
to wittgenstein?

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,947
No! no!

45
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,350
And where do they stand
on young people?

46
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,452
Just here, dear.

47
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,487
Their power is growing daily

48
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,689
And when these girls
roll their sleeves up

49
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,824
It's arms all the way.

50
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,193
Yes, this is the way to fight

51
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:11,198
The constant war
against pornography.

52
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,043
And now...

53
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,646
It's...

54
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:32,119
Monty python's flying circus.

55
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,266
Doctor!

56
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,236
Doctor!

57
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,905
Doctor!

58
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,508
Doctor!

59
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,879
Doctor!

60
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,115
Doctor!

61
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,417
Doctor!

62
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,020
Doctor!

63
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,388
Doctor!

64
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,025
Where is the doctor?

65
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,533
Hello!

66
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:56,937
Are you the brain specialist?

67
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,978
Hello!

68
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:10,651
Are you the brain specialist?

69
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,321
No!

70
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,324
No, I am not
the brain specialist.

71
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,726
No, no, I am not!

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,796
Yes! yes, I am!

73
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,033
My brain hurts!

74
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:32,973
Well, let's take a look
at it, mr. gumby.

75
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,074
No, no, no...

76
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,809
My brain in my head.

77
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,078
Oh!

78
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,786
It'll have to come out.

79
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,355
Out... of my head?

80
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,358
Yes! all the bits of it.

81
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,861
Nurse!

82
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,597
Nurse!

83
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,800
Nurse!

84
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,403
Nurse!

85
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,944
Nurse, take mr. gumby
to a... brain surgeon.

86
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,913
Yes, doctor.

87
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,181
Where's the lancet?

88
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,250
He's brilliant, you know.

89
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:20,287
Where's the bloody lancet?

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,924
My brain hurts, too.

91
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,467
Gloves...

92
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,336
Glasses...

93
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,841
Moustache...

94
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,312
Handkerchief...

95
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,448
I'm going to operate!

96
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,385
Operate, operate...

97
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,187
Get bits
of brain!

98
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,657
Get bits of brain!

99
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,393
Hello!

100
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,394
Oh!

101
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,395
Oh!

102
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,631
We forgot
the anesthetic!

103
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,166
Anesthetic!

104
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,601
Anesthetic!

105
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,504
Anesthetic!

106
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,007
Anesthetic!

107
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:22,883
I've come to
anesthetize you!

108
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,226
Good evening.

109
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,928
Tonight I'd like to talk to you
about... oh, uh...

110
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,530
Excuse me, this is all wrong.

111
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,433
One moment.

112
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,945
Hello, again.

113
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,280
As I was saying...

114
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,482
Ah, oh, wait, this is
still not quite right.

115
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,985
Sorry.

116
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:10,330
No, no, sorry, no, not right.

117
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:27,414
Ah, this is better.

118
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,217
Now, tonight I want to look
at the meaning of life...

119
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,453
Oh! ow! oh! oh!

120
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,394
No, no, no...

121
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,966
No, no, please!

122
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,987
Hmm, ah, well...

123
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,056
This'll do nicely.

124
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,157
Good evening.

125
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,558
Tonight I'd like to talk to you

126
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,693
About the meaning of life

127
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,362
In the context of...

128
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,532
The 9:00 news,
which was to have followed

129
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,601
has been canceled tonight

130
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,636
so we can bring you
the quarterfinals

131
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,805
of the all-essex
badminton championship.

132
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,841
Your commentator as usual
is edna o'brien.

133
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,476
Hullo, fans.

134
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,745
Begorra, an' to be sure
there's some fine badminton

135
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,247
down there in essex
this afternoon.

136
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,250
We really...

137
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,296
Hmm.

138
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,464
George?

139
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,298
Yes, gladys?

140
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,933
There's a man here
with a moustache.

141
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,535
I already got one.

142
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,436
All right, all
right, all right

143
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,938
What's he want,
then?

144
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,173
He says, do we want

145
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,741
A documentary
on mollusks?

146
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,742
Mollusks?!

147
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,743
Yes!

148
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,211
What's he mean,
"mollusks"?

149
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,846
Mollusks!

150
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,415
Gastropods, lamellibranchs,
cephalopods!

151
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,583
Oh, mollusks.

152
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,951
I thought
you said "bacon."

153
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,420
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

154
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,788
What's he
charge, then?

155
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,056
It's free.

156
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,991
Oh! where does he
want us to sit?

157
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,994
He says yes!

158
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,604
Good evening.

159
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,339
Tonight, mollusks.

160
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:36,310
The mollusk is a soft-bodied,
unsegmented invertebrate animal

161
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,579
Usually protected
by a large shell.

162
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:42,382
One of the most numerous
groups of invertebrates

163
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,118
It is exceeded
in number of species

164
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,654
Only by the arthropods, viz...

165
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,857
Not very
interesting, is it?

166
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,091
What?

167
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,593
I was talking to him.

168
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:53,927
Oh.

169
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:56,964
Anyway, the typical mollusk,
viz a snail...

170
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,833
Consists of a prominent
muscular portion--

171
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,870
The head-foot--
a visceral mass and a shell

172
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:06,240
Which is secreted by
the free edge of the mantle.

173
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,407
Dreadful, isn't it?

174
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,609
What?

175
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,244
I was talking to him!

176
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,813
Oh... well, anyway...

177
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,282
In some mollusks, however,
viz, slugs

178
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,484
The shell is absent
or rudimentary.

179
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:18,919
Switch him off.

180
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,954
Whereas in others,
viz cephalopods

181
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,923
The head-foot
is greatly modified

182
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,058
And forms tentacles,
viz the squid.

183
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,059
What are
you doing?

184
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,094
Switching you off.

185
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,095
Don't you
like it?

186
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,096
Oh, it's dreadful.

187
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,097
Embarrassing.

188
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,098
Is it?

189
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,266
Yes, it's perfectly awful.

190
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,467
Disgraceful!

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,435
I don't know how they got
the nerve to put it on.

192
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,770
It's so boring.

193
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,839
Well, it's not much of a
subject, is it?

194
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,940
Be fair.

195
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,341
What do you think,
george?

196
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,577
Give him another 20 seconds.

197
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,645
All right.

198
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,280
Anyway, the majority
of mollusks

199
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,881
Are included
in three large groups:

200
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,416
The gastropods,
the lamellibranchs

201
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,584
And the cephalopods.

202
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,718
We know that!

203
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,520
However, what is
more interesting

204
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,155
Is the, uh...
mollusk's, uh...

205
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,156
Sex life.

206
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,425
Oh!

207
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,395
Yes, the mollusk is a randy
little fellow

208
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,430
Whose primitive brain
scarcely strays

209
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,566
From the subject
of you-know-what.

210
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,567
Disgusting!

211
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,668
Ought not
to be allowed.

212
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,503
The randiest of the gastropods

213
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,871
Is the limpet.

214
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,673
This hot-blooded little beast

215
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,475
With its tentlike shell
is always on the job.

216
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,110
Its extramarital
activities

217
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,545
Are something startling.

218
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,714
Frankly, I don't know
how the female limpet

219
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,816
Finds the time
to adhere to the rock face.

220
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,017
How am I doing?

221
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,152
Disgusting.

222
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,220
But more interesting.

223
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,621
Oh, yes.

224
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,557
Another loose-living gastropod
is the periwinkle.

225
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,459
This shameless little libertine

226
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,162
With its characteristic
ventral locomotion...

227
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,763
Is not the marrying kind--

228
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,432
"anywhere, anytime"
is its motto.

229
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,267
Up with the shell
and they're at it.

230
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,169
What about the lamellibranchs?

231
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,403
I'm coming to them.

232
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,373
The great scallop...

233
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,509
This tatty, scrofulous
old rapist

234
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:52,279
Is second in depravity
only to the common clam.

235
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,314
This latter is a right whore!

236
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,782
A harlot,
a trollop

237
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:59,219
A cynical, bed-hopping,
firm-breasted

238
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,455
Rabelaisian
bit of seafood

239
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,391
That makes fanny hill
look like a dead pope.

240
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,327
And finally among the
lamellibranch bivalves

241
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:12,399
That most depraved of the whole
subspecies, the whelk.

242
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:17,004
The whelk is nothing but
a homosexual of the worst kind.

243
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,973
This gay boy
of the gastropods

244
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:23,177
This queer crustacean,
this mincing mollusk

245
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,414
This screaming, prancing,
limp-wristed queen of the deep

246
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,116
Makes me sick.

247
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,951
Have you got one?

248
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:31,985
Here!

249
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,688
Let's kill it.

250
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,956
Disgusting!

251
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,625
There,
that'll teach it.

252
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,328
Well, thank you for
a very interesting program.

253
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,729
Oh, not at all,
thank you.

254
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,031
Yes, that was
very nice.

255
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,199
Thank you.

256
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,200
Oh, thank you.

257
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,401
And good night.

258
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,902
And now a word
from the man in the...

259
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,704
Street.

260
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:51,505
Anyway...

261
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,240
Ooo...

262
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:57,277
Coochy, coochy, coochy...

263
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,680
...dear little fellow.

264
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:04,184
Look at the twinkle in his eye.

265
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,857
Oh, he's a little dear,
isn't he?

266
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,093
You shouldn't let him
suck on a dummy, my dear.

267
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,294
Oh, my god... no!

268
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:17,531
Don't touch it!

269
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,126
The minister for not
listening to people

270
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,595
Toured batley today
to investigate allegations

271
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,198
Of victimization in home-loan
improvement grants

272
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,166
Made last week
by the shadow-minister

273
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,935
For judging people
at first sight

274
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,437
To be marginally worse
than they actually are.

275
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:00,107
At the home office, the minister
for inserting himself

276
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,176
In between chairs and walls
in men's clubs

277
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,011
Was at his desk
after a short illness.

278
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,613
He spent the morning
dealing with the irish situation

279
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:08,615
And later in the day
had long discussions

280
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,185
With the minister for running
upstairs two at a time

281
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,686
Flinging the door open

282
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,755
And saying, "ha, ha,
caught you, mildred."

283
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,558
In the commons there was
another day of heated debate

284
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,160
On the third reading
of the trade practices bill.

285
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,762
Mr. roland penrose

286
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:25,599
The undersecretary for
making deep growling noises...

287
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,301
Launched a bitter
personal attack

288
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:30,337
On the ex-minister for delving
deep into a black satin bag

289
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,639
And producing a tube
of euthymol toothpaste.

290
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:34,041
Later in the debate

291
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,109
The junior minister
for being frightened

292
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,644
By any kind of farm machinery

293
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:39,713
Challenged
the undersecretary of state

294
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,415
For hiding from terence rattigan

295
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,750
To produce the current year's
trading figures

296
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:46,653
As supplied by the department
of stealing packets of bandages

297
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,922
From the self-service counter
at timothy whites

298
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,258
And selling them again
at a considerable profit.

299
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,759
Parliament rose at 11:30

300
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:55,662
And, crawling along a dark
passageway into the old rectory

301
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,598
Broke down the door
to the serving hatch

302
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,099
Painted the spare room

303
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,068
And next weekend
I think they'll be able

304
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,836
To make a start
on the boys' bedroom.

305
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,772
While amy and roger--
up in london for two days--

306
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,141
Go to see
the mysterious mr. grenville.

307
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,244
He in turn
has been revealed by d'arcy

308
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,346
As something less
than an honest man.

309
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,480
Sybil feels once again

310
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:15,148
A resurgence
of her old affection

311
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,583
And she and balreau return

312
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:18,852
To her little house
in clermont-ferrand--

313
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,687
The kind of two-up,
two-down house

314
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:23,557
That most french workers--
and, indeed, most workers

315
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,026
Throughout the european
community-- are living in today.

316
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,461
The ease of construction

317
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,796
Using on-site prefabrication
facilities

318
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,632
Makes cheap housing a reality.

319
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,500
The walls of these houses
are lined

320
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:37,070
With prestressed asbestos, which
keeps the house warm and snuggly

321
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,374
And ever so safe
from the big bad rabbit

322
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,743
Who can scratch and scratch
for all he's worth

323
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,913
But he just can't get
into porky's house.

324
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,214
Where is porky?

325
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,215
Here he is.

326
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,351
What a funny little chap.

327
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,420
But porky is one
of the lucky ones.

328
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,757
He survived the urban upheaval
of the '30s and '40s.

329
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,259
For him, jarrow is still
just a memory.

330
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,795
The hunger marches,
the east end riots

331
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,597
The collapse of
the labor government in 1931

332
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,799
Are dim reminders of the days

333
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,268
Before a newfound affluence
swept the land

334
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,736
Making it clean and tidy

335
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,639
And making all the shops
full of nice things:

336
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:14,975
Lovely choo-choo trains and toys

337
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,377
And shiny cars that go
"brrm, brrm, brrm"

338
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:20,347
And everybody was happy
and singing all the day long

339
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,950
And nobody saw
the big bad rabbit ever again.

340
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,785
But, of course,
it's all very easy

341
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,186
To blame the big bad rabbit

342
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,622
When by-elections are going
against the government.

343
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,958
Ut how often do you think

344
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,426
We should really
be blaming ourselves?

345
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:39,132
Because, you know, that's where
we ought to start looking.

346
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,432
Hello... all the activity
you can see here in progress

347
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,668
Is part of the intricate...

348
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:27,140
Preparations for the british
naval expedition to lake pahoe.

349
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,476
The leader of the expedition is

350
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,812
Sir jane russell.

351
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,381
Sir jane, what is the purpose of
your expedition?

352
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,016
Well, this is a completely
uncharted lake

353
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,885
With, like, hitherto
unclassified marine life, man

354
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,687
So the whole scene's wide open
for a scientific exploration.

355
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:43,090
One can see the immense
amount of preparation involved.

356
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,558
Have there been
many difficulties

357
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:45,893
In setting up this venture?

358
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,995
Well, the real hang-up
was with the bread, man

359
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:49,963
But when the top-brass pigs
came through

360
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,899
We got it together
in a couple of moons.

361
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:54,268
Commodore betty grable,
who's a real sub-aqua head

362
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,636
Has got it together diving-wise

363
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,804
And, like, the whole gig's
been a real gas, man.

364
00:18:57,838 --> 00:19:00,641
Thank you.

365
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:03,177
Lieutenant commander
dorothy lamour.

366
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,879
Pieces of eight.

367
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:08,515
Dorothy, you're in charge
of the security and liaison

368
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:09,616
For this operation.

369
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,218
Right on.

370
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,521
You've kept this all
very hush-hush so far, shipmate.

371
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:16,356
Yeah, it's been
really heavy, man

372
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,825
With all these freaks
from the fascist press

373
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,627
Trying to blow
the whole scene.

374
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,196
There's no doubt
about it

375
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,664
This expedition
does have

376
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,866
Some rather unusual
aspects, jim lad.

377
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:29,369
For a start, why do the senior
personnel all bear the names

378
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,471
Of hollywood film stars
of the '40s

379
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,940
And female ones at that?

380
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,242
Shiver me timbers,
'tis the black spot

381
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,679
And secondly, I be not afraid
of thee, blind pew!

382
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,715
Why do they talk this
rather strange, stilted

383
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,350
Underground jargon?

384
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:47,054
Belay the main brace, squire trelawney,
this be my ship now!

385
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,590
Ah! a tranquilizing
dart fired

386
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:53,126
By the cowardly bbc
health department dogs.

387
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,333
They've done filled me full
of chlorpromazine! damn!

388
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,003
I'm sorry about my colleague's
rather unconventional behavior.

389
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,071
The navy's
out of sight!

390
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:05,339
Come together
with the r.n.

391
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:10,511
It really is something
other than else.

392
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,563
Can you dig it, man?

393
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,565
Hello... I'm sorry
about my colleague's

394
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,700
Rather unconventional
behavior just now

395
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,303
But things haven't been
too easy for him recently--

396
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,704
Trouble at home--

397
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,707
Rather confidential, so I can't
give you all the details

398
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,476
Interesting though they are.

399
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,212
Three bottles of rum with
his weetabix, and so forth.

400
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,581
Anyway... apparently,
the girl wasn't even...

401
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,450
Anyway, the activity
you see behind me...

402
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,819
It's the mother
I feel sorry for.

403
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,454
I'll start again.

404
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:57,191
The activity you see behind me
is part of the preparations

405
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:59,226
For the new naval expedition
to lake pahoe.

406
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,128
The man in charge
of this expedition is

407
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,763
Vice admiral
sir john cunningham.

408
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,398
Sir john,
hello, there.

409
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,599
Hello... well,
first of all

410
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:06,633
I'd like
to apologize

411
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,769
For the behavior of certain of
my colleagues

412
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:10,003
You may have
seen earlier

413
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:12,139
But they are
from broken homes

414
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:13,907
Circus families
and so on

415
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,976
And they are in no
way representative

416
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,345
Of the new, modern,
improved british navy.

417
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,348
They are a small,
vociferous minority.

418
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,183
And may I take
this opportunity

419
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:25,786
Of emphasizing that there is
no cannibalism

420
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,054
In the british navy--

421
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:28,188
Absolutely none.

422
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:29,489
And when I say none

423
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,625
I mean there is
a certain amount--

424
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,927
More than we are
prepared to admit--

425
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,929
But all new ratings
are warned

426
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,298
That if they wake up
in the morning

427
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:39,733
And find any
tooth marks at all

428
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,335
Anywhere on
their bodies

429
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,370
They're to tell
me immediately

430
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:46,273
So that I can immediately take
every measure

431
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,108
To hush the
whole thing up.

432
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:53,013
And finally, necrophilia
is right out.

433
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:55,682
Now, this expedition
is primarily

434
00:21:55,716 --> 00:22:00,387
To investigate reports of cannibalism
and necrophilia in...

435
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,389
This expedition
is primarily

436
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,626
To investigate reports of
unusual marine life

437
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,195
In the as-yet
uncharted lake pahoe.

438
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:10,564
And where exactly
is the lake?

439
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,966
Uh... 22a,
runcorn avenue.

440
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,235
Yes, that's right, 22a.

441
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,703
Runcorn avenue?

442
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,338
Yes, it's just
by blenheim crescent.

443
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:19,473
Do you know it?

444
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,441
Uh, you mean it's
in an ordinary street?

445
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,076
It is not an
ordinary street--

446
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,311
It's got
a lake in it!

447
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,345
Yes, but i...

448
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,680
Look, how many
streets do you know

449
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:27,781
That have got
lakes in them?

450
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,983
I mean, is it very large?

451
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,451
Of course
it's not large.

452
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:34,254
You couldn't get a large lake in
runcorn avenue!

453
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:36,790
You'd have to knock down
the tobacconist's!

454
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,425
Jenkins...

455
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,694
No!

456
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:50,337
I'm now standing
in runcorn avenue.

457
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,639
Sir john, where
exactly is the lake?

458
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:55,475
Uh, well let's see,
that's 18...

459
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:58,378
That's 20,
so this must be the one.

460
00:22:58,412 --> 00:22:59,746
Um, excuse me, um...

461
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,281
Yes, this is
the one, all right.

462
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:02,316
But it's
an ordinary house.

463
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:03,650
Look, I'm getting
pretty irritated

464
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:05,385
With this line
of questioning.

465
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,753
But it doesn't even
look like a lake.

466
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,589
Look, your whole approach
since this interview started

467
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:09,690
Has been
to mock the navy.

468
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,959
When I think that
for the likes of you

469
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:14,194
I had both my legs
blown off...

470
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:15,929
But you haven't had both
your legs blown off!

471
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:18,198
I was talking
metaphorically, you fool.

472
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,433
Jenkins...

473
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,668
Put that down.

474
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:23,270
Right, is
the equipment ready?

475
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:26,540
Diving equipment
all ready, man.

476
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,908
Right... now,
quite simply

477
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:30,110
The approach to lake pahoe
is up the steps

478
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,412
And then we come to
the shores of the lake.

479
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,114
Now, I'm going
to press the bell

480
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:38,585
Just to see if
there's anyone in.

481
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:39,786
Hello?

482
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,057
Good morning, I'm looking
for a lake pahoe.

483
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,559
There's a mr. padgett.

484
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,094
No, no, a lake.

485
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,495
There's no lake here, mate.

486
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,863
This is runcorn avenue.

487
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:51,231
What's that camera doing?

488
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,267
Camera? what's he want?

489
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,269
Ooh, are we on the telly?

490
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:56,603
He's looking
for a lake.

491
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:58,038
Lake pahoe.

492
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:01,341
Oh, you want downstairs,
22a, the basement.

493
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,310
Ah! thank you very much,
good morning.

494
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:04,611
Come on, men, downstairs.

495
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,346
Uh, were you successful,
sir john?

496
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:07,514
It's in the basement.

497
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:09,116
In the basement?

498
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:10,117
Pieces of eight!

499
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,486
Ugh!

500
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:17,824
Hello?

501
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,561
Oh, I think it's
someone about the damp.

502
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:21,562
Hello.

503
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:22,563
Tell them

504
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,131
About the
bleeding rats, too.

505
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:26,300
I'll go.

506
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,568
Yes?

507
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:31,438
Good morning,
is this lake pahoe?

508
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:35,342
Well, I don't know about that,
but it's bleeding damp.

509
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,110
Are you from the council?

510
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:42,182
No, we are the official british naval
expedition to this lake.

511
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:43,483
May we come in?

512
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:46,153
Hang on.

513
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,763
Bloody sharks.

514
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:58,131
Get back in...

515
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,132
Get in.

516
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,768
Get in.

517
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:13,814
Well, that would appear
to be the end of the expedition.

518
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,082
The magna carta--

519
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:17,384
Was it a document signed
at runnymede

520
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,652
In 1215 by king john

521
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,355
Pledging independence
to the english barons

522
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:24,725
Or was it a piece of chewing gum
on a bedspread in dorset?

523
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:27,427
The latter idea is
the brainchild of a man

524
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:30,030
New to the field
of historical research.

525
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:33,834
Mr. badger, why... why are you on
this program?

526
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:37,271
Well, I think I can answer
this question

527
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:41,375
Most successfully in mime.

528
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:54,021
But why dorset?

529
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,557
Well, I have for a long time
been suffering

530
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,392
From a species of brain injury

531
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:01,261
Which I incurred
during the rigors of childbirth

532
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:04,698
And I'd like to conclude
by putting my finger up my nose.

533
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,367
Mr. badger, I think
you're the silliest person

534
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,169
We've ever had on this program

535
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:10,337
And so I'm going
to ask you

536
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,906
To have dinner
with me.

537
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,210
My wife maureen ran off
with a bottle of bell's whiskey

538
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,979
During the aberdeen
versus raith rovers match

539
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,814
Which ended
in a goal-less draw.

540
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:23,650
Robson, particularly, in goal,
had a magnificent first half

541
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:26,019
His fine positional sense
preventing the build-up

542
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:28,722
Of any severe pressure
on the suspect aberdeen defense.

543
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,490
Mcloughlan missed
an easy chance

544
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:32,726
To clinch the game towards
the final whistle

545
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,394
But raith must be
well satisfied

546
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:35,395
With their point.

547
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:36,964
Do please go on.

548
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:39,166
This is the least fascinating
conversation I've ever had.

549
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,634
Would you like to order, sir?

550
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,170
Yes, mr. badger, what would you
like to start with?

551
00:26:43,203 --> 00:26:46,373
Uh, I'll have a whiskey
to start with.

552
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:47,541
For first course, sir?

553
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:49,309
Aye.

554
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:51,078
And for main course, sir?

555
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,380
Uh, I'll have a whiskey
for main course

556
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:56,450
And I'll follow that with a
whiskey for pudding.

557
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:59,987
Yes, sir, and what would you
like with it, sir? a whiskey?

558
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,589
No, a bottle of wine.

559
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:05,292
"fine, sir," he said
between clenched teeth

560
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:08,362
Knowing full well it was
a most unrewarding part.

561
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:11,999
This is the silliest sketch
I've ever been in.

562
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:15,402
Shall we stop it?

563
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:19,039
Yeah, all right.
