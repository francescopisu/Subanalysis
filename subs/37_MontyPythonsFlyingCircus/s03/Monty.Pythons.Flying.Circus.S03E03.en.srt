1
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:38,403
Good evening, and welcome
to the money programme.

2
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:41,573
Tonight on the money programme,
we're going to look at money--

3
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:44,809
Lots of it,
on film and in the studio

4
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,578
Some of it in nice piles

5
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:49,380
Others in lovely clanky bits
of loose change

6
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:52,283
Some of it neatly counted
into fat little hundreds

7
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:55,119
Delicate fivers stuffed
into bulging wallets

8
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,121
Nice, crisp, clean checks

9
00:00:57,155 --> 00:01:01,392
Pert pieces of copper coinage
thrust deep into trouser pockets

10
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:04,028
Romantic foreign money
rolling against the thigh

11
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:05,563
With rough familiarity

12
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:07,932
Beautiful wayward
curlicued bank notes

13
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,335
Filigree copper-plating
cheek by jowl

14
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:12,303
With tumbling
hexagonal-milled edges

15
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:14,672
Rubbing gently
against the terse leather

16
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:19,511
Of beautifully balanced
bank books!

17
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,214
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:24,983
But I love money...

19
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:26,518
All money.

20
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:30,889
I've always wanted money
to handle, to touch

21
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:33,057
The smell
of the rain-washed florin

22
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:34,592
The lure of the lira

23
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:36,628
The glitter and the glory
of the guinea

24
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:39,764
The romance of the ruble,
the feel of the franc

25
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:41,366
The heel of the deutsche mark

26
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,635
The cold antiseptic sting
of the swiss franc

27
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:47,639
And the sunburned splendor
of the australian dollar.

28
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:52,010
I've got funt90,000
in my pajamas

29
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:54,546
I've got 40,000 french francs
in my fridge

30
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,347
I've got lots and lots
of lira

31
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:58,516
Now the deutsche mark's
getting dearer

32
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,252
And my dollar bills
would buy the brooklyn bridge

33
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:04,255
There is nothing
quite as wonderful as money

34
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,658
There is nothing quite
as beautiful as cash

35
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,828
Some people say it's folly,
but I'd rather have the lolly

36
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:12,030
With money
you can make a smash

37
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:16,167
There is nothing quite as wonderful as
money, money, money, money, money

38
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:20,171
There is nothing like a newly minted pound
money, money, money, money

39
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,941
Everyone must hanker
for the butchness of a banker

40
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:26,744
It's accountancy that makes the world
go round, round, round, round

41
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:28,213
You can keep
your marxist ways

42
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:29,681
For it's only just a phase

43
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:33,117
It's money, money, money
makes the world go round

44
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,819
Money, money, money, money

45
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:39,557
Money, money, money,
money, money!

46
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:42,961
Now...

47
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:45,563
It's...

48
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:53,037
Monty python's flying circus.

49
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:54,032
I bling a dispatch
flom prymouth.

50
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,533
"flom prymouth"?

51
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:58,403
Flom sil flancis dlake.

52
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:02,841
Entel and apploach
the thlone.

53
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,223
What news

54
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:23,695
Dlake has sighted
the spanish freet, youl majesty.

55
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:28,199
So! phirip's garreons ale hele.

00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:36,241
Broody herr.

59
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:39,711
Is dlake plepaled?

60
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:45,717
He has oldeled the whore freet
into the blitish channer.

61
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,154
So, we must to tirbuly.

Come on.

68
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:01,733

00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:03,201
That was telliber.

70
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:04,435
What?

71
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:05,537
Telliber.

72
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,172
When you have the rine

73
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,840
Ling your berr.

74
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:09,974

Ling, ling.

And cut the

77
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:14,345
Erizabeth!

78
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,446
Yes?

79
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,282
You should be
on a bicycer.

80
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:18,449
Why?!

81
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:20,718
You rook odd rike that.

82
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:22,821
I do not look odd like this.

83
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,355
It's that lot
that looks odd.

84
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:26,991
It's bleeding weird having
half the tudor nobility

85
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,661
Ligging around on
motorized bicycles!

86
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,030
It's vely sullearist.

87
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:33,031
Horse feathers!

88
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:34,098
Listen, mate, I'm beginning

89
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:35,099
To have my doubts about you.

90
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,100
What you mean?

91
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:37,769
I'm telling you
straight, mate.

92
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:40,238
I don't think you're
luchino visconti at all.

93
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,840
Oh, of coulse, I am.

94
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:45,477
Me vely impoltant
itarian firm dilectol.

95
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,379
You are a nip.

96
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:49,647
Lubbish!

97
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:51,850
Me genuine wop!

98
00:05:51,883 --> 00:05:55,253
Alliveldelchi loma

99
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:56,387
He's bluffing.

100
00:05:56,421 --> 00:06:00,258
Vo-rale,
oh-oh-oh-oh...

101
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,759
Oh, is that
the time?

102
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:04,028
I must fry.

103
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:07,832
Not so fast, yakomoto.

104
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:12,737
Shut up!

105
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,073
Allow me
to introduce myself.

106
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:17,775
I am inspector leopard
of scotland yard

107
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:20,612
Special fraud
film director squad.

108
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:22,514
Leopard of the yard?!

109
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:26,784
The same,
only more violent.

110
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:33,992
Right, slit-eyes yakomoto,
I'm arresting you

111
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:37,629
For the impersonation
of signor luchino visconti

112
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:40,698
Famous italian director
of such movie classics

113
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:44,235
As obsessione, 1942

114
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:46,638
La terra trema, 1948

115
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:49,307
And bellissima, 1951--

116
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,911
A satisfyingly ironic
slice-of-life drama.

117
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:56,080
1957 brought
to the silver screen

118
00:06:56,114 --> 00:07:01,085
His I bianche notte,
adapted by dostoyevsky

119
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,822
A mannered and romantic
melancholy of snow and mists

120
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:06,658
And moonlit encounters
on canal bridges.

121
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:09,828
Boccaccio 70 followed
five years later

122
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:12,230
And the following year saw...

123
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:14,399
The leopard!

124
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:15,834
So impressed was i

125
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,670
With this motion picture
treatment of the risorgimento

126
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:21,039
That I went along
to somerset house

127
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:22,941
And changed me own name
to "leopard"

128
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:28,746
Preferring it to me
original handle, "panther."

129
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:34,319
I digress.

130
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:37,956
1969 saw the damned,
a gotterdammerung epic

131
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:40,225
Of political
and industrial shenanigans

132
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,060
In good old nazi germany

133
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:45,763
Starring helmut berger
as a stinking transvestite

134
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,799
What should have
his face sawn off

135
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:51,336
The curvaceous charlotte
rampling as a bit of tail

136
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:54,973
And the impeccable
dirk bogarde as von essen.

137
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,876
The association of the latter
with signor visconti

138
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,512
Fructified with dirk's
magnificent portrayal

139
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:04,082
Of the elderly pouf
what expires in venice.

140
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:07,619
And so, yakomoto...

141
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,655
Blimey! he gone!

142
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:11,990
Never mind.

143
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,625
I'll have you instead.

144
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,994
I haven't time to go
chasing after him.

145
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,530
There's violence
to be done.

146
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:21,199
Oh, yes.

147
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,715
All right, buster.

148
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:40,485
Hands up!

149
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,466
I would like to ask the team

150
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,838
what they would do
if they were hitler.

151
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:01,206
Gerald?

152
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,842
Well, I'd, uh...
annex the sudetenland

153
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,679
and sign a nonaggression pact
with russia.

154
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:09,047
Norman?

155
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,951
Well, I'd do the reichstag
bathroom in purples and golds

156
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:16,087
and ban abortion on demand.

157
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,622
Liberal rubbish!

158
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:20,225
Klaus, what you want
with your jugged fish?

159
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:21,459
Halibut.

160
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,862
The jugged fish is halibut.

161
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:26,898
Well, what fish you got
that isn't jugged then?

162
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,066
Rabbit.

163
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,868
What? rabbit fish?

164
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,369
Yes. it's got fins.

165
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:32,537
Is it dead?

166
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,507
Well, it was coughing up blood
last night.

167
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,613
All right, I'll have the dead
unjugged rabbit fish.

168
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:44,916
Well, that was
really horrible.

169
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:46,751
Oh, you're always
complaining.

170
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:47,919
What's for afters?

171
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:50,622
Well, there's rat cake,
rat sorbet

172
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:53,424
Rat pudding or strawberry tart.

173
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,893
Strawberry tart?!

174
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,761
Well, it's got some rat in it.

175
00:09:56,794 --> 00:09:58,897
How much?

176
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,098
Three.

177
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,900
It's rather a lot, really.

178
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:07,005
Well, I'll have a slice without
so much rat in it.

179
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:08,039
Appalling.

180
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,275
Moan, moan, moan.

181
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:11,509
Hello, mum.
hello, dad.

182
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:12,644
Hello, son.

183
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:14,445
There's a dead bishop
on the landing.

184
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,814
Where did that come from?

185
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:16,815
What do you mean?

186
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,416
What's its diocese?

187
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,186
Well, it looked a bit bath
and wellsish to me.

188
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:22,720
I'll go
and have a look.

189
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:25,690
I don't know who keeps
bringing them in here.

190
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:26,925
Well, it's not me.

191
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,660
I put three
out by the bin

192
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,728
And the dustmen
won't touch 'em.

193
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,197
Leicester.
how'd you know?

194
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,098
Tattooed on the back
of his neck.

195
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:35,967
I'm going to call
the police.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,936
Shouldn't you call
the church?

197
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,437
Call the church
police.

198
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,306
All right.
the church police!

199
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,041
Yes?

200
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,810
There's another...
there's a dead bishop...

201
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,245
Suffragan?

202
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,681
There's another dead
bishop on the landing.

203
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:50,949
Suffragan
or diocesan?

204
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:52,083
How should I know?

205
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:54,385
Its tattooed on the
back of their necks.

206
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:55,386
Ere!

207
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,489
Is that rat tart?

208
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,858
Yes.

209
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:02,260
Disgusting.

210
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,261
Right!

211
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:04,496
The hunt is on.

212
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,698
Oh, lord, we
beseech thee...

213
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:11,136
Tell us who croaked
leicester.

214
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,340
All right, it's a fair cop

215
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:16,808
But society is to blame.

216
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:17,976
Agreed.

217
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,711
I would like the three
by the bin

218
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:21,379
To be taken
into consideration.

219
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:24,782
Right. and now, I'd like
to conclude this arrest

220
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,584
With a hymn.

221
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:30,021
And did those feet

222
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:33,324
In ancient times

223
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:38,696
Walk upon
england's mountains green

224
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:44,135
And was the holy lamb of god

225
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:51,476
On england's
pleasant pastures seen...

226
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:54,479
Oh, shut up!

227
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:58,149
Thank you.

228
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:00,585
What?

229
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:10,328
Ere. oh, ooh.

230
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:16,901
Ow! oh. ah, oh...

231
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:18,102
Oh!

232
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,605
Oh, oh, whoa! oh.

233
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:22,974
Oh! whoa!

234
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:25,076
Oh. oh-oh.

235
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:27,979
Oh, oh, oh!

236
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:33,151
Oh! ooh! oh!

237
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,089
Whee-hee-hee!
whoa!

238
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:39,157
Yahoo!

239
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,158
Yay!

240
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,359
Whee!

241
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:46,364
Meanwhile, in the jungle
next door...

242
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,537
What a simply super
little place.

243
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,338
Yes. they've done
wonders with it.

244
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:28,940
You know, this
used to be one

245
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:32,177
Of the most swampy, disease-infested
areas of the whole jungle

246
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,280
And they've turned it into this
smashing little restaurant.

247
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:39,284
Here you are, omkami.
thank you.

248
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,819
Well, hello, mr. akwekwe.

249
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:44,255
Hello there, mr. spare-buttons-
supplied-with-the-shirt.

250
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,723
Nice to see you again.

251
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:48,259
These are some
of my fellow explorers.

252
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:51,596
Sir charles farquarson,
brian bailey, betty bailey

253
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:55,066
And this is mr. akwekwe
who started the whole place.

254
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,167
It really
is super.

255
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,302
Oh, terrific idea.

256
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:58,503
Thank you all.

257
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:03,508
May I recommend
the alligator purees?

258
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:32,303
Now then, have you decided?

259
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:35,340
Uh, yes. well, there's two
avocado vinaigrette here

260
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,609
And what are you
going to have, brian?

261
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:39,978
Uh, quiche lorraine
for me, please.

262
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:45,283
Right. so that's two
avocado, one quiche.

263
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:05,403
So, that's two avocado,
one quiche.

264
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:06,805
And a soup
of the day.

265
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:09,307
Right.

266
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,209
And to follow?

267
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,778
Uh, two chicken
a la reine, please.

268
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,613
Uh, with sauce provencal,
please.

269
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:16,948
And one scampi desiree.

270
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:19,450
And a boeuf bourguignon
with a green salad.

271
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:20,718
Right on.

272
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,921
Two chicken, one scampi

273
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:27,225
One boeuf
with the green salad.

274
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:28,693
There may be...

275
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:30,028
A little delay.

276
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,664
That's fine,
but we have to be out by 3:00.

277
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:36,701
Yes, sir. yes.
we'll try.

278
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:40,104
We'll try.

279
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,284
The bbc would like to announce

280
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,887
That the next scene
is not considered suitable

281
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,021
For family viewing.

282
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,723
It contains scenes of violence

283
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:01,726
Involving people's heads
and arms getting chopped off

284
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,228
Their ears nailed to trees

285
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,797
And their toenails pulled out
in slow motion.

286
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,033
There are also scenes of naked
women with floppy breasts.

287
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,903
And also at one point,
you can see a pair of buttocks

288
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:15,140
And there's another bit where
I swear you can see everything

289
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:19,644
But my friend says it's just
the way he's holding the spear.

290
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:22,514
Because of the unsuitability
of the scene

291
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,482
The bbc will be replacing it

292
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:30,822
With a scene from a repeat
of gardening club for 1958.

293
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:52,744
And now, back to the story.

294
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:01,252
That was a nasty business
back at the restaurant.

295
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,155
Yes. I thought most places took
barclaycard nowadays.

296
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,591
Where do you think
they're taking us, brian?

297
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:07,725
God knows.

298
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,860
Look!

299
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:11,563
The sacred
volcano andu!

300
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:13,665
Which no man
has seen before.

301
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:17,535
No, no, no.
next to that.

302
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,304
No, no, no, no.
nextto that.

303
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,439
The forbidden plateau
of roiurama.

304
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,774
The lost world.

305
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,443
Thrown up
by mighty earth movements

306
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,146
Thousands of millions
of years ago.

307
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,050
Where strange primeval creatures
defying evolution

308
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,986
Lurk in the dark,
impenetrable forests

309
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:38,022
Cut off forever
from the outside world.

310
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,891
I still can't see it.

311
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,961
You don't think that's
where they're taking us.

312
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:46,764
Yes. and god knows
what we'll find there.

313
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:47,999
What page, please?

314
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:49,200
What?

315
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,702
What page
in the script?

316
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,904
Page seven.

317
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,406
"come on, you dogs.
we have far to go.

318
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,941
We must lose no time."

319
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,310
Come on, you dogs.
we have far to go.

320
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,712
We must lose no time.

321
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:01,713
Come on, you...

322
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:02,914
Come on, you dogs.

323
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,315
We have time to lose.

324
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,119
This has gone too far.

325
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:11,189
Meanwhile, back in london

326
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:15,460
At the british explorers club
in the mall...

327
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:19,497
Any news of betty bailey's
expedition, hargreaves?

328
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,666
Uh...

329
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:23,034
Uh...

330
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,402
Page... page nine.

331
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:27,572
Oh, thank you.

332
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:32,143
Uh... the lost world
of roiurama.

333
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,912
That's...
that's my line.

334
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:36,748
Oh. sorry.

335
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,184
Where were they
going, sir?

336
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:43,388
The lost world of roiurama.

337
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:47,058
Yes, sir.
we've got a telegram.

338
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,327
Oh.

339
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,099
"reads it."

340
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,102
"expedition superb,
weather excellent.

341
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,505
Everything wonderful."

342
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,440
I wonder
what's gone wrong.

343
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,075
For god's sake,
be careful...

344
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,877
Wait a minute.

345
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,413
I'm going to go after them.

346
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:12,917
Oh! for god's sake,
be careful.

347
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,431
My god, betty,
we're done for.

348
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,566
We'll never
get out of here.

349
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,702
We're completely
lost. lost!

350
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,804
Even the natives
have gone.

351
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:34,405
Good-bye, betty.

352
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,207
Good-bye, farquarson.

353
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,842
Good-bye, brian.

354
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:42,180
It's been
a great expedition.

355
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,016
Great expedition.

356
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,253
All that'll be left of us is
a map, a compass

357
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:51,990
And a few feet of film recording
our last moments.

358
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,258
Wait a minute!

359
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,660
What is it?

360
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:59,097
If we're on film...

361
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,900
There must be someone
filming us.

362
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:04,002
My god, betty!

363
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,704
You're right!

364
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,640
Look!
hello!

365
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:10,575
Great to see you!

366
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,343
Super to see you.

367
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,579
Super!

368
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:15,880
How are you, mates?

369
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:16,881
Jolly good!

370
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,349
Wait a minute!

371
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,885
What is it again?

372
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,056
If this is the crew
who were filming us...

373
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:28,760
Who's filming us now?

374
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:31,729
Look!

375
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:32,797
Cut there, man.

376
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:33,798
Cut there.

377
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,266
No... no good.

378
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,068
How we going to get
that feeling

379
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,504
Of personal alienation
of self from society

380
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,806
With this load
of bulldog drummond crap?

381
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,776
When I was doing la notte
with that monica vitti gal

382
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:45,877
She didn't give me

383
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,882
None of this
empire-building shit, man.

384
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:54,686
Not so fast, akarumba.

385
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,654
Allow me to
introduce myself.

386
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,022
I'm inspector baboon

387
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,125
Of scotland yard's special
fraud film director's squad.

388
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,360
Jungle division.

389
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:03,828
Baboon of the yard!

390
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,498
Shut up!

391
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,633
Right, akarumba.

392
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:12,670
I'm arresting you for impersonating
signor michelangelo antonioni

393
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,172
An italian film director

394
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:16,141
Who co-scripts
all his own films

395
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,911
Largely jettisoning narrative in favor
of vague incident

396
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:22,113
And relentless character study.

397
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,849
In his first film
cronaca di un amore, 1915

398
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:28,686
The couple are brought together
by a shared irrational guilt.

399
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,455
Le amiche followed in 1955

400
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:34,225
And 1959 saw the first of
antonioni's world-famous trilogy

401
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:38,029
L'avventura, an acute study
of boredom, restlessness

402
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:41,332
And the futilities and agonies
of purposeless living.

403
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,168
In l'eclisse three years later

404
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,437
This analysis of the sentiments
was taken up once again.

405
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,041
"we do not have to know each
other to love," says the heroine

406
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:52,477
"and perhaps,
we do not have to love."

407
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,947
The eclipse of the emotions
finally casts its shadow

408
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,984
When darkness descends...

409
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:13,331
Signor antonioni first makes use
of color to underline...

410
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:14,999
And now on bbc 1

411
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:21,206
Another six minutes of
monty python's flying circus.

412
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,007
Yes, sir.

413
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,076
I'd like to have
an argument, please.

414
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:26,144
Certainly, sir.

415
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:27,645
Have you been here before?

416
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,113
No. this is
my first time.

417
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,649
I see. do you want to have
the full argument

418
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,985
Or were you thinking
of taking a course?

419
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:35,520
Well, what would
be the cost?

420
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:36,788
Well, yes, it's five...

421
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,023
It's one pound
for a five-minute argument

422
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,292
But only eight pounds
for a course of ten.

423
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,394
Mmm... well, I think
it's probably best

424
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,662
If I start with the one

425
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,664
And see how it goes
from there, okay?

426
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,000
Fine. I'll see who's free
at the moment.

427
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,535
Uh... mr. du-bakey's free

428
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:52,604
But he's a little bit
conciliatory.

429
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:53,638
Mmm.

430
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:55,707
Yes, uh, try
mr. barnard-- room 12.

431
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,543
Thank you.

432
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,716
What do you want?!

433
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,284
Well, I was told outside...

434
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,452
Don't give me that

435
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:09,921
You snotty-faced heap
of parrot droppings!

436
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:10,922
What?

437
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:14,259
Shut your festering gob,
you tit!

438
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,628
Your type makes me puke!

439
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:20,365
You vacuous, toffee-nosed,
malodorous pervert!

440
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,366
What?!

441
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,468
I came in here
for an argument!

442
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,736
Oh! oh, I'm sorry.

443
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:25,737
This is abuse.

444
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,738
Oh. oh, I see.

445
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:27,939
That explains it.

446
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:29,908
No. you want 12a next door.

447
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,909
I see.

448
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:31,910
Sorry.

449
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:32,911
Not at all.

450
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,412
Yeah, that's all right.

451
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:37,315
Stupid git.

452
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,884
Come in.

453
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,021
Is this the right room
for an argument?

454
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,589
I've told you once.

455
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:45,890
No, you haven't.

456
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,624
Yes, I have.

457
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,759
When?

458
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:48,326
Just now.

459
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,460
No, you didn't.

460
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,562
Yes, I did.
didn't.

461
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,396
Did.
didn't.

462
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,263
I'm telling you I did.

463
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:52,964
You did not.

464
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:53,965
I'm sorry, is this

465
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:55,200
A five-minute argument

466
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,734
Or the full half hour?

467
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,736
Oh! oh. just
the five-minute one.

468
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,737
Fine.

469
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,738
Thank you.

470
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,739
Anyway, I did.

471
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,575
You most certainly
did not.

472
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,144
Now, let's get one
thing quite clear.

473
00:24:06,177 --> 00:24:07,979
I most definitely
told you.

474
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:09,080
You did not.
yes, I did.

475
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:10,081
You did not.
yes, I did.

476
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,082
Didn't.
yes, I did.

477
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:12,083
Didn't.
yes, I did.

478
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,852
Look, this isn't an argument.

479
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:14,986
Yes, it is.
no, it isn't.

480
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,754
It's just contradiction.
no, it isn't.

481
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,755
Yes, it is.
it is not.

482
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,257
It is!
you just contradicted me.

483
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,258
No, I didn't.

484
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:20,925
Oh, you did.

485
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,293
No, no, no, no.

486
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:22,994
You did just then.

487
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:24,462
No, no, nonsense.

488
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,430
Oh, well, this is futile.

489
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,364
No, it isn't.

490
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:27,365
I came here for a good argument.

491
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:28,900
No, you didn't.
you came here for an argument.

492
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:30,435
Well, argue is not the same
as contradiction.

493
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,703
It can be.

494
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:32,937
No, it can't.

495
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,939
An argument's a collected series
of statements

496
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,541
To establish
a definite proposition.

497
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:37,775
No, it isn't.
yes, it is.

498
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,210
It isn't just contradiction.

499
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,411
Look, if i
argue with you

500
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,147
I must take up
a contrary position.

501
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,481
But it isn't just saying,
"no, it isn't."

502
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:44,482
Yes, it is.

503
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,517
No, it isn't.

504
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,452
Argument's
an intellectual process.

505
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,021
Contradiction is just
the automatic gainsaying

506
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:51,923
Of anything
the other person says.

507
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:53,324
No, it isn't.
yes, it is.

508
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,860
Not at all.
now, look...

509
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,861
Thank you.

510
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,596
Good morning.

511
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,597
What?

512
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,598
That's it.

513
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,633
Good morning.

514
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,701
But I was just getting
interested.

515
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,603
Sorry. the five
minutes is up.

516
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,939
That was never five
minutes just now.

517
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:08,973
Afraid it was.

518
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,042
No, it wasn't.

519
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:13,211
Sorry, I'm not allowed
to argue anymore.

520
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:14,212
What?!

521
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:15,980
If you want me
to go on arguing

522
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,516
You'll have to pay for
another five minutes.

523
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,885
But that was never five
minutes just now.

524
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,888
Oh, come on!

525
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:25,757
This is ridiculous.

526
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,560
I'm very sorry,
but I told you

527
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,595
I'm not allowed to
argue unless you pay.

528
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:33,665
Oh, all right.

529
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,066
There you are.

530
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,067
Thank you.

531
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,802
Well?

532
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,604
Well what?

533
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:41,139
That was never five minutes
just now.

534
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,740
I told you, I'm not allowed
to argue unless you pay.

535
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:43,875
I just paid.
no, you didn't.

536
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:46,344
I did. I did! I did!

537
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,012
Look, I don't want
to argue about that.

538
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,448
Well, I'm very sorry,
but you didn't pay.

539
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,318
Aha! well, if I didn't pay,
why are you arguing?

540
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,319
Got you.

541
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,153
No, you haven't.

542
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,187
Yes, I have.

543
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,622
If you're arguing,
I must've paid.

544
00:25:57,655 --> 00:25:58,957
Not necessarily.

545
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,458
I could be arguing

546
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,060
In my spare time.

547
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,394
I've had enough of this.

548
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:07,732
No, you haven't.
oh, shut up.

549
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:10,201
I want to complain.

550
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,470
You want to complain?
look at these shoes.

551
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:13,538
I've only had them three weeks

552
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,772
And the heels are worn
right through.

553
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:15,840
No, I want
to complain about...

554
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:16,941
If you complain,
nothing happens

555
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,076
You might just as
well not bother

556
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,077
And my back hurts...

557
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,645
I want to com... ow!

558
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:22,280
No, no. hold
your head

559
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:24,516
Like this and
then go, "wah!"

560
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,517
Try it again.
whoa!

561
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,218
Better, better,
but, "wah! wah!"

562
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,419
Hold your hands here.

563
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,421
No.
now...

564
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,357
No, that's it,
that's it! good!

565
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,825
Stop hitting me!
what?

566
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:34,893
Stop hitting me.

567
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,394
Stop hitting you?
yes.

568
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,396
Well, uh, what did
you come in here for?

569
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,531
I came here to complain.

570
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,132
Oh, I'm sorry.
that's next door.

571
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,301
It's being hit on the
head lessons in here.

572
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:44,402
What a stupid concept.

573
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:45,470
Right. hold it there.

574
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,471
What?
what?

575
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,239
Allow me to introduce myself.

576
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,442
I'm inspector fox of the
light entertainment police

577
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,478
Comedy division,
special flying squad.

578
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,946
Flying fox of the yard?!

579
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:55,947
Shut up!
oh!

580
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,649
No, no, no, no.
"wah!"

581
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,683
And you!

582
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:00,185
He's good.

583
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,353
You could learn
a thing or two from him.

584
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,223
Right, now you two, me old
beauties, you are nicked.

585
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,691
What for?

586
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:10,528
I'm charging you under section
21 of the strange sketch act.

587
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,529
The what?

588
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,864
You are hereby charged

589
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,500
That you did willfully take part
in a strange sketch.

590
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,535
That is a skit, spoof
or humorous vignette

591
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,937
Of an unconventional nature

592
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,239
With intent to cause
grievous mental confusion

593
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,640
To the great
british public.

594
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,242
Evening, all.

595
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,243
It's a fair cop.

596
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,244
And you tosh!

597
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,245
Wah!

598
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,246
That's excellent!

599
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,315
Right, come on
down to the yard.

600
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,316
Hold it, hold it.

601
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,717
Allow me
to introduce myself.

602
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,319
I'm inspector
thompson's gazelle

603
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,954
Of the programme
planning police

604
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,523
Light entertainment division,
special flying squad.

605
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,525
Flying thompson's
gazellle of the yard?

606
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,526
Shut up!

607
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,527
Ahh!

608
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,528
He... he's good.

609
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,596
Shut up.
wow!

610
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,597
Rotten.

611
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,598
Ahh!

612
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,266
Good.

613
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,635
Right. I'm arresting
this entire show

614
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,736
On three counts:

615
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:54,372
One, acts of self-
conscious behavior

616
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:56,674
Contrary to the "not in front
of the children" act

617
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,410
Two, always saying,
"it's so and so of the yard"

618
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,945
Every time
the fuzz arrives

619
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,081
And three-- and this is
the cruncher--

620
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,583
Offenses against
the "getting out of sketches

621
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,752
Without using
a proper punch line act."

622
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:11,356
Namely simply ending
every bleeding sketch

623
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,993
By just having
a policeman come in and...

624
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,928
Wait a minute.

625
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:17,929
Hold it.

626
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,232
It's a fair cop.

627
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:22,801
And now on bbc 1

628
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,771
One more minute of
monty python's flying circus.
