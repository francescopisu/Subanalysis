00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Monty Python's Flying Circus
tonight comes to you live

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,100
from the Grillomat Snack Bar, Paignton.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello to you live from the
Grillomat Snack Bar, Paignton.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,300
And so, without any more ado,
let's have the titles.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
It's...

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,100
Well, those were the titles.

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,300
And now for the first item this evening
on the Menu - ha ha - 

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,300
the team have chosen
as a little hors d'oeuvres an item

9
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,900
and I think we can be sure
it won't be an ordinary item

10
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,900
in fact the team told me just
before the show that anything could happen,
and probably would

11
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,400
so let's have ... the item.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
 

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,200
Hello, good evening,
and welcome to 'Blackmail'!

14
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,200
And to start tonight's programme, we go
North to Preston in Lancashire,

15
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,300
and Mrs Betty Teal!

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,600
Hello, Mrs Teal!

17
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,000
Now this is for £15

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,300
and it's to stop us revealing
the name of your lover in Bolton.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,200
So Mrs Teal...if you send us £15
by return of post, please,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,800
and your husband Trevor, and your
lovely children, Diane, Janice and Juliet

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,100
need never know the name
of your lover in Bolton.

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,700
And now...a letter...
a hotel registration book...

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,700
and a series of photographs...
which could add up to divorce,

24
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,300
premature retirement,
and possible criminal proceedings

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,900
for a company director in Bromsgrove.

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,300
He's a freemason, and prospective Tory MP.

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,800
That's Mr S. of Bromsgrove... £3000...

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
... to stop us from revealing your name,
the name of the three other people involved,

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,200
the youth organization to which they belong,

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,700
and the shop where you bought the equipment.

31
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
We'll be showing you more of that photograph
later in the programme...

32
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,600
unless we hear from Charles or Michael.

33
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,700
And now it's time
for our 'Stop the Film' spot!

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,100
The rules are very simple. We have taken
a film which contains compromising scenes
and unpleasant details,

35
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,100
which could wreck a man's career.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,700
But, the victim may phone me
at any point and stop the film.

37
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,900
But remember the money increases
as the film goes on.

38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,100
So the longer you leave it...
the more you have to pay!

39
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,300
So now, with the clock at £300

40
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,700
this week 'Stop the Film'
visited Thames Ditton...

41
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,400
He's being very brave here...

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Hello, sir, hello, yes.

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
No sir, no, I'm sure you didn't.

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,400
No, it's all right, sir, we don't
morally censure, we just want the money.

45
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Yes, here's the address to send it to:

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
 

47
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
 

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
 

49
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,400
Not at all, sir...thank you.

50
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,100
Sorry chaps, it was my mother.

51
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,000
Gentlemen, pray silence

52
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,200
for the President of the Royal Society

53
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,400
for Putting Things on Top of Other Things.

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,400
I thank you, gentlemen.

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,000
The year has been a good one for the Society

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,300
(hear, hear)

57
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,300
This year our members have put
more things on top of other things

58
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,100
than ever before.

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,200
But, I should warn you,
this is no time for complacency.

60
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,400
No, there are still many things,

61
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,400
and I cannot emphasize this too strongly,
not on top of other things.

62
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,000
I myself, on my way here this evening,

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,900
saw a thing that was not on top
of another thing in any way.

64
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,100
(shame!)

65
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,700
Shame indeed but we must not allow
ourselves to become too despondent.

66
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,000
For, we must never forget that
if there was not one thing that was not
on top of another thing

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,900
our society would be nothing more
than a meaningless body

68
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,300
of men that had gathered together
for no good purpose.

69
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,600
But we flourish.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,200
This year our Australasian members

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,100
and the various organizations affiliated

72
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,300
to our Australasian branches

73
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,700
put no fewer than twenty-two things
on top of other things.

74
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Well done all of you.

75
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,400
But there is one cloud on the horizon.

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
In this last year our Staffordshire branch

77
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,000
has not succeeded in putting
one thing on top of another!

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,500
(shame!)

79
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Therefore I call upon
our Staffordshire delegate

80
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,700
to explain this weird behaviour.

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,900
Er, Cutler, Staffordshire.

82
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,800
Um ... well, Mr Chairman, it's just
that most of the members in Staffordshire

83
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,900
feel... the whole thing's a bit silly.

84
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Silly! SILLY!!

85
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,900
Silly! I suppose it is, a bit.

86
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,300
What have we been doing wasting our lives
with all this nonsense?
Right, okay, meeting adjourned for ever.

87
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Good Lord. I'm on film.

88
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
How did that happen?

89
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
It's film again. What's going on?

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,000
Gentlemen! I have bad news.

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,400
This room is surrounded by film.

92
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,800
We're trapped!

93
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,700
Don't panic, we'll get out of this.
We'll tunnel our way out.

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,700
Good thinking, sir. I'll get the horse.

95
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,500
Okay Captain, you detail three men,
start digging and load them up with cutlery,

96
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,900
and then we'll have a rota, we'll have
two hours digging, two hours vaulting
and then two hours sleeping, okay?

97
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,700
All right, Medwin, let's see you get over
that horse. Pick your feet up, Medwin.
Come on, boy!

98
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,300
Ze stupid English. Zey are prisoners
and all they do is the sport.

99
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,300
- One thing worries me, Fritz.
- Ja?

100
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,900
Where's the traditional cheeky
and lovable Cockney sergeant?

101
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,500
Cheer up, Fritz, it may never happen.

102
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,900
Good. Everything seems to be in order.

103
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,100
- Colonel! I've found another exit, sir.
- Okay, quickly, run this way.

104
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,300
If we could run that way...
Sorry.

105
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,800
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, excuse me.

106
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,100
 

107
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,900
Ah, hello. Well they certainly
seem to be in a tight spot,

108
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,400
and I spot... our next item

109
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,300
so let's get straight on with the fun
and go over to the next item

110
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
or dish! Ha ha!

111
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,700
Hello. 'Ow are you?

112
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,900
I'm fine.

113
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,100
Welcome to a new half-hour chat show

114
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,100
in which me, viz the man what's talking
to you now, and Brooky
- to wit my flat mate -

115
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,500
and nothing else, I'd like to emphasize that,
discuss current affairs issues
of burning import.

116
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,100
- Have you heard the one about
the 3 nuns in the nudist colony?
- Shut up. Tonight, the population explosion.

117
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,300
- Apparently there were these 3 nuns...
- Shut up.

118
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,000
Come the year 1991, given the present rate
of increase in the world's population,

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,900
the Chinese will be three deep.
Another thing...

120
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,700
Sorry, loves, sorry, the show is too long
this week and this scene's been cut.

121
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,500
Lord Hill's at the bottom of this.

122
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,100
But if you can find a piano stool
you can appear later on in the show on film.

123
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,300
- 'Ow much?
- Oh, about ten bob each?

124
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,200
- I wouldn't wipe me nose on it.
- 'Ave you 'eard the one about these 3 nuns...

125
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,100
Shh. I can hear something.

126
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,400
'Ang about, we may still get
in this show as a link.

127
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,800
- That's clever. How do they do that?
- Colour separation, you cotton head.

128
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,900
No, that's not right.

129
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Oh, what's this?

130
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,500
- 'lo British pig, we meet again!
- What?

131
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,700
That bitch! He spilled the entire
bottle of Chateau la Tour.

132
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,300
- Everything?
- It's a disaster!

133
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,900
- Over here, Sir William.
- Sir William, over here.

134
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,100
Now, stay there!

135
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,100
How do we get out of this?

136
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,500
No idea.

137
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,900
- Don't jump!
- What?

138
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,700
- Don't jump!
- The firemen are coming!
139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,300
- What?
- The firemen, don't jump!

140
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,900
- What?
- Don't jump!

141
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,500
My god, he's coming back!

142
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Well, they seem to be in another tight spot.

143
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,700
Could you...could you, could you
keep it down a little, please?

144
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Thank you so much.

145
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,200
Could you keep it down please...

146
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,100
Thank you.

147
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Well and now we move on to our, main course.
Prawn salad...

148
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,800
Prawn salad?

149
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,300
 

150
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,900
Well, if you'll just wait in here, sir,

151
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,500
I'm sure Mr Thompson
won't keep you waiting long.

152
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Fine. Thanks very much.

153
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,400
The mirror fell off the wall.

154
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,500
Sir?

155
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,500
The mirror fell off...
off the wall... it fell.

156
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
I see. You'd better wait here.

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,900
I'll get a cloth.

158
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,700
- Ah, it ... it came off the wall.
- Yes, sir?

159
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,800
- It just came right off the wall.
- Really, sir.

160
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,100
Yes, I ... I didn't touch it.

161
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,000
Of course not. It just fell off the wall.

162
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,300
Yes. It just fell off the wall.

163
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,400
Don't move. I'll get help.

164
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,800
Yes - er, fell off the wall.

165
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,400
Oh my God, what a mess.

166
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,000
- 'Ere, did you do this?
- No, no. I didn't do all this.
It... it did it all.

167
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,400
Oh? Well...

1680
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,200
'ere, hold this. I'll get started.

169
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,500
Oh, it's jolly nice. What is it?

170
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,200
It's a Brazilian dagger. Ooops!

171
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Er, she just fell on... on to the dagger.

172
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,000
- Yes, of course she did, sir.
- Yes,

173
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,400
just gave me the dagger and tripped,
and went, 'Oops'.

174
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,600
- Yes sir, I understand.
- I mean, I didn't er...

175
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,300
Oh no, no, of course not, sir, I understand.

176
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,600
- I mean she ... she just, er...
- Fell?

177
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm terribly sorry.

178
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,900
- That's him.
- Right, sir.

179
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Hello, officer.
There seems to have been an accident.

180
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,400
Well, several accidents actually.

181
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,000
That's right, sir.
Would you come this way, please.

182
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,600
Ahh! It's me ... me heart, sir.

183
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You swine. I'll get you for that.

184
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Er, I won't wait.

185
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I'll phone.

186
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,300
Sorry.

187
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,400
I think we're really out this time.
Yes. Jolly good.

188
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,600
Now where's the school hall?

189
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,800
- I think it's over there.
- Come on. Sorry. Jolly good.

190
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,200
'Oh, Mr Belpit.

191
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,200
Your legs are so swollen.'

192
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,800
Excuse me, is that the school hall?

193
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,100
Um, I'm sorry, I don't know.

194
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm not in this one,
I'm in next week's, I think.

195
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,900
Oh, come on.

196
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,200
'Oh, Mr Belpit! ...'

197
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,500
Oh, here we are.

198
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,400
 

199
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,400
Ah well, they seem to have
linked that themselves,

200
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
so there's no need for me
to interrupt at all.

201
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
So, ah, back to the school hall.

202
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,900
'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'.

203
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,800
'Tis time the seven Smith brothers
had brides.

204
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,600
Fetch me Smith Major.

205
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,800
Sir.

206
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,400
'Tis time you and your six brothers
were married.

207
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,600
Thank you, Headmaster.

208
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,100
Fetch me your six brothers,
that the seven brothers may be together.

209
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,700
Behold, the seven brothers.

210
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,900
Right, I'll see Watson, Wilkins, and Spratt

211
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,900
in my study afterwards.

212
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,400
But...

213
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,900
where shall we find seven brides
for seven brothers?

214
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
The Sabine School for Girls.

215
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,900
Yes, and it's the Annual Dance.

216
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Fetch hither the seven brides
for seven brothers.

217
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Behold the seven brides.

218
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,000
Fetch hither the padre
that the seven brides

219
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
may marry the seven brothers.

220
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,500
Fetch hither the master on duty
that the seven brides

221
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
may marry the seven brothers.

222
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,100
Sorry, I'm late, Headmaster
- I've been wrestling with Plato.

223
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,600
What you do in your own time, Padre,
is written on the wall in the vestry.

224
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,400
Right, do you 4 boys...

225
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,600
take these 2 girls to be your 7 brides?

226
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,300
- Yes, sir.
- Right, go and do your prep.

227
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,800
- I say, Teddy.
- You said something, Neddy?

228
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,200
- That's right, I did, Teddy.
- Well what is it, Neddy?

229
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,300
Piggybanks, Teddy.

230
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,600
Piggybanks, Neddy?

231
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,800
Yes, I want to hunt piggybanks, Teddy.

232
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
- You want to hunt piggybanks, Neddy?
- That's right, Teddy.

233
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,100
- I got him, Teddy.
- Time to bring home the bacon, Neddy.

234
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,300
That's not bacon,
that's sirloin, Teddy.

235
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,500
Can't be sirloin!
Not from a piggy, Neddy.

236
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,700
- But that's sirloin, Teddy.
- No it isn't, Neddy.

237
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,900
- Is, Teddy.
- Isn't, Neddy.

238
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,900
- Is, Teddy.
- Hmm... Looks like I've been
playing the fool, Neddy.

239
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,300
- That's all right, Teddy.
- Thanks, Neddy.

240
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,900
Doesn't matter at all...

241
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Good morning,
I'd care to purchase a chicken, please.

242
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,100
Don't come here with that posh talk
you nasty, stuck-up twit.

243
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,000
- I beg your pardon?
- A chicken, sir. Certainly.

244
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,200
Thank you. And how much does that
work out to per pound, my good fellow?

245
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Per pound, you slimy trollop,
what kind of a ponce are you?

246
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,500
- I'm sorry?
- 4/6 a pound, sir, nice and ready for roasting.

247
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,700
I see, and I'd care to purchase
some stuffing in addition, please.

248
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Use your own, you great poofy poonagger!

249
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,000
- What?
- Ah, certainly sir, some stuffing.

250
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,200
- Oh, thank you.
- 'Oh, thank you' says the great queen

251
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
like a la-di-dah poofta.

252
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,700
- I beg your pardon?
- That's all right, sir, call again.

253
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
- Excuse me.
- What is it now, you great pillock?

254
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,100
Well, I can't help noticing that
you insult me and then you're polite
to me alternately.

255
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
I'm terribly sorry to hear that, sir.

256
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,800
- That's all right. It doesn't really matter.
- Tough titty if it did,
you nasty spotted prancer.

257
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,800
Sorry, I asked for tea.

258
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,000
Thank you very much.

259
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,500
Well we've had the dessert and then,

260
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,900
and so the first item,

261
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,200
the last item on our menu of fun
is the coffee.

262
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,900
- Now I did ask for tea.
- But you just said coffee.

263
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,100
No, no, that was just my announcement,
just a metaphor.

264
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,800
We come... look would you mind
keeping it down, please...

265
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,400
we come as - as I said just now, to the coffee.

266
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,500
- Here, he said it again!
- Shut up!

267
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,900
This is Ken Clean-Air Systems, the great
white hope of the British boxing world.

268
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,400
After three fights, and only two convictions,

269
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,300
his manager believes that Ken is now ready
to face the giant American, Satellite Five.

270
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,300
The great thing about Ken is that
he's almost totally stupid.

271
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Every morning, he jogs the 47 miles from
his 2-bedroomed, 8-bathroom, 6-up-2-down,
3-to-go-house in Reigate,

272
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,500
to the Government's Pesticide Research Centre
at Shoreham.

273
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Nobody knows why.

274
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,700
Basically Ken is a very gentle,
home-loving person.

275
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,200
I remember when one of his stick insects
had a knee infection.

276
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,000
He stayed up all night rubbing it with
germoline and banging its head on the table.

277
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,300
Oh he was such a pretty baby, 

278
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,200
always so kind and gentle.
He was really considerate to his mother,

279
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,400
and not at all the kind of person

280
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,600
you'd expect to pulverize their opponent

281
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,000
into a bloody mass of flesh and raw bone,
spitting teeth and fragments of gum

282
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,500
into a ring which had become
one man's hell and Ken's glory.

283
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,400
Every morning at his little 3-room semi
near Reading, Ken gets up at three o'dock

284
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
and goes back to bed again
because it's far too early.

285
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,800
At seven o'clock Ken gets up,
he has a quick shower, a rub-down,

286
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,700
gets into his track-suit,
and goes back to bed again.

287
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,300
At 7.50 every morning Ken's trainer

288
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,500
runs the 13,000 miles from his 2-room
lean-to in Bangkok

289
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
and gets him up.

290
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,200
I used to wake Ken up with a crowbar
on the back of the head.

291
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,500
But I recently found that this was
too far from his brain

292
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,700
and I wasn't getting through to him anymore.

293
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,700
 So I now wake him up with a steel peg
driven into his skull with a mallet.

294
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,600
For breakfast every day,

295
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Ken places a plate of liver and bacon
under his chair,

296
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
and locks himself in the cupboard.

297
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,000
Well, he's having a lot of mental
difficulties with his breakfasts,

298
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,800
but this is temperament,

299
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,200
caused by a small particle
of brain in his skull,

300
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,200
and once we've removed that
he'll be perfectly all right.

301
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,800
At 8.30 the real training begins.

302
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,900
Ken goes back to bed
and his trainer gets him up.

303
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
At 10.30 every morning Ken arrives
at what he thinks is the gym.

304
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,300
Sometimes it's a sweetshop, sometimes it's
a private house. Today it's a hospital.

305
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Urn, straight down there.

306
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,000
Straight down there.

307
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
Straight down there.

308
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,800
For lunch, Ken crouches down
beside the road

309
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
and rubs gravel into his hair.

310
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,500
But lunch doesn't take long.

311
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,300
Ken's soon up on his feet and back to bed.

312
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,900
And his trainer has to run the 49,000 miles
from his 2-bedroom, 6-living-room tree-house

313
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,500
in Kyoto to wake him up.

314
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,000
Hello. When Ken is in
a really deep sleep like this one,

315
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
the only way to wake him up
is to saw his head off.

316
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,900
What is he like in the ring, this human dynamo,

317
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,100
this 18-stone bantam weight battering-ram?

318
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,300
We asked his sparring partner
and one-time childhood sweetheart,

319
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,500
Maureen Spencer.

320
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Well, I think that if Ken keeps his right up,

321
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,900
gets in with the left jab
and takes the fight to his man,

322
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:08,100
well, he should go for a cut eye in the 3rd
and put Wilcox on the canvas by 6th.

323
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,600
Ken's opponent in Tuesday's fight
is Petula Wilcox,

324
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,000
the Birmingham girl who was a shorthand typist
before turning pro in 1968.

325
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,100
She's keen on knitting
and likes Cliff Richard records.

326
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,300
How does she rate her chances against Ken?

327
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, I'm a southpaw and I think
this will confuse him,

328
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,800
particularly with his brain problem.

329
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,600
My lords, ladies and gedderbong!

330
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,700
On my right, from the town of Reigate

331
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,100
in the county of Kent, the heavyweight...

332
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,900
Mr Ken Clean-Air Systems!...

333
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
and on my left, Miss Petula Wilcox.

334
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,100
 

335
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,900
I think boxing's a splendid sport -
teaches you self-defense.

336
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,000
Obviously boxing must have its limits,

337
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,500
but providing they're both perfectly fit
I can see nothing wrong with one healthy man

338
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,500
beating the living daylights out of a
little schoolgirl; it's quick and it's fun.

339
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,100
Oh, no, he's gone. But he left a message.

340
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Jack! Where's that note that fellow left?

341
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,900
Oh, here you are.

342
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,400
It says...

343
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,600
'Sorry, had to catch the last bus.

344
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,400
Am on the 49b to Babbacombe.'

345
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,600
Oh, er, there you are. Hello.

346
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
You got the note, jolly good.

347
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,900
Well, um, that's all the items
that we have for you this week

348
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,900
and er, what a jolly nice
lot of items too, eh?

349
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,500
Um...well, the same team will be back
with you again next week with another menu
full of items.

350
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,500
Um...I don't know if I shall
be introducing the show next week

351
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,700
as I understand that my bits in this show

352
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,800
have not been received quite as well
as they might

353
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,800
but er, never mind, the damage is done

354
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
- no use in crying over spilt milk.

355
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,200
I've had my chance and I've muffed it.

356
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,500
Anyway, there we are.

357
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,500
I'm not really awfully good with words.
You see, I'm more of a visual performer.

358
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,700
I have a very funny - though I say so myself
- very funny funny walk.

359
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,000
I wish I'd been in that show.
I'd have done rather well.

360
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,400
But anyway, there we are - the show's over.

361
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,400
And...we'll all be - they'll all be back
with you again next week...

362
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Sorry.

363
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
I do beg your pardon.

364
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,800
I don't like these... displays of emotion.

365
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,800
... I wish it would say the end.

366
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
