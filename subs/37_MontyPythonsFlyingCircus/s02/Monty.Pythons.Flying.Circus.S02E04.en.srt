1
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,800
And now for something completely different.

2
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
It's...

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Hello, and welcome to the show.

5
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Without more ado, the first item

6
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,600
is a sketch about architects,

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,700
called The Architects Sketch...

8
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,500
The Architects Sketch...

9
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,000
The Architects Sketch...

10
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,500
The Architects Sketch...

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Up there!... Up there!...

12
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Up there!...

13
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,400
Gentlemen, we have two basic suggestions
for the design of this...

14
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,400
Gentlemen, we have two basic suggestions
for the design of this...

15
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,200
Shut up!

16
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,100
Gentlemen, we have two basic suggestions...

17
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,600
Gentlemen, we have two basic suggestions

18
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,100
for the design of this residential block,

19
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,200
and I thought it best

20
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,700
that the architects themselves came in
to explain the advantages of both designs.

21
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
That must be the first architect now.

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,300
Ah yes, it's Mr Wiggin of Ironside and Malone.

23
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,100
Good morning, gentlemen.

24
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,500
This is a twelwe-storey block combining
classical neo-Georgian features

25
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,700
with the advantages of modern design.

26
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,900
The tenants arrive in the entrance hall here,

27
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,200
and are carried along the corridor on a
conveyor belt in extreme comfort

28
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,200
and past murals depicting Mediterranean
scenes, towards the rotating knives.

29
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,800
The last twenty feet of the corridor
are heavily soundproofed.

30
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,400
The blood pours down these chutes
and the mangled flesh slurps into these...

31
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Excuse me...

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,500
Did you say knives?

33
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Rotating knives, yes.

34
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,900
Are you proposing to slaughter our tenants?

35
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,800
- Does that not fit in with your plans?
- No, it does not.
We asked for a simple block of flats.

36
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Oh, I see. I hadn't correctly divined
your attitude towards your tenants.

37
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,900
You see I mainly design slaughter houses.

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,700
Yes, pity. Mind you, this is a real beauty.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,900
I mean, none of your blood caked on the walls
and flesh flying out of the windows,
inconveniencing the passers-by with this one.

40
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,900
I mean, my life has been building up to this.

41
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,300
Yes, and well done,
but we did want a block of flats.

42
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,100
May I ask you to reconsider.
I mean, you wouldn't regret it.
Think of the tourist trade.

43
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,900
No, no, it's just that we wanted
a block of flats, not an abattoir.

44
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,400
Yes, well, of course, this is just the sort
of blinkered philistine pig ignorance

45
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,400
I've come to expect
from you non-creative garbage.

46
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,600
You sit there on your loathsome,
spotty behinds squeezing blackheads,

47
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
not caring a tinker's cuss
about the struggling artist.

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,300
You excrement!

49
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,000
You lousy hypocritical whining toadies

50
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
with your lousy colour TV sets
and your Tony Jacklin golf clubs

51
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,200
and your bleeding masonic handshakes!

52
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,700
You wouldn't let me join, would you,
you blackballing bastards.

53
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,300
Well I wouldn't become a freemason now

54
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,600
if you went down on your lousy, stinking,
purulent knees and begged me.

55
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,400
Well, we're sorry you feel like that
but we, er, did want a block of flats.

56
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,000
Nice though the abattoir is.

57
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,700
Oh the abattoir, that's not important.

58
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,400
But if any of you could put in a word
for me I'd love to be a freemason.

59
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
Freemasonry opens doors. I mean...

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,700
I was...I was a bit on edge just now,

61
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,400
but if I were a mason I'd sit at the back
and not get in anyone's way.

62
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,900
Thank you.

63
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,000
- I've got a second-hand apron.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,200
- I nearly got in at Hendon.
- Thank you.

65
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry about that, gentlemen.
The second architect is Mr Leavey
of Wymis and Dibble.

66
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Good morning gentlemen.
This is a scale model of the block.

67
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,400
There are 28 storeys, with
280 modern apartments.

68
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,100
There are 3 main lifts
and 2 service lifts.

69
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Access would be from Dibbingley Road.

70
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,500
The structure is built
on a central pillar system

71
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,800
with cantilevered floors in
pre-stressed steel and concrete. 

72
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,500
The dividing walls on each floor section

73
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,100
are fixed by recessed
magnalium flanged grooves.

74
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,100
By avoiding wood and timber derivatives

75
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,400
and all other flammables, we have
almost totally removed the risk of...

76
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
 

77
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,700
Quite frankly, I think the central pillar
system may need strengthening a bit.

78
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,000
- Isn't that going to put the cost up?
- It might.

79
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Well, I don't know whether I'd worry about
strengthening that much. After all,
they're not meant to be luxury flats.

80
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,200
I quite agree. I mean, providing the tenants
are of light build and relatively sedentary and,

81
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,400
given a spot of good weather,
I think we're on to a winner here.

82
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,600
Thank you.

83
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,500
Quite agree. Quite agree.

84
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,600
Thank you very much. Thank you.

85
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,400
It opens doors, I'm telling you.

86
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,600
Let's have a look at that handshake again
in slow motion.

87
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,600
What other ways are there
of recognizing a mason?

88
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,900
 

89
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,000
Having once identified a mason
immediate steps must be taken
to isolate him from the general public.

90
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,000
Having accomplished that, it is now
possible to cure him of these
unfortunate masonic tendencies

91
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,000
through the use of behavioural psychotherapy.

92
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,000
In this treatment, the patient is rewarded
for the correct response

93
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,900
and punished for the wrong one.
Let us begin.

94
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
 

95
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,000
Would you like to give up being a mason?

96
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Think carefully.

97
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,900
Think.

98
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,100
Think.

99
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,000
- No.
- No? That's wrong!

100
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,100
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

101
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,500
No! No! Bad! Bad!

102
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,000
The BBC would like to apologize
for the following announcement.

103
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:56,800
Oh! And the next item
is a sketch about insurance

104
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,200
called 'Insurance Sketch'.

105
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,900
'Insurance Sketch'...

106
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,900
'Insurance Sketch'...

107
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
What do you want?

108
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,900
 

109
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,300
Well I've come about your special fully
comprehensive motor insurance policy offer...

110
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,500
What was that?

111
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,800
Fully comprehensive motor insurance for
one-and-eightpence.

112
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
Oh, oh, yes...

113
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,200
yeah well, unfortunately, guv,
that offer's no longer valid.

114
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,900
You see, it turned out not to be
economically viable,

115
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,900
so we now have a totally new offer...

116
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,700
- What's that?
- A nude lady.

117
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,200
- A nude lady?
- Yes.

118
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,600
You get a nude lady with a fully
comprehensive motor insurance.

119
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,900
If you just want third party she has
to keep her bra on, and if it's just theft...

120
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,900
No, no, I don't really want that, Mr...

121
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,900
- Devious.
- Mr Devious.

122
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,500
I just want to know what it would cost me
to have a fully comprehensive inurance
on a 1970 Aston Martin.

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,700
- Aston Martin?
- Yes.

124
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,600
- 500 quid.
- 500 quid?

125
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,800
- 40 quid.
- 40 quid?

126
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,000
- Forty quid and a nude lady.
- No, no, I'm not interested in a nude lady.

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,700
- Dirty books?
- No, look, I'm not interested in any af that.

128
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,300
I just want to know what it would cost me
to have a fully comprehensive insurance
on a 1970 Aston Martin. 

129
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Can you please quote me your price?

130
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,200
Knock knock.

131
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,100
- Who's there?
- The Reverend...

132
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,900
- The Reverend who?
- The Reverend Morrison.

133
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,900
Oh, come in.

134
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,200
Now then, vic. What's the trouble?

135
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,000
- Well, it's about this letter you sent me.
- Excuse me, do I have any more lines?

136
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know, mush,
I'll have to look in the script...

137
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,900
Where are we? Show 8.

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
- Are you 'man'?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,900
No...no, you're finished.

140
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Well, I'll be off then.

141
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,400
'The vicar sits'.

142
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,100
It's about this letter you sent me
regarding my insurance claim.

143
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Oh, yeah, yeah - well, you see,

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it's just that we're not as yet... totally
satisfied with the grounds of your claim.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
But it says something about filling
my mouth in with cement.

146
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,700
Oh well, that's just insurance jargon,
you know.

147
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,700
But my car was hit by a lorry while standing
in the garage and you refuse to pay my claim.

148
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh well, reverend Morrison, in your policy...

149
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,900
in your policy...

150
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,900
Here we are.

151
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,400
It states quite clearly that
no claim you make will be paid.

152
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,400
You see, you unfortunately plumped
for our 'Neverpay' policy,

153
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,200
which, you know, if you never claim
is very worthwhile...

154
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,700
but you had to claim, and, well, there it is.

155
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
Oh dear, oh dear.

156
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Still, never mind - could be worse.
How's the nude lady?

157
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,400
Oh, she's fine.

158
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,200
Look, Rev... I hate to see a man cry,

159
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,700
so shove off out the office,
there's a good chap.

160
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,200
OK, Devious...Don't move!

161
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
The bishop!

162
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,800
 

163
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,100
 

164
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,300
 

165
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
 

166
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,100
 

167
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
 

168
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,900
 

169
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,100
 

170
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,500
I take as my text for today...

171
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,400
The text, vic! Don't say the text!

172
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Leviticus 3-14...

173
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,200
We was too late.
The Reverend Grundy bit the ceiling.

174
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,700
Hello? ... What?...

175
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,600
We'll be right over!

176
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,500
And it is for this reason that
the Christian Church lays upon you,
the godparents,

177
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,900
the obligation of seeing this child

178
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,900
is brought up in the Christian faith.

179
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,600
Therefore, I name this child...

180
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,100
Don't say the kid's name, vic!

181
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,400
Francesco Luigi...

182
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,700
We was too late...
The Rev. Neuk saw the light.

183
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,800
The ring, vic! Don't touch the ring!

184
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,500
Hey vic!

185
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,800
...dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

186
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,000
Help...

187
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,200
Help...

188
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,000
Help... Help...

189
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,200
Help...

190
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,100
Come on!

191
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,600
OK, Devious... Don't move!

192
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,400
The bishop!

193
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
 

194
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,600
 

195
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100
 

196
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
 

197
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,900
 

198
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,200
- This is where we came in.
- Yes.

199
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,900
Oh, it's nice to be home.

200
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,900
- Builders haven't been then.
- No.

201
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,400
These two old people are typical
of the housing problem

202
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
facing Britain's aged.

203
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,000
Here! Don't you start doing
a documentary on us, young man.

204
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,300
- Oh please ...
- No, you leave us alone!

205
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,800
Oh, just a little one about the
appalling conditions under which you live.

206
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
No! Get out of our house! Go on!

207
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,700
Oh all right. Come on, George, pick it up.

208
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Why don't you do a documentary about
the drug problem round in Walton Street?

209
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Oh, I'll go and have a bath.

210
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,200
The splendour fans on castle walls

211
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,200
And snowy summits old in story...

212
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,100
'Ere, there's Alfred Lord Tennyson
in the bathroom.

213
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,400
Well, at least
the poet's been installed, then.

214
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Yes, a poet is essential for complete
home comfort, and all-year round reliability
at low cost.

215
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,900
We in the East Midlands Poet Board

216
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
hope to have a poet in every home
by the end of next year.

217
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,100
Poets are both clean and warm
And most are far above the norm

218
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,500
Whether here, or on the roam
Have a poet in every home.

219
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,700
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high...

220
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,000
Morning, madam, I've come
to read your poet.

221
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,400
Oh yes, he's in the cupboard
under the stairs.

222
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
What is it, a Swinburne? Shelley?

223
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
- No, it's a Wordsworth.
- Oh, bloody daffodils.

224
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,000
A host of golden daffodils
Beside the lake, beneath the trees
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze

225
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,700
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the Milky Way
They stretch in...

226
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,800
- Right. Thank you, madam.
- Oh, not at all. Thank you...

227
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,500
It's a nice day, isn't it?

228
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Yes, yes, the weather situation
is generally favourable.

229
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,100
There's a ridge of high pressure
centered over Ireland

230
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,100
which is moving steadily eastward bringing
cloudy weather to parts of the West Country,

231
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,200
Wales and areas west of the Pennines.

232
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
On tomorrow's chart...

233
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,400
the picture is much the same.
With this occluded front bringing
drier, warmer weather.

234
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,500
Temperatures about average
for the time of year.

235
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,300
That's 3 degrees centigrade, 44 degrees
fahrenheit, so don't forget to wrap up well.

236
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,600
That's all from me. Goodnight.

237
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,200
Now on BBC television a choice of viewing.

238
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,900
On BBC 2 - a discussion on censorship
between Derek Hart,

239
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,800
The Bishop of Woolwich and a nude man.

240
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,000
And on BBC 1 - me telling you this.

241
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
And now...

242
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,600
We don't want that, do we.
Do you really want that cherry in your tea?

243
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,500
- Do you like doing this job?
- Well, it's a living, isn't it?

244
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,500
I mean, don't you get bored
reading people's poets all day?

245
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,100
Well, you know, sometimes ... yeah.

246
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,200
Anyway, I think I'd better be going.

247
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,300
You've got a nice torch, haven't you?

248
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,300
Er, yeah, yeah, it er...

249
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,700
It er... It goes on and off.

250
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,100
How many volts is it?

251
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,800
- Er ... um... well, I'll have a look
at the batteries.  - Oh yes, yes.

252
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,500
It's four and a half volts.

253
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Mmmm. That's wonderful.

254
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,800
- Do you want another look at the poet?
- No, no, I must be off, really.

255
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,800
I've got Thomas Hardy in the bedroom.
I'd like you to look at him.

256
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,200
- Well, I can't touch him. He's a novelist.
- Oh, he keeps mumbling all night.

257
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,200
- Oh well, novelists do, you see.
- Oh forget him! What's your name, deary?

258
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
- Harness.
- No, no! Your first name, silly!

259
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,000
- Wombat.
- Oh, Wombat. Wombat Harness!

260
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Take me to the place
where eternity knows no bounds,

261
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,200
where the garden of love encloses us round.

262
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,400
Oh Harness!

263
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,000
All right, I'll have a quick look
at yer Thomas Hardy.

264
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,400
Nude man, what did you make of that?

265
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,200
Well, don't you see, that was exactly
the kind of explicit sexual reference
I'm objecting to.

266
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,600
It's titillation for the sake of it.

267
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,600
A deliberate attempt at cheap sensationalism.

268
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,500
I don't care what the so-called avant-garde,
left-wing, intellectual namby-pambies say...

269
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It is filth!

270
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Bishop.

271
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Okay, don't anybody move!

272
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,500
 

273
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,100
 

274
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,000
 

275
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,500
 

276
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,400
The BBC would like to apologize for
the constant repetition in this show.

277
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,300
The BBC would like to apologize for
the constant repetition in this show.

278
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,800
 

279
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,500
 

280
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,300
 

281
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
I...

282
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
hope...

283
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
you're...

284
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,000
en...

285
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,200
joy...

286
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,400
ing...

287
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
this!

288
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,100
'tention; there's been a nasty
5 frog curse near the M4.

289
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Proceed immediately to the area.

290
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,200
- Oh dear...
- Looks bad!

291
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,800
Very bad.

292
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,500
Only one thing to do with
a multiple frog curse like this.

293
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,700
Get the magic wound.

294
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,200
Clear out the area.
Fire!

295
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,100
Thank you.

296
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:05,300
And now a sketch about a chemist

297
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,600
called 'The Chemist Sketch'.

298
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,600
 

299
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,100
Right. I've got some
of your prescriptions here.

300
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Er, who's got the pox?

301
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,100
Come on, who's got the pox...

302
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,100
Come on...

303
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
There you go.

304
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,000
Who's got a boil on the bum...

305
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,100
Boil on the botty?

306
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,800
Who's got the chest rash?

307
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,000
Have to get a bigger bottle.

308
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Who's got wind?

309
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,600
Catch.

310
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,300
The BBC would like to apologize for the
poor quality of the writing in that sketch.

311
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,700
It is not BBC policy to get easy laughs
with words like bum,

312
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,100
knickers, botty or wee-wees.

313
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,300
These are the words which are not
to be used again on this programme.

314
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 

315
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,700
 

316
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,500
 

317
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,700
 

318
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 

319
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,800
 

320
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,300
 

321
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,500
- Semprini!?
- Out!

322
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,900
Right, who's got a boil
on his Semprini, then?

323
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,500
 

324
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,400
- Good morning.
- I'd like some aftershave, please.

325
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,600
Ah, certainly. Walk this way, please.

326
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,900
If I could walk that way
I wouldn't need aftershave.

327
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,700
 

328
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,000
 

329
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,000
Good morning, sir. Can I help you?

330
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,100
- Yes. I'd like some aftershave.
- Ah. A toilet requisite-t-t-t-t-t...

331
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,100
Would you like to try this, sir?

332
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
It's our very very latest,
it's called Sea Mist.

333
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,300
- I quite like it.
- How about something a little more musky?
This one's called Mimmo.

334
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,800
- Not really, no. Have you anything
a little fishier?  - Fishier?

335
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Fishier. Fish, fish, fish.

336
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,600
A fishy requisite-t-t-t-t-t...

337
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,900
Like halibut or sea bass.

338
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
- Or bream?
- Yes.

339
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,100
No, we haven't got any of that...

340
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,300
Ah, I've got mackerel, or cod, or hake...

341
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
You haven't got anything
a little more halibutish?

342
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,200
Er... parrot?

343
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,300
What's that doing there?
Or skate with just a hint of prawn?

344
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,500
- Or crab, tiger and almonds, very unusual.
- I really had my heart set on halibut.

345
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Well, sir, we had a fishy consignment in
this morning, so I could nip down to

346
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,500
the basement and see if I can come up trumps
with this particular requisite-t-t-t-t-t.

347
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,200
So it was halibut... or... ?

348
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,000
- Sea bass.
- Sea bass. Won't be a moment.

349
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,300
Sorry about this...

350
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,500
Normally we try to avoid these little...
pauses... longueurs...

351
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,300
only dramatically he's gone down
to the basement, you see.

352
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,300
'Course, there isn't really a basement
but he just goes off and we pretend...

353
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,000
Actually what happens is he goes off there,
off camera, and just waits there

354
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,300
so it looks as though he's gone down...
to the basement.

355
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,700
Actually I think he's rather overdoing it.
Ah!

356
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,100
Well, sorry, sir. Lot of steps.

357
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,900
Well, I'm afraid it didn't come in
this morning, sir. But we have got some
down at our Kensington branch.

358
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,300
I'll just nip down there and get it for you.

359
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,600
- How long will that be?
- 20 minutes.

360
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,300
20 minutes?

361
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,700
Oh... I wonder what other people use
for aftershave lotion?

362
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,300
I use a body rub called Halitosis

363
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,200
to make my breath seem sweet.

364
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,500
I use an aftershave called Semprini.

365
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm sorry, sorry - can't stop now,
I've got to get to Kensington.

366
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,000
I use two kinds of aftershave lotions:
Frankincense, Myrrh...

367
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,600
three kinds of aftershave lotions:
Frankincense, Myrrh, Sandalwood...

368
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,900
four kinds of aftershave lotion:
Frankincense, ...

369
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,300
I have a cold shower every morning
just before I go mad, and then I go

370
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:43,000
Mad, 1. Mad, 2. Mad, 3. Mad, 4...

371
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,100
I use Rancid Polecat number two.

372
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,800
It keeps my skin nice and scaly.

373
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,300
Sorry again. Can't stop, got to get back.

374
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,200
 

375
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Well I'm afraid they don't have any
at our Kensington branch.
But we have some down at the depot.

376
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,200
- Where's that?
- Aberdeen.

377
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
- Aberdeen?
- It's all right. Wait here, I got a car.

378
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,100
- No, no, no. I'll take the other,
the crab, tiger and...
- Almond requisite... t... t... ?

379
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
I'll take it.

380
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,200
Right. Right! RIGHT!

381
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Now then! Now then!

382
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,400
- Your turn.
- Aren't you going to say
'What's all this then?'?

383
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Oh! Right, what's all this, then?

384
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,800
- This man has been shoplifting, officer.
- Oh, he has? Yes?

385
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,500
- Are you trying to tell me my job?
- No, but he's been shoplifting.

386
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,400
Look! I must warn you that
anything you may say will be ignored

387
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:51,200
and furthermore, given half a chance
I'll put my fist through your teeth.
F'tang. F'tang.

388
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,400
- But officer, this man here...
- I've had enough of you. You're under arrest.

389
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Officer, it wasn't him.
He's the shoplifter.

390
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,700
- No I'm not.
- He's not ... I'm a witness.

391
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,500
One more peep out of you
and I'll do you for heresy.

392
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,000
Heresy. Blimey.
I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.

393
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,100
Shut up! F'tang. F'tang.

394
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,600
Oh, that's nice.

395
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,100
- Right. I'm taking you along to the station.
- What for?

396
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,700
I'm charging you with illegal possession
of whatever we happen to have down there.

397
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,200
Right. Lunar module calling Buzz Aldrin.
Come in.

398
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,400
Raindrops keep falling on my head...
but that doesn't mean that my...

399
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:36,100
The BBC would like to apologize
to the police about the character
of Police Constable Pan Am.

400
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,900
He was not meant to represent
the average police officer.

401
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,300
Similarly, the reference to Buzz Aldrin,
the astronaut,

402
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,700
was the product of a disordered mind
and should not be construed
as having any other significance.

403
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,700
And now for something completely different.

404
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,300
Oh that was fun.

405
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,400
And now...

406
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,100
