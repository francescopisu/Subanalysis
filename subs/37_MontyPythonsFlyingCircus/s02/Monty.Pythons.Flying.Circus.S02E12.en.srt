00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:53,938
And now for something
completely different...

3
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,540
It's...

4
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:03,681
Monty python's flying circus.

5
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:32,576

Shh! shh!

9
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,501
Uh... hah...

10
00:03:57,535 --> 00:04:00,671
I will not buy this record.

11
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:02,173
It is scratched.

12
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:03,574
Sorry?

13
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:07,511
I will not buy this record.

14
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,079

18
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:17,788
I will not buy
this tobacconist's.

19
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:19,690
It is scratched.

20
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:21,025
No, no, no, no.

21
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:22,693
Tobacco.

00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:24,028

My hovercraft is full of eels.

26
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,539
My hovercraft...

27
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:36,874
Is full of eels.

28
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,375

Bouncy bouncy?

Would you hold it against me?

39
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:06,704

Ah! you have

That on the 28th day of may,

You did willfully, unlawfully,
and with malice aforethought

69
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:46,070
Publish an alleged
english/hungarian phrase book

70
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:47,404
With intent

71
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:49,373
To cause a breach
of the peace.

72
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:50,374
How do you plead?

73
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:51,509
Not guilty.

74
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:54,211
You live at 46 horton terrace?

00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,846
I do live at 46 horton terrace.

76
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,414
You are the director
of a publishing company?

77
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:59,049
I am the director
of a publishing company.

78
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,584
Your company
publishes phrase books?

79
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,186
My company does publish
phrase books.

80
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:03,721
You did say 46 horton terrace,
did you?

81
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:04,388
Yes.

82
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:05,656
Hah! got him!

83
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:07,892
Get on with it.

84
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,193
Get on with it.

85
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:10,528
Yes, m'lord.

86
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,296
On the 28th day of may

87
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,765
You published
this phrase book.

88
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:16,133
I did.

89
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,801
I quote an example.

90
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:19,737
The hungarian phrase
meaning

91
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,139
"can you direct me
to the station"

92
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:24,608
Is translated
by the english phrase

93
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:28,312
"please fondle my bum."

94
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:31,048
I wish to plead incompetence.

95
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:34,885
Please, may I ask for
an adjournment, m'lord?

96
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,089
Adjournment? certainly not.

97
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,497
Why on earth didn't you say
why you wanted an adjournment?

98
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,436
I didn't know an acceptable legal
phrase, m'lord.

99
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:57,041
If there's any more stock film
of women applauding

100
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:58,709
I shall clear the court.

101
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:02,346
Call abigail tesler.

102
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:05,082
M'lord, this

103
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:05,783
Is it?

104
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,218
Yes, m'lord.

105
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,320

106
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:11,155
Where they're
upside down about her.

107
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:13,390
Those aussies certainly
know a thing or two

108
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:14,992
When it comes to beach belles.

109
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:18,128
Bet some lifesaver wouldn't mind
giving her the kiss of life.

110
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:20,064
So watch out for the sharks,
abigail.

111
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:22,166
Journalist

And grievous bodily harm
at gray's inn.

120
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:42,186
And with cases like he's won

121
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,622
We bet gray's in
when nelson's around.

122
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,290

Tonight is indeed
a unique occasion

129
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,979
In the history of television.

00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:17,748
We are very privileged
and deeply honored

131
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:20,384
To have with us in the studio

Founder of modern socialism

133
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:24,722
And author

134
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,156
Vladimir ilich ulyanov

142
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:45,943

143
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,444
"the hammers."

144
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:54,451
"'the hammers' is the nickname
of what english football team?"

145
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:56,086
The hammers?

146
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,189
No? well, bad luck there, karl.

147
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,823
So we go on to you, che.

148
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:01,458
Che guevara.

149
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:05,362

150

No?

151
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:08,866
I'll throw it open.

152
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,937
"coventry city last won
the f.a. cup in what year?"

153
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,806
No? well, I'm not surprised
you didn't get that.

154
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,741
It was in fact a trick question.

155
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,277
Coventry city have never won
the f.a. cup.

156
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,179

00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,384
"a what struggle?"

185
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:34,552
A political struggle.

186
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:36,854
Yes. yes.

187
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,255
One final question, karl

188
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,858
And the beautiful lounge suite
will be yours.

189
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:42,226
You going to have a go?

190
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,327
You're a brave man.

191
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,129
Karl marx,
your final question:

192
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:47,765
"who won the cup final
in 1949?"

193
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:51,101
Uh... the workers control
the means of production.

194
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:53,637
The struggle
of the urban proletariat.

195
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:56,140
No. it was in fact
wolverhampton wanderers

196
00:12:56,173 --> 00:13:00,010
Who beat leicester 3-1.

197
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,901
Ah. thank you.

198
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:26,337
Just the word
I was looking for.

199
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,339
"I wonder," said la farge

200
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:30,508
"just how much molineux."

201
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,675
Hey!

202
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,812
That's the bad jokes.

203
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:38,516
And now a bit of fun.

204
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:21,725
Jenkins?

205
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,127
Yes, sarge?

206
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,829
What you gonna do when
you get back to blighty?

207
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:27,131
I don't know, sarge.

208
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:29,366
I 'spect I'll be looking
after me mum.

209
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,235
She'll be getting on
a bit now.

210
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:33,170
Got family of your
own, have you?

211
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,305
No, she's...

212
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:36,073
She's all I got left now.

213
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:37,975
My wife doreen, she...

214
00:14:38,008 --> 00:14:39,310
I got a letter.

215
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,145
You don't have
to tell me, son.

216
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:43,047
No, sarge, I'd like
to tell you.

217
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,281
See... this place...

218
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:45,349
Hold it!

219
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:46,650
Hold it!

220
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,620
Look, loves, can anyone
not involved in this scene

221
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:50,888
Please leave the set?

222
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,189
Now, come on. please.

223
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,258
Anyone not concerned
in this scene.

224
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,893
The canteen's open
upstairs.

225
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:57,194
Now, come on, please.

226
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:58,529
Sorry, loves, sorry.

227
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:01,565
We'll have to take it again
from the top, all right?

228
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,566
Okay.

229
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,935
Cue!

230
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,239
Hold it!

231
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:09,240
Hold it!

232
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:10,941
Now, who changed the caption?

233
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,776
Can whoever changed the caption

234
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,212
Put the right one back
immediately, please?

235
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:21,685
Right. all right, we'll
take it again from the top. cue.

236
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:22,686
Hold it!

237
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,954
Hold it!

238
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:25,589
Come on, come on,
out of there!

239
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:26,724
You're not in this.

240
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:28,759
You're just holding
the whole thing up.

241
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:29,860
Come on, please.

242
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:31,662
It's no good, loves,
it's no good.

243
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:33,330
We'll have to leave
it for now.

244
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:35,766
Come back when everyone's
settled down a bit.

245
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,536
So that means we go over
to the art room, all right?

246
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:41,539
So, cue camera three.

247
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,541
Sorry! camera four.

248
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:45,242
Aren't they marvelous?

249
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:46,243
Yes, yes.

250
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:48,379
The strength and boldness...

251
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:51,315
Life and power
in those colors.

252
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:53,484
This must be
titian's masterpiece.

253
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:56,487
Oh, indeed, if only for
the composition alone.

254
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,856
The strength
of those foreground figures

255
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,758
The firmness of the line.

256
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:07,598
Yes, the confidence of a master
at the height of his powers.

257
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:17,241
Yes?

258
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:18,976
Hello, sonny.
your dad in?

259
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,277
Yes.

260
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:21,679
Could I speak
to him, please?

261
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:23,180
It's the man
from "the hay-wain."

262
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:24,348
Who?

263
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,483
The man from "the hay-wain"
by constable.

264
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,485
Dad! it's the man
from "the hay-wain"

265
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,854
By constable
to see you.

266
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:32,456
Coming.

267
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:42,366
Hello.

268
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,868
How are you?
come on in.

269
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,302
Oh, no, no.
can't stop.

270
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,004
Just passing by, actually.

271
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,539
Oh. where are you now?

272
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:49,974
Well may you ask.

273
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:52,510
We've just been moved in
next to a roomful of bruegels.

274
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:55,079
Terrible bloody din--
skating all hours of the night.

275
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:56,914
Anyway, I've just dropped in
to tell you

276
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:58,949
There's been a walkout
in the impressionists.

277
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,518
Walkout, eh?

278
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:02,920
Yeah. it started with
the dejeuner sur l'herbe lot.

279
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:04,421
Evidently, they were moved away

280
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,156
From above the radiator
or something.

281
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,992
Anyway, the impressionists
are all out.

282
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:10,794
Gainsborough's blue boy's brought out
the 18th-century english portraits

283
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:13,430
The flemish school's solid, and the german
woodcuts are at a meeting now.

284
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,533
Right. well, I'll get
the renaissance school out.

285
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,568
Okay. meeting 4:30--
"bridge at arles."

286
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,136
Okay. cheerio.
good luck, son.

287
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,371
Good luck.

288
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:21,672
Right. everybody out!

289
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:23,641
I'm off.

290
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:25,042
I'm off.

291
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:27,545
I'm off.

292
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:29,713
I'm off.

293
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:32,283
I'm off, dear.

294
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:34,385
I'm off.

295
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,253
I'm off, too.

296
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,923
I'm off.

297
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:40,758
Here is the news.

298
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,259
By an almost unanimous vote

299
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:44,094
paintings
in the national gallery

300
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:45,696
voted to continue the strike

301
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,998
that has emptied frames
for the last week.

302
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:50,100
The man from constable's
"the hay-wain"

303
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:52,336
said last night
that there was no chance

304
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,939
of a return to the pictures
before the weekend.

305
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:58,075
Sir kenneth clarke has said
he will talk to any painting

306
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:02,346
if it can help bring
a speedy end to the strike.

307
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,548
At sotheby's,
prices dropped dramatically

308
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:06,951
as leading figures
left their paintings.

309
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:08,652
What am I bid for vermeer's

310
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,088
"lady who used to be
at a window"?

311
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:12,356
Do I hear two bob?

312
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:13,357
Two bob!

313
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,592
Gone.

314
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,161
Now what am I bid
for another great bargain--

315
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:19,196
Edwin landseer's
"nothing at bay"?

316
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,464
All we bloody want

317
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:23,167
Is a little bit
of bloody consultation.

318
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,104
At a mass meeting
at brentford football ground

319
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:29,940
Other works of art
voted to come out

320
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:32,176
In support of the paintings.

321
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,178
The vote was unanimous...

322
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:36,947
With one abstention.

323
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,549
Meanwhile at television centre

324
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,918
work began again
on a sketch about ypres.

325
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,921
A spokesman for the sketch
said he fully expected it

326
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:48,359
to be more sensible this time.

327
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:55,766
Jenkins?

328
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,800
Yes, sarge?

329
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:57,868
What you gonna do

330
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,436
When you get back
to blighty?

331
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,871
I don't know, sarge.

332
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:02,373
I 'spect I'll look
after me mum.

333
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:03,841
She'll be getting on
a bit now.

334
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:06,177
Got a family of
your own, have you?

335
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,946
No. she-she's all
I got left now.

336
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:10,781
My wife doreen, she...

337
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:12,216
I got a letter.

338
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:13,717
You don't have
to tell me, son.

339
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:15,319
No, sarge,
I'd like to tell you.

340
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:17,454
You see, this bloke
from up the street...

341
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:18,556
Okay, chaps.

342
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:19,957
At ease.

343
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,692
I've just been
up the line.

344
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:23,227
Can we get
through, sir?

345
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,395
No. I'm afraid
we'll have to make

346
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:25,429
A break for it
at nightfall.

347
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:26,430
Right, sir.

348
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:27,431
We're all with you.

349
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:28,465
Yes, I know.

350
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,000
That's just the
problem, sergeant.

351
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,235
How many are
there of us?

352
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:33,270
Well, sir, there's
you, me, jenkins

353
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:35,306
Padre, kipper--
there's five, sir.

354
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:39,176
And only rations
for...

355
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,011
Four, sir.

356
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:42,046
Precisely.

357
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,714
I'm afraid one of us

358
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:48,619
Will have to take
the other way out.

359
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:53,257
I'm a goner, major.

360
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,358
Leave me.

361
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:56,961
I'm... I'm not
a complete man anymore.

362
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:59,830
You've lost both
your arms as well.

363
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:02,199
Yes.

364
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:04,001
Damn silly, really.

365
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,870
No, no, we'll draw for it.

366
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,672
That's the way we do
things in the army.

367
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:09,673
Sergeant, the straws.

368
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:12,276
Righto.

369
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:14,478
All right.

370
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:17,715
Now, the man who gets
the shortest straw

371
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:20,184
Knows what to do.

372
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:21,919
Looks like

373
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:22,887
You, sir.

374
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,655
Is it? oh, what did we say--

375
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:26,423
"the longest straw," was it?

376
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:27,925
No. shortest, sir.

377
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,393
Well, we better
do it again.

378
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:31,595
There's obviously been
a bit of a muddle.

379
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:34,598
There we go.

380
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:43,073
Best of three?

381
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:51,949
Right.

382
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:56,387
Well, I got
the shortest straw, so...

383
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,224
I decide what means we use
to decide who's going to do...

384
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:03,160
To-to-to, uh, to, uh,
to do the thing...

385
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,828
To do the right thing.

386
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:07,965
Now, rank doesn't enter
into this.

387
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:10,901
But obviously, if I should
get through the lines

388
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:15,272
I'll be in a very good position
to recommend anyone very highly

389
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:18,976
For a posthumous v.c.

390
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,651
No? good, fine.

391
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:29,086
Fine, fine,
fine, fine.

392
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,589
Right.

393
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:35,159
Dip, dip, dip,
my little ship

394
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:37,628
Sails on the ocean,
you are...

395
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:38,762
No, no, wait
a minute.

396
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:41,632
Um... i-i-i must have
missed out a dip.

397
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:42,666
We'll start again.

398
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,637
Dip, dip, dip, dip,
my little ship

399
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,539
Sails on the ocean,
you are...

400
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,140
No, this is not
working out.

401
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:51,575
It-it's not
working out.

402
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,177
Uh, what-what
shall we do?

403
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,179
How about
one potato, two potato, sir?

404
00:21:55,212 --> 00:21:56,847
Don't be childish,
jenkins.

405
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:59,617
No, um, I think-
I think fisties

406
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,318
Would be best.

407
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:04,088
Okay? so, uh,
hands behind backs.

408
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:07,157
After "three," okay?

409
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:10,461
One, two, three!

410
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:13,330
Now, what's this?

411
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:16,300
Uh, stone, stone, stone
and scissors.

412
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,537
Now, uh, scissors
cut everything, don't they?

413
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,671
Not stones, sir.

414
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:24,875
They're very good
scissors.

415
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:27,077
And padre
hasn't been!

416
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:28,913
No arms, sir.

417
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:30,548
Oh, I'm
terribly sorry.

418
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,816
I-i-i-i'm afraid
I didn't, um...

419
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,553
Tell you what--
all those people

420
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:37,721
Who don't want
to stay here

421
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:42,393
And shoot themselves.
raise their arms.

422
00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:43,661
Stop it! stop it!

423
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:46,130
Stop this... this
hideous facade.

424
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:47,665
E... easy, padre.

425
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:48,999
No, no, I must speak.

426
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,434
When i... when I came

427
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,469
To this war, I had two arms--
two good arms

428
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,672
But when the time came to...
to lose one, i...

429
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:58,108
I gave it-- I gave it gladly.

430
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:59,877
I smiled as they cut it off

431
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,180
Because I knew there was
a future for mankind. i...

432
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:05,616
I knew there was hope

433
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:09,019
So long as men were prepared
to give their limbs!

434
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:12,957
And when the time came for me
to give my other arm, i...

435
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,525
I gave it gladly, i...

436
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,261
I sang as they sawed it off,
because I believed--

437
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:19,330
Oh, you may laugh!--

438
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:22,867
But I believed
with every fiber of my body

439
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,003
With every drop of rain
that falls

440
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:29,640
A... a flower grows.

441
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,343
And that flower--

442
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:36,313
That small, agile,
delicate flower--

443
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:38,582
Shall burst forth

444
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,618
To give a new life

445
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,854
A new strength!

446
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:04,441
...there is freedom--
freedom from fear

447
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:07,711
Freedom from oppression
and freedom from tyranny.

448
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:11,282
A world where men and women
of all races and creeds

449
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:13,017
Can live together in communion.

450
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,286
And then in the twilight
of this life

451
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:19,190
Our children
and our children's children...

452
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:20,324
Our patients here

453
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:22,593
Are suffering
from severe overacting.

454
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:23,594
Argh! jim, lad!

455
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:26,330
Argh! jim, lad!

456
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:29,533
When they're brought in,
they're all really over the top.

457
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,803
It's our job to try and treat
the condition of overacting.

458
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:34,471
Rather serious.

459
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:38,809
This is the richard iii ward.

460
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:46,984
A horse. a horse.

461
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:50,354
My kingdom for a horse.

462
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:52,890
Most of these cases
are pretty unpleasant.

463
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:53,991
A horse!

464
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:55,092
Nurse?

465
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,160
A horse!

466
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:59,029
My kingdom for...

467
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,432
But the treatment does work
with some people.

468
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:02,566
This chap came to us

469
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,735
Straight from the
chichester festival.

470
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,105
We operated just in time,
and now he's almost normal.

471
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:10,007
A horse, a horse.

472
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,878
My kingdom for a horse.

473
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:20,117
Argh! argh!
argh! argh!

474
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,454
Argh! argh!
argh! argh!

475
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:26,323
But, uh, in here,
we have some very nasty

476
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:28,259
Cases, indeed.

477
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:31,795
To be or not to be.

478
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:36,033
That is the question.

479
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:40,404
To be...
to be...

480
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:43,007
Oh.
oh.

481
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:10,668
Good evening.

482
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:14,972
First, take a bunch of flowers:

483
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:19,643
Pretty begonias, irises,
freesias

484
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,479
And cry-manthesums.

485
00:26:22,513 --> 00:26:24,215
Then...

486
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:26,183
Arrange them...

487
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,685
Nicely...

488
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:29,320
In a vase!

489
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:31,288
Oh, get in!

490
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:32,756
Get in!

491
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,926
Get in! oh...!

492
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,598
Shh!

493
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:45,769
Morning.

494
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:47,505
Morning!

495
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,139
What you got, then?

496
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:51,575
Well, there's egg and bacon.

497
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,577
Uh, egg, sausage and bacon.

498
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,945
Egg and spam.

499
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,814
Egg, bacon and spam.

500
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:59,783
Egg, bacon, sausage
and spam.

501
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:01,886
Spam, bacon, sausage and spam.

502
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,522
Spam, egg, spam, spam,
bacon and spam.

503
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:05,990
Spam, spam

504
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:07,825
Spam, egg and spam.

505
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:11,462
Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam,
spam, baked beans

506
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:13,130
Spam, spam, spam
and spam.

507
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:16,233
Or lobster thermidor
aux crevettes with mornay sauce

508
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,670
Garnished with truffle pate,
brandy, and a fried egg on top

509
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:20,838
And spam.

510
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:23,541
Have you got anything
without spam in it?

511
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:25,743
Well, spam, egg, sausage
and spam.

512
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:27,678
It's not got much spam in it.

513
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:29,013
I don't want any spam!

514
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:31,715
Why can't she have
egg, bacon, spam and sausage?

515
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:33,017
That's got spam in it!

516
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,519
Not as much as spam,
egg, sausage and spam.

517
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:39,290
Look, could I have egg,
bacon, spam and sausage

518
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:40,491
Without the spam?

519
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:41,392
Ugh!

520
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:42,960
What do you mean "ugh"?

521
00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:44,428
I don't like spam!

522
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:47,631
Spam, spam, spam, spam
spam, spam, spam, spam

523
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,200
Lovely spam!

524
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,868
Wonderful spam!

525
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:52,469
Lovely spam!
wonderful spam!

526
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:54,471
Shut up! shut up!

527
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:57,241
Shut up! shut up! lovely spam!
wonderful spam!

528
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:59,643
You can't have egg,
bacon, spam and sausage

529
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,744
Without the spam.

530
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,046
Why not?!

531
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,515
Well, it wouldn't be egg,
bacon, spam and sausage

532
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:05,516
Would it?

533
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:06,917
I don't like spam!!!

534
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,620
Oh, don't make a fuss, dear.
I'll have your spam.

535
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,856
I love it! I'm having
spam, spam, spam, spam, spam...

536
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:13,557
Spam, spam, spam, spam
spam, spam, spam, spam...

537
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,959
...spam, baked beans,
spam, spam and spam!

538
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:15,993
Baked beans are off.

539
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:17,795
Well, can I have
spam instead?

540
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:19,430
You mean spam, spam,
spam, spam...

541
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:21,699
Spam, spam, spam, spam
