1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
And now, for something completely different.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,900
It's...

3
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,500
FACE THE PRESS

4
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,700
Hello. Tonight on "Face the press"
we're going to examine two different views
of contemporary things.

5
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,400
On my left, is the Minister for Home Affairs...

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,500
who is wearing a striking organza dress
in pink tulle, with matching pearls
and a diamante collar necklace. 

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,100
The shoes are in brushed pigskin with
gold clasps, by Maxwell of Bond Street. 

8
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,500
The hair is by Roger, and the whole
ensemble is crowned by a spectacular display
of Christmas orchids. 

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,100
And on my right, putting the case against the
government, is a small patch of brown liquid

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,600
which could be creosote or some extract
used in industrial varnishing. 

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,300
Good evening. Minister,
may I put the first question to you?

12
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,200
In your plan "A better Britain for us",
you claim that you would build

13
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,900
88 000 million billion houses a year
in the Greater London area alone. 

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,100
In fact, you've built only 3
in the last 15 years.

15
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,800
- Are you a bit disappointed with this result?
- No, no.

16
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,900
I'd like to answer this question,
if I may, in two ways.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,900
Firstly, in my normal voice, then
in a kind of silly high-pitched whine.

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,300
Well, while the Minister
is answering this question,

19
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,300
I'd just like to point out the minister's
dress has been made entirely by hand

20
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,100
from over 300 pieces of Arabian shot silk 

21
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,300
especially threaded for the Minister
by Vargar's, of París.

22
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,100
The low slim-line has been cut
off-the-shoulder to heighten the effect
of the minister's fine bone structure.

23
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,700
Well I think the minister is coming
to the end of his answer now 

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,700
so let's go back over and join the discussion.
Thank you very much, Minister.

25
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,800
Today saw the appointment of a new head of...

26
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,100
- Don't I say any more?
- No fear!

27
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,000
Today saw the appointment of a new Head
of Allied Bomber Command.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Air Chief Marshal
sir Vincent 'Kill the Japs' Forster.
He's in our Birmingham studio...

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,700
Hello Sailors! Listen, guess what. 

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,700
The Minister of Aviation has made me
head of the RAF Ola Pola.

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,300
Hello. Mrs. Rogers?

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,200
No!
Ooh, I must be in the wrong house!

33
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,300
So from now on we're going
to do things my way.

34
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,700
For a start David Hockney is going to design
the bombs. And I've seen the plans...

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,900
That must be the new gas cooker.

36
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,900
NEW COOKER SKETCH

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,300
- Morning! Mrs. G. Crump?
- No, Mrs. G. Pinnet.

38
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,500
- This is 46 Egernon Crescent?
- No, Road! Egernon Road.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,700
Road, yes, says here. Yeah. Right,
could I speak to Mrs G. Crump please?

40
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,100
There's nobody here of that name.
It's Mrs. G. Pinnet, 46 Egernon Road.

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,000
- It says Crump here, don't it Harry?
- Yes, it's on the invoice.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,700
Yes, definitively Crump.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,300
Well there must have been a mistake, because
the address is right, and that's definitely
the cooker I ordered - a blue and white CookEasi.

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,200
- Well you can't have this. This is Crump.
- Oh dear, what are we going to do?

45
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,600
Well I don't know. What we can do for you
is take it back to the Depot,

46
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,700
get a transfer slip from Crump to Pinnet,
and put it on a special delivery.

47
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Yeah, that's best. We'll special it
for you, we'll get it down there today
and you'll get it back in 10 weeks.

48
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,700
Ten weeks! Blimey, can't you just leave this one?

49
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,600
- What, this ? What, leave it here?
- Yes.

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,600
- Well I dunno. I suppose we could.
- She'd have to fill out a temporary dispatch note.

51
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,900
- We could leave it on a temporary dispatch note.
- Well that's sorted out then. What a mess...

52
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,400
I know, it's ridiculous really, but there you are.
Glad we could be of such a help. 

53
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,700
- Would you sign it down there please, Mrs Crump?
- Pinnet.

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,900
Listen, just for the books to make it
a bit easier, could you sign it Crump-Pinnet?

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,300
Right. Thank you very much, dear. The cooker's yours.

56
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,600
Sorry about the bother... but there you are ...
You know ... cheerio!

57
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,700
Hey, excuse me! Cooey! 

58
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,200
- Er, can you put it in the kitchen?
- You what?

59
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,200
- Well I can't cook on it unless it's connected up.
- We didn't realize you had an installation invoice.

60
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,000
- An MI.
- No, we can't touch it without an MI, you see.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,900
- Or a R16.
- If it's a special.

62
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,200
- No, it's not special. Special's back at the Depot.
- No, the special's the same as installation invoice.

63
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,400
- So it's an R16.
- What is an installation invoice?

64
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,400
- A pink form from Reading.
- We wondered what that was. Now these are the forms.

65
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,500
That's the one, love. This should be all I need.
Hang on. This is for Pinnet. Mrs G. Pinnet.

66
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,500
- That's right, I'm Mrs. G. Pinnet.
- Well we've got Crump-Pinnet on the invoice.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
- Shall I sign it Crump-Pinnet then?
- No no no, not an MI., no!

68
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,500
- No - that's from Area Service at Reading.
- No, Cheltenham isn't it?

69
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,600
- No, not this side of the street.
- Look, I just want it connected up!

70
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,600
- What about London Office?
- Well they haven't got the machinery.

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,900
- Not now.
- What! The Hounslow Depot?

72
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,200
- No, they're still on standard pressure.
- Same with Twickenham.

73
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,700
- Surely you can connect up a gas cooker.
- Oh yeah, we could connect it up, love,
but not unless it's an emergency.

74
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,100
- But this is an emergency!
- No it's not. An emergency is 290... 

75
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,500
'where there is actual or apparent loss
of combustible gaseous substances'.

76
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,200
- Yes, like a leak.
- Yes, or a 478.
- No, that's valve adjustment. 

77
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,700
But there can't be a leak unless
you've connected it up!

78
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,100
- No, quite, we'd have to turn it on.
- Can't you turn it on and connect it up?

79
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,000
No. What we can do, this is between you and me,
I shouldn't really be telling you this,

80
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,200
we'll turn your gas on, make a hole in your pipe,

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,800
you ring Hounslow emergency,
they'll be around here in a couple of days.

82
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,700
What, a house full of gas! I'll be dead by then.

83
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,900
Oh well, in that case you'd have the South East
Area Manager round here like a shot.

84
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Ah yes. 'One or more persons overcome by fumes',
you'd have Head Office, Holbom, round here.

85
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
- Really?
- Yes, that's murder you see.

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,200
- Or a suicide.
- No, that's S42.

87
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,600
Still, I thought it was Hainault.

88
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,600
No, Central area and Southall Marketing Division,
they're both on the S42 now.

89
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,500
- And they'd be able to connect it up?
- Oh, they'd do the lot for you, love.

90
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,300
- And they'd come round this afternoon?
- Well what is it now... 11:30... 

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,500
- Murder... they'll be round here by two.
- Oh well that's wonderful.

92
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Oh well, right love, if you'd like
to lie down here.

93
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,500
- Ok, Harry.
- Ok, gas on.

94
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,700
Right, deep breaths, love.
Ring Head Office would you Norman...

95
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,200
- Shall I go through maintenance?
- You'd better go through Deptford maintenance.

96
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
- Peckham's on a 207...
- That's LeWisham. What about Tottenham?

97
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,500
VACANCY - PILOT NEEDED

EUROPEAN MONARCHS
APPLY BRI. 5331

99
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,500
- Good morning.
- Morning sir, can I help you?

100
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,600
- Help me? Yes, I'd say you can help me.
- Yes, sir?

101
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,900
I came by your advert: "Small white
pussy cat for sale. Excellent condition."

102
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,600
- Ah, you wish to buy it?
- That's right.

103
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,800
Just for the hour. Only I aint gonna pay
more'n a fiver cos' it aint worth it.

104
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Well it's come from a very good home,
it's house trained.

105
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,100
"Chester drawers."

106
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,000
- I'd like some Chester drawers, please.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,600
- Does it go?
- It's over there, in the corner.

108
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,100
"Pram for sale. Any offers."

109
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,900
- I'd like a bit of pram, please.
- Yes, sir. That's in good coondition.

110
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,100
Oh good I like them in good condition, eh? eh?

111
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,700
Yes, here it is you see. 

112
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,100
"Baby-sitter."
No, it's a baby-sitter...

113
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,300
I don't want a baby-sitter.
"Be a blood donor", that's it.

114
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,100
I'd like to give some blood please.

115
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,700
Oh, spit, which one is it?

116
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,500
"Blond prostitute will indulge in any
sexual activity for four quid a week".

117
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
What does that mean?

118
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,500
- The Times, please.
- Oh yes sir, here you are.

119
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,300
MINISTRY OF SILLY WALKS

120
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,500
Good morning.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,

121
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,100
but my walk has become rather sillier recently
so it takes me rather longer to get to work.

122
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,700
- Now then, what was it again?
- Well sir, I have a silly walk...

123
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,100
and I'd like to obtain a
Government grant to help me develop it.

124
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,600
I see, may I see your silly walk?

125
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,900
Yes certainly, yes.

126
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,500
- Err that's it, is it?
- Yes that's it, yes.

127
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,100
It's not particulary silly, is it?

128
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,800
I mean, the right leg isn't silly at all
and the left leg merely does a forward 
aerial half turn every alternate step.

129
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
Yes, but I think that with Government backing
I could make it very silly.

130
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,700
Mr Pudey, the very real problem is one of money. 

131
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm afraid that the Ministry of Silly Walks is
no longer getting the kind of support it needs.

132
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,500
You see there's Defense, Social Security, Health,
Housing, Education, Silly Walks ... 

133
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,600
They're all supposed to get the same. 

134
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
But last year, the Government spent less
on the Ministry of Silly Walks 

135
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,900
than it did on National Defence. 

136
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,600
Now we get £348 million a year, 

137
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,900
which is supposed to be spent on all our available
products.

138
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

139
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,400
- Mrs TwoLumps, would you bring us 2 coffees please?
- Yes, Mr Teebag.

140
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,900
Out of her mind.

141
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,400
Now the Japanese have a man who can
bend his leg back over his head 

142
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
and back again with every single step. 

143
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,800
While the Israelis... ah, here's the coffee.

144
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Thank you - lovely. 

145
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,100
- You're really interested in silly walks,
 aren't you?    - Oh rather, yes.

146
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,600
Well take a look at this, then.

147
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,700
Mr Pudey, I'm not going to mince words with you.
I'm going to offer you a Research Fellowship
on the Anglo-French silly walk.

148
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,500
La Marche Futile?

149
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,900
Bonjour... 

150
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:24,300
et maintenant ...
comme d'habitude, au sujet du Le Marché Commun. 

151
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Et maintenant, je vous presente, encore une fois

152
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,300
mon ami, le pouf célèbre, Jean-Brian Zatapathique.

153
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
Merci, mon petit chou-chou Brian Trubshawe.

154
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,300
Et maintenant avec le pied de droite,
avec le pied de gauche,

155
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,700
et maintenant l'Anglais-Française Marche Futile,
et voilà!

156
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,100
And now, a choice of viewing
on BBC television.

157
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,700
Just started on BBC2, the semi-final
of episode 3 of "Kierkegaard's Journals"

158
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
starring Richard Chamberlain,
Peggy Mount and Billy Bremner.

159
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,700
And on BBC1, "Ethel the frog".

160
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,700
Good evening. On "Ethel the Frog" tonight we look
at violence. The violence of British Gangland.

161
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Last Tuesday a reign of terror was ended
when the notorious Piranha brothers,

162
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,100
Doug and Dinsdale, after one of
the most extraordinary trials

163
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,600
in British legal history were sentenced to
400 years inprisonment for crimes of violence.

164
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,400
Tonight Ethel the Frog examines the rise
to power of the Piranhas...

165
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
the methods they used
to subjugate rival gangs...

166
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,700
and their subsequent tracking down
and capture by the brilliant Superintendent...

167
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,100
Harry "Snapper" Organs of Q Division.

168
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,400
Doug and Dinsdale Piranha were born,
on probation, in this house in Kipling Road

169
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,300
the eldest sons in a family of sixteen.

170
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Their father, Arthur Piranha,
a scrap metal dealer and TV quizmaster...

171
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,200
was well known to the Police
and a devout Catholic.

172
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,200
In January 1928,
he had married Kitty Malone...

173
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,800
an up-and-coming EastEnd boxer.

174
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Doug was born in february 1929
and Dinsdale two weeks later...

175
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,900
And again a week after that.

176
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,600
Their next-door neighbour
was Mrs April Simnel.

177
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,300
Kipling Road was a typical sort
of East End street.

178
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,100
People running out of each other's houses
with each other's property all day long.

179
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,300
- They were a cheering lot though.
- Was it a terribly violent area?

180
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,900
Oh... Yes, cheerful and violent.

181
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,200
I remember Doug was very keen on boxing,
until he learned to walk...

182
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Then he took up putting the boot in the groin;
oh he was very interested in that.

183
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
His mother used to have such trouble
getting him to come in for his tea.

184
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,500
He'd be out here, putting his little boot in,
you know... Bless him.

185
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:07,700
Kids were very different then, they didn't have
their heads filled with all this cartesian dualism.

186
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,000
At the age of 15, Doug & Dinsdale started attending
the Ernest Pythagoras Primary School in Clerkenwell.

187
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,400
You taught the Piranha brothers English. 
What do you remember most about them?

188
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Anthony Viney.

189
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,100
When the Piranhas left school,
they were called up but they were found 

190
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,100
by an Army Board to be too mentally unstable
even for National Service.

191
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,200
Denied the opportunity to use their talents
in the service of their country

192
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,100
they began to operate what they called
"The Operation".

193
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,800
They would select a victim
and then threaten to beat him up...

194
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,400
if he paid them the so-called
"protection" money.

195
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,500
Four months later, they started another operation
which they called "The Other Operation".

196
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,600
They selected another victim and threatened
not to beat him up if he didn't pay them.

197
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,100
One month later, they hit upon
the "Other Other Operation".

198
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,500
In this the victim was threatened if he didn't
pay them, they would beat him up.

199
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,300
This, for the Piranha brothers,
was the turning point.

200
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,900
Doug and Dinsdale Piranha now formed a gang
which they called "The Gang"...

201
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
and used terror to take over night clubs,
billiard halls, gaming casinos and race tracks.

202
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,700
When they tried to take over the MCC,
they were, for the only time in their lifes,
slit up a treat.

203
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,100
As their empire spread however, we in Q Division
were keeping tabs on their every move...

204
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
by reading the color supplements.

205
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,800
A small time operator who fell foul of 
Dinsdale Piranha was Vince Snetterton-Lewis.

206
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,300
Well one day I was sitting at home
threatening the kids...

207
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,300
I look out through the hole in the wall
and I saw this tank driver.

208
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,600
One of Dinsdale's boys gets out.

209
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,900
He comes up all nice and friendly-like and says
Dinsdale wants to have a talk with me.

210
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,400
So he chains me to the back of the tank,
and takes me for a scrape round at Dinsdale's..

211
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,300
And Dinsdale's there,
in a conversation pit with Doug...

212
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,700
and Charles Paisley, the baby crusher,
and a couple of film producers...

213
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,600
and a man they call Kierkegaard,
who just sat there biting the heads of whippets

214
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,800
and Dinsdale says, "You've been
a naughty boy, Clement."

215
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,900
And he splits me nostrils open
and saws me leg off, and pulls my liver out.

216
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,100
And I say "my name's not Clement."

217
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,800
And... Then he loses his temper
and nails my head to the floor.

218
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,800
- He nailed your head to the floor?
- At first, yeah.

219
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,700
Another man who had his head nailed
to the floor was Stig O'Tracey.

220
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Stig, I've been told Dinsdale Piranha
nailed your head to the floor.

221
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,000
No, no, never, never.
He was a smashing bloke.

222
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,100
He used to give his mother flowers and that.
He was like a brother to me.

223
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,600
But the Police have film of Dinsdale
actually nailing your head to the floor.

224
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,300
- Oh yeah, well - he did that, yes.
- Why?

225
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,300
Well he had to, didn't he? I mean...
Be fair, there was nothing else he could do.

226
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,400
- I had transgressed the unwritten law.
- What had you done?

227
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,900
Er... He never told me that.
But he gave me his word that it was the case
and that's good enough for me with old Dinsy.

228
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,900
I mean he didn't want to nail my head
to the floor, I had to insist.

229
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,900
He wanted to let me off.
There's nothing Dinsdale woulnd't do for you.

230
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,700
- And you don't bear him any grudge?
- A grudge! Old Dinsy? He was a real darling.

231
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
I understand he also nailed
your wife's head to a coffee table.

232
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,900
- Isn't that right Mrs. O'Tracey?
- Oh no, no, no.

233
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,100
Yeah well, he did do that, yes.

234
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
He was a cruel man...
But fair.

235
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,400
Vince, after he nailed your head to the floor,
did you ever seen him again?

236
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,500
Yes, after that I used to go round to his flat
every Sunday lunchtime to apologize.

237
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,600
And we'd shake hands, and then
he'd nail my head to the floor.

238
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,400
- Every Sunday?
- Yes, but he was very reasonable about it.

239
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,900
I mean one Sunday, when my parents were
coming round for tea

240
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,700
I asked him if he minded very much
not nailing my head to the floor that week.

241
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,700
And he agreed,
and just screwed my pelvis to a cake stand.

242
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,300
The only friend I ever had.

243
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,100
I wouldn't hear a word against him.

244
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,200
Lovely fellow.

245
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,600
Clearly, Dinsdale inspired tremendous loyalty
and terror amongst his business associates.

246
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,500
But what was he really like?

247
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,700
I walked out with Dinsdale on many occasions

248
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,200
and found him a most charming and erudite companion.

249
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,600
He was wont to introduce one to many
eminent persons.

250
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,900
celebrated American singers, members
of the aristocracy and other gang-leaders.

251
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,400
- How had you met then?
- Through his work for charity.

252
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,700
He took a warm interest in Boys' Clubs,
Sailors' Homes, 

253
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,600
Choristers' Associations, Scouting Jamborees
and of course the Household Cavalry.

254
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,100
- Was there anything unusual about him?
- I should say not!

255
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,100
Dinsdale was a perfecty normal person
in every way...

256
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Except... Except in as much as he was convinced
that he was being watched by a giant hedgehog

257
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,800
which he reffered to as "Spiny Norman".

258
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
How big was Norman supposed to be?

259
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Normally he was wont to be about
12 feet from nose to tail...

260
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,600
but when Dinsdale was very depressed...

261
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,000
Norman could be anything
up to 800 yards long.

262
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,800
When Norman was about,
Dinsdale would go very quiet...

263
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,200
his nose would swell up
and his teeth would start moving about

264
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,400
and he'd become very violent
and claimed that he'd laid Stanley Baldwin.

265
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,300
Dinsdale was a gentleman.

266
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,400
What's more, he knew how to treat
a female impersonator.

267
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,100
It's easy for us to judge
Dinsdale Piranha too harshly.

268
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,300
After all, he only did what most of us
simply dream of doing.

269
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,700
I'm sorry.

270
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,400
After all, a murder is only
an extroverted suicide.

271
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,500
Dinsdale was a looney, but he was a happy looney.
Lucky bastard!

272
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,300
Most of these strange tales
concern Dinsdale, but what of Doug?

273
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,900
One man who met him was Luigi Vercotti.

274
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,700
I'd been running a succesful escort agency

275
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,200
high class, no really, high class girls...
We didn't have any of that, that was right out.

276
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,300
And I decided... Excuse me.

277
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,400
Hello? No, not now. Shtoom... shtoom... 

278
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,300
Right, we'll have the "watch" ready for you
at midnight.

279
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,900
The watch...
The Chinese watch.

280
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,800
Yes, right oh, bye bye... Mother.

281
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,500
Anyway I decided then to open a high class
night club for the gentry at Biggleswade 

282
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:00,500
with international cuisine, cooking, top-line acts,
and not a cheap clip joint for picking up tarts,
that was right out, I deny that completely.

283
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,300
And one night Dinsdale walked in
with a couple of big lads

284
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
one of whom was carrying a tactical nuclear missile.

285
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,400
They said I had bought one of their
fruit machines and would I pay for it.

286
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,100
- How much did they want?
- 3/4 of a million pounds.

287
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,400
- Then they went out.
- Why didn't you call for the police?

288
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,700
I'd noticed that the lad with the thermonuclear
device was the Chief Constable for the area.

289
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,400
Anyway, a week later they came back,
said that the cheque had bounced

290
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,600
and that I had to see... Doug.

291
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Doug. Well, I was terrified of him.
Everyone was terrified of Doug.

292
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,200
I've seen grown men pull their own heads off
rather than see Doug.

293
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,000
- Even Dinsdale was frightened of Doug.
- What did he do?

294
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,300
He used... sarcasm. He knew all the tricks, 

295
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:16,700
dramatic irony, metaphor, pathos, puns,
parody, litotes and... satire. 

296
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,600
By a combination of violence and sarcasm,
the Piranha brothers, by February 1966, 

297
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
controlled London and the Southeast.
In February, though, Dinsdale made a big mistake.

298
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,900
Latterly Dinsdale had become increasingly
worried about Spiny Norman. 

299
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,300
He had come to the conclusion that Norman slept
in an aeroplane hangar

300
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,900
at Luton Airport.

301
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,400
And so on Feb 22nd 1966, at Luton Airport... 

302
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Even the police began to sit up and take notice.

303
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,800
The Piranhas realised they had gone too far
and that the hunt was on.

304
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,300
They went into hiding and I decided
on a subtle approach, viz. some form of disguise,

305
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,800
as the old helmet and boots were a bit of a giveaway. 

306
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,200
Luckily my years with Bristol Rep. stood me in 
good stead, as I assumed a bewildering
variety of disguises.

307
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,000
I tracked them to Cardiff,
posing as the Reverend Smiler Egret. 

308
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,100
Hearing they'd gone back to London, I assumed
the identity of a pork butcher, Brian Stoats.

309
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,600
On my arrival in London, I discovered they
had returned to Cardiff.

310
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,200
I followed as Gloucester from King Lear. 

311
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,300
Acting on a hunch, I spent several months
in Buenos Aires as Blind Pew, 

312
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,300
returning through the Panama Canal as Ratty,
in Toad of Toad Hall.

313
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,500
Back in Cardiff, I relived my triumph
as Sancho Panza in Man of la Mancha,

314
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,600
which the Bristol Evening Post described as
'a glittering performance of rare perception',

315
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,900
although the Bath Chronicle
was less than enthusiastic. 
In fact it gave me a right panning. I quote:

316
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,300
'as for the performance of Superintendent
Harry "Snapper" Organs as Sancho Panza,

317
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,900
the audience were bemused by his high-pitched Welsh
accent and intimidated by his abusive ad-libs.'

318
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,300
'Sancho Panza (Mr Organs) spoilt an otherwise

319
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,800
impeccably choreographed rape scene
by his unscheduled appearance

320
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,000
and persistent cries of "What's all this then?"'

321
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,600
- Never mind, Snapper, love, you can't win 'em all.
- True, constable. Could I have my eye-liner, please?

322
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,800
- Telegram for you, love.
- Good-oh. Bet it's from Binky.

323
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,400
Those flowers are for Sgt. Lauderdale
from the gentleman waiting outside.

324
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,600
- 30 seconds, Superintendent.
- Oh blimey, I'm on. 

325
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,900
- Is me hat straight, constable?
- Oh, it's fine.

326
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,400
- Right, here we go, Hawkins.
- Oh, merde, Superintendent.

327
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,900
Good luck, then.

328
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,300
Read all about it. Piranha brothers escape.

329
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,600
Dinsdale? Dinsdale? Dinsdale?

330
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,800
Well, that's all for now.
And so until next week...
