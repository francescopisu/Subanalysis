1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,035
Ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:04,937
I am not simply going to say

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:07,940
"and now for something
completely different" this week

4
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,342
As I do not think it fit.

5
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,677
This is a particularly
auspicious occasion

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,946
For us this evening,
as we have been told

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,315
That her majesty the queen
will be watching

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,783
Part of this show tonight.

9
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:21,187
And we don't know exactly when
her majesty will be tuning in.

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,724
We understand that at the moment
she is watching the virginian

11
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,493
But we have been promised
that we will be informed

12
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:29,462
The moment
that she changes channel.

13
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:32,598
Her majesty would like everyone
to behave quite normally

14
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,835
But her equerry has asked me
to request all of you at home

15
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:38,037
To stand when
the great moment arrives--

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,806
Although we here in the studio
will be carrying on

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,776
With our humorous vignettes
and spoofs in the ordinary way.

18
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,111
Thank you.

19
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:47,613
And now without any more ado
and completely as normal

20
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:51,884
Here are the opening titles.

21
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:22,481
The coal miners of wales
have long been famed

22
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,851
For their tough, rugged life
hewing the black gold

23
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:29,021
From the uncompromising hell
of one mile under.

24
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,157
This is the story of such men--

25
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,193
Battling gallantly
against floods, roof falls

26
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:35,828
The english criminal law

27
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:38,164
The hidden killer,
carbon monoxide

28
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:42,501
And the ever-present threat
of pneumoconiosis which is a...

29
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,136
A disease miners get.

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,105
Don't you talk
to me like that

31
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:47,373
You lying bastard.

32
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:48,374
You bleeding pig.

33
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,276
You're not fit
to be down a mine.

34
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:52,278
Typical bleeding
rhondda, isn't it.

35
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,213
You think you're
so bloody clever.

36
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,247
All right.

37
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,616
You're bloody
fighting again?

38
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:57,750
Break it up

39
00:01:57,783 --> 00:01:59,785
Or I'll put this pick
through your head.

40
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,886
Now what's
it all about?

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,054
He started it.

42
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,123
Oh, you bleeding pig,
you started it.

43
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:05,825
I don't care
who bloody started it

44
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,193
What's it about?

45
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:12,264
Well, he said the bloody treaty
of utrecht was 1713.

46
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,033
So it bloody is.

47
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,434
No, it bloody isn't.

48
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,037
It wasn't ratified
till february 1714.

49
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,071
He's bluffing.

50
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,906
Your mind's gone,
jenkins.

51
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,041
You're rubbish.

52
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:23,442
He's right,
jenkins.

53
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,678
It was ratified
september 1713.

54
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,980
The whole bloody pit
knows that.

55
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,016
Look, in trevelyn,
page 468.

56
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,318
He's thinking of the treaty
of bloody westphalia.

57
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,887
Are you saying I don't know
the difference between

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,956
The war of the bloody
spanish succession

59
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,624
And the thirty
bloody years' war?

60
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,192
You don't know
the difference

61
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,661
Between the battle
of borodino

62
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,728
And a tiger's bum.

63
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,130
Break it up!
break it up!

64
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,265
I'm sick of all this
bloody fighting.

65
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,601
If it's not the bloody
treaty of utrecht

66
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:50,503
It's the bloody
binomial theorem.

67
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,339
This isn't the senior
common room at all souls--

68
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:54,907
It's the bloody coal face.

69
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,776
Hey, gaffer, can you
settle something?

70
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,745
Morgan here says you find the
abacus between the triglyphs

71
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,714
In the frieze section
of the entablature

72
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:03,449
Of classical
greek doric temples.

73
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:04,951
You bloody fool, morgan.

74
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,085
That's the metope.

75
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:07,353
The abacus is between

76
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:10,189
The architrave and the echinus
in the capital.

77
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:13,659
You stinking liar!

78
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:17,463
Break it up.

79
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,245
Oh, most magnificent
and merciful majesty

80
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,115
Master of the universe,
protector of the meek

81
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:38,384
Whose nose we are not
worthy to pick

82
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:41,420
And whose very feces
are an untrammeled delight

83
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,456
And whose peacocks
keep us awake

84
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,626
All hours of the night
with their noisy lovemaking

85
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,795
We beseech thee, tell thy
humble servants the name

86
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,566
Of the section between the
triglyphs in the frieze section

87
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,701
Of a classical doric
entablature.

88
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,703
No idea.

89
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,738
Sorry.

90
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,540
Right. everybody out.

91
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,642
Still no settlement

92
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,877
In the coal mine dispute
at llanddarog.

93
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,712
Miners refuse to return to work

94
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,848
Until the management define
a metope.

95
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,283
Meanwhile, at dagenham

96
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,852
The unofficial strike committee
at fords

97
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,687
Have increased their demands

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,490
To 13 reasons
why henry iii was a bad king.

99
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:21,294
And finally, in the disgusting
objects international

100
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,063
At wembley tonight,
england beat spain

101
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,300
By a plate of braised pus
to a putrid heron.

102
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:32,138
And now,
the toad elevating moment.

103
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,544
Good evening.

104
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:40,446
Well, we have
in the studio tonight

105
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,082
A man who says things
in a very roundabout way.

106
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:44,617
Isn't that so,
mr. pudifoot?

107
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,986
Yes.

108
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,955
Have you always
said things

109
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,456
In a very
roundabout way?

110
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:51,991
Yes.

111
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:54,860
I can't help noticing
that for someone who claims

112
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,063
To say things
in a very roundabout way

113
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,532
Your last two answers
have had very little

114
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,601
Of the discursive quality
about them.

115
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,869
Oh, well,
I'm not very talkative today.

116
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,838
It's a form
of defensive response

117
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:07,773
To intense
interrogative stimuli.

118
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,443
I used to get it very bad
when I was a boy...

119
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,777
Well, when I say badly

120
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,013
In fact, do you remember
that fashion they had

121
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:16,449
For, you know, little poodles
with small coats...?

122
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,050
Ah, now you're
beginning to talk...

123
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,919
You're beginning to talk
in a roundabout way.

124
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,253
Oh, I'm sorry.

125
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,655
No, no, no.
please do carry on

126
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,724
Because that is in fact why we
wanted you on the show.

127
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,593
I thought it was because
you were interested in me

128
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,694
As a human being.

129
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,563
Well, let's move on
to our next guest

130
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,031
Who not only lives in essex

131
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:34,100
But also speaks only
the ends of words.

132
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,302
Mr. ohn ith.
mr. ith, good evening.

133
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,303
...ood ...ing.

134
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,671
Nice to have you...

135
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,706
Nice to have you
on the show.

136
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,008
...ice ...o ...e ...ere.

137
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,843
Mr. ith, don't you find it
very difficult

138
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,177
To make yourself understood?

139
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,746
Yes, it is extremely difficult.

140
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,080
Just a minute. you're a fraud.

141
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,448
Oh, no. I can speak the third

142
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,384
And fourth sentences
perfectly normally.

143
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,852
I see.

144
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,855
So your next sentence will be
only the ends of words again?

145
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:56,856
...t's ...ight.

146
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,624
As we move on
to our next guest

147
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,960
Who speaks only
the beginnings of words--

148
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:01,961
Mr. j... sm...

149
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,195
Mr. sm...,
good evening.

150
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,530
G... e...

151
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,198
Have you two
met before?

152
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,800
N... o.
N...

153
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,436
Well, this is really
a fascinating occasion

154
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,204
Because we have
in the studio

155
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,472
Mr. ...oh... ...i...

156
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,441
Who speaks only
the middles of words.

157
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:16,575
Good evening.

158
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,843
...oo...
...ni...

159
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,478
And where do
you come from?

160
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,646
...u... ...i... ...a...

161
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,081
Dunfermline
in scotland.

162
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,816
Well, let me
introduce you.

163
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,751
Mr. ohn ith.

164
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,786
...ood
...ing.

165
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,820
Mr. j... sm...

166
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:28,821
...ooo...
...ni...

167
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,189
G... eve...

168
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,158
Yes, well, ha, ha,
just a moment.

169
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,860
Perhaps you'd all like
to say good evening together.

170
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,095
G... oo...d

171
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:39,899
Eve... ni... ing

172
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:43,803
Hi, there, beautiful.

173
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,707
Hi, bob.

174
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,476
Say, what's the matter
with you?

175
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,911
I don't know, tom

176
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,914
But girls seem
to avoid me these days.

177
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,216
Hmm, could be bad breath, bob.

178
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:00,419
Say, have you tried using
crelm toothpaste?

179
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,122
Gosh, tom, do you think
that would help?

180
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:06,525
You bet your boots it will, bob.

181
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,628
Tom was sure right.

182
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,665
Crelm has changed my life.

183
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,501
Hi, girls.

184
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,941
This table has been treated

185
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,576
With ordinary soap powder

186
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,612
But these have been treated
with new fibro-val.

187
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,948
We put both of them
in our washing machine

188
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,783
And just look at the difference.

189
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:31,784
The table

190
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,286
Is all broken and smashed--

191
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:40,293
But the sheets, with fibro-val,
are sparkling clean and white.

192
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,010
I love the surgical garment.

193
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,314
Enjoy the delights of the
victor mature abdominal corset.

194
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,150
Sail down the nile
on the bleed-it kosher truss.

195
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,719
And don't forget
the hercules hold-'em-in--

196
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,554
The all-purpose concrete truss

197
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:12,158
For the man with
the family hernia.

198
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,727
Well, last week on fish club

199
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,228
We learnt how to sex a pike.

200
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,231
And this week we're going
to learn how to feed a goldfish.

201
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,233
Now, contrary
to what most people think

202
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,102
The goldfish has
a ravenous appetite.

203
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,805
If it doesn't get enough protein
it gets very thin--

204
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,908
Its bones begin to stick out
and its fins start to fall off.

205
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,042
So once a week

206
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,044
Give your goldfish
a really good meal.

207
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,846
Here's one specially recommended

208
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,915
By the board
of irresponsible people.

209
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,884
First, some cold consomme
or gazpacho...

210
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,954
Then some sausages
with spring greens...

211
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:46,092
Sauteed potatoes, bread,
gravy...

212
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,894
The rspca wish it to be known

213
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,131
That that man was not
a bona-fide animal lover

214
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,301
And also that goldfish
do not eat sausages...

215
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,802
...treacle tart!

216
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,371
Shut up.

217
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,374
They are quite happy with
breadcrumbs, ants' eggs and...

218
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,610
Who wrote that?

219
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,196
Come on.

220
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,831
Oh, charles.

221
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,334
Come on.

222
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,136
Oh, oh...

223
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,904
Oh, come on...

224
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,005
Oh...

225
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,441
Oh...

226
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:46,485
I hope you're enjoying
the show.

227
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,824
Herbert mental
collects bird-watchers' eggs.

228
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,258
At his home in surrey

229
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,894
He has a collection
of over 400 of them.

230
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,631
Here now, this is
a very interesting one.

231
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,899
This is
from a mr. p.f. bradshaw.

232
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,502
He is usually found
in surrey hedgerows

233
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,870
But I found this one

234
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,373
In the gents at st. pancras,
uneaten.

235
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:45,011
Mr. mental, why did you start
collecting bird-watcher's eggs?

236
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,680
Well, I did it
to get on man alive.

237
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:48,881
Man alive?

238
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,283
That's right, yes.

239
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,951
Uh, but then, that got
all serious.

240
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,353
So I carried on in the hope
of a quick appearance

241
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,023
As an eccentric on the regional
section of nationwide.

242
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,192
Mr. mental, I believe
a couple of years ago

243
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,628
You started to collect
butterfly hunters.

244
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,929
Butterfly hunters?

245
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,131
Yes.

246
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,465
Oh, that's right.

247
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,967
Here's a couple of them
over here.

248
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,502
Nice little chaps.

249
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:16,008
But the hobby I enjoyed most
was racing pigeon fanciers.

250
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,901
Dinsdale! dinsdale!

251
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,775
Is the balloon ready?

252
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,243
Yeah, boss.

253
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,113
Coming right up.

254
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,349
Okay, let's go.

255
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,268
Uh, good morning.

256
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,669
I've been in
touch with you

257
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,072
About the, uh,
life insurance.

258
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,173
Ah, yes.

259
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,941
Uh did you...
did you bring the, uh...

260
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,010
Mmm, specimen
of your...

261
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,112
Um, and so on
and so on?

262
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,280
Uh, yes, I did.

263
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,615
It's in the car.

264
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,284
There's rather a lot.

265
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,685
Good, good.

266
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,420
Do you really
need 12 gallons?

267
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,123
Mmm... no.
no, not really.

268
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,458
Do you test it?

269
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,792
No.

270
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,127
Well, why do
you want it?

271
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,328
Well, we do it
to make sure

272
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,163
That you're serious
about wanting insurance.

273
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,264
I mean, if you're not

274
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,466
You won't spend
a couple of months

275
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,067
Filling up that
enormous churn with...

276
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,135
Mmm... so on and so on.

277
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,903
Shall I bring it in?

278
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,372
Lord, no. throw it away.

279
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,406
Throw it away?

280
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:05,244
I was months
filling that thing up.

281
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:13,152
And we've just heard
that her majesty, the queen

282
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,121
Has just tuned in
to this program

283
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,523
And she is now watching
this royal sketch

284
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,991
Here in this royal set.

285
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,927
The actor on the left
is wearing the great gray suit

286
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,729
Of the bbc wardrobe department

287
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,998
And the other actor
is about to deliver

288
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,001
The first great royal joke
here this royal evening.

289
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,938
Going to the right,
you can see the royal cameraman

290
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,306
And behind...

291
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,207
Oh, we just heard
she's switched over.

292
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,244
She's watching news at ten.

293
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,346
...despite
the union's recommendation

294
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,849
That the strikers should accept
the second and third clauses

295
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,955
Of the agreement
arrived at last thursday.

296
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,356
Today saw the publication

297
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,092
Of the mcguffie commission's
controversial report

298
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,162
On treatment of inpatients
in north london hospitals.

299
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,332
Get on parade!

300
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,737
Come on, come on!

301
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,673
We haven't got all day, have we?

302
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:11,777
Come on, come on, come on!

303
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,947
Hurry up!

304
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,021
Right!

305
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,024
Now, I know
some hospitals

306
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:29,462
Where you get the patients
lying around in bed--

307
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:35,167
Sleeping, resting,
recuperating, convalescing.

308
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,673
Well, that's not the way
we do things here, right?!

309
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,542
No, you won't be loafing about
in bed

310
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,211
Wasting the doctors' time.

311
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,747
You!
you horrible little cripple!

312
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,315
What's the matter
with you?

313
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,817
Fractured tibia, sergeant.

314
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,120
"fractured tibia, sergeant."

315
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,989
"fractured tibia, sergeant,"
ooh.

316
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,158
Proper little mummy's boy,
aren't we?!

317
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,894
Well, I'll tell you something,
my fine friend.

318
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,865
If you fracture a tibia here,
you keep quiet about it!

319
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,567
Look at him!
he's broke both his arms

320
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,003
And he don't go shouting
about it, do he?!

321
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,339
No!
'cause he's a man, you...

322
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,174
He's a woman,
you see

323
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,777
So don't try that
fractured tibia talk with me!

324
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,279
Get on for detail at the double!
one, two, three.

325
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,881
Pick that crutch up!

326
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,985
Pick that crutch
right up!

327
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:33,025
Right...
squad... 'tion!

328
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,696
Squad, right turn!

329
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:40,633
Squad, by the left,
quick limp!

330
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,636
Come on,
pick 'em up, there!

331
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,372
Get some air
in those wounds!

332
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:50,276
Here at st. pooves,
we believe in a.r.t.--

333
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,178
Active recuperation techniques.

334
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,246
We try
to help the patient understand

335
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,215
That however ill he may be

336
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:00,052
He can still fulfill
a useful role in society.

337
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:04,790
Sun lounge, please,
mr. griffiths.

338
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,760
Well...

339
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,029
I got a triple fracture
of the right leg

340
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:14,567
Dislocated collarbone
and multiple head injuries

341
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,871
So I do most of the heavy work,
like helping the surgeon.

342
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,540
What does that involve?

343
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,777
Well, at the moment, we're
building him a holiday home.

344
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,279
What about the nurses?

345
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,147
Oh, well,
I don't know about them.

346
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,650
They're not allowed
to mix with the patients.

347
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,084
Do all the patients work?

348
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:37,790
No, no. the ones
that are really ill do sport.

349
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:53,372
Yes, one thing patients here
dread are the runs.

350
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,619
How are you feeling?

351
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,622
Much better.

352
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,364
But the patients
are allowed visiting hours

353
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,667
And this week they're visiting
an iron foundry at swindon

354
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:26,906
Which is crying out
for unskilled labor.

355
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,643
But this
isn't the only hospital

356
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:35,881
Where doctors' conditions
are improving.

357
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,784
We have very little shortage
of doctors here.

358
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,822
We have over 40 doctors
per bed... uh, patient.

359
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,459
Oh, be honest : bed.

360
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,361
We've every facility here

361
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,396
For dealing with people
who are rich.

362
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,198
We can deal with a blocked purse

363
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,134
We can drain private accounts,
and in the worst cases

364
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,969
We can perform
a total cashectomy

365
00:18:57,003 --> 00:19:02,041
Which is total removal
of all moneys from the patient.

366
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,843
Well, here we try to help people

367
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,778
Who have to link sketches
together.

368
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,246
We try to stop them saying

369
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,182
"have you ever wondered
what it would be like if...?"

370
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,352
And instead
say something like, um...

371
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,588
"and now,
the mountaineering sketch."

372
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:20,293
Well, I haven't written
a mountaineering sketch, but...

373
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:26,332
Now to the exploding version
of "the blue danube."

374
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:04,904
And now a dormitory
in a girls' public school.

375
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,617
Hello. agnes?

376
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,986
Agnes, are you awake?

377
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,488
Agnes?

378
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,958
Agnes?

379
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,460
Who is it?

380
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,195
Is that you, charlie?

381
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,196
Yeah, agnes.

382
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,530
Where is jane?

383
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,599
I'm over here, charlie.

384
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,735
Jane, we're going down
to raid the tuck shop.

385
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,169
Oh, good-o.

386
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,571
Count me in, girls.

387
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,306
Can I come, too, agnes?

388
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,540
Yeah, joyce.

389
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,042
And me and avril?

390
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,377
Yeah, rather.
and suki.

391
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,145
Oh, whacko
the diddle-oh.

392
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,146
Cave, girls.

393
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,083
Here comes miss rodgers.

394
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,019
All right, girls.

395
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,521
Now, stop this tomfoolery
and get back into bed.

396
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,056
Remember, it's
the big match

397
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,557
At st. bridget's
tomorrow.

398
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,861
Yes, on your screen tomorrow--

399
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:05,698
Starring the men
of the 14th marine commandos.

400
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,333
And now it's documentary time

401
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,535
When we look
at the momentous last years

402
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,003
Of the second world war

403
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,639
And tonight, the invasion
of normandy, performed

404
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:20,246
By the girls of oakdend high
school, upper fifth science.

405
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,630
Oh, it's still raining.

406
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,899
I'm going
down the shops.

407
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,400
Oh, be a dear and get me

408
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,769
Some rats' bane
for the budgie's boil.

409
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,905
Otherwise,
I'll put your eyes out.

410
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,306
Aye, aye,
captain.

411
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,943
Coo-ee. torpedo bay.

412
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,314
Yoo-hoo. torpedo bay.

413
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,816
She said torpedo bay.

414
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,117
Yes, she did.
she did.

415
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,486
Yes, she said torpedo bay,
she did, she did.

416
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,622
Said torpedo bay,
she did, she did.

417
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,523
Mrs. lieutenant edale here.

418
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:08,361
Mrs. midshipman nesbitt's got
one of her headaches again

419
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,563
so I put her
in the torpedo tube.

420
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,465
Roger, mrs. edale.

421
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,734
Stand by to fire
mrs. nesbitt.

422
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,069
Stand by
to fire mrs. nesbitt.

423
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,672
Standing by
to fire mrs. nesbitt.

424
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,074
Red alert.

425
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,476
Put the kettle on.

426
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,577
Kettle on.

427
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,647
Engine room, stand
by to feed the cat.

428
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,049
Standing by to feed the cat.

429
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:33,519
Fire mrs. nesbitt!

430
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,591
Oh, that's much better.

431
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,360
As an admiral who came up
through the ranks

432
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,529
More times than you've had
hot dinners

433
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,332
I wish to join my husband
admiral o.w.a. giveaway

434
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,734
In condemning
this shoddy misrepresentation

435
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:49,936
Of our modern navy.

436
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,971
The british navy
is one of the finest

437
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,339
And most attractive

438
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,608
And butchest fighting forces
in the world.

439
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,376
I love
those white-flag trousers

440
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,211
And the feel
of rough blue serge

441
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,880
On those pert little buttocks.

442
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:04,417
I'm afraid we're unable to show
you any more of that letter.

443
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:10,690
We continue with a man
with a stoat through his head.

444
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,093
And now...

445
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,167
Still no sign of land.

446
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,935
How long is it?

447
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,638
That's rather a personal
question, sir.

448
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,006
You stupid git.

449
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,843
I meant how long
have we been in the lifeboat?

450
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,778
You've spoilt
the atmosphere now.

451
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:33,779
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:34,780
Shut up.

453
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:38,884
We'll have to start again.

454
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,656
Still no sign of land.

455
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,758
How long is it?

456
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,893
33 days, sir.

457
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,395
33 days.

458
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,931
I don't think we can
hold out much longer.

459
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,499
I don't think
I did spoil

460
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,101
The atmosphere.
shut up!

461
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,836
I'm sorry. I don't
think I did.

462
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:57,970
Of course you did.

463
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,172
Do you think I spoilt
the atmosphere?

464
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,107
Well, i...

465
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,977
Look, shut up!
shut up.

466
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,382
Still no sign of land.

467
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,183
How long is it?

468
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,184
33 days, sir.

469
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:13,619
Can we start
it again?

470
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,888
Oh!

471
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,730
Still no sign of land.

472
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,265
How long is it?

473
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,166
33 days, sir.

474
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,134
33 days?

475
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,135
Yes.

476
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,137
We can't hold
out much longer.

477
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,940
We haven't had any food
since the fifth day.

478
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,108
We're done for,
we're done for.

479
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,510
Shut up, maudling.

480
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,812
We've just got
to keep hoping

481
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,113
Someone will find us.

482
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,782
How are you
feeling, captain?

483
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,250
Not so good.

484
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:47,153
I feel so weak.

485
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,989
We can't hold
out much longer.

486
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,490
Listen, chaps.

487
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:52,858
There's one last chance.

488
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,094
I'm done for.

489
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,596
I've got a gammy leg
and I'm going fast.

490
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,365
I'll never get through, but...

491
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,033
Some of you might.

492
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,269
So you'd better eat me.

493
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,404
Eat you, sir?

494
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:07,239
Yes. eat me.

495
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,775
Ugh. with a gammy leg?

496
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,044
You don't have to eat
the leg, thompson.

497
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,980
There's still plenty
of good meat.

498
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,047
Look at that arm.

499
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,283
It's not... just
the leg, sir.

500
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,451
What do you mean?

501
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,952
Well, sir, it's
just that...

502
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:21,520
Why don't you want
to eat me?

503
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,456
I'd rather eat
johnson, sir.

504
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:24,857
Oh, so would
i, sir.

505
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,858
I see.

506
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,226
Well, that's
settled then.

507
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,227
Everyone eats me.

508
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,228
Well, i, um...

509
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,229
What sir?

510
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,198
No, no. you go ahead.
I won't...

511
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,666
Nonsense,
nonsense, sir.

512
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,167
You're starving.
tuck in.

513
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,669
No, it's not just that.

514
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,871
What's the matter
with johnson, sir?

515
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,675
Well, he's not kosher.

516
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,477
Depends how
we kill him, sir.

517
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,545
Yes, yes, I see that,
but, uh...

518
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,913
Well, to be quite frank

519
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,882
I like my meat
a little more lean.

520
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,250
I'd rather eat hodges.

521
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,652
Oh, well,
all right.

522
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,021
No, I still prefer
to eat johnson.

523
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,789
I wish you'd all stop bickering
and eat me.

524
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,425
I tell you what, why don't
those of us who want to

525
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,627
Eat johnson,
then, you, sir, can eat my leg

526
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:04,697
And then we'll make a stock
of the captain, and after that

527
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,199
We can eat the rest of johnson
cold for supper?

528
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,401
Good thinking, hodges.

529
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:10,436
And we'll finish off
with the peaches.

530
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,538
And we can start off
with the avocados.

531
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,572
Waitress?
yes.

532
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:16,108
Waitress, we've decided now.

533
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:20,479
We're going to have
a leg of hodges...

534
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:23,649
Dear sir, I'm glad to hear
that your studio audience

535
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:26,285
Disapproves of the last skit
as strongly as i.

536
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,821
As a naval officer,
I abhor the implication

537
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,490
That the royal navy
is a haven for cannibalism.

538
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:34,026
It is well known
that we now have the problem

539
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,494
Relatively under control

540
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:37,730
And that it is the r.a.f
who now suffer

541
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,799
The largest casualties
in this area.

542
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,635
What do you think
the argylls ate in aden? arabs?

543
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,637
Yours, etc.,
captain b.j. smethwick

544
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:51,310
In a white wine sauce with
shallots, mushrooms and garlic.

545
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:09,061
Stop it. stop it.

546
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:10,930
Stop this cannibalism.

547
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:15,234
Let's have a sketch about
clean, decent human beings.

548
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:16,369
Morning.

549
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,803
Ah, good morning.

550
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:19,338
What can I do
for you, squire?

551
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,374
Uh, well, I wonder
if you can help me.

552
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,142
Um, you see my
mother's just died.

553
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,344
Oh, we can help.
we deal with stiffs.

554
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:26,078
What?

555
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,213
Well, there are

556
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,382
Three things
we can do with your mother.

557
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,550
We can burn her,
bury her or dump her.

558
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:32,618
Dump her?

559
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,253
Dump her in the thames.

560
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:35,187
What?

561
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,822
Oh. did you like her?

562
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:37,590
Yes.

563
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,058
We won't dump her then.

564
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,192
What do you think?

565
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,827
We can bury her
or burn her.

566
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,529
Well, which do
you recommend?

567
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,964
Well, they're both nasty.

568
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,633
If we burn her, she gets
stuffed in the flames--

569
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,569
Crackle, crackle, crackle--
which is a bit of a shock

570
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,538
If she's not quite dead,
but quick.

571
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,473
Then we give you
a handful of ashes

572
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,208
Which you can pretend
were hers.

573
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,276
Oh. I see.

574
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,245
Or if we bury her,
she gets eaten up

575
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,280
By lots of weevils
and nasty maggots

576
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:03,883
Which, as I said before,
is a bit of a shock

577
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,351
If she's not quite dead.

578
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:09,622
I see. well, she's, uh...
she's definitely dead.

579
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:10,823
Where is she?

580
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,726
Well, she's
in this sack.

581
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,329
She looks quite young.

582
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,930
Yes. yes, she was.

583
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:18,931
Fred!

584
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:19,932
Yeah?

585
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,434
I think we've
got an eater.

586
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,802
What?

587
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,403
I'll get the oven on.

588
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:25,838
Right.

589
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:26,973
Uh... excuse me.

590
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,542
Um, are you, uh...
are you suggesting

591
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:32,945
Eating my mother?

592
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,880
Yeah.

593
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,048
Not raw.

594
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,049
Cooked.

595
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,117
What?

596
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,653
Yes. roasted
with a few french fries

597
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,688
Broccoli, horseradish sauce.

598
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,291
Well, I do feel
a bit peckish.

599
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,325
Great.

600
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,994
Disgraceful!

601
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,528
Can we have
some parsnips?

602
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,130
Fred, get some parsnips.

603
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,099
I really don't
think I should.

604
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,301
Look, tell you what,
we'll eat her

605
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:58,137
If you feel a bit guilty
about it afterwards

606
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:03,843
We can dig a grave
and you can throw up in it.
