1
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,200
- All quiet today?
- Keeping it like that, boss.

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,300
We rule where we stand.

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,200
Police sitting on all corners
over these parts.

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,500
- Likely because we been dropping bodies.
- Yeah, they do like that.

5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,700
But, you know, tomorrow some other
nigga'll stop a bullet somewhere else...

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
and then they'll go stand on a new spot.

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,700
Boy Marlo closed up shop.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Word is, he wholesaling
his packages for now.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,500
He don't have no crews out here at all?
How about his avenue corners?

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,900
Nigga give up quick, didn't he?

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,200
Damn, I was just beginning to respect
the little motherfucker for showing heart.

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,100
All right, listen. When them police roll out,
y'all step in there and take my corners.

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,900
I'm on it, B.

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,200
- Cheese steaks from Bill's.
- Nah, I did that Tuesday, man.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
Fuck it then, you pick.

16
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,300
- No, fuck me.
- What?

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,400
- Mope in the truck.
- What about him?

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,000
Think I locked him up.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Avon what's-his-face?

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,100
Big player from the projects.
He was the target on that detail...

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,400
I worked a couple of years back,
the one I told you about.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
- Motherfucker's out already.
- Why, what'd he pull?

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,200
Oh, six, eight years.
Who the fuck can remember?

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
And he's out in two?

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,700
Maybe I got the years wrong.

26
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,700
My point is, guy's an asshole.
Locked him up, is all.

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,700
- Pit B from the market.
- See, now you're thinking like police.

28
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,900
Change in plan.

29
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,300
Bell, you recognize.

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,400
Second target is a Marlo Stanfield...

31
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,200
who's apparently warring
with Bell for the West Side corners.

32
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,900
- What about Kintel Williamson?
- That case is on hold for now.

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,500
On hold? We just managed to ID
the cell phones on two of his people.

34
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,900
- Be that as it may...
- I mean, why not take a few more weeks...

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
so we can put together
what we got on Kintel, you know?

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,600
We send the case to grand jury
and then we start up this West Side case.

37
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,100
Otherwise, we wasted
more than two months...

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,500
Change of target comes to us from
the Commissioner and the Deputy Ops.

39
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,300
The Department is in a reactive mode...

40
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
trying to get the murder rate down
by any means necessary.

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,400
Kintel was dropping bodies
two months ago.

42
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,800
Today, it's the West Side
that's got the bosses spinning.

43
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,200
Look, I know y'all thought
it was nothing for me to sit on that roof...

44
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,000
day after 90-degree day...

45
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,700
dodging swarms of cicadas and shit,
but, damn, this is fucked up!

46
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,100
And all the assets work I did on Kintel,
his cars, his cash flow...

47
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,100
just put that in a drawer?

48
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,100
Someday, I wanna work
for a real police department.

49
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,800
Just to see how the fuck they do it,
you know?

50
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,500
McNulty. In my office.

51
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
Hey, Prez, can you
run something out for me?

52
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
What?

53
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,700
I need to know who rented this room in
the downtown Hilton, Thursday before last.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,700
Who rented the room?

55
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,500
Address, credit card details,
whatever you can pull.

56
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,400
- How's it fit with the case?
- It's hard to say just yet.

57
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,800
Hey, my man. I'm done mowing.

58
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
So?

59
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,900
I figured I'd use this to edge
the weeds around the fence.

60
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,000
- It's gas-powered.
- Means I gotta prime it.

61
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,500
You ain't gotta school me but once.

62
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Get some water
before you go back out there.

63
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,300
All right.

64
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,200
You been going hard at it.

65
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,900
You keep showing up at the spot,
I'll keep putting you on.

66
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,700
Good, 'cause I ain't got nothing else.

67
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,800
You walked back through them old doors,
didn't you?

68
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,700
- Tried to.
- Yeah. I had took you for gone.

69
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,200
Man, parole officers, employment agencies.

70
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,300
Shit, I just felt like I was an interruption
to their lunch break.

71
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,700
No family?

72
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,000
None besides my grandmother.
She put me up in her basement.

73
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,000
That's plenty to ask
of the old girl right there.

74
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,600
You could use somebody to talk to
besides your grand-moms.

75
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,600
What about
one of them social worker types?

76
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,500
I hooked up with one dude. He was cool.

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,600
- But, I wasn't ready.
- You look like you're ready now.

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,100
I mean, you found an ear to bend,
you wouldn't have to talk to me.

79
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,700
Shit, I know you gonna get tired
of looking at my ugly-ass grill.

80
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,600
Drink that too fast, you'll cramp up.

81
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,800
- You're asking?
- I am.

82
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,900
Lieutenant, I didn't...

83
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,900
Because I got no problem changing targets
if that's what the bosses tell me to do.

84
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Unless it's personal,
like when Kima got shot...

85
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,600
I don't care
where we spend our time and money.

86
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,000
Bell, Williamson, whoever.
It's all just police work to me.

87
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,200
And I understand that people
above my pay grade...

88
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,500
have the right to make decisions
that are theirs to make.

89
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
- And if they're wrong?
- Then they're wrong.

90
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,300
And time will tell, won't it?

91
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,700
Now, I'm asking you for the truth.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,200
- You went to Colvin behind my back.
- I'd have gone to the devil himself.

93
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,800
Which way you were standing, Lieutenant,
had not a fucking thing to do with it.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,800
You piece of shit.

95
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,200
I did it 'cause it had to be done.

96
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,800
Just like it had to be done two years ago
when we were first detailed.

97
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,300
Stringer was the target then,
he's still the target now.

98
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Lieutenant, you know, as bosses go,
you're better than most...

99
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
and I know you went out of your way
to get me off that boat.

100
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,800
I know that,
but now we're back on the right man.

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
Detective McNulty.

102
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,200
When the cuffs go on Stringer,
you need to find a new home.

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're done in this unit.

104
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Your count right?

105
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,900
Yeah, went almost to Richmond
for this here batch.

106
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,800
Yeah, I'm holding.

107
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
- You did like we say, right?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,000
Give him that.

109
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,600
We're gonna need another 60 more
in a couple days.

110
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,500
- 60 more?
- You know how we do.

111
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,100
So, don't be crying, Bernard.

112
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,700
- You must have left something out.
- Fuck, no.

113
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
I got the part ones from every sector,
every post.

114
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,500
- We're down about 2%.
- No, where exactly are we down?

115
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Larcenies and burglaries are steady.

116
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
But shootings and agg assaults
are both down.

117
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,000
Drug arrests, too,
but I guess that won't look so good.

118
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,900
I mean, where geographically are we down,
in the district?

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Well, the posts near the designated
drug zones are up, almost all of them.

120
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,800
That ain't pretty,
but everywhere else it's down.

121
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,400
In some places as much as 4%.

122
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,800
- Bosses gonna love you.
- It's too soon to take any credit.

123
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,600
This might be, what you call that?
A statistical aberration.

124
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
You ain't gonna let them know that
your little experiment might be working?

125
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,900
Not yet, no.

126
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,400
But I'll tell you what we are gonna do.

127
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,500
Starting next week,
I want you to pull one car out of service...

128
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,900
in the quiet posts in every sector,
all three shifts.

129
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,700
We'll take those nine guys...

130
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
then use them and double up
on the high crime posts.

131
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,100
If we handle less of it...

132
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,000
we ought to do better
with the crime we got, right?

133
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,900
- Can I get two Trac disposable phones?
- They're on special.

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,400
- Four for $180.
- Just the two.

135
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,900
The late show out at Westview is 8:45.

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,200
We could make that
if we don't make the whole damn run today.

137
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,900
Seem to me one phone
is as good as the next.

138
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,500
Only a fool would drive all over the world
when there ain't no need.

139
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,300
Keep on with that shit
and I'm gonna leave your ass in Baltimore.

140
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,500
I don't trust no man on the road
by hisself, okay? I'm not stupid.

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,600
Stupid-ass fucker. Commissioner!

142
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
How goes it?

143
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,600
It went a lot better before the Mayor's
cabinet meeting, I can tell you that.

144
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,000
He rip you?

145
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,200
Says we need to finish under 300
for this year, regardless of how it happens.

146
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,900
- Now, I tried to tell...
- Erv, let me ask you.

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,800
Where do you guys stand
on this Witness Assistance thing?

148
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,100
What?

149
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,900
Overhauling the city's
Witness Assistance Program?

150
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,300
Nobody from the Mayor's office
called you...

151
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
regarding this problem
of witnesses getting killed?

152
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,900
I got a call from Chief of Staff
a week ago, yeah.

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,600
But all he said was I should try not
to have any more witnesses get killed.

154
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
But overhauling the program?

155
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Unless someone wants to spend
a lot more money...

156
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,400
there's not a whole hell of a lot
my people can do.

157
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,800
And you haven't talked
to the Mayor directly on this?

158
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,900
You're not gonna fuck me on this?
As it is, I got the Mayor's teeth in my ass.

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,200
Your name does not get mentioned.

160
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,600
Mayor didn't say a word to me.

161
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,800
Thanks.

162
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,300
<i>... is nothing.</i>
<i>This is DC 's number one, WPGC 95.5.</i>

163
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,100
Where the fuck we at now?

164
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,400
Just buy four or five, Bernard.
Do it like that and it'll go twice as quick.

165
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,300
I want a Shrek Slurpee, Bernard,
and some Krispy Kreme.

166
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,700
All this
from one disposable cell phone, huh?

167
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,500
And a dead one, too.

168
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,500
It was used by Marlo's people
and picked up off the ground by Kima's CI.

169
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,300
Problem is it's just raw data.
We need to firm up...

170
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,000
what we know about Marlo's operation
with surveillance and CI info.

171
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,900
On the other hand...

172
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,900
if we had a burner that we knew was used
by one of Stringer's players...

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,400
we could use what we know
about that organization...

174
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,100
to make all kinds of connections.

175
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Get us one good phone,
we'll give you the network.

176
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,500
- That's the good news.
- And what's the bad?

177
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,100
It's all historical.
We can give you the network, no problem...

178
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,200
but by then it's a week old
and they've dumped their phones.

179
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,500
And how we get a wire up on that,
I haven't figured out yet.

180
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,500
Well, see that you do, Detective.

181
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,700
Oh, yeah, you keep this job,
I'm gonna gain some serious weight.

182
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,700
- Just the two?
- Just the two.

183
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
Nigga, you ain't never heard
of buying in bulk?

184
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,600
You could be saving them people
all kind of money.

185
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,600
Better still, spending it on me.

186
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,000
- Why you got a gun, Bernard?
- Oh, you ain't heard?

187
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,500
- Avon's home, so we tooling up.
- You ain't the only one on parole.

188
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,500
- You riding my last good nerve.
- And that ain't the only thing I can ride.

189
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,500
Just get me back to the interstate.

190
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,200
Big white bag, got the big white bag.

191
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,400
- Which one is he again?
- Broadus, street name of Bodie.

192
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,100
He used to be in the low-rises.
Had a Tower later on.

193
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,400
Big white, got the big white.

194
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,000
How many more minutes you think
he's got on that phone?

195
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,500
- Fuck this, let's hit the bar.
- Lester needs a phone, man.

196
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,300
No, there's an easier way.
I'll show you tomorrow.

197
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,100
Come on.

198
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,900
I'm buying.

199
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,400
Big white bag, got the big white bag.

200
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,400
She just wants me to be happy, you know?

201
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,100
And I mean,
I do the same for her when I can.

202
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,400
Like this thing with the police detective.

203
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,900
Brianna says she wants me
to go downtown with her and...

204
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,800
I don't know, hear the man out about D.

205
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,000
And I know there ain't nothing to it,
but she is all upset, you know?

206
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,900
And I tried to tell her what you told me.

207
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,400
But, she say she wanna go down there
and talk to him herself, I guess.

208
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,300
- You told her about the cop?
- What?

209
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,200
About the detective.
What you told me, you told her?

210
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,800
It's her son, right?

211
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,700
I mean, ain't she got a right to know
what's going on?

212
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,300
- Look, I just thought...
- What?

213
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,500
Why the fuck you gonna get her all upset
over some bullshit?

214
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,500
Here we are a fucking year later,
everybody forgot about the shit...

215
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,500
you go running your mouth
about nothing at all?

216
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,900
- But, String...
- What, and she gonna believe that shit, too.

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,300
I mean, what moms is not gonna believe
her son didn't kill hisself?

218
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
- String...
- Huh? She gonna take that shit...

219
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
go half-crazy with it.

220
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,500
- I just...
- You just what?

221
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,100
Sorry!

222
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,300
- When you tell her that?
- About a week ago, I guess.

223
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,200
When is she gonna go see the cop?

224
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,800
Think she gonna talk to a lawyer first,
ask him how to play it.

225
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,800
- Who, Levy?
- I guess, whoever.

226
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,500
- The lawyer.
- Levy?

227
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,900
- I guess.
- Oh, you didn't ask that?

228
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,200
And this fucking Royce just lets it slide.
I mean, I go to him, right?

229
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,100
Not to make points,
just to do the right thing...

230
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,500
what does he do
but blow smoke up my ass.

231
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,300
"I'm glad you came to us with this, Tommy.

232
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,100
"Oh, I'll light a fire, don't you worry.
We gotta move on this."

233
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
I never thought he'd have the balls
to just fuck the dog on it.

234
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,700
- And you were doing the right thing.
- Fuck, yeah.

235
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,700
What?

236
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,600
You went there hoping
that Royce would disappoint.

237
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,400
You want to know that you're better,
that you deserve his chair.

238
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,500
If I lie down on this couch,
do you charge by the hour?

239
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
Thanks.

240
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,200
You're not naive. Neither am I.

241
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,100
A man doesn't run for office
without being a bit self-righteous first.

242
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,900
Self-righteous? Me?

243
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,100
So, what are you gonna do now?

244
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Call a reporter or two, rip the Mayor,
maybe on background...

245
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,800
maybe go on the record, I don't know.

246
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,800
Rip him now?
With the primary next September?

247
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,700
Tommy, no one's gonna remember
a dead witness a year from now.

248
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,900
Better if you go to Royce,
confront him, not angrily...

249
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,500
give him a chance to explain
or maybe take action.

250
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,000
If he does do something,
then a problem got fixed...

251
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,400
and you can feel special for helping.
If he doesn't, you sit tight.

252
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,800
I don't know. Maybe you document
your meeting in a letter...

253
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,100
expressing your concern and regret.

254
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,400
Then you're set
if the next witness gets killed.

255
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,300
Win-win.

256
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,700
- Unless you're the witness.
- I know, you're right.

257
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,900
But he's taking on a two-term incumbent.
It's all gonna be ugly from here.

258
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,500
All right.

259
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,100
Yeah, it's cool.

260
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,700
- Need another 30 by Monday, all right?
- All right.

261
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,200
Yeah.

262
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,600
Forgot this.

263
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,300
Bitch, everything I say,
you hear backwards.

264
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,600
Stupid motherfucker.

265
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,500
Got them T's, white and bright!

266
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,000
- One for $3, two for $5.
- Blue tops, got them blue tops!

267
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,400
I got them T's.
White, bright, one for $3, two for $5.

268
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,800
- I got this, man, $5. New.
- No, thank you, man.

269
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,300
- It's only $5.
- No, thank you.

270
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Fuck you, then, man, fuck you. Fuck you.

271
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,900
I got <i>them...</i>

272
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
I got them. I got them T's.

273
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,100
Red tops, red tops, got them red tops!

274
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
Rockefeller, got some Rockefeller, hey!

275
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,900
Hey, seller man, what you got?

276
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,100
Got the long white T's for the young ones.

277
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,900
You ain't got no candles?
I'm looking to buy candles...

278
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,400
and toilet paper for the shit-bucket, too.

279
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,900
- You be back here tomorrow?
- I can't leave.

280
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,300
- I leave, somebody grab my stake.
- I'll be back tomorrow.

281
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,800
Yo, Johnny.

282
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,600
What's up, Bubs?

283
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,000
Shit, Johnny, man.

284
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,300
Just been chasing the pipe, you know?

285
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Shit's got me all digging and scratching
in my arms.

286
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,400
You know, it's cool.

287
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,900
All right.
Come on, man, you need a break, all right?

288
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
I'm serious, man, you need a break.
Come on, man.

289
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,700
No, man, look around you.

290
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
It's a soldier's paradise, man.

291
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,500
I'm a Viking, Bubs.

292
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
Are you a Viking?

293
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,400
Fuck, not again.

294
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,400
- You two coming?
- Major said to bring them down here.

295
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,100
He didn't say shit about playing nursemaid
to a bunch of goddamn animals.

296
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,900
Push it back. Get back,
push it back.

297
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,700
- Should we cuff them, Sarge?
- No, cut them loose.

298
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,400
The fuck we tell you
about fighting down here?

299
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,500
Only rule is no fighting,
no cutting, no shooting!

300
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,200
Y'all still fuck it up.

301
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,900
Next time you make me come down here,
see if I don't call for a 10-38.

302
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,100
Just so you know, dickhead,
that's an ambulance.

303
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Break it up, break it up, break it up.

304
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,100
- Did I wake the baby?
- You would know if you did.

305
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,900
3:00 in the morning.
Nice of you to check in.

306
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,300
- I went out after work to unwind.
- Yeah, you look unwound.

307
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,500
Well.

308
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,500
I figured you had everything under control
on the home front.

309
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
What the fuck is wrong with you?

310
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,900
What's with the sarcasm? How come
you can talk to everybody else but me?

311
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,300
Do you really want to know?

312
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,100
I'm listening.

313
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,500
I miss us.

314
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,900
Do not blame that baby. Do not do it.

315
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
- I'm not blaming anybody.
- I didn't do this by myself.

316
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,000
- We discussed it, all of it.
- We talked about it, yeah.

317
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,800
But...

318
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,800
I didn't have
as much to say about it as you.

319
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,900
- And why not?
- Because <i>you...</i>

320
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,300
You wanted this.

321
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,100
I <i>just...</i>
I didn't want to disappoint you on it.

322
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Well, I don't think I could be
more disappointed than I am right now.

323
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,500
You need to go.

324
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,300
How much you got?

325
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,600
Quiet overnight?

326
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,100
Midnight shift had to toss a crew
that was casing the place.

327
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,100
Other than <i>that...</i>

328
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,300
Too many damn children.

329
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
What do you need lookouts and runners for
if the shit is legal?

330
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,800
A lot of them have been cut loose
by the dealers.

331
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,400
It's like one of those nature shows.
When you mess with the environment...

332
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,700
some species get fucked
out of their habitat.

333
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,000
Did you just use the word "habitat"
in a sentence?

334
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,300
I did.

335
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,300
- Letting your lookouts go, huh?
- My runners, too.

336
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,200
Shit, what's the point?

337
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,600
So, here you are
making money hand over fist...

338
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,000
and you're too damn greedy
to take care of your workforce.

339
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,900
- I don't need them.
- But they need you, right?

340
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,300
You was all they had
when you couldn't work a corner...

341
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
except for touts and runners...

342
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,000
then it was cool to have them cut school
and work out.

343
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,600
- Okay, new tax initiative, my brother.
- Say what?

344
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
If you wanna sling
in Hamsterdam after today...

345
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,800
you and every other knucklehead,
you each got to kick in $100 a week.

346
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,000
- Oh, so you trying to get paid, huh?
- Not me, not for me.

347
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,300
Get the cash up, I'll be back.

348
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,100
Green tops! What's up? Green tops!

349
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,300
Got the green tops.

350
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,800
But it ain't something
I'm gonna go to jail for, right?

351
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,700
I mean, it ain't nothing like that, is it?

352
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,800
- That one?
- No, it was more black than silver.

353
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,200
This one, I think.

354
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,800
I can see y'all got some real ugly shit
planned for me.

355
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
I can see it.

356
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,600
You just bumped up against
a clever police is all.

357
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,600
Course, he gonna try to shame you
with the dead girl...

358
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,800
or some mess about children looking up
to Omar and his sawed-off.

359
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,500
All he can do...

360
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,200
especially since you backed down
what he had for a witness.

361
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,300
He working you with guilt, boy.

362
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,200
Yeah, but that fat man gave me
a itch I can't scratch, Butchie.

363
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,600
Oh, everybody in this world does
what they going to.

364
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,400
Me, you, the police.

365
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,600
Everybody in this world
got their own place.

366
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,300
And a man in your line of work start
worrying about how other people see you.

367
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,800
Playing to other people
instead of to hisself, he gonna get dead.

368
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,600
I still feel like I owe something, Butch.

369
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,300
I had a uncle down Carolina, he dead now...

370
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
but I remember he was grieving real hard...

371
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,300
real hard over chasing his ladyfriend away.

372
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,300
So, he put himself to punishment.

373
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,100
Took a knife to his little finger,
then his ring finger.

374
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,000
With them all bloody on the table,
he pulled up short.

375
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,500
For the rest of his life...

376
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,200
I remember him saying, "The bitch wasn't
worth more than a pinkie."

377
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But it was too late then.
You can try that if you got a mind.

378
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,700
I don't know, Butch.
A little something less dramatical.

379
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,000
You feel me?

380
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,500
You told Brianna
she could go downtown with this?

381
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,100
D'Angelo's her son,
how was I gonna stop her?

382
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,700
Look. Look, there's no harm done if
she keeps her mouth shut and just listens.

383
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,300
No, it's fucked up.

384
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,800
There ain't no call
messing with Brianna with this bullshit.

385
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,400
- What can you do?
- I don't know.

386
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,100
File a complaint against the detective
or some shit. I don't know.

387
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,300
Harassment?

388
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,200
Look, this is the same motherfucker
that had Avon's case.

389
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,500
Same motherfucker that's coming at me
in my print shop, talking shit...

390
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,300
and now, he coming at Brianna
with this bullshit?

391
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,000
A complaint's not going to do anything.
And the fact is...

392
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,000
if the cops are saying
her son might not be a suicide...

393
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,400
Brianna's gonna hear this out, regardless.

394
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,200
I suppose Avon should know
about it, though.

395
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,200
Yeah, well, I'll handle that.

396
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,800
- Not much slinging going on here.
- Western boys are sitting on the real estate.

397
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah. All right. All right.
That'll work too. All right.

398
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,500
Yo, Shamrock says we should take some
of our people...

399
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
down to Hamsterdam and sell off there.

400
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,500
At least, until these narcos roll up
off some of these corners.

401
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
- Come on.
- Yeah. Yeah. Come on.

402
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,400
- Car stop, maybe?
- Why not?

403
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
- Hey, motherfucker.
- Got it right here, yo!

404
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,100
Get that pink top, yo.

405
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,100
Not yet, you fucking rodent!

406
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,600
Y'all can't do this, man.
We headed to Hamsterdam.

407
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,700
You come off that car again...

408
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
you headed to Bon Secours
emergency room. You hear me?

409
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,500
Yo, Officer, we got immunity from y'all.
We going to the free zone.

410
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
What the fuck's a free zone?

411
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
Package for sale.

412
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,200
I'm saying, straight up. Why you think
we was headed there in the first place?

413
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,900
- Get down. Headed where?
- Hamsterdam.

414
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,900
Suck my dick!

415
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,200
- Hey, y'all wanna see a wagon?
- Fuck y'all!

416
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,800
Will you shut the fuck up
and cut this shit out now?

417
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,200
Like you said.

418
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,800
That's your receipt.
$244 for the hoop comes back to me...

419
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,500
rounded to $250 for my gas money.

420
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,800
This repays me.

421
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,400
And the rest of this?
Use it to pay them hoppers for the week.

422
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,300
Whether you use them or not,
you pay this money out.

423
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,100
This shit is like unemployment insurance.
Every employer gotta pay in.

424
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,700
If I find out anybody been holding out...

425
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,900
then he's out of here,
back in the street getting his head busted.

426
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,100
The least you all can do
is look after your own people a little bit.

427
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
What are you, a fucking communist?

428
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,600
<i>23-04. Need a couple of 10-16s</i>
<i>to Fayette, west of Vincent.</i>

429
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,000
- That's right around the corner from here.
<i>- 10-4. Units responding.</i>

430
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,300
- What the fuck happened?
- Car stop.

431
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
I got a g-pack from beneath
the passenger seat.

432
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,600
Yo, we was on our way to Hamsterdam.

433
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,500
The man say we don't get no hassle
coming in or going out. What's up?

434
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,700
- What the fuck is Hamsterdam?
- Lying-ass police!

435
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,200
I can't let you do this.

436
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,300
- Carv, they got a g-pack.
- On the way to the free zone, they did.

437
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,800
- You know the rules.
- Yeah, man...

438
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,500
- and I was trying to tell these people...
- Just shut the fuck up.

439
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,100
<i>... to any unit at the scene</i>
<i>at Fayette and Vincent.</i>

440
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,600
- Yeah, boss?
<i>- You got a situation there?</i>

441
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,500
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Yeah, bullshit is right.

442
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,800
- I told you to shut the fuck up.
- Yo, man, you gave us y'all fucking word!

443
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,400
You know you did, man.
This is some fucking bullshit.

444
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,700
Y'all some fucking liars, man.

445
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,700
Carv, will you please tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

446
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,100
Major said he's on his way.

447
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,500
Carv?

448
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,000
Oh, man.

449
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,200
- You sure that's the one?
- Reesie say that was the one.

450
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Who am I to say different?

451
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,200
Tell him I ain't gonna pay
till it proves itself, though.

452
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,900
I told him that already.
He say $1,500 for his troubles.

453
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,800
Damn.

454
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Conscience do cost.

455
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,000
I seen him, Bernard.
You hadn't even gone past the damn door...

456
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,500
and he threw all them papers in the trash.

457
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,000
- You lying now, I could tell.
- You is the only one who gives a fuck...

458
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,100
and if you hadn't been the stupidest
motherfucker that I ever gone out with...

459
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,400
you just would have bought
a whole bunch of them things at once.

460
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,500
I only need like six more.
We be done in like a half an hour.

461
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,400
How about we make one more stop,
you get six of them shits...

462
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,900
and I suck your dick
for the next 20 minutes.

463
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,300
Got you.

464
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,600
Oh, fuck.

465
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,500
Oh, fuck you all.

466
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,000
- Shit, I worked a double, man.
- Yeah, right.

467
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,700
- Bunk, line three.
- All right.

468
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,200
Tack it to the board, Mike,
you know the rules.

469
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,300
- Detective Moreland.
<i>- Heard you looking for something.</i>

470
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,900
Let me get some
of them Trac phones activated.

471
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,800
Eight of them bitches.

472
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,400
This one's for Sector Two.

473
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,900
Sector One, I'm using
that empty low-rise housing on Winchester.

474
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,500
- Sector Three, the old Koppers plant.
- And it's legal to sell here?

475
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,600
- Sector Three, the old Koppers plant.
- And it's legal to sell here?

476
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,000
It's not legal.

477
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,200
- We just look the other way is all.
- How? How can you?

478
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,100
Look, I know it hurts your head
to think about...

479
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,300
but before you decide
to lose your mind on this...

480
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,800
take a moment, ride around to my corners,
my worst drug corners.

481
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,500
Edmondson and Brice. North and Pulaski.
Hollins and Payson.

482
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,600
They're empty. All of them.

483
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,300
District-wide, my crime is down 5%.

484
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,800
- But do the bosses know?
- No, the bosses don't know shit about it.

485
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,100
Look, this is just a District Commander
taking initiative on his own.

486
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,700
Jesus Christ!

487
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,400
I knew it was a matter of time...

488
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,800
before I bumped into somebody
from downtown about this.

489
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,300
And I know your natural impulse is to take
what you saw back downtown with you.

490
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,800
- But I got to ask you...
- You legalized drugs!

491
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,700
Look, this is a tactical deployment.

492
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,500
We just wait for everything to get
settled down here in these three zones...

493
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,100
and then we move.

494
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,200
Look, we make a big show of locking
everybody up and then we shut it down.

495
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,300
I'm sorry I had to fuck you up
on that arrest.

496
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,300
And I'm sorry you had to see me
give that runt back the g-pack.

497
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,900
That was ugly, I know.

498
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,200
But I'm just trying to save what's left
of my district any way I can, if I can.

499
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,100
And the longer I have before I have to brief
the bosses about this deployment...

500
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,100
We got all we needed
from the car stop, Major. Don't sweat it.

501
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,900
Let me get a word with my old Commander.

502
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,100
I don't know, Major.

503
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,900
Whenever you bust this place up,
they'll go back to their same corners.

504
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,200
Besides, you were never much
on making a big show.

505
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,200
If this doesn't work, Jimmy,
I mean, it's just back to usual.

506
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,500
I'm out the door on pension anyway.

507
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Jimmy, I need more time.

508
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,200
I need to be able to rely on you
and your people to keep this close.

509
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,900
Bosses don't know, huh?

510
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,600
Fuck the bosses.

511
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,400
You the man who called?

512
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,100
I did.

513
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,800
You witnessing or what?

514
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,900
I'm afraid I'm blind.

515
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,200
Legally.

516
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Something you need to see, though.

517
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,300
Glock .40, I believe.

518
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,000
I suppose you ain't going to tell me
who brought this here, right?

519
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,600
Like I said, I'm blind.

520
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
I thought you might know, though.

521
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,300
You can tell him from me...

522
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm hoping he might need this
in court some day.

523
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,800
Man, narcos might come back.

524
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,900
They might.
But until they do, this your corner to hold.

525
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,400
- What about Marlo's crew?
- Look, Avon's home...

526
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,400
and you on a Barksdale corner.
You feel me?

527
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,500
- Avon ain't here now.
- You got muscle.

528
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,700
Don't worry about that, little man.

529
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,500
Hey.

530
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,900
The burner of young Bodie Broadus.
Still has minutes left.

531
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,400
Speed dial?

532
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,100
Caroline.

533
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,900
You wouldn't have an extra room
at your place, would you?

534
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Just for a night or two
till I can get my shit together.

535
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,500
- Ain't no fixing it?
- It's fixed pretty good, I think.

536
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,100
Thanks.

537
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,300
Credit card was a business account
listed to a Theresa D'Agostino.

538
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,900
Yeah, that's her.

539
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,300
What kind of business?

540
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,200
Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.

541
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,800
Billing on the card goes to a business
address in northwest Washington.

542
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,200
I called the switchboard and she's listed.

543
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
D'Agostino doesn't sound much like
a West Baltimore name to me.

544
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,400
Me, either.

545
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,300
Truth is, I don't know what I want.

546
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,300
I know I'm looking for something,
but I can't even tell you what it is.

547
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,500
- I understand you found work.
- Ain't no payroll job, but it'll do.

548
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,000
You ain't here for a job
or the GED program.

549
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,700
So, you looking to join the church?

550
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,000
I <i>just...</i>

551
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,300
I've had this feeling for a long time...

552
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,700
and it's like I'm standing outside myself...

553
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,400
watching me do things
I don't wanna do, you know?

554
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Just seeing me like I'm somebody else...

555
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,600
but never, ever
being able to stop the show.

556
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,300
I'm tired.

557
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,600
It's Cutty, right?

558
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,500
No, man.

559
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Dennis.

560
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,800
- She's left, huh?
<i>- She's out of the office.</i>

561
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,800
I figured that,
'cause I'm supposed to meet her, actually.

562
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,200
Tonight, yeah.

563
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,700
Right, exactly.

564
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,300
Well, I was going to pick her up
and take her to that, but I'm running late.

565
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,100
<i>- Her plans may have changed.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

566
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,500
Where is that exactly?
I'm not real familiar with that part <i>of...</i>

567
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,100
<i>It's on the corner of 15th Street and...</i>

568
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,600
Okay.

569
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,700
Too many damn
scheduling conflicts, unfortunately.

570
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,500
But we have put it on the agenda
for the next meeting...

571
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,200
of the Coordinating Council
on Criminal Justice.

572
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,300
You're sentencing it to committee?

573
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,900
Mr. Mayor, we're probably only talking, like,
a few hundred thousand to start.

574
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,700
I'm not saying we should
create new identities for these people...

575
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,100
send them to New Mexico like the Feds.
We just need to get them out of harm's way.

576
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,500
Let me tell you something, Councilman.

577
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,700
I can't lay my hands
on several hundred thousand dollars...

578
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
that's not already spoken for.

579
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,800
- Mr. Mayor, I was not...
- What would you have me do, Councilman?

580
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,200
Should I divert the money
that's already been budgeted...

581
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,600
for snow removal
from the First District this winter?

582
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,400
Or how about I reduce trash pickup
to once a week citywide...

583
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,200
put the witnesses up
at the Hyatt Inner Harbor?

584
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,500
I'm not trying to be difficult.
Tommy, come on.

585
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,600
The city in the financial situation it's in?
Very few friends in Annapolis.

586
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,600
We've done all we could do
with this matter for now.

587
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,000
Okay, then.

588
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,800
Well, thanks for your time. Gentlemen.

589
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,400
Ah, what the fuck.

590
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,400
I don't know, boss. If there weren't
so many fucking kids down here...

591
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,300
I might be okay with it.

592
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,200
- Baltimore police.
- Baltimore?

593
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,100
Baltimore, Maryland.

594
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,100
- Can I get a Jameson?
- Bushmills okay?

595
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,400
- That's Protestant whiskey.
- The price is right, isn't it?

596
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,000
Make it neat.

597
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,900
Excuse me.

598
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

599
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,400
- What are you doing here?
- Just asking myself the same thing.

600
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,100
You drive all the way down here...

601
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,100
to look at me from across the room
and then leave?

602
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,500
- That's kind of creepy.
- You looked occupied.

603
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,500
Him? Honey, that's just business.

604
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,000
- This ain't my kind of crowd.
- Definitely not.

605
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,600
Yeah, well, I made a mistake, so I better go.

606
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,000
- 428?
- You live in this town.

607
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,300
- Why book the room?
- I live across town.

608
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,800
As late as these things go,
that's a DUI away.

609
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,100
- Give me two hours, McNulty?
- What am I gonna do for two hours?

610
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,200
Dream on it.

611
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,900
Water fresh?

612
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,600
You keeping them cool?

613
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,500
You got squeakers nesting squabs.

614
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,800
Taking care of the young'uns.
I like seeing that.

615
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,000
Yeah, Marlo, he's real loyal.

616
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,300
- I can't kick him off that nest.
- This is good work.

617
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,900
- This is really good work.
- Police coming off them corners.

618
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,900
I seen.

619
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,900
Gonna keep my name off the package
for a time, gonna keep wholesaling.

620
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
You know, step back a bit.

621
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,500
Barksdale gonna think we weak,
not coming out to claim what's ours.

622
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,200
The police leave them corners,
he's gonna be back out there.

623
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,800
I know he will.

624
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,800
- Your turn, girl.
- It's about time. For real.

625
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,000
For starters...

626
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,800
its memory holds the last 10 calls
made and received by the user.

627
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,600
- That's enough to give us a signature.
- Signature?

628
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
The phone number's unique
to an individual.

629
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,800
That way we can identify the user
when he switches to another phone.

630
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,800
Sorry, I'm late. Woke up in the wrong town.

631
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,200
Anyway, we ran the tolls
on those numbers...

632
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,200
and we came up with
a rather interesting pattern.

633
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,600
Check this out. This is the pattern
of a closed communication network.

634
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,400
Something you'd expect
from a drug organization.

635
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,000
This particular one so far involves...

636
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,900
- 15 distinct burners.
- 15.

637
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,600
And none of them
list subscriber information.

638
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,300
- You can do that?
- With these burners...

639
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,800
with this particular company,
you don't need subscriber information.

640
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,200
Our data shows that over 92% of the calls...

641
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,700
were made within this network, with
the average call lasting less than a minute.

642
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,300
Again, suggestive of drug trafficking.

643
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,700
Now, this user here,
he serves as a clearing house.

644
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,600
He receives calls and initiates interactions.
He coordinates the show.

645
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,400
- Nice if that was Stringer.
- Now, this is the best part.

646
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,300
This is something that Prez discovered
when he was playing with it.

647
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,200
It has a speed dial feature.

648
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,900
Meaning, someone took the time
to program the phone.

649
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,800
Hell, that's probably the only way these
corner boys can remember all the numbers.

650
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,500
What with these phones
being dumped every few days or so.

651
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,000
I'll bet all the other phones in the network
are set up the same way.

652
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,000
Well, I've heard enough.
We should start writing for the wire.

653
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,900
- When can we get up?
- Get up on what?

654
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,200
They're dumping phones
every couple of weeks on average.

655
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,800
By the time you get a wire up on that,
the phones are dead.

656
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,200
The whole network
shuts down simultaneously.

657
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,900
- Do we have a plan?
- Not yet, we don't.

658
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,700
But, for now, if I could get
a couple more of these dead phones...

659
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,300
it'd probably help corroborate the theory
for the affidavit.

660
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,600
Kima, maybe you could ask those
Western boys to pick up what they find...

661
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,200
- on the ground for the next few days. Huh?
- Yeah, sure.

662
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,500
Damn, boy, you smell like sex.

663
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,800
- You didn't take a fucking shower?
- I was late for work.

664
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,400
- Forgot my Newports, didn't you?
- Oh, shit, man, I did, yo.

665
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,200
Let me do these chips
and then I'll go get your cigarettes.

666
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,100
<i>3- 1 on shooting of this number one male.</i>

667
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,900
<i>- We're gonna need 10-100 down here.</i>
<i>- Copy that... I'm on my way.</i>

668
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,700
<i>- Roger, 700.</i>
- Back so soon?

669
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,600
I thought you guys had enough
of our happy district yesterday.

670
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,300
Just need a favor.
Lester wants you to scoop up...

671
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,400
any discarded cell phones
you find on Barksdale corners.

672
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,000
You want Barksdale's license plates.
Tag numbers and all?

673
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,300
Whatever, sure.

674
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,700
'Cause I saw big man
riding in a truck the other day.

675
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,900
Missed the tags, but if I see him again...

676
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,200
- Stringer?
- No, the other guy.

677
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,700
- What other guy?
- Big boy, the one we locked up.

678
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,300
- Avon.
- Avon Barksdale?

679
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,100
Jesus, Herc. He's at Jessup,
down for four or five at least.

680
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,700
- What, we all look alike to you?
- Lf you don't believe me, fuck it.

681
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,300
No fucking way.

682
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,600
But the fact remains, we would not
be returning this service weapon...

683
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:51,400
to this officer without help
from the citizens of Baltimore as well.

684
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,300
And on that note, I think our Mayor
would like to say a few words.

685
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,600
Thank you, Commissioner Burrell.

686
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,800
I just want to take this opportunity
to commend our department...

687
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,000
on successfully resolving this case...

688
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,200
and to wish Officer Dozerman
a speedy return to duty.

689
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,300
<i>Officer Dozerman,</i>
<i>the citizens want you to have this back...</i>

690
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,100
<i>and to thank you for your service</i>
<i>in defense of our city.</i>

691
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,500
<i>And I especially want to thank</i>
<i>all of our concerned residents...</i>

692
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,800
<i>who called in to the hotline.</i>
<i>We would not be here today...</i>

693
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,400
- Lester.
- Lieutenant, you gotta see this.

694
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,300
Big joke.
