1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,700
No, Bubs. I mean, there's gotta be rules,
or else things get fucked up.

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,600
Ain't no rules with dope fiends.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,700
When the police got you shackled up,
you make a move, right?

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,000
You help yourself out.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,700
But you just start snitching for no reason,
that doesn't make no...

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Whoa, whoa! Let me track this.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
You hypopulating that you can tattletale
when you locked up...

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,200
but you can't do it
straight up for the money?

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,600
I mean, no offense, son,
but that's some weak-ass thinking.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,200
You equivocating like a motherfuck.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
Okay, so a snitch is a snitch, right?

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,900
- There you go.
- So why be one, man?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,800
I mean, we're getting by with our capers.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,200
We getting by out here every damn day
ripping and running...

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,400
and ain't got shit to show for it.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,900
It's part of being a soldier. I mean,
that's you, right, that's what you says.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,300
Yeah, that's why I put all this mileage
on these feet.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
You wait.
You wait till you ain't a pup no more.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,700
See if you ain't looking for something
a little more steady for your own self.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,200
What the fuck? You ill already?

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,300
It's not even past morning.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,300
I'm cool, man. I'm fine, I'm fine.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,500
Look, we hook up with my girl Kima,
we get paid, you gonna be better.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,500
Fuck that, Bubs, all right?
I'm not a fucking snitch.

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,600
You know I could argue the other side.

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,100
Say that if you drop dime
to duck a charge, then you a snitch.

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,200
You do it as a living, you a professional.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,800
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
You see that ladder right there?

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,000
Just like old times, man.
I'll be the bad guy, you be the Lone Ranger.

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,700
Leave that man be.
We get paid more hooking up to my girl.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,100
But that's cash money right there.

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,400
With the white man, I best be the bad guy.
That way he ain't confused.

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,600
All right, meet me in the alley.

34
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,100
Fuck.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,300
- Yo, mister.
- Yo.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Throw down your wallet,
or I'm gonna jerk this ladder right out.

37
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,100
- What? No, no.
- I'm a poor man who ain't playing.

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,000
- Throw down the goddamn money.
- No, please. Help!

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,500
- Okay.
- Hey! Hey! Leave that man alone.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,100
Oh, thank you.

41
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,800
It's crazy, man.

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,500
- What's that guy doing?
- Shit.

43
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,700
- Here, here.
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,100
No, you saved my ass.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,100
It's appreciated, you know.

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,400
Yo, Bubs, you won't fucking believe this.

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,300
<i>Bubs...</i>

48
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,700
Dennis, you up? Dennis!

49
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,500
Mee-maw, hey.

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,300
- Guess you're not working today, huh?
- I'm working nights now.

51
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,800
At a bar. Working the door.

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,700
You know, it's <i>just...</i>

53
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,800
- Just till I find something a little bit better.
- Yeah, huh?

54
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,000
Reminds me.
Your friend called again this morning.

55
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,300
She said for you to remember
your appointment.

56
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,200
Says there's a job in it, if you still looking.

57
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
So Marlo, right?

58
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,900
He got this one boy watching his back,
name be Chris Partlow.

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,300
Bartlow with a "B"?

60
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,500
"Part," like white people got in their hair.

61
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
- And "low," like a low-bottom dope fiend.
- Partlow.

62
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,700
- Yeah, what I said.
- So he's Marlo's muscle.

63
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,800
They say...

64
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,400
- How much is that worth?
- $5, if I can work up a photo ID.

65
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,400
The boy, Fruit, he used that.

66
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,700
Fruit who runs one of Marlo's corners?

67
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,600
- Careful, it's got prints.
- Prints, huh? Look at you...

68
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,300
getting all <i>CSI</i> on me and shit.

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
Now, a burner with prints,
that's gotta mean cash money, right?

70
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,900
If I could pull a print, get Fruit ID'd,
I can go to $10.

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,600
And if I show you
where Marlo hides his Mercedes?

72
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,500
Benz would go for $15.

73
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,900
I mean, you don't know it,
but these are hard times in a hard land.

74
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,700
You killing me out here, girl.

75
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,900
All right. $25 for the Benz.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,700
You good peoples.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,700
So let's total up. We at $40, right?

78
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,500
- Here, bank that for me.
- Bank it? For what?

79
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,500
Got me a plan, girl.

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,800
The hoppers out here, they only be
wearing them big, white T-shirts...

81
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,500
a couple of times before they chuck them.

82
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,100
So I'm thinking, while I'm out here
working for y'all, I get my ends up...

83
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,800
sell them shirts on the corner.
I'll make my nut coming and going.

84
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,300
Truthfully, I don't know what more
you could have done.

85
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
Charlie's right, boss.

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,400
- You tried.
- Fucking hoodleheads won't cooperate.

87
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Here you are
giving them their own block or two...

88
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,800
offering them a place to sell drugs
in peace, and do they even fucking listen?

89
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,900
It's a damn shame, too,
'cause if it worked...

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
you might have had a positive effect
on the community.

91
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
<i>Shift commander, call the front desk.</i>

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,800
You guys are some lying sacks of shit.

93
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,100
- I'm saying, sir...
- I'm guessing...

94
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,100
that you have some thoughts
on where we should go from here.

95
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,100
Well, sir, we were thinking
a modified zebra operation.

96
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,100
Jump-outs rotating from sector to sector,
combined with a zero-tolerance approach.

97
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,500
We detail a couple of men from each shift,
build a flex unit...

98
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,800
double up on the head-knocking
and corner-clearing.

99
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,500
- More of the same, you mean.
- But better.

100
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Better?

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
Better than nothing.

102
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,300
Fuck this bullshit already.

103
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Man, they gave us 15 cases of legal...

104
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,500
but they shorted us on the colored bonds.
What's going on there?

105
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
I got this.

106
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,300
- Officer.
- Detective, String.

107
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,800
You remember. Bird trial.
Detective McNulty.

108
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,200
You want something copied, man?
Search warrant, court papers?

109
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,200
- Anything I can do to help, you know.
- I ain't seen you around the way.

110
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm not around the way no more.
You wanna find me, I'm right here.

111
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,000
Right here, huh?

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,700
This and some real estate
I'm working on is all.

113
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,500
You know, more than enough
to occupy me, really.

114
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,300
- Say, where you living, man?
- Where am I living?

115
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Well, if you thinking of coming downtown...

116
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
I got some condos
about to come on the line in eight months.

117
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,100
You say the word, I'm gonna hook you up
something nice down there...

118
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,100
by the Hippodrome. Loft apartments.
Real nice.

119
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,800
You disappoint me, String.
I had such fucking hopes for us.

120
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,900
Have a nice day, Officer.

121
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,700
You see this shit?

122
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,700
Remember that kid
who got shot in the parking lot...

123
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,700
- in Lake Clifton a couple months back?
- Drug feud, right? What about it?

124
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,700
Well, last night,
they just found the only eyewitness...

125
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,000
- in an alleyway, bunch of holes in him.
- And?

126
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,000
What do you mean, "And?"
You're talking about a state's witness.

127
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,400
You let a witness get killed
in a high-profile case like this, it says...

128
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,100
"The city's broke and can't be fixed."

129
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,000
- Sounds like we found an issue.
- No, fuck the politics for a minute.

130
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,800
You know, this is something
we all need to be on the same page with.

131
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm serious, Tony.

132
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,100
You let shit like this stand,
pretty soon you got nothing left.

133
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,000
You gonna go public
and bang the Mayor with it?

134
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,200
You gonna bang Burrell
and the state's attorney then?

135
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,300
I ain't gonna bang nobody.

136
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,300
Like I said, fuck the politics for once.

137
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,500
But there is a problem here,
and I'm gonna do something to fix it.

138
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,400
You want your cape
and the little red underpants...

139
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,000
or you stash that shit in the phone booth?

140
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
I always wondered about that.

141
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,900
- Man, I'd like a piece of that.
- You'd like any piece at all.

142
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,900
- Nigga, I'd like a piece of your mother.
- Yo, stop fucking around.

143
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
I ain't started that shit.

144
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Yo, now she got our boy
with his nose wide open.

145
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,400
He's stealing from us,
and she most likely the reason for it.

146
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,100
Y'all stay with the girl.
She'll soon enough show us the money.

147
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,500
Hey, where you going?

148
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,300
Yo, I got something I got to do.

149
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,700
You supposed to be here
on this shit with us.

150
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,700
Y'all stay with the girl.
I'll get back with y'all down the way.

151
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,700
- Say what?
- Yo, I made a date a while back...

152
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,300
got to keep.

153
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Man made a date, got to keep.

154
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Hey, we find out he pussy-whipped
like this motherfucker over here.

155
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,900
Now, once again, from the data...

156
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,700
- when are most cars stolen?
- Sir, at night.

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,900
And your unit, which I believe...

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,500
is charged with deterring
the theft of autos...

159
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,300
when do you work?

160
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,900
The day shift, 8:00 to 4:00.
But, sir, as I tried to <i>explain...</i>

161
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,800
Your position is clear.
You effect more arrests of car thieves...

162
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,200
during the daylight than at night.

163
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,700
You see, our ears work. We heard you.

164
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,600
But the question becomes,
why the fuck can't you hear us?

165
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,800
Sir, I don't...

166
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,800
The Commissioner is attempting...

167
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to move this department
from the Dark Ages into the 21st century.

168
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,400
That means preventing crime
by relying on computer-generated data...

169
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,300
not on your
fly-by-your-fucked-up-ass instinct.

170
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Give me the auto-theft numbers
for downtown parking lots...

171
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,400
on Friday nights.

172
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,100
Sir, I have to check that.

173
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,700
Where are we with the gun?

174
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,800
Colonel, I was made to understand...

175
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,000
that recovering Officer Dozerman's
lost weapon was a priority.

176
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,800
The gun, yes, we're on it, sir.
Making progress as we speak.

177
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,700
Lieutenant?

178
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,900
Sir, I now understand
that prevention is the way to go...

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,600
and we'll immediately
change our hours to reflect the data.

180
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,500
All right, Lieutenant.

181
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,000
Fecal gravity.

182
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,200
You beat on the right people
and the shit rolls down the hill.

183
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,300
- Dennis, is it?
- Cutty works for me.

184
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,500
Cutty then.

185
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,500
So it's just gonna be us here?

186
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,000
- You know, I mean, Grace...
- Sister Grace called on your behalf...

187
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,100
but to my knowledge,
she didn't plan to be here.

188
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,300
She's a beautiful woman.

189
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,200
A man might say things he didn't mean
to stand closer to a woman like that.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You're in the job market though,
I understand.

191
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,200
A couple of questions.

192
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,000
You got a high-school diploma, GED?

193
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,400
Any work experience?

194
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,800
I worked in a warehouse
for a couple of months...

195
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
back in, like, '86.

196
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,900
How do you see the church helping you?

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,900
Maybe get me some jobs
or put my name on a list or something.

198
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't know.

199
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,300
I should tell you up front,
we don't do like that here.

200
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,600
You want a job,
you're gonna have to work to get it.

201
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,100
We'll help, but it's gonna be your sweat.

202
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,400
With that said, then, the first thing
is to get you enrolled in a GED program.

203
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,700
Look, I don't mean to put you out,
but <i>this...</i>

204
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,800
This ain't how I thought it was gonna play.

205
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,900
Me, Oscar, a bunch of the guys...

206
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,900
we seen it.

207
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,600
Couldn't help it.

208
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
They practically ran right past us.

209
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,200
And the victim, the girl, had a gun.

210
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,900
Whose side was she on?

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,400
Couldn't tell.
They weren't doing slow motion.

212
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,300
Did any of them have a big scar?

213
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,200
Do you think you'd be able to recognize
any of them again if you saw them?

214
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,500
- Just Omar.
- So you know Omar?

215
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,800
Omar came up around here.

216
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,300
That's good, Bruiser, very good.

217
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,500
- You do know Omar has a scar, right?
- He do?

218
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,100
I think we better go to my office,
put this down on paper. Come on.

219
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,400
Officer. Excuse me, Officer.

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,700
Is this North and Pulaski?

221
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,100
'Cause I could fucking swear Dozerman
was shot up at North and Pulaski.

222
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
No, no, wait, wait, let me guess.

223
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,800
The pursuit of your fellow officer's
service weapon...

224
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,500
has led you to this fine citizen.

225
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Tell me, kind sir, do you know
the whereabouts of said officer's weapon?

226
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,300
I didn't think so.

227
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,800
Calls from the detention center.

228
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Some kind souls begging to assist you...

229
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,000
in your foundering investigation.

230
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Let me just grand-jury my man here,
lock in his story.

231
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,100
Now for the gun. Later for his story.
And that's your sergeant talking.

232
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,600
Yo, wipe your nose, yo.

233
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,600
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit.

234
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,200
Motherfucker, you scared the shit
out of us coming up like that.

235
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,500
This shit do make you paranoid, yo.

236
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,500
- Go on, nigga, hit this shit.
- No, man, I gotta drop urine tomorrow.

237
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
Yo, you worried about that?

238
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,400
Go ahead, nigga. We got that covered.

239
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,200
Oh, you got that covered?

240
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,500
What, you think
you're the only motherfucker on parole?

241
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,700
- Yo, nigga, give me that shit.
- There you go.

242
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,600
All right. What was her day?

243
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,100
She caught a hack
up to Towson Town Mall.

244
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,500
Hit two jewelry stores
and came back with bags from both.

245
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,900
By the time she caught up with our boy...

246
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,700
she was wearing one of them shits
around her neck.

247
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,300
- Gave the other one to him.
- You know, his and hers, like.

248
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,500
Yeah, Cutty. She was on that shit, man.

249
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,500
It's been a week, McNulty.

250
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Either you got something on Stringer
or you don't.

251
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,300
He tried to sell me a condo.

252
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,700
Cocksucker.

253
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Might as well join the Rotary
and take up golf or some shit.

254
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,900
He's running with the hounds,
though I'll bet his heart is still with the fox.

255
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Stringer's out of the game?

256
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,400
Mr. Bell has become the bank.

257
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,300
The bank?

258
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,800
The bank plays it legit.
He generates a good bit of honest income.

259
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,400
But at the same time,
his money finances packages...

260
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,800
that he himself will never touch.

261
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,400
He won't go near the street.

262
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,800
He's insulated
from the everyday operations of the corner.

263
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,300
The money that comes back
is then laundered through...

264
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,400
enough straight business investments
that there's no way to trace it.

265
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,600
A player gets to that point,
there ain't no way in hell...

266
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,500
a working police
is going to tie a can to his tail.

267
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,700
Oh, man.

268
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,300
So, Kintel Williamson,
the prince of Pimlico.

269
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,200
- Where we at on this mope?
- DNRs on a couple of payphones.

270
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,800
That got it?

271
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,600
All right.

272
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
You gonna help or what, boy?

273
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,300
Might as well not even take a whistle...

274
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,500
if all I'm doing
is standing in the fucking alley.

275
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Back's where you belong.

276
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,800
Thataway I ain't got to be worrying
about getting my damn head blown off...

277
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,300
- 'cause you all scared and shit.
- Enough.

278
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,800
Y'all hear me? I said enough.

279
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Come over here and put some pumpkin
balls in this shotgun, man. Kimmy!

280
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,400
Both of y'all learn to live with it,
or y'all out, man.

281
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,700
Now, this time we gonna do it right.
Y'all feel me?

282
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,800
Boss, you gotta let this go.
It ain't gonna work.

283
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,000
You said in COMSTAT shit rolls down.

284
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,500
Now, we tried to talk to all the hoppers.
What the hell can they do about anything?

285
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,900
We need to bring it to the dealers.

286
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,100
Sergeant...

287
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,900
I need a list of names of all
the mid-level dealers running my corners.

288
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Sir?

289
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,500
You are my DEU, Sergeant, right?
I need a list of names.

290
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,000
Maybe Narcotics downtown
has something like that. I don't know.

291
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,900
We're knocking heads, taking bodies.

292
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I didn't know I was supposed
to be doing a census or nothing.

293
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,000
Hey, yo, miss.
Miss, where the pee-pot at? Thanks.

294
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,800
Come on, this way.

295
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
- Yo, my man need to drop a negative.
- Yeah.

296
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,500
- $5.
- Motherfucker, they was just $2.

297
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,900
You try finding clean piss in Baltimore.
$5 a go.

298
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,300
- Yo, how I know it's clean?
- I get mine from daycare.

299
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,700
I need you to put the chicken
in the oven at 375.

300
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes, and after you're done that, I need you
to help me put your sister down...

301
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,500
Excuse me, miss.

302
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,400
Put your thumb on the scanner.

303
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,300
Hold on a second.

304
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,000
- What's your name?
- Wise, Dennis Wise.

305
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,400
Take one of those.
Go around the corner to the second door.

306
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,100
No, you cannot go outside.

307
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,600
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

308
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,700
That's all we got on the Westside dealers.

309
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,000
George. I'm looking
at a sprinkling of rap sheets here.

310
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,000
Well, you telling me
nobody in this department know...

311
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,800
who controls
West Baltimore corners anymore?

312
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,600
Hey, Rawls has my people doing street rips.

313
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,700
You want up-to-date info,
you should try the intelligence unit.

314
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,500
- Shit, they sent me to you, George.
- What the fuck can I tell you?

315
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,700
With all the street work, ain't nobody
left doing the high-end drug stuff.

316
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,800
From what I'm hearing,
the guy comes in of his own accord...

317
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,400
and he gets betrayed by us.

318
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,700
Protection in this city amounts
to nothing more than getting dumped...

319
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,500
in a fleabag joint on Route 40
and calling it a plan.

320
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,500
No monitoring, no assistance.

321
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,100
Nothing. Just a bundle of clothes
and a toothbrush.

322
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,400
- Jesus.
- No way to treat a cooperator.

323
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,300
I know someone could get
a lot of mileage out of this with the press.

324
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,200
But fuck that, right,
because if I go that way...

325
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,800
then everybody gets defensive
and nothing gets fixed.

326
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,600
- I'm coming to you with this, straight up.
- Agreed.

327
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,900
Where do we stand on this?

328
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,100
You've already called for a meeting
on this with the state's attorney...

329
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,300
and the Police Commissioner.
It's penciled in for next Wednesday.

330
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,400
No, no, Tommy's right on this.
We need to act quickly.

331
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,300
I'm glad you came to us with this.
I'll light a fire, believe me.

332
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,600
All right, thanks.

333
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,400
- You will keep me in the loop on this?
- Yeah, absolutely. Councilman.

334
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,800
Hey, slow up, girlfriend,
we need to talk for a minute.

335
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,400
- Yeah, sweet thing.
- We met before?

336
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,100
- No, baby, but that can happen.
- We ain't met, excuse me.

337
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,700
- Hey, it's just talk, baby.
- Get the fuck out the way.

338
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,700
Look, girl,
all we need for you to do is talk...

339
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,500
Is you deaf or just stone stupid?

340
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,600
- Look, hold on, girl, all we wanna do...
- Whoa!

341
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,600
Damn.

342
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
Now, we gonna talk.

343
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,200
How the fuck is this little runt of a unit...

344
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,000
holding all this drug intelligence?

345
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,700
I made the rounds down at headquarters
and came up with jack...

346
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,300
and y'all holding all this.

347
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,300
Well, you run a couple of wiretaps,
you fill up a file cabinet pretty fast.

348
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,700
This is great. Thanks.

349
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,200
Oh, shit! God damn it!

350
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
I heard this was where you landed.

351
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,200
This pretty boy, I broke his ass in.

352
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,000
I wrote more on ID complaints
on Bushy-top here...

353
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,400
than on the whole goddamn squad.
That is, till he scuffed himself up.

354
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,200
Now where you at, McNulty?

355
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,700
1911 South Clinton Street, first floor.

356
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,300
There you go.

357
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,500
Yeah. I know you got to keep him close...

358
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,800
but still,
that's a good goddamn police right here.

359
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,400
So what brings you to our shop?

360
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,300
I'm trying to find out
who running my corners.

361
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,300
My own DEU is just about street rips,
and headquarters wasn't no help, neither.

362
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,300
- Y'all saved my ass, though.
- You tell him about your boy Marlo?

363
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,500
It's in the files, along with
every other mid-level player we know.

364
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,300
You don't mind me asking,
what are you gonna do with all that, Major?

365
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,300
Well...

366
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,000
we'll round up these young men...

367
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,900
and put a little COMSTAT on their ass.

368
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,500
Gentlemen. Ma'am. Bushy-top.

369
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,600
Bushy-top?

370
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
Uh, point of order and shit.

371
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Chair recognize the esteemed rep
of the Veronica Avenue boys.

372
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,300
All right, look,
we done talked this shit to death, all right?

373
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,000
- When we gonna vote?
- Rick do have a point.

374
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,900
All right, then.
All those in favor of going together...

375
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,300
so we can get the best discount
on a New York package, raise up.

376
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,300
- All right, then.
- There it is.

377
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Look like we gonna make
more money, together.

378
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,800
Got to say I'm proud of y'all
for putting aside petty grievances...

379
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,800
and putting this thing together.

380
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,900
For a cold-ass crew of gangsters,
y'all carried it like Republicans and shit.

381
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,400
Yo, remember, man,
talk this shit up when you hit them bricks.

382
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,000
Best way to get more involved
is to tell people...

383
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,000
about the benefits of this here thing.

384
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,800
No beefing, no drama, just business.

385
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,700
Anybody got problems
with anybody else here...

386
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,500
we bring it to the group.
We ain't gotta take it to the streets.

387
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,900
All right. Let's do it.

388
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
- All right.
- Yo.

389
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,100
Motherfucker, what is that?

390
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,900
The Robert Rules say we gotta have
minutes for a meeting, right?

391
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,300
These the minutes.

392
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,400
Nigga, is you taking notes
on a criminal fucking conspiracy?

393
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,800
What the fuck is you thinking, man?

394
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,000
- That's cool.
- Dad, he's cheating.

395
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,700
Michael, take it easy on your brother.

396
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,700
How are you two getting along
with Mom's new friend?

397
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,900
- We call him Dennis. He's not new.
- Okay, how are you doing with him?

398
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,600
Mom says we can't talk to you
about family stuff.

399
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,800
Dad, you going to the open house?

400
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,500
Yeah, I'll try.
I've been real busy at work though.

401
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,400
- New case and all.
- Mom says you have to go, Dad.

402
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,300
Yeah, all the other kids' fathers
are gonna be there.

403
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,700
Get his legs.

404
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,400
- Steal from us, motherfucker, huh?
- Get the ring, too, yo.

405
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
- Shit won't come off, yo.
- Drop him.

406
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,100
You know the man works for us.

407
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,000
You keep going at him like that...

408
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,500
ain't gonna be nothing left of him
to make right what he owes.

409
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,600
Bitch got to pay.

410
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,200
- Hey, yo, check his pockets, yo.
- Right.

411
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,800
- That dog's mine, yo.
- Fuck off! Get the fuck off!

412
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,800
What's up, baby?

413
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,900
Yo, man, I been in here for 26 months...

414
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,800
you come pick me up
in a motherfucking Ford?

415
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,600
I'm just fucking with you. What's up, baby?

416
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
What up, man?

417
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,900
Man, I'm feeling real good to be out
of this motherfucker. You know what?

418
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,200
There's a sign on the other side
of this gate that say, "Never again."

419
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,600
And that's the only fucking thing
I'm gonna take with me from this place.

420
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,400
First things first, man.
Let's get you looking right.

421
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
You know what I mean?

422
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,000
You got my shit. Oh, yes. Yes.
Good looking, baby.

423
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,600
Start with Sector One.

424
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,200
Bring as many as you can down to the
Vincent Street area by the end of the shift.

425
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,500
Don't use your wagons.

426
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,800
Bring as many as you can in your cars.

427
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,500
The hoppers wouldn't listen.
What makes you think these guys will?

428
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,700
These are lieutenants running the corners...

429
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,900
and I personally feel their pain.

430
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,200
Now, middle-management means
that you have just enough responsibility...

431
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,500
that you got to listen when people talk...

432
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
and not so much...

433
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,700
that you can tell anybody
to go fuck themselves.

434
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,400
Look, my major just wants to talk.
That's all, I promise.

435
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,900
- We'll bring you right back.
- That ain't gonna happen.

436
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,300
What the fuck you say?

437
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,600
What the fuck you mean,
it ain't gonna happen?

438
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,000
Let me tell you something, motherfucker.
We got orders to bring your sorry ass...

439
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
down the way for a sit down with our boss.

440
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,500
Now we're prepared
to take you with us right now.

441
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,800
- We can either do this the easy <i>way...</i>
- Brain-dead fucks.

442
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,700
It's up to you.

443
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,200
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Prez, it's me.

444
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,300
I think we got a little situation here.
Stay with me. 10-6.

445
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,000
Major wants the dickhead, you gotta go.

446
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
I think he gets a pass this time.

447
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,700
You sure? I mean, you want, he goes.

448
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,200
Another time, Herc.

449
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
We're on the Major's clock here.

450
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,000
Don't forget the face, cocksucker.
It's gonna be here tomorrow.

451
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,700
<i>- You need me to call dispatch?</i>
- No, it's okay. I'll tell you later.

452
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,200
I say we get the troops
and fuck these assholes up.

453
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,100
- Come on, let's go again.
- Come on, Tommy, it's just a game.

454
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,000
Look, sounds like you got what
you want, anyway. From the Mayor, I mean.

455
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah, well, he's played me before.

456
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,700
But so help me...

457
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,000
if he farts around on this...

458
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,600
I'm going after him. Big time.

459
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,600
- For real?
- Trust me on this.

460
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,400
He keeps ducking me,
I'm gonna fuck him good.

461
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,200
That's the good part.

462
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,700
It's what I call the carrot.

463
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,300
Now you move your people
into any designated area I told you about...

464
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,400
and you'll have immunity
from arrest and prosecution.

465
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,600
You're free to make your drops,
collect what need collecting...

466
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,000
won't nobody bother you.
You got my word on it.

467
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,200
- What do you get out of this?
- That's a fair question.

468
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,100
I want to salvage
what's still worth salvaging in my district.

469
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,900
And I can't do that with a bunch
of young hoppers running around...

470
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
scaring the hell out of decent people.

471
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,200
Now, these kids ain't gonna listen to me,
but they will listen to y'all.

472
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,400
Now, you tell them to move down here,
set up a shop, and they will.

473
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,800
So the way I got it figured, I motivate you...

474
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,100
- and you motivate them.
- No, this is a trap.

475
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,400
No, you check out the spot.

476
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,300
There ain't no cameras,
ain't no microphones, nothing.

477
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Any cops you see
going to be down right on the perimeter.

478
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,400
Just to make sure there's no violence.
And you watch.

479
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,400
You see if it don't work out the way I say.

480
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,600
Nothing personal against you, Chief...

481
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,800
- but what happens if we buck?
- You remember the carrot, right?

482
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,400
Well, you choose the stick instead...

483
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,800
you gonna feel that stick
like you ain't never felt before.

484
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,800
We gonna indict every corner, every day.

485
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,600
I got over 200 sworn personnel,
and I plan to free up every one of them...

486
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,500
to knock every one of y'all down they can.

487
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,200
You're on a corner in my district,
it ain't gonna be about no humble...

488
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,700
it ain't gonna be about no loitering charge,
nothing like that.

489
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,600
There gonna be some biblical shit
happening to you on the way...

490
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,800
to that motherfucking jail wagon.
You understand me?

491
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,000
And while you're bucking the new system,
the smart ones among you...

492
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,600
gonna be down here,
making money hand over fist.

493
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,100
So think it over.

494
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,800
But I swear to God, come Monday...

495
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,700
your world and mine
ain't gonna be the same.

496
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,300
I thought you said
these goddamn houses were vacant.

497
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,200
- We must have missed her.
- There's one more thing I gotta do then.

498
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,100
Little man, up on B tier,
one of his boys in the dormitory...

499
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,400
his brother's tight with the girlfriend
of the boy that shot that police.

500
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,500
Little man saying,
"If you sprung the three of us...

501
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,300
"we can get her talking."
You know, find the gun.

502
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,700
Yo, I'm hearing the boy, Dink,
got that man's gun.

503
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Now, I ain't sure yet if that Dink be...

504
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,800
Dink Dink or Inky Dink or maybe Fat Dink.

505
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,000
Then again, it might be Flatnose Dink.
No, wait.

506
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,200
Nah, nah, that can't be him, that Dink dead.

507
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,500
Look, man, I can help you.

508
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,600
But first you gotta get me out
from under these murder beefs.

509
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah. How many murders are we talking?

510
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,200
Look, man, do it have to be the cop's gun?

511
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,900
'Cause if it's guns you want,
I can get you guns.

512
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,600
I remember this. Sixth grade.

513
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,900
Mrs. Holley's science class. Box lunches.
Taste like shit.

514
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,700
You got something so important, man,
you can't go through the proper channels?

515
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,900
Well, no. I don't know.

516
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,400
I just figured if I told anybody but you,
you might think I'm riding the rock.

517
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,300
What makes me think you ain't?

518
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,900
Yeah, right. That's a good point.

519
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,100
Look, today, me, Tuckie, Little Mikey...

520
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,600
man, we all, a bunch of us
got scooped up by the police.

521
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,600
Well, you shouldn't sell drugs.

522
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,600
All right, all right.

523
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,700
Nah, see, they didn't take us to the station.

524
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,700
They took us down to the bottom
of Vincent Street...

525
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,800
where all the houses is boarded up,
and they let us out.

526
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,100
And then, on top of all of that, like,
the whole while they was being...

527
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,400
all like decent and shit,
and you know that fucked me up.

528
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,400
And then, like,
the police chief, he come out...

529
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,400
and this is the crazy part...

530
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,200
he say that he got it set up
so where we could sell stuff...

531
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,700
in certain spots,
and the police won't bother us.

532
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,700
I know, I know. It's fucked up...

533
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,900
but I just thought you should know.

534
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,200
- That's it?
- Yeah, just that and the boy Marlo.

535
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,500
Yeah, I'm on it.

536
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,000
Yep.

537
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,100
23-03 to KGA.

538
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,400
Have Foxtrot meet me on six, Adam.

539
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,200
<i>- Foxtrot, 10-4.</i>
- 23-03 to Foxtrot.

540
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,000
<i>- Foxtrot, standing by.</i>
- It's a black Mercedes, pulling out the lot.

541
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,200
<i>Copy that, we got the eyeball.</i>

542
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,500
This here the spot? 'Cause Tuckie says
we supposed to set up shop here.

543
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,500
- Hamsterdam.
- Yeah, this is it.

544
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Set up anywhere inside
where we got the white flags.

545
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,500
- Yo, I'm getting ready to roll out.
- You just got here. What's wrong?

546
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,400
Ain't nobody around to buy.

547
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,800
Good point.

548
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,000
- Man needs customers.
- I'm saying...

549
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,000
No. I mean, you can't make me.
I'm a sworn fucking police officer.

550
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,300
What's up, man?
You got that Body Bag still? Two.

551
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,100
Narco.

552
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,300
- Give it up, motherfucker.
- Money comes back, right now.

553
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,000
Boss, you fucking up, man.

554
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,300
You didn't let me cop
before you snatch me up.

555
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,100
Is that some fucking rule?

556
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,000
You call, we haul. You clean?

557
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,800
Yeah, of course I'm clean.

558
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,100
Stupid-ass rookie
didn't even give me a chance to cop.

559
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,500
This corner's indicted.

560
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,200
You move over to Vincent Street,
or we come back with the bracelets.

561
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,000
<i>Anybody available for...</i>

562
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,700
<i>- What you got?</i>
- 10-11 me at Riggs and Calhoun.

563
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,900
<i>Despite unforeseen delays...</i>

564
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,200
<i>we will begin an academy class</i>
<i>this January...</i>

565
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,400
<i>which leaves us in good shape</i>
<i>for the coming year.</i>

566
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,000
<i>Thank you, Commissioner.</i>

567
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,000
<i>The chair pleases,</i>
<i>I have a couple of questions.</i>

568
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,900
<i>Commissioner, I know that you are aware</i>
<i>that a state witness...</i>

569
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,800
<i>in a recent city homicide prosecution</i>
<i>was killed.</i>

570
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,000
<i>We are treating that incident</i>
<i>with the highest priority.</i>

571
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,100
<i>Homicide has set up a task force...</i>

572
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,700
<i>and Narcotics is working</i>
<i>the informant angle.</i>

573
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,800
<i>We have also asked both the FBI</i>
<i>and DEA for support.</i>

574
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,000
<i>It sounds like a full-court press,</i>
<i>but you must admit...</i>

575
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,300
<i>it's a bit like closing the barn door</i>
<i>after the horse is out.</i>

576
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,400
<i>I mean, the shooting of the boy</i>
<i>on a lot at Lake Clifton High School...</i>

577
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,200
<i>was a high-profile case,</i>
<i>wasn't it, Commissioner?</i>

578
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,200
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

579
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,900
<i>And yet a key witness in the case</i>
<i>was allowed... One moment.</i>

580
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,700
<i>Excuse me, Commissioner, but the chair</i>
<i>was good enough to remind me...</i>

581
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
<i>that you have a pressing engagement.</i>

582
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,300
<i>So if it's all right with you,</i>
<i>we can continue this at a later date.</i>

583
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,700
<i>Meeting adjourned.</i>

584
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,000
Did you see Burrell sweat?

585
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,600
- The man's collar almost melted.
- What the hell got into you?

586
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,500
You did, old buddy. You did.

587
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,900
End of the line, all out.

588
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,100
We got that Rockefeller, yo.
We got that Rockefeller over here, yo.

589
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,500
- Over here we got that Rockefeller, yo.
- What the fuck?

590
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,600
Yo, yo, we got that Rockefeller, yo.

591
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,800
We got that WMD. Right here, right here.

592
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,300
- I hear the WMD is the bomb.
- WMD. Right here.

593
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,800
WMD.

594
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,300
Give me two, yo.

595
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,200
WMD. Right here.

596
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,900
WMD, right here. Right here.

597
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,500
Right here.

598
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,700
- We got that Rockefeller over here.
- Yo.

599
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,100
We got that Rockefeller, yo.

600
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,200
- What do we got?
- There's binoculars on the floor.

601
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,900
- Marlo making a move?
- Just watch.

602
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,200
Forget everything the boy Bodie told you.

603
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,400
Forget the beating, it ain't about that.

604
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,500
You smart, man, I can see that.

605
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,100
I wanted you to choose somewhere safe
for us to speak.

606
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,600
But God damn...

607
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,500
only bugs in this motherfucker
gonna have legs.

608
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
Now, I appreciate smart...

609
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,000
but you gotta know in this game, man,
it ain't enough.

610
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,600
You a student of history?

611
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,200
You know this town had its share
of smart players, man?

612
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,600
Melvin, Little Wil, Big Head Brother,
Peanut, Warren.

613
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,400
All real smart, man, real smart.

614
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,200
But you know,
soon as their names rang out...

615
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,500
the feds was on them.
You know what I mean?

616
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,000
Government ain't want you to be organized.
No, they want you...

617
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,100
scrimping and scraping, killing each other
on the corner on some bullshit.

618
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,200
Not me.

619
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,000
That's why me and Prop Joe,
we getting ready to put this co-op together.

620
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,400
Different crews, one package.
Best dope, best coke.

621
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,000
Share and share alike.

622
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,900
- Been hearing about that.
- You been hearing about that?

623
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,200
That's good. That's a start, right?

624
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,500
You know that Mercedes
you got riding out there, man...

625
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,900
you got that titled in your aunt's name
or some shit?

626
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,500
Now, when they come get you,
that straw purchase out there...

627
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,700
gonna come bite you in the ass, boy.
That's what they do.

628
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,300
They turn your money against you.

629
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,800
Now, you,
I'm thinking with the corners that you got...

630
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,100
- you close to $1 mil, right?
- I'm doing all right.

631
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,800
You doing all right, but all right
ain't got your name on a crib, right?

632
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,400
Ain't got you a little spot for you
to wash that dirty money.

633
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,800
That what I'm offering you, man.

634
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,600
- Come on, who's he in there with?
- I told you, keep watching.

635
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,400
Bunk put you up to this?

636
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,700
Tell you what, how about a case
of that PBR piss you drink...

637
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,500
against a touch of the Irish
that he went out the back...

638
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,100
and you're watching that house
for nothing.

639
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,200
Here comes your nothing.

640
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Whoa!

641
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,600
I like my piss in bottles.

642
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,900
Anyway you like, darling.

643
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,200
Chris. Tell our people to tool up.

644
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm on it.

645
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:02,800
I got that WMD. Got that WMD.

646
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,400
I got that WMD. Got that WMD.

647
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,500
They get comfortable with it pretty quick.

648
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:17,300
- Yeah, it's like we ain't even standing here.
- The hoppers call it Hamsterdam.

649
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,400
Like from Amsterdam.

650
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,800
Hamsterdam.

651
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,700
...by the use of integrated math concepts
such as algebraic reasoning...

652
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,900
and number sense,
geometry and probability.

653
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,400
Very impressive.

654
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,700
Now what we try to do is keep
the class size under 10, 12 at the very most.

655
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,100
- And there are three levels?
- Yes, so that if...

656
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,900
Sorry, I'm Jim McNulty. I'm a little late,
'cause of developments at work.

657
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,400
Mr. McNulty.

658
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,900
I have some concerns
about the integrated math program.

659
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,600
In their previous schools,
Michael took introductory algebra...

660
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,300
but I understand that this school
is doing something different.

661
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,900
- We are. The integrated math program...
- Excuse me, I'm thirsty.

662
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,500
Can I get either of you something to drink?

663
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,700
The integrated math program here
<i>consists...</i>

664
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,400
Not much of a spread,
but you can't go wrong with <i>crudits.</i>

665
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,000
Crudity?

666
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,400
I'm sorry. You know, I came straight
from work, or I'd have changed.

667
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,900
No need to call names, right?

668
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,000
- What do you do, <i>Mr...</i>
- I'm on the board at Legg Mason.

669
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,300
- Jim McNulty.
- Legg Mason?

670
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,400
Either that or I'm a cop in the city.
I keep forgetting.

671
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,900
Terri D'Agostino.

672
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,900
I'm an alumni and one of the school's
dreaded fundraisers.

673
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,200
The math program
offers tutoring possibilities.

674
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,600
So if Michael finds it difficult adjusting...

675
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,600
we can have classes
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

676
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,100
- So how do you find the school?
- It's good.

677
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,200
Good.

678
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,900
My ex and I are thinking
of sending our boys here.

679
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,100
- Any problems, difficulties?
- No, not really.

680
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,600
I mean, there's the math integration class
for my oldest.

681
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,000
He's in sixth, seventh, and...

682
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,500
I'm just not sure he's ready, you know,
for all that math.

683
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,200
- Careful, I'm only a country boy.
- Shut up.

684
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,000
- Hey, sweetie, welcome home.
- How's it going?

685
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,200
- What's up, man?
- How you doing?

686
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,000
Welcome back.

687
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
Hey, sis.

688
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,000
Man, I just wish I wasn't the only one
coming home, you know.

689
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,900
I know.

690
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,000
Enjoy tonight. We'll talk later.

691
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,300
- Welcome home.
- What up, Prop? How you doing, man?

692
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,600
All right. You looking fit.

693
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,900
Hell, yeah, I've been working out in there.
That's all you gonna do, is work out.

694
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,400
Might be a good place
for a fat man to find his inner self.

695
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,500
Yo. I got some downtown suits
who wanna holler at you real quick.

696
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,600
Take me to see suits,
I'm trying to see some skirts.

697
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,700
So what do you do?

698
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,900
You should get dressed.

699
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,700
I got a lot of work here.
It's a long day for me tomorrow.

700
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,300
I'll be really quiet.

701
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,500
You never know,
you might get bored working.

702
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,700
I gotta work.

703
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,300
You gotta go.

704
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,400
What Stringer has done
with all that property downtown, Avon...

705
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,300
I cannot tell the kind of profit
you're looking at...

706
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,600
once all the federal redevelopment
money lands.

707
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,600
That whole Howard Street thing
is gonna take off...

708
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,200
and you're gonna be right there
to cut the pie yourself.

709
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,200
Any dollar you spend now
is gonna come back to you 10 times.

710
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:32,100
And the thing is, I know
you don't wanna go back to them streets.

711
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,400
Not after what you been through.

712
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,200
I know, 'cause I'm from them same streets.

713
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,600
And once I had the chance
to play a different game...

714
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,900
it wasn't a question in my mind how to go.

715
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,500
The government is going
to be looking at you hard, too.

716
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,700
No sense in giving them
what they're looking for.

717
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,400
You take what you have, you build on it.

718
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,600
It's all good.

719
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,500
Just put it up on the calendar.
We should meet.

720
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,000
Yo, Slim.
You see them two niggas right there?

721
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,800
They over there getting high
in the middle of all this.

722
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,200
Now where the fucking discipline at, yo?

723
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,300
Fuck, toss them niggas.

724
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,500
Can I talk to you for a second?
Don't you know not to stare at me like that?

725
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,700
Hey, yo.

726
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,000
I gotta show you something.
Pardon me, sweetie.

727
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,500
Yo, man.
You know I've been locked down, man.

728
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,700
You gonna love this. Trust me.

729
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,500
Okay.

730
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah.

731
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,700
Shit, this ain't my little place
down in Jessup.

732
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,100
But you know what I mean,
what the fuck is, right?

733
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,500
This is all you, B.
All you, in your name, too.

734
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,100
You know what I mean?
This piece of paper right here make it legit.

735
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,200
Keys to the Navigator in the basement.

736
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,400
It's just a rental
until you pick out something nice.

737
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,300
Damn, all this, huh?

738
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,600
You did good.

739
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,400
Yeah, I mean we're making
so much straight money, man...

740
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,100
we can carry shit like this out in the open,
in our own names.

741
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,200
Yo, you remember when we used to sit
on the top of 734 building, man...

742
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,000
Iooking at the city,
used to talk about what we gonna do?

743
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,000
And you was all heavy
into that black pride bullshit...

744
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,800
talking like you gonna get you two
grocery stores, make motherfuckers proud.

745
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:52,300
Sure was, man,
you was out hunting on a AK-47...

746
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,400
talking about "I'm gonna go get warrin'."

747
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,000
Man.

748
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,300
Yeah.

749
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,800
- We brothers, B.
- Always, baby.

750
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,800
Always.

751
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,600
And just one more thing, though, man.
You know...

752
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,200
I don't mean to be picky with you
about this...

753
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,600
especially not after you did
all this shit for me...

754
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,500
but, look, man, I've been locked down.
You know what I mean?

755
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,100
Yeah, you know what?
I got to take this meet.

756
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,600
- You <i>know...</i>
- I'm gonna get at you. Welcome home, man.

757
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,200
Yo, it's me, man. I left something.

758
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,500
Shit. My man.
