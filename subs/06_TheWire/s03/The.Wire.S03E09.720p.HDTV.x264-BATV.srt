1
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,400
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, what're you doing?</i>

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,900
Oh, hi.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,900
<i>- Are you sleeping?</i>
- No.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,200
<i>- Oh, you're not happy to hear from me.</i>
- No, I'm glad you called.

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,500
<i>I wanna see you.</i>

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,400
- What, now?
<i>- Yes, now.</i>

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,000
- Where are you?
<i>- Same place as before.</i>

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,900
Peabody.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,100
<i>- Are you sure you're not sleeping?</i>
- No, no, I was up.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,700
<i>You liar. Come on, get your ass over here.</i>

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,500
<i>Yeah, okay. I mean, yeah, what the hell.</i>

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,300
<i>- Room 210.</i>
- Fine.

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,700
- Sean, Seanie.
- What?

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,200
I have to go out and see a friend
for a little bit.

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,600
I'll be gone for an hour or two, okay?

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,400
I put my cell phone on this slip of paper.

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,600
I'll put it on that top shelf, okay?

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,300
What did I just say?

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,200
You're going out to see a friend
and your number's on the top shelf.

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,300
Attaboy.

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,600
<i>The Kerry camp had an early opportunity</i>
<i>to capitalize on jobs and the economy...</i>

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,400
<i>as an issue,</i>
<i>and tag the President with it.</i>

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,900
<i>The pre-election polls show</i>
<i>that a significant number...</i>

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,700
<i>of undecided and persuadable voters...</i>

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,600
<i>thought Kerry over Bush</i>
<i>offered a better chance for jobs.</i>

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,800
<i>Jobs may have been</i>
<i>a marginal issue, Kate...</i>

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,300
<i>in some of the Rust Belt</i>
<i>battleground states.</i>

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,200
<i>But, ultimately, this was a referendum</i>
<i>on the leadership of George W. Bush...</i>

29
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,400
<i>on the war against terror</i>
<i>and the war in Iraq.</i>

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,700
You're so full of shit.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
Nothing mattered in the red states
but the economy.

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,400
I've been saying that for months.

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,300
Hey, I'm not tossing you so quick tonight.
I got nothing to do tomorrow.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,800
Well, I'm tossing myself.

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,000
I gotta get home.

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,000
You know what, not that this wasn't fun...

37
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,500
but it might be nice to have dinner first.
Dinner and a movie.

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,400
- I got to Baltimore late.
- No, I'm saying next time.

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,000
We talk some, then we fuck our brains out.
It's different for girls like me.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,700
You need to be cuddled, McNulty?

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,000
No, but we make a date, I don't feel like
I have to charge by the hour.

42
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,600
A date, huh?

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
I'll call you.

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,300
In the daytime.

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,200
<i>I think we can all agree</i>
<i>that foreign policy and...</i>

46
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,600
<i>... while the United States was reeling</i>
<i>from the attack on Pearl Harbor...</i>

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,000
<i>... wonders of wood carving...</i>

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,900
<i>He wrapped himself in the American flag</i>
<i>at the convention and never looked back.</i>

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
<i>Come on, Kate, that's a little harsh,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,800
<i>No, I don't, I'm serious.</i>

51
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,900
<i>And I think it was great strategy</i>
<i>by his handlers, too.</i>

52
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,300
<i>You don't think that when John Kerry</i>
<i>kicked off... In his acceptance speech...</i>

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,100
<i>at the Democratic National Convention</i>
<i>he said, "I'm here under Old Glory"...</i>

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,400
<i>that he wasn't trying</i>
<i>to wrap himself in the flag, too?</i>

55
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
<i>No, I don't think he was trying</i>
<i>to wrap himself in the flag.</i>

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,400
<i>I think he was trying to defend the</i>
<i>people in the battleground states.</i>

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,600
<i>The ones who...</i>

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,300
<i>... 1942, the US 1st Marine Division</i>
<i>stormed the shore at Guadalcanal...</i>

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,200
<i>seizing a nearly complete airfield</i>
<i>at Lunga Point...</i>

60
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,500
<i>which was renamed Henderson Field...</i>

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,100
<i>and an anchorage at nearby Tulagi...</i>

62
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,100
<i>that would later be known</i>
<i>as Iron Bottom Sound...</i>

63
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,100
<i>because of the number of ships</i>
<i>sunk there in battle.</i>

64
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,400
<i>The landings of the first day</i>
<i>put nearly 11,000 Marines...</i>

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,900
<i>on the island. Minimal resistance...</i>

66
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,700
- Deep into it, I see.
- Yeah, we getting there.

67
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,200
You looking correct.

68
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Sunday morning.
I'm on my way to hear the Word, you know?

69
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,500
You paying those guys out of pocket?

70
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,000
Boiler in there's working
and the pipes are okay.

71
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,700
I should have it all cleaned out
by tomorrow, I think.

72
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,900
All you gonna need is the permits.

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,400
- Permits?
- Yeah. Permits.

74
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,900
- Yo, was that him?
- Shit.

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
If it ain't, we'd only be wasting a bullet.

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Only problem is it being Sunday
morning and all, you know?

77
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
- Who you calling?
- Slim Charles, man.

78
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,000
You told me we supposed to bring
our beefing before the group, right?

79
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,600
Here it is you warring
with the young boy, Marlo, over corners.

80
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,600
Marlo ain't in the group.

81
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Be that as it may, all this shoot-em-up shit
is bad for business.

82
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,100
We got cops on half the West Side corners.

83
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,600
And what corner they ain't holding, I can't
have my people standing on for fear...

84
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,300
they gonna be mistaken as one
of Barksdale people and catch a bullet.

85
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,800
Look, man, I tried to talk to the
young buck myself, but...

86
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,900
You try talking to Avon.
Because that's half the problem right there.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,500
No doubt, exactly.

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
- Yeah.
- That's it.

89
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,600
That's what I'm saying, man.

90
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
Nigga probably sleeping in.

91
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,800
Fact is, Stringer, your man
needs to reconcile himself...

92
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,200
to this new way of thinking.

93
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,400
Now, you could remind him that,
like everyone else in this room...

94
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,200
he benefiting from my connect
and from the wholesale price...

95
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,900
- we got by throwing in together.
- I mean, he know that, come on, Joe.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, so, now we coming to him for help
with a little something.

97
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,800
He need to just back the fuck off
and let the young gun keep his corners.

98
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,800
Now, you said yourself
it can't be about territory no more.

99
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,600
- Old habits die hard.
- Who this?

100
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,900
Yeah, it's me.

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah, we on the house where
the dude is, you <i>know...</i>

102
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,400
- Talk, nigga.
- Shit, man, I'm trying not to use names.

103
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,200
Look, this Gerard, man. And we're on Omar,
he gonna come out the house.

104
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,900
As you know, I ain't trying to lose
no niggas on them corners, either...

105
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,700
but it's a two-way street, you know?

106
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Go ahead, man.

107
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,000
Gerard and Sapper
got their sights on Omar.

108
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Tried to reach Slim and he ain't answering.

109
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,300
- So?
- It's church day, String.

110
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
Sunday morning, you know?

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,200
- They sure it's him?
- Omar, yeah.

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
All right, do it.

113
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Do it.

114
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,100
Gerard. They right there, come on.

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
All right, here you go.

116
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,300
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

117
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,100
This time, I definitely hit him.

118
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,600
District-wide, it's 14%.

119
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,800
A drop like that in the Western felony rate,
that's unheard of.

120
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,100
But God knows what happens
when you let go of your secret.

121
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,500
Hey, what happens, happens.

122
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,700
I mean, if they want to keep
my little experiment going...

123
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,100
or they want to go back to business
as usual. That's on them. But me?

124
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm out of here, D, I'm gone.
And Hopkins came through.

125
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,400
I got a contract offer
on that security job yesterday.

126
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,900
- You really gonna retire?
- Always planned to.

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,900
What?

128
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,600
You started something.
You ain't gonna finish it?

129
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,400
- What do you mean?
- On a battlefield you can't do much...

130
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,800
to help anybody with anything.
But you managed a truce, Bunny.

131
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,800
And making the game street legal
takes the heart out of it.

132
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Keep it going,
we gonna reach some of those people...

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
chasing dope and coke,
and maybe even some hoppers, too.

134
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,700
You might at that.

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,100
But what happens when you turn
your district over to the next man?

136
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,900
Or people get wind of this thing and
there's no one to defend it? What then?

137
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,400
- How's the contrast on that?
- Good for daylight.

138
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,400
Yeah?

139
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,700
On a Sunday? What the fuck, Lester?

140
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,800
Could say the same of you.

141
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,100
Elena's taking the kids to her mother's,
what the fuck else am I gonna do?

142
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
No life, no marriage, no kids.

143
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,800
No problem.

144
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,900
What's with the video?

145
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,700
Gonna put it up in one of the windows
across from Stringer's print shop.

146
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,100
Catch him coming and going.

147
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,000
- Hey, you need help?
- You're a known face.

148
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,600
I figure me and Prez do it on a Sunday,
shop is closed...

149
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,600
you know, looking like working men.

150
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,700
You know something, Lester? I do believe
there aren't five swinging dicks...

151
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
in this entire department
who can do what we do.

152
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not saying, like, all chest-out and shit.
It's just, I mean, you think about it...

153
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,400
there's maybe, what, 3,000 sworn, right?

154
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,200
Hundred or so are bosses,
so there's not a fucking clue there.

155
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,100
Few more hundred is
sergeants and lieutenants.

156
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,300
Most of them wanna be bosses one day,
so they're just as fucked.

157
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Then there's 600 or 700
fucking housecats, you know?

158
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,300
Deskmen. And the patrol division?

159
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,600
There's probably a little bit of talent there,
but the way the city is right now...

160
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,000
that's 1,500 guys chasing calls
and clearing corners.

161
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,700
I mean, nobody's knowing his post,
nobody's building nothing, right?

162
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,600
And CID's the same.

163
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,600
Catching calls, chasing quick clearances,
keeping everything in the shallow end.

164
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,800
I mean, who is there out there,
can do what we can do with a case?

165
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,700
How many are there really?

166
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,700
Don Worden, Ed Burns,
Gary Childs out in the county...

167
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,300
John O'Neil and Steve Cleary
over at Woodlawn.

168
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,200
Oh, they bring it in, but there's not many.
There's not many.

169
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,000
We're good at this, Lester.
In this town, we're as good as it gets.

170
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,800
- Natural police.
- Fuck, yes, natural police.

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,400
Tell me something, Jimmy.
How exactly do you think it all ends?

172
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,300
- What do you mean?
- A parade? A golden watch?

173
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,000
A shining Jimmy-McNulty-Day moment
when you bring in a case...

174
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,600
so sweet everybody
gets together and says...

175
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,600
"Oh, shit, he was right all along.
We should've listened to the man."

176
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
The job will not save you, Jimmy.

177
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,900
It won't make you whole,
it won't fill your ass up.

178
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,600
- I don't know. A good case...
- Ends. They all end.

179
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,000
The handcuffs go click and it's over...

180
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,000
and the next morning it's just
you in your room with yourself.

181
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,600
Until the next case.

182
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,000
Boy, you need something
outside of this here.

183
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,000
Like what? Dollhouse miniatures?

184
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,700
Hey, hey, hey. A life.
A life, Jimmy, you know what that is?

185
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,000
It's the shit that happens while you're
waiting for moments that never come.

186
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,100
- On a Sunday morning?
- We called to ask.

187
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,900
And Shamrock said to go.

188
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,700
On a Sunday morning,
y'all try to hit a nigga...

189
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,800
when he taking his
wrinkle-ass grandmas to pray.

190
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,500
And y'all don't hit the nigga, neither.

191
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,600
All y'all kill is grandma's crown?

192
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,500
And by the time Sham say go,
Omar damn near in the cab.

193
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,700
Ain't enough y'all done violated
the Sunday morning truce.

194
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,100
No! I'm standing here holding
a torn-up church crown...

195
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,400
of a bona fide colored lady.

196
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,200
Do you know what a colored lady is?
Not your moms, for sure.

197
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,100
'Cause if they was that...

198
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,000
y'all would've known better
than that bullshit.

199
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,500
Y'all trifling with Avon Barksdale
reputation here.

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,300
You know that?

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,200
Is she all right, though?

202
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,100
She got cut on her face from the glass
and she sore from where I fell on her.

203
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,300
But other than that, though.

204
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,200
You saved her ass, huh?

205
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,500
I damn near got that woman killed, yo.

206
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Y'all should've seen me in Sinai Hospital
while they stitching her up...

207
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,800
lying about why somebody
wanna shoot me down in the street.

208
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
That woman think I work in a cafeteria.

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,100
- Cafeteria?
- At the airport, yeah.

210
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,400
The airport? Why the airport?

211
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,700
'Cause I know she ain't never gonna
go down there to go dining, that's why.

212
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,300
Hey, yo, Kimmy, this ain't funny, yo.
That woman raised me!

213
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,100
And, for as long as I been grown, once a
month I been with her on a church Sunday.

214
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,700
Telling myself ain't no need to worry
'cause there ain't nobody...

215
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,200
in this city that low-down
to disrespect a Sunday morning.

216
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,100
Y'all know I was gonna walk away, right?
Y'all know that, right?

217
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,000
I mean, after Tosha, I was
gonna leave them people be, yo.

218
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,800
- Avon home now.
- Oh, Barksdale got to go.

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
Stringer, too. This thing got to end, man!

220
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,000
I swear to God, yo, on a Sunday morning,
they near shot her best crown off, yo.

221
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,900
I mean, no shame, them niggas!
Man, y'all feel me?

222
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,300
I'm out.

223
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,800
If you back to dealing
with Barksdale people, I'm out, yo.

224
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,600
I'm in it for the money.
It's easier out there than that.

225
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,900
Just you and me then. Like it was.

226
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,600
No, yo. This one about me.

227
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,600
- And nobody else.
- Hey, I'm with you.

228
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,900
Not on this one, you ain't.

229
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,100
Okay, guys.

230
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,500
We are maybe a step and a half away
from being up on a wire on these people.

231
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,400
All we need is to firm up the PC...

232
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,700
showing the disposable phones
are being used in a drug conspiracy.

233
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,900
McNulty and Greggs, you're on that angle.

234
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,400
You need to walk either
an undercover or a wired CI...

235
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,800
up to one of the Barksdale crews.

236
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,800
Lester, you and Prez
start typing affidavits...

237
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,500
because when the probable cause
comes in...

238
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,000
we're gonna want to get
the application in fast.

239
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,800
Detective, you're the chaser
on our boy Bernard.

240
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,500
When he goes out for cell phones,
we're right behind.

241
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,300
The faster we get ahold
of the new numbers...

242
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,500
the faster we're up on those phones.

243
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,700
Now, when Caroline comes back
off vacation...

244
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
she's gonna be on the mini-cam.

245
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,100
From here on out we keep a log
on any movement by Stringer...

246
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,500
and we keep an eye out
for Mr. Barksdale as well.

247
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,700
Try to get a line
on where he spends his days.

248
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,800
As for me, I'm off to do battle
with the wireless company.

249
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,100
They a problem?

250
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,400
Have been since
the damn things were invented.

251
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
Okay, then.

252
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,800
Remember that with this wire,
everything is a race against the clock.

253
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,300
Anything we get up on is only temporary.

254
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,900
- You reach Bubbles?
- Yeah. He'll be waiting at Mount Clare.

255
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,900
- Lee, where's the DNR log?
- What?

256
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,400
The log.

257
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,500
Never mind, I got it right here.

258
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
All Stringer, all the time.

259
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,800
Theresa D'Agostino, please.

260
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,000
<i>- Can you hold, please?</i>
- Yeah, I'll hold.

261
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,600
<i>I'm sorry, she's not in the office now.</i>
<i>You wanna leave a message?</i>

262
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,300
No, I left one already.

263
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,400
- A boxing gym?
- For kids and all. An athletic club.

264
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,400
"Gyms, reducing salons, public baths are
permitted only in properties zoned...

265
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,100
"B2, B3, B4 or B5."

266
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,800
All signed and sealed
by a registered architect and <i>engineer...</i>

267
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,600
Floor framing plan,
including the load <i>criteria...</i>

268
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,300
Hydronic piping and equipment layouts.

269
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,500
Six copies of your fire protection plan...

270
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,200
with emergency exits
and sprinkler system noted.

271
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,900
Health Department since
it's a physical culture and health service.

272
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,200
A license from the State Athletic
Commission up on Calvert Street.

273
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,700
- Mid-size or full?
- Mid-size.

274
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,400
You should upgrade
and get one of them Escalades.

275
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,900
They got that XM radio and all.

276
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm saying if we gonna be in that damn car
all damn day, it's worth it, Bernard.

277
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,900
- You ticklish, Bubs?
- The chills, Kima.

278
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,700
You do that to me.

279
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Here's the buy money, Bubs.
Remember, this is all on tape.

280
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,300
I hear you.

281
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,600
So, down there on Vincent Street, they
don't even hide the ground stash anymore.

282
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,300
You watch and wait,
see when they're running low...

283
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,900
and ask for 30 or so. Enough so that
they have to call for a quick re-up.

284
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,200
That's the important thing.
We want him to use his burner.

285
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,800
- All right. I get to keep the 30.
- Thirty'd kill you, Bubs.

286
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,500
You get to keep the money we hand you...

287
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,300
once you come back here
with all of that product.

288
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,300
- I was just asking.
- Just telling.

289
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,300
- It can't be done.
- Excuse me?

290
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,800
The activation information
you're gonna want?

291
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,400
That stuff's not accessible from the
business office until it goes to billing...

292
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
and that takes a few days,
sometimes a week or more.

293
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,100
But, more than that, we have dozens of
law enforcement inquiries every month.

294
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,100
We get to them in the order received
and currently the turnaround's 30 days.

295
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
Thirty days?

296
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,100
Let me understand something.

297
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,800
Your company is in business
selling disposable cell phones...

298
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,600
to people who don't have to give
any subscriber information...

299
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,800
- at the time of purchase, correct?
- Correct.

300
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,200
They buy these phones
and as far as you're concerned...

301
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,200
they use them anonymously,
pre-paying for their <i>minutes...</i>

302
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,500
From the retailers, yes.

303
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,300
And while they're using these phones
anonymously, for whatever purpose...

304
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,800
they can't be monitored by
law enforcement because your company...

305
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,900
can't react within a month
to a court order for a wiretap?

306
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,800
- We do the best we can.
- This is bullshit.

307
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,300
You're selling a phone that you know
is effective for drug trafficking.

308
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,700
Lieutenant, our prepaid inventory is there
for young people...

309
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,600
college students and such, people who
can't afford a permanent cell phone plan.

310
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
What college student
can't afford a cell phone?

311
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,100
They can afford the fucking college,
they can afford the phone that goes with it.

312
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,300
I resent the suggestion.

313
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,300
Just so I'm clear, you're telling me
that even if by some miracle we are able...

314
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,500
to get up on a drug dealer's disposable cell
phone in time to catch him talking...

315
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,700
you're gonna take as much as a month
to activate our tap.

316
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,800
Well, if you have a problem with that, your
office can contact our general counsel.

317
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,500
That's all I can say.

318
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,200
How about this? How about
the State's Attorney for Baltimore City...

319
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,500
calls a press conference
on the courthouse steps to declare that...

320
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,500
Bay Wireless is in league with the most
violent drug traffickers in the city...

321
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,200
preventing their apprehension and arrest
by law enforcement.

322
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
Four to five days turnaround.
Best we can do.

323
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,800
I swear, I felt like a damn balloon
with air rushing out my ass...

324
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,600
going from desk to desk.

325
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,300
This is our new man, huh?

326
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
- Frank Reid.
- Dennis Wise.

327
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Reverend, our man Dennis spent all day...

328
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,000
down at the Benton Building,
trying for permits.

329
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,000
- On the new gym?
- Yeah.

330
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,900
You use my name?

331
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,700
You use anybody's name?

332
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,300
Hell, man. There was a time I'd have used
Smith and Wesson.

333
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,400
No, look, man, I'm just saying, how y'all
regular folk get it done in this town?

334
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,300
Doreen, ring Delegate Watkins, please.

335
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
- Yellow tops, yellow tops.
- Obliged, man, obliged.

336
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,300
Keeping it close, you know?
You tell a friend, okay?

337
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,700
Too hot for them black tees, right?

338
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,300
- What's up, papa, what you hawking?
- Body bags.

339
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,800
All right, let me get 30. Thirty pills.

340
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,800
Thirty? Where the fuck your raggedy-ass...

341
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,800
come up with $300
in motherfucking cash, man?

342
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,700
Well, I've been selling these
T-shirts for weeks now, you know.

343
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,600
I mean, I might be raggedy,
but I'm in a cash business.

344
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,100
You want my money or no?

345
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, we out. All right.

346
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,900
Shouldn't be long.

347
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,300
A bulk purchase justify a discount, right?

348
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,500
- $250 or so?
- $275.

349
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,300
- And a couple of them whiteys.
- Yeah, that'll work.

350
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,700
<i>- That'll work.</i>
- Bubs just made another $25.

351
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
- Theresa D'Agostino, please.
<i>- I'm sorry, but she's not in.</i>

352
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,400
<i>- Can I take a message?</i>
- No, I'll call back.

353
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,400
- So, how's that working?
- What?

354
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,800
- Your new ho.
- So far, so good.

355
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
- You got the receipts, man?
- Yeah, most of them.

356
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,900
A few blew out the damn window
on the interstate.

357
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,200
What, y'all waiting to see Avon?

358
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,200
Man, I hear y'all shot the crown off
an old lady's head yesterday.

359
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,900
Good, y'all made it.

360
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, we putting in some work.
Come on upstairs so we can talk.

361
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,400
Back with numbers.

362
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,000
- How many?
- Twenty-four Trac phones.

363
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,500
Two each from Mondo Marts in Catonsville
and Sykesville and four from Frederick...

364
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,900
and then eight each from two stops
over the river in West Virginia.

365
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,200
Those bumper beepers?
They work great, man.

366
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,200
- He went out l-70 this time.
- Can you blame him? The scenery's better.

367
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,200
Twenty-four, huh?

368
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
We're gonna have a lot of DNRs up.
But with any luck...

369
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,600
one of these phones leads
to young Mr. Bodie Broadus.

370
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,600
- You wanna call Pearlman?
- All right.

371
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,200
Who's hungry?

372
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,200
- How about Chinese?
- Sounds good to me.

373
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,600
- You guys call it in and I'll go.
- Let me have some of that lo mein.

374
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,500
You take a turn typing this shit
and I'll go with him.

375
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,800
- Make mine sweet and sour.
- Lo mein for me.

376
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,500
Get rolling?

377
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,300
So y'all get with Charles,
he gonna give you all the details on it.

378
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,700
- Who that?
- East Side niggas.

379
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,100
Be willing to soldier up for us on retainer.
Milton put me up on them.

380
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,900
Man, we gonna be back where we was,
String. You know, I can smell it.

381
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,700
We just got to get this boy Marlo
and then we spread out like we do.

382
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,200
Them co-op boys, man, they ain't
too happy about this situation, man.

383
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah. They say they got cops on corners
where they wouldn't have otherwise.

384
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,400
- Everybody nervous.
- Man, fuck them niggas.

385
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,000
I mean, Prop Joe said he'd mediate.
You know what I mean?

386
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,400
Go to Marlo, talk on it.

387
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,700
Yeah, well, if he take a gun with him,
maybe it could work.

388
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,300
Let me ask you something, though.

389
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,800
Did you tell them discount-ass niggas
that they could pop off at Omar grandma?

390
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,800
Oh, man. Sham come to me
in the middle of the meeting...

391
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,400
and talk about they got their sights on
Omar.

392
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,800
They say nothing about no grandma.
No church hat, nothing like that.

393
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,000
I hear the cocksucker's name, I say, "go."

394
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,600
- On a Sunday morning?
- Yo, I don't give a fuck, man.

395
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,500
I hear that cocksucker's name, man,
I ain't thinking about a church day.

396
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,300
The Sunday truce been around
long as the game itself, man.

397
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,800
I mean, you know what I'm saying,
you can do some shit...

398
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,800
and be like "what the fuck,"
but, hey, just never on no Sunday, man.

399
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,200
I mean, it's just like people
was talking on us and all...

400
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,800
and the stories are
getting bigger and bigger.

401
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,200
Like, I swear to God, Fatface Rick heard
that our people went and shot...

402
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,800
Omar granny in the ass
on purpose, and all that.

403
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,800
And that pulled their dicks out,
pissed on her crown and shit.

404
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,300
No, I mean, I heard the same bullshit.

405
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,200
Prop Joe gave me an earful.
But, yo, what can I say, man?

406
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,600
Good help is hard to find.

407
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,600
If it wasn't, you think I'd be paying
East Side niggas for shit?

408
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,300
Yeah. Yo, we still off them corners?

409
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,700
Yeah, got to be.

410
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,000
We gonna be off them corners
till we take care of Marlo.

411
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah, maybe we should
put a couple more crews...

412
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,000
on them free zones them cops got.

413
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,500
You know what I mean?
Take the profit where we can.

414
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,100
- You trust that shit?
- I mean, so far.

415
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,100
And if they running game, man,
they ain't gonna get...

416
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,300
nobody higher than a crew chief
to take a charge, right?

417
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
What you gonna do with them two niggas
you got waiting downstairs?

418
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,300
I gonna make them buy the lady a new hat.

419
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,200
What're we waiting for? Sweet and sour?

420
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,000
You do the cookie first?

421
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
What's the difference?

422
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,700
"A new friend makes himself known."

423
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,900
Himself?

424
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,700
If it was "herself,"
then you'd have a fortune.

425
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Shit, I'm married with lawn furniture, man.

426
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,100
The technology's out of control,
no question.

427
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,500
But that's nothing new.

428
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,200
The way these guys are using disposables
nowadays...

429
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,000
we cannot get a working wire up in time.

430
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,600
By the time we get subscriber
information and papers served...

431
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,600
They're dumping phones.

432
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,000
Cellular carriers tell them they need
nearly a week to process the paperwork.

433
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,600
They're only half-scared of us,
but a visit from the Feds?

434
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,100
- You all have profile enough to push them.
- I don't know.

435
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,000
If you've got them down to five days,
you're doing about as well as we can.

436
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,900
Once again, guys, the Bureau's
a little busy with counter-terrorism.

437
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,400
And our US Attorney here...

438
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,100
he only touches himself
at the mention of political corruption.

439
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,900
Ghetto drug stuff just doesn't rate.
I'm sorry to say.

440
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,000
Shit always smells best in the car,
going home.

441
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,500
<i>Unit 13. In the alley in the rear,</i>
<i>East Side, 800 North Montford.</i>

442
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,600
- That's five blocks, up and over.
- Go.

443
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,700
<i>What's the cross street?</i>
<i>What's the cross street?</i>

444
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,800
<i>Shots fired.</i>
<i>Sounded like it was west of Milton.</i>

445
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,900
I'm police! He's 10-7, call it in.

446
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,600
A Glock.

447
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,100
I saw the gun as he turned.

448
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,500
It's Derrick. Jesus Christ.

449
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
You killed Derrick. It's Waggoner.

450
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,700
You fucking killed Waggoner!

451
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,400
- Greggs.
<i>- Prez shot another cop.</i>

452
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,100
What?

453
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,600
<i>It was an accident in an alley,</i>
<i>a little while ago.</i>

454
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,300
- No.
<i>- I'll call you back.</i>

455
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,800
- You here for Barksdale?
- I'm here for peace, man.

456
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,100
- There's some senseless shit going on.
- But Barksdale ain't sent you?

457
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
No, Stringer knows I'm here, man.

458
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,200
If I can bring something respectful back,
they most likely to show the same.

459
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,600
Tell the boy he can come in with the co-op.

460
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,700
If he takes our package, which by the way...

461
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,300
is better than the best
he putting out there now...

462
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,200
he'll keep his corners. Guaranteed.

463
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,500
He might listen. But the boy got ideas.

464
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,900
And he's thinking Avon weak right now.

465
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,900
You ever know Avon Barksdale
to back down from anything?

466
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,400
A plainclothesman in a dark alley,
with his gun out and shots fired.

467
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Look, no one wants to burn anybody...

468
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,600
but the fact is
there's a racial component to consider.

469
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,900
- The appearance of it...
- Has he seen a lawyer?

470
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,600
- Lieutenant.
- What?

471
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,000
He's in a situation where
you can't compel a statement...

472
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
out of him until you read him his rights,
and we haven't done that yet, so...

473
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,600
I'm his commanding officer.
I just want to know if he's all right.

474
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,100
Okay, okay, there's <i>just...</i>

475
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,300
It's a legal question at this point.

476
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,400
Can I get you anything?

477
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,500
You should call the union, Roland.

478
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,500
Talk to a lawyer
before you say anything further.

479
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,900
I'm not saying anyone's gonna
charge anything criminally.

480
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,200
Everyone knows you had no intention <i>of...</i>

481
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,200
But administratively...

482
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,400
you need to be careful
because of the racial thing.

483
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,900
You see that, right?

484
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,500
There's gonna be people in the Department
who see this that way.

485
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,900
- You see that, right?
- I wasn't scared, I wasn't angry.

486
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,500
I didn't give a shit he was black
or <i>whatever...</i>

487
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,200
Or maybe I did.

488
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,400
How the fuck do you know
if that's in your head or if it's not?

489
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,100
- But you saw the gun.
- Yeah.

490
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah, he turned toward me <i>and...</i>

491
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,000
'Cause you shouted, right?
You shouted, "police" and he turned, right?

492
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,600
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I said anything.

493
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,700
I don't think he did.

494
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,300
I was a couple steps in the alley
and he turned and I saw the gun.

495
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,500
That's all.

496
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,100
- Did he have kids? A wife?
- I don't know.

497
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
They won't say.
They won't talk to me about him.

498
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,600
Call the FOP. Get a lawyer, Roland.

499
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,600
No, sir.

500
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,700
I'm done.

501
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,800
Let the lawyer talk for you.

502
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,700
Lieutenant...

503
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
tell Lester I'm sorry.

504
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,100
Call the union.
He wants a lawyer in there with him.

505
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,700
Whenever he's done here,
you need to send someone home with him.

506
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,300
For tonight at least, he's a suicide watch.

507
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,500
Lieutenant. You'll back him?

508
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,600
What I mean is, if this thing should turn...

509
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,600
into some kind of a black-white thing,
you're his unit commander...

510
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,500
he can count on you, right?

511
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,600
You all right?

512
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,600
Lo mein.

513
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
What a clusterfuck.

514
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,900
- How many years on for Waggoner?
- Six and a half.

515
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,400
Two commendations,
16th on the current sergeants list.

516
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Pretty much the exact opposite
of that goof in there.

517
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
You know what's in that guy's jacket?

518
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,100
Motherfucker flaked out,
shot up his own radio car.

519
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,900
They were gonna charge him
with false report until Valchek weighed in.

520
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,400
You know he married
Valchek's daughter, right?

521
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,700
Fucking goof had nine lives
behind that shit.

522
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,600
Eight up, and the rest still to be activated...

523
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,300
whenever the cellular company
gets to our subpoenas.

524
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,300
You did good, detective.

525
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,200
So we're looking for what?

526
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Looking for one of these phones
to give us a signature on our man Bodie.

527
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:29,000
Calls to his girlfriend, his grandmother.
The numbers we pulled off the burners.

528
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,500
We see that, we know it's his phone.

529
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,800
We know it's his phone,
we know he use it to sell drugs.

530
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,600
We know all that.

531
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Then we get a tap up and pray like hell
he doesn't throw it away anytime soon.

532
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,900
Prez would love this.

533
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,900
I ain't gonna lie to you all.

534
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,000
I don't know about nothing
except the boxing part.

535
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,900
That's all I was thinking.

536
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,600
- Were you a pug?
- Yeah, I was.

537
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,800
But I got sidetracked, though.

538
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, Reverend Reid seems to think
you'd be quite a draw...

539
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,800
for some of these corner kids that we got.

540
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,500
They didn't think so downtown?

541
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,900
Well, the fact is you're looking to put
your gym in the Fourth District.

542
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,100
So your councilperson
would be Eunetta Perkins.

543
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,600
Do you know Miss Perkins?

544
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,700
Well, few of us do anymore. Few of us do.

545
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Well, since we can't really
rely on Miss Perkins...

546
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
Miss Daniels here will go with you.

547
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,100
She's here because constituent service
is the life of a city councilperson.

548
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,500
- She needs to get a taste of that.
- At least I hope I do.

549
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,400
If you don't mind me asking, Mr. Watkins.
Why are you doing this?

550
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,900
Do you know who Reverend Reid is?

551
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,200
Well, the voters in my district do.

552
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,800
This came today?

553
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,000
Well, now, see, this is fucked up.

554
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,200
Oh, I give you $250,000
to have them tell me my paperwork...

555
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,500
is insufficient enough to certify me
as a developer in the empowerment zone?

556
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,000
- Yeah, yeah, you could call it fucked up.
- Look, I know we touched the right people.

557
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,300
Just let me get with them,
clear this mess right up.

558
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,800
- Get with them.
- Hey, I'm on it, String.

559
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,600
You got the light bulb franchise, right?
That came through. Now...

560
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,100
You talking about $30,000 coming back.

561
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,500
I'm talking about
the $250,000 that you took.

562
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,300
Now, you need to call
Mr. Goose, Mr. Faucet...

563
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,600
whoever the fuck you gotta call because
I gave you money to run, remember that?

564
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,300
It ain't like no drug deal, String.
Hell, man, you don't put your money...

565
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,100
on the street and have it come right back.
It don't work like that.

566
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,000
- Oh, it don't, huh?
- Patience, my man.

567
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,600
Sometimes with the bureaucracy...

568
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,000
the one hand don't know
what the other is all about.

569
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,300
Yeah, well, you know what I see?
I see one hand in my pocket...

570
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,000
while the other hand seem
to have grabbed your dick.

571
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,000
Fucking Prez.

572
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,000
I don't even feel like working.

573
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,800
- Sanny, baby.
- Welcome to the Western, guys.

574
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,100
That thing with Pryzbylewski?

575
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,800
Jesus Christ. So fucking sad, man.

576
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,800
- So you humping a wagon, huh?
- Fuck, yes.

577
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,000
- How's that working out for you?
- Jimmy, I love this fucking gig.

578
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,200
The best thing Rawls ever did for me
was to knock me back to a district.

579
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,100
No stress, no struggle.
I work eight-hour shifts.

580
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,500
I take nothing home with me.
No, really, I couldn't be happier.

581
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,100
All those years knocking my head
against a wall on homicide and for what?

582
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,900
The same fucking pension
with twice the heartburn.

583
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Well, I'm glad you landed
on your feet, Mike.

584
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,600
- Hello.
<i>- You called my office?</i>

585
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,300
- Yeah, I did, several times.
<i>- Really, why?</i>

586
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,300
- Why do you think?
<i>- A sleepover. You wanna get dinner first?</i>

587
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,800
- How about tonight?
<i>- Georgia Brown's down near 15th Street.</i>

588
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,400
That'll work.
You want me to make a reservation?

589
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,000
<i>- No, I can always get a table there.</i>
- All right, whatever.

590
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,800
<i>- Let's shoot for 7.:30.</i>
- I'll see you then.

591
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,100
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

592
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,700
You in?

593
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,200
- What do you think?
- Nice colors.

594
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,300
- You got a platform?
- Schools.

595
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,600
- Thought I'd be the education mayor.
- Well, good luck, Tony.

596
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
- I mean it.
- Thanks, man.

597
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,300
- When do you announce?
- Next month, I think.

598
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,900
You know, get out there early,
start raising money.

599
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,600
In fact, I thought I'd make the rounds
of some people...

600
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,700
before then, you know? Feel them out.

601
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,900
- What, Watkins?
- Hey, he seems to like me.

602
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,200
What, you really think Odell Watkins
is gonna split from the Mayor's camp?

603
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,000
What you could do is, you know,
feel him out on an issue or two.

604
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,600
You go in that way, it's more subtle.
You know, you gotta charm the guy first.

605
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,900
Talk to him about the issues
and then down the road...

606
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,100
see if he's willing to throw
sunshine on your ass.

607
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,100
- I like that. We should do that.
- We?

608
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,000
I was thinking maybe you would ticket
your white ass up with me.

609
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,600
Make a run for council president.
Me at the top of the ticket...

610
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,400
an emerging black leader,
handsome, well-spoken.

611
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,600
You, the great white hope,
the new voice of civic reform.

612
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,000
We could give Royce a run, man.

613
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,000
And what makes you think
I'm interested in council president?

614
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,000
What the hell else you got going?
Think about it.

615
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,800
Look at them.
Like roaches when you turn the lights on.

616
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,000
- What's it look like?
- Head and torso.

617
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,800
- You got two casings over here.
- Hold the call.

618
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,200
So much for the
no-violence-in-Hampsterdam theory, huh?

619
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,200
Herc...

620
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,300
- help them move the body.
- What?

621
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,200
Just up the block, just out of the free zone.

622
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,700
Carv, you lost your fucking mind?

623
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,900
Before the ambo gets here
to pronounce him, we can do it.

624
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,200
- Why?
- Because if homicide gets here...

625
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,600
if they do any kind of canvass...

626
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,000
they're gonna get wind of this shit
on the sixth floor downtown.

627
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,600
- Good.
- Herc, come on.

628
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,300
No way, man. No way.

629
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,200
Fuck those stripes. Fuck them.

630
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,200
Hey, Toke, Gil, help me move this guy
out of Hamsterdam.

631
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,600
I'll be first officer at the scene.
It's my responsibility.

632
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,300
Don't forget the casings.

633
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,900
Make sure that you call me.

634
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,100
- I will. Thank you.
- Let me know, okay?

635
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,400
- Take care.
- All right.

636
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yes!

637
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,700
7-60 to KGA.

638
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,600
<i>Go ahead, 7-60.</i>

639
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,000
Have 700, 10-11 me on Vincent Street,
below Fayette.

640
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,100
10-4, Vincent south of Fayette.

641
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,700
Hey. You say you worked with this guy?

642
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,200
Three shots, no warnings.
He scared of black people or something?

643
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Shit.

644
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,900
- The shit's gone too far, man.
- Hey, you're telling me.

645
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,600
Yeah, I need the number
to the newspaper, <i>The Sun.</i>

646
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,400
Yeah, the number for the reporters.
The newsroom, yeah.

647
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,400
- So, you ain't gonna say nothing on it?
- What is there to say?

648
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,700
- Avon, this is blood. Family.
- I know it.

649
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,500
And I'm telling you that someone
may have done this to us, Avon.

650
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,400
- To our family.
- The cop's just saying that shit.

651
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,200
- To mess with your head.
- Exactly.

652
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Why?

653
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,600
That cop don't know me for shit.
What the hell am I to him?

654
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,600
He know you're gonna
wanna think this thing...

655
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,000
that D, you know,
he wouldn't do what he did.

656
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,300
I do think it!

657
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,300
Was it some beef he had?
Someone on the inside?

658
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,900
That cop said it was someone
who didn't want you to know...

659
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,900
and so they made it look like it did.

660
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,400
Nobody did nothing.

661
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
- But the cop said...
- He's lying.

662
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,700
He paid to lie.

663
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,700
Avon, you are my brother.

664
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,300
I need to know this more than anything.

665
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,100
D did not roll on us.

666
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,800
He came to the edge,
but he turned around and walked away.

667
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,000
And I know he was willing to do
what he had to for his family.

668
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,100
For us.

669
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
But I need to know that you know that.

670
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,600
That you saw him that way.

671
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,800
What? What you trying to say?

672
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,300
- Lf something happened...
- The fuck are you even thinking?

673
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,200
That I had something to do with it?
I could do that to my own kin?

674
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,800
Is that what you fucking think?
The fuck is in your head?

675
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,900
I ain't do nothing to D.
I ain't had shit to do with it.

676
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,600
To do with what?

677
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,900
- To do with what?
- Whatever happened.

678
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,200
Whatever it is that happened, Brianna.

679
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,700
You think I don't know my business?
Is that what you think?

680
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,400
Look I understand. I can see
the body was moved from the block.

681
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,600
I can get him to you tomorrow morning.
Just let me see if I can find him.

682
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,900
Look, I'll make good on this.

683
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Take care of this.

684
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,200
What'd he say?

685
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,700
They found a blood trail
going back up the block.

686
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,800
- So maybe...
- Smeared, with drag marks.

687
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,500
And they also found
a third casing at the other end.

688
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,800
Shit.

689
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,100
So what's the deal?

690
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,700
The deal is, we turn this into a dunker
by tomorrow morning...

691
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,300
or he starts typing a report for ISD
and the Deputy Ops.

692
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,800
- Fuck me.
- No, fuck me!

693
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,100
Look, you didn't move that body, Sergeant.

694
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:43,400
Look, you didn't move that body, Sergeant.

695
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,900
I moved the body. You understand?

696
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,100
Look, I respect that you did
what you did on behalf...

697
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,300
of what I'm trying to do down here,
but the responsibility is mine.

698
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,200
Well, so what do we do?

699
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,900
He basically said he wasn't gonna commit
any new resources...

700
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,400
though he has placed it on the agenda...

701
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,900
of the Coordinating Council
on Criminal Justice, for what that's worth.

702
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,500
Poor Clarence. He's looking tired.

703
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,400
So we're looking for help
from the State House.

704
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,200
If the city could get
a couple hundred thousand...

705
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,800
we could afford an overtime detail
to protect these folks.

706
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,400
I know this is an easier sell
with the Mayor involved, but...

707
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
- Could you convince him?
- Clarence?

708
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,000
- He barely listens anymore.
- Jesus, tell me about it.

709
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,800
I mean, I been a councilman
for three years now...

710
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,900
that's a long fucking time to be ignored.

711
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,200
I'm saying the rules got broke.
My people kept their promises...

712
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,900
they did what they said
and they were as good as their word.

713
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,100
Y'all, y'all ain't keep up your end of it.

714
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,300
Wasn't my people.

715
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,800
Look, I ain't making
those distinctions right now.

716
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,200
The fact is, somebody brought a gun
up in the free zone and used it.

717
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,400
And both those things
against the promises made.

718
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,700
Now, I can't justify this shit
if I got dead bodies up in there.

719
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,800
So, what I'm saying is this,
come tomorrow...

720
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,400
if I don't have a shooter in bracelets...

721
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,000
this whole Hamsterdam affair is over,
it's finished.

722
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,900
I'm gonna take my people
back up on the corners...

723
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
and we gonna fuck y'all every way we can.

724
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:23,100
You hear me?
Yeah, it was good while it lasted, huh?

725
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,600
You had cash on the barrel
and you ain't never need no bail money.

726
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,600
And hell, I had clean corners
everywhere I looked.

727
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,100
But all that gonna be gone tomorrow,
unless y'all bring me my shooter.

728
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,800
You think that'll work?

729
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,900
Do you?

730
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,700
That's good food.

731
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,100
- How'd you know about this place?
- It was big when Clinton was in.

732
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,900
This and the Red Sage.
Now it's all steakhouses and cigar bars.

733
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,200
So you live here, but you spend
a lot of time in Baltimore, right?

734
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,000
I have work up there.

735
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,100
And the alumni stuff
with St. Mary's on the Hill.

736
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,900
I went to UM Law,
so I still have connections there, too.

737
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,900
- Actually, I grew up in Homeland.
- Yeah?

738
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,300
Lauraville for me.

739
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,700
- Where'd you go to college?
- Loyola. Only one year.

740
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,900
My girlfriend got pregnant, <i>so...</i>

741
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,300
- So?
- <i>So...</i>

742
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,500
So you became a cop in Baltimore.

743
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,000
- How's that working for you?
- It's pretty good.

744
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,800
You know.
I do a lot of high-end drug stuff. Wiretaps.

745
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,700
Prolonged investigations
of violent offenders, that kind of stuff.

746
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,200
Fact is, there's not a lot
of guys in the department...

747
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,800
who can do that kind of thing.
You know, it takes a <i>certain...</i>

748
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,700
I don't know, you gotta love it.

749
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,900
Thrill of the chase and all that.

750
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,700
- So, you do what in politics?
- I do political campaigns.

751
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,600
- You mean like a campaign manager?
- More of a strategist really.

752
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,600
Not so much the day-to-day stuff...

753
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,500
but the strategy
of how a candidate can win.

754
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,700
A consultant of sorts.

755
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,700
- You strategizing for anyone in Baltimore?
- I shouldn't say.

756
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,900
I mean, he hasn't
officially announced anything yet.

757
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,000
He any good?

758
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,300
Hey, if you're for him,
I'll throw the guy a vote. What the hell.

759
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,900
Who'd you vote for this time?

760
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,600
What?
You mean Bush and what's-his-name?

761
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,900
Kerry.

762
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,200
You didn't vote for president?

763
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,500
I thought about it, yeah, and, you know...

764
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,600
Bush seemed way over his head, I know...

765
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,000
but he wasn't gonna win
in Maryland, anyhow.

766
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,800
Besides, these guys,
it doesn't matter who you got.

767
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,500
None of them has a clue
what's really going on.

768
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,800
I mean, where I'm working every day...

769
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,900
the only way any of these guys
is even gonna find West Baltimore is if...

770
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,700
I dunno, Air Force One
crash-lands into Monroe Street...

771
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,200
on its way back to Andrews.

772
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,100
It just never connects.

773
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,900
Not to what I see, anyway.

774
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,300
Hey, that's just me, though.

775
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,900
The man Colvin say
he want the boy locked up...

776
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,300
or the free zone shuts down tomorrow.

777
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,100
All she wrote for Hamsterdam.

778
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,800
- Colvin?
- From the Western.

779
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,600
- Sham, who is this kid, man?
- Some young boy from Tuckie's crew.

780
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,700
He connected? Kin to anybody?

781
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,000
No, he only been on
for a couple months or so.

782
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,700
What he use the whistle for?

783
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,900
Some nigga in one of Ghost Kane crews
laughed at his shoes.

784
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,300
Do it.

785
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,200
I'll be out in a minute.

786
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,700
No, he needs to put those
in the departmental mail.

787
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,100
Yeah.

788
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,700
What do you need?

789
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,900
- To turn myself in.
- For what?

790
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,100
- I shot a boy.
- Oh, yeah?
