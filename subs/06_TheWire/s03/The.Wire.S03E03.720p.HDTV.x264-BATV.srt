1
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,200
I got to hit the head.

2
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,200
I can't take this shit, Bunny.

3
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,400
Hey.

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,600
It'll pass.

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,700
They're just riding you now.
Next week it's somebody new.

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,900
They can't take away your E.O. D, Marvin.

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,900
The worst they can do
is bust you back to lieutenant.

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,700
I don't even wanna think about the worst
these motherfuckers can do.

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,800
You don't either.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,900
You're still not
connecting the dots, Marvin.

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,000
Have a look.

12
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,500
- Hoffman and Holbrook, sir.
- Very good.

13
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,900
But you had a body dropped there
last week...

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,100
and this is what the fuck
it looked like yesterday.

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,600
Bond and Preston, for the record.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Ashland and Wolfe.

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,900
Chase and Durham.

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,200
Sir, I deployed my resources
per your instructions.

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
We've beefed up foot patrols...

20
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,800
we have our plainclothes squads
on 12-hour shifts.

21
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,800
- And the corners stay full?
- They move, sir.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,800
Every day.
They're gonna sell their drugs somewhere.

23
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,000
Major Taylor, I look at your numbers,
I see the intel reports, the photos.

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
It all tells me that you lack a fucking clue.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,100
If you'll permit me.

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,500
- Is your Deputy Major present?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,200
You now command the Eastern District.

28
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,100
Major Taylor, you are relieved.

29
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,200
Take the podium.

30
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,400
Anyone else having trouble
with the writing on the wall?

31
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,400
Dismissed.

32
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,200
And I'm like,
"Nigga, if you want to sell me a new car...

33
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,000
"you better really sell it to me.

34
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,600
"'Cause otherwise,
I'm sitting back and I'm watching."

35
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,500
What you want with a new ride for?

36
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,500
Ain't like you can't get a new car
anywhere you want...

37
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,900
anytime, in this whole city.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,900
- I'm just saying.
- Saying what?

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,100
- In case.
- In case what?

40
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,600
In case I ever want to buy a new car.

41
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,700
- Damn, is that too much to ask for?
- Girl, you crazy.

42
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,700
Shit, shit, get down, get down.

43
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,700
- Yeah, they feeling it now.
- They protecting the fuck out of it, too.

44
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,800
You see what you wanted?

45
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,400
Yeah, man, but they got
the whole second floor boarded up.

46
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,900
Got a little porch around back.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
Couple of the boys out there
now smoking on them menthols.

48
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,100
So we slide up from the back?

49
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,900
- That barred up, too.
- No way through the front?

50
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,000
Not now. But come tomorrow morning...

51
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,500
they gonna scale back down
to a three-man skeleton crew, you feel me?

52
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,700
Not sure I like this.

53
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,500
Why we got to keep hitting up
the Barksdale people?

54
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,400
Ain't like this whole motherfucking city
ain't got stashes all over it.

55
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,800
True that.

56
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,200
So why?

57
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,000
Because.

58
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,600
Because?

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,100
Indeed.

60
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,300
So that's a cop-shooter?

61
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,400
Yeah, not much to him.

62
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,200
But he did that job
on the Dozerman kid last week.

63
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,000
Gave it up in a full statement.

64
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,200
Before or after
you knocked the shit out of him?

65
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,100
"Injuries were sustained
while patrol officers...

66
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,900
"were effecting pursuit
and arrest of aforementioned suspects."

67
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,500
- He was caught East Side, right?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,900
But the wagon made a stop
at the Western District...

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
for an unscheduled tune-up.

70
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,300
It's dark on that back lot.

71
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Western boys mistook him for a <i>piñata.</i>

72
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,400
So what do you think?

73
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,400
I think this is a tragic motherfucking
miscarriage of justice.

74
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,200
I think it deserves a special grand jury...

75
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,400
and if not, the President should appoint
an independent prosecutor.

76
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
No, no, no.

77
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,200
Actually, I think, Kofi Bryant
and the United fucking Nations...

78
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,900
should get involved.

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,700
- It's a murder, Bunk.
- The word from upstairs...

80
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
is that we're supposed to be
having less murders, not more.

81
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,700
This is Anne Arundel County.
Why should they care about that?

82
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,900
Why should you?

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
Hey, Bunk. Hey, how's it going?

84
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,100
Listen, Deputy wants to know, have we
recovered Dozerman's service weapon?

85
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,200
No, sir.
The kid said he sold it on the street.

86
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,200
Gave only the street name of the buyer.

87
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,300
A certain Peanut, whereabouts unknown.

88
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,500
- They want that gun back.
- Sir?

89
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,900
They don't want to have
a departmental weapon on the street.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
You know, as a principle.

91
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,500
Look, the great white deputy has spoken.

92
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,700
This case is not down
until that gun comes home.

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,500
Fine, don't get up.

94
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,300
One of the most heavily armed cities
in the gun-loving <i>world...</i>

95
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,100
Why should those ignorant
motherfuckers care...

96
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,200
about one goddamn semi-auto
more or less?

97
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,300
What'd you bring me downtown
in this shit for, man?

98
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,100
Police don't get wet.

99
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,300
Talk to me, big man.

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,300
Thought you should know,
my boy, Cheese...

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,900
he went into the box
with a couple of police.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,900
- He stood tall?
- No doubt.

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,700
Kept his mouth shut and waited them out.

104
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
The way it turned out,
they the ones that fucked up.

105
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,700
How come?

106
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,900
Police let it slip
Cheese played in on some talkies.

107
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,500
Tried to pin a hit on him.
Said they heard it all over.

108
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,100
- Who got hit?
- A dog.

109
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,100
- What kind of dog?
- Kind mistake your leg for pussy.

110
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,200
So, they had phones tapped?

111
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,900
Don't matter to me none if they did.

112
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,100
Me and the people I keep close,
we don't talk on the phone none.

113
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,400
You talk on the phone, String?

114
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,800
So we good then.

115
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,900
What we know is
they still looking hard at us.

116
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,800
You wanna know what kills more police
than bullets and liquor?

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,900
Boredom. They just can't handle that shit.

118
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,800
You keep it boring, String.

119
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,700
You keep it dead fucking boring.

120
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,400
You're serious?

121
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,000
I am.

122
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,400
What's the closest school to here?

123
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,400
Stuart Hill Elementary.

124
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,700
That's at least eight blocks.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,100
- Three sevens.
- Three sevens?

126
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,300
Five eights.

127
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,400
Bullshit, let's see it.

128
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,900
Five eights. Read them and weep.

129
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
You're cheating.

130
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,900
- I just can't catch your ass is all.
- It's just luck, Tony.

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,700
Yeah, it's just luck.

132
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,600
- You called my desk looking for me?
- Yes, I did. Come on in. Grab a chair.

133
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
But watch your wallet if you do.

134
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,600
Make it quick, Tommy.

135
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,500
The new city editor wants a 40-inch
weekender on liquor board reform.

136
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,900
- They're going to reform the liquor board?
- Yeah, with a hand grenade.

137
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,900
So what's on your mind?

138
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,300
We're off the record?

139
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,000
There's going to be no academy class
of police cadets this year.

140
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,600
Mayor's orders.

141
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,200
Homicide rate's climbing, felonies are up,
we got patrol vacancies out the ass.

142
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,500
Even more coming
at the year-end retirements.

143
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
And this is coming from His Honor?
To what end?

144
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,000
Keep some money.

145
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,500
Money's in the budget...

146
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,900
but even a six-month delay in hiring
saves a couple million.

147
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,900
You think there's some paper?
Something the Mayor signed?

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,500
No, but you call the personnel office...

149
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,300
and they'll confirm that the class
is delayed until next year.

150
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,300
You get that much, you can come back
to me for a couple of quotes.

151
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,400
- You want in on this?
- No indeed. I love my Mayor.

152
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,400
Councilman, thank you.

153
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,700
- Stirring up some shit?
- Just a little bit.

154
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,100
For the good of our fair city by the bay.

155
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,100
Three twos.

156
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Housing authority has this slated
for demolition, right?

157
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
But no money to do it yet.

158
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,300
Boss, you sure it's a good idea
not to tell anybody about this downtown?

159
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,500
Ignorance is bliss, Lieutenant.

160
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,300
Anyone ever tell you that?

161
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,800
Once, but I beat the dog-piss out of the guy
with a nightstick.

162
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,400
Anybody seen McNulty?

163
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Catch him up when he posts.

164
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,400
New target.
Kintel Williamson, goes by Prince K.

165
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,100
Has a string of corners
from Park Circle to Woodland Avenue.

166
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,800
And he's dropping bodies, too.
Three in the last four months.

167
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,500
Or so say our friends
in the Northwestern District.

168
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,500
So we're off Proposition Joe's people?

169
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,400
We're gonna ship all the mid-level arrests
downtown to C.I.D.

170
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,100
Let narcotics work up those prosecutions.
After that, we're on to new business.

171
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,100
- He don't look like much.
- He's dropping bodies.

172
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,900
And with everybody pressed
to bring the murder rate down...

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,800
that's the new mandate for this unit.

174
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,700
- Bell has bodies on him, too.
- Not lately.

175
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,100
And Prop Joe
hasn't made much noise either.

176
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,000
They're still running product.
Still got kids banging out there.

177
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,200
And now, 'cause we blew a wire
over a fucking dog...

178
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,900
we have to let them just walk on,
go about their shit...

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
like we were never anything
to take seriously in the first place?

180
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,700
I want an investigative strategy mapped up
by week's end.

181
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,500
Well, McNulty's here in spirit anyway.

182
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,200
What?

183
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,300
Right there.

184
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,800
This will work, too.

185
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,400
There's a couple occupied
in the 200-block and that one over there.

186
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,100
But otherwise...

187
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,600
we're good.

188
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,900
Good shit, right?

189
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,100
Let's go.

190
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,500
- Commissioner Burrell, please.
<i>- Who's calling, please?</i>

191
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,200
- It's Councilman Carcetti.
<i>- Hold, please.</i>

192
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Erv, I'm giving you a heads up.

193
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,000
You're gonna get a call
from a <i>Sun</i> papers reporter...

194
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,300
- about the academy class.
<i>- What the fuck, is this a joke?</i>

195
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,800
Calm the hell down, Erv.
You just "no comment" the fucker.

196
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,000
<i>You tell me my name</i>
<i>will be nowhere near this...</i>

197
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,300
<i>- and then send a reporter my way?</i>
- Exactly.

198
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,600
Then you call the Mayor yourself
and you tell him...

199
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,800
you got a reporter nosing around
about the academy class getting pushed.

200
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,800
You tell him you have no idea
how it leaked.

201
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,300
<i>I knew this shit'd come back to me.</i>

202
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,200
- Trust me, you're covered on this.
<i>- God damn it...</i>

203
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
<i>you can't hang me out there like this</i>
<i>with the Mayor.</i>

204
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,500
<i>- My ass is flapping in the breeze, for...</i>
- You want that class, Erv?

205
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,400
- You got to trust me.
<i>- Shit!</i>

206
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,600
How you even find me?

207
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,700
- Ran into Lucas.
- Don't even call his name.

208
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Nigga still owes me money.

209
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,900
He just told me how to find you, that's all.

210
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He tell you how I'm doing?

211
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah...

212
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,200
I know what you're thinking.

213
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,900
You ain't looking all that yourself.

214
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
You look just fine, girl.

215
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,300
Just trying to find your sister, that's all.

216
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,500
She ain't for you no more.

217
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,100
She ain't for none of our kind.

218
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
Gone out County way.

219
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,600
Picked herself up County clothes,
County car...

220
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,800
County nose to look down
on all us city niggers with.

221
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,200
She a teacher.

222
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,300
- Where at?
- Don't be rushing me, motherfucker.

223
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I know you looking to tip on out of here,
get your aftershave on, get yourself correct.

224
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,900
She teach speech.

225
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,200
Make it so every nigga
sound like Condoleezza.

226
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,700
Up Ida B. Wells.

227
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,700
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me, have you seen this little girl?

228
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,600
This my baby.
Can you just take that picture with you?

229
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,300
Thank you so much. God bless.

230
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,300
- Excuse me, have you seen this little girl?
- Lady, you gonna have to back up.

231
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,200
She's my little girl.
Please, she's only four years old.

232
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,600
I ain't seen your little girl.
You're gonna have to back up.

233
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,400
- Please, just take a look at her!
- I ain't seen your girl, <i>you...</i>

234
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,600
How do?

235
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,100
Let's go.

236
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,100
Where it at, man?

237
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,500
Back there.

238
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,300
So, what up, man?
You don't value my time?

239
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,900
Nigga, please.

240
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300
Hand me that screw gun
and calm the fuck down.

241
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,800
Go! Go!

242
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,200
Clear!

243
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,000
Yo, Tosha, go!

244
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,500
- Dante, go, I got your back.
- Go, Dante.

245
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,500
I got you, baby. I got you.

246
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,900
Go! Go!

247
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,900
Go, Dante, go!

248
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
Yo, y'all ready?

249
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,200
Let's bang out.

250
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Go, go, go!

251
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,700
Come on, Kimmy, get in the car.
Get in the car, man.

252
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,900
Your department leaks like a fucking sieve.

253
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
It could be someone over here at the Hall.
Someone on your staff.

254
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,200
- Someone on the Council.
- It doesn't matter now.

255
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,100
We got to spin it the best way we can...

256
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,300
which means we need you to step up
and take this one for the team, Erv.

257
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
- Me?
- Yeah.

258
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,400
Tell the newspaper that the academy class
has been delayed for some reason.

259
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,600
Lack of recruits,
problems in your personnel division.

260
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,900
Keep it in your shop.

261
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
After which, the Mayor steps in...

262
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,200
announces we'll have an academy class
in January come hell or high water.

263
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,600
Do it like that, it's a one-day story.

264
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Mr. Mayor, this was a budget question.

265
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,600
I was directed to delay that class.

266
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,800
Yeah, you took the hit then
and you're taking the hit now.

267
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,600
And I thank you for both, Commissioner.

268
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Eighty-nine?

269
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,300
And that's just the ones
with West Side addresses.

270
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,400
Man, you got to narrow that shit down.

271
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,600
Find some way
to work with all them Peanuts.

272
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,200
Motherfucker, do I look like
George Washington Carver?

273
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Shit.

274
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,300
Cocksuckers got me chasing one gun
through a city full of them.

275
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,600
- Homicide. Yeah.
<i>- Two down, Pall Mall and Pimlico.</i>

276
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,400
Pall Mall and Pimlico. Got it.

277
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,300
Two down in the street.

278
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,700
Ray Cole's up.

279
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,600
Cole is in court today and I caught
that cutting in Cherry Hill last night.

280
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Don't look at me.

281
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,300
I'm in the haystacks,
looking for Dozerman's prodigal gun.

282
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,900
You gonna make me
go back-to-back as a primary?

283
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
That's some cold shit, Bunk.

284
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,100
Agg assault with a two-by-four?
I don't think so.

285
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,100
Put that with the part twos.

286
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,400
This one, too. Assault by pointing.

287
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,800
If you don't use a handgun,
you don't get credit for waving it, right?

288
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Larceny here.
Hump wrote this up as a daytime B and E?

289
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Fuck this.

290
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
Do it clean.

291
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,500
Don't massage anything,
don't sex anything down.

292
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
We give them the fucking truth.

293
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,500
What about COMSTAT, boss?
They'll rip you.

294
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,100
There's five months to my 30, right?

295
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,600
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

296
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,100
The major no doubt has some explanation,
some excuse, if you will...

297
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,600
for a weekly felony tabulation
that's going in the opposite direction...

298
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,300
from the other eight districts.

299
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,100
I have none, sir.

300
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,300
You are content with this?

301
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
No, Deputy, I'm unhappy.

302
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I wish we were making more of an impact.
But doing what we're doing...

303
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,800
it's clear that's not the case.

304
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,400
Major Colvin, I am under the impression
crime is down in the Western.

305
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,700
Perhaps you misfigured
your felony stats this week.

306
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,300
No, sir. We were very accurate.

307
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,600
Sometimes the gods are uncooperative.

308
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
Uncooperative?

309
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,100
This is a cooperative effort,
a cooperative department.

310
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,100
Why, in the Eastern District...

311
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,400
Lieutenant Daniels exemplified
this new spirit just the other day.

312
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,000
And because of that,
we got two fresh homicides in the black...

313
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,400
and a lot less bodies on the streets
than could have been...

314
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,900
had that drug war been allowed to drag on.

315
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,100
Mayor has me taking the hit in public
for the late academy class.

316
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,600
- You're kidding me.
- Where's the fucking loyalty, I ask you?

317
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,100
But in the Western,
what do I get from a veteran commander?

318
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,900
You're just having a laugh,
aren't you, Bunny?

319
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,800
You got the real stats and projections
somewhere else.

320
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,500
Someone's just outside the door
with them, right?

321
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,800
A stripper, maybe? That would be nice.

322
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,200
She comes in, flashes a little tit
gives us a whiff of that muff...

323
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,700
and delivers my fucking stat sheets...

324
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,900
with the reduction that matches
just what we promised the Mayor.

325
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,600
That would be beautiful.
That would be crème fucking brûlée.

326
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,400
But what I got instead is some half-assed
"I wish we were doing better" platitude...

327
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,500
that's meant to fool maybe a six-year-old
girl into thinking you're doing your job.

328
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,500
Well, she's left the room, Major Colvin.

329
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,800
She's out there right now
asking the stripper...

330
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,800
if she can have her job
when she grows up...

331
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,100
because she sure as shit
doesn't want yours.

332
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,500
You know why?

333
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Because there isn't gonna be a goddamn
Western District in 20 years...

334
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,500
if this shit keeps up.

335
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,800
I don't care how many years
you have on this job.

336
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,300
If the felony rate doesn't fall,
you most certainly will.

337
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,100
The gods are fucking you,
you find a way to fuck them back.

338
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,500
It's Baltimore, gentlemen.
The gods will not save you.

339
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
I ain't on nobody's team.
I'm not playing <i>that...</i>

340
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,900
Come on. We're on the same team.

341
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,600
Give me that.

342
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,600
She look like a player?

343
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,000
Bystander?

344
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,300
Come on, let's go.

345
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,800
Right in the middle of it all if she was.

346
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,800
- Yo, my turn to be Omar.
- No. Give it to me.

347
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,100
Look, I'm telling you, I was there.

348
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,400
White folks was on the stoop
by the 909 Club...

349
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,200
and Apex just standing over his ass...

350
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,700
pumping more holes in the boy
than a motherfucker need.

351
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,700
Shit, I ain't lying. Soon as that
motherfucking nine stopped talking...

352
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,900
White folks look up at Apex, say,
"Bitch, that the best you got?"

353
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,300
Man, I'm just saying...

354
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,700
a boy got that much white blood,
he got to be a punk.

355
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,700
- You want me, boss?
- Your numbers way down, Fruit. Way down.

356
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,800
Man, it's Barksdale's people.

357
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
They clipping the dope fiends
coming up Fremont.

358
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,300
You know, when I ran a shop
and my numbers dropped...

359
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,600
I damn sure did something about it.

360
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,700
- Yeah, I hear that.
- I just want them moved.

361
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,200
Take the young 'uns with you,
give them a workout.

362
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,400
All right.

363
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,900
So, Lieutenant, you got an "attaboy"
from the Deputy today, huh?

364
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
It cost me my wiretap, though.

365
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,400
Still, it's good work over in the Eastern.

366
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Knocking down a drug war.

367
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Yeah, he's gonna do the same thing for me
up on Park Heights.

368
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,400
I got this Kintel Williamson character
who needs some fixing.

369
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,200
And Rawls promised me Daniels
and his unit for about a month or so.

370
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,000
You're getting quite the rep there, kiddo.

371
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,400
So, Stan, what's your plan
for the Southeast?

372
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
How you gonna give Rawls his numbers?

373
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,500
I don't know. Flex squads on the corners...

374
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,900
foot patrols in the Perkins Homes,
overtime out the ass.

375
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,300
And if that don't work, cheat on the stats.

376
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,400
So what say you?

377
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,000
Shit, me? I'm going to 12-hour shifts
on the weekend, man.

378
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,200
What about you, Bunny?

379
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,900
I don't know.

380
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,600
I thought I might legalize drugs.

381
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,900
So they hit the goddamn alley.
And we on them.

382
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,300
That cocksmoking motherfucker
with the big-bitch gun?

383
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,400
- We was running hard on his ass, but...
- I think I hit him.

384
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,500
- Nigga, you ain't hit nobody.
- I might've hit him.

385
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,000
Yo, String, we hit the one girl.

386
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,600
But after that, man,
I ain't seen nobody catch no lead, man.

387
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,900
- Except for Tank.
- Yeah, Tank gone.

388
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,100
The other broad dropped him.
So I guess we're even now.

389
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,800
- So you get one, right?
- Yeah.

390
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,200
That's good. That's like a 40-degree day.

391
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,300
Ain't nobody got nothing to say
about a 40-degree day.

392
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Fifty. Bring a smile to your face.

393
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,200
Sixty, shit, niggas is damn near
barbecuing on that motherfucker.

394
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,700
Go down to 20, niggas get their bitch on.

395
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,200
Get their blood complaining.

396
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,600
But 40? Nobody give a fuck about 40.

397
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,900
Nobody remember 40, and y'all niggas
is giving me way too many 40-degree days.

398
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,100
What the fuck?

399
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,200
Now, we gonna cover that bitch's funeral,
her fucking wake.

400
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,400
We're gonna be all over that motherfucker,
till the bitch hit the ground.

401
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,800
And if the faggot roll up
to pay his respects...

402
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,500
we're gonna be on that motherfucker.

403
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,200
Who the fuck you talking to, man?

404
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,600
It's Donette, String. She been calling.

405
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,300
No, put the phone down.

406
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
- Are you all feeling me on this?
- Yeah.

407
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

408
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,800
He show up,
we on him like a motherfucking...

409
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,500
Like a 40-degree day.

410
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,100
So overall, felonies are down.

411
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,300
But murders are still up.
What's our next move?

412
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,900
Let me bump overtime and court pay
for homicide and district ops.

413
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,400
Cases go into the green
before they go into the black.

414
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,600
Done.

415
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,400
And of course, if we could get some help
at the courthouse, it would go a long way.

416
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,700
Hey, if you're going to try
and dig your way out of this...

417
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,900
don't make me your shovel.

418
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,400
My department is bringing you casework
that goes nowhere.

419
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,000
The cases are thin.

420
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,100
Most wouldn't make it past a prelim
in the court of a freshman judge.

421
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,700
Well, maybe if your personnel weren't
so goddamn concerned...

422
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,900
for their goddamn conviction rate,
they'd chance a whodunit or two.

423
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
For Christ's sake...

424
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,200
Jesus, at least pretend
you're on the same side.

425
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,000
Stephen, you and I are both going to be
counting votes this time next year.

426
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,200
Do something to help our sorry asses.

427
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,200
And Erv, if you want to do more
than just finish out Walker's term...

428
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,400
show me something more
than just a pass of the buck.

429
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,700
I don't think any of us
wants to have to get a real job.

430
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
- Mr. Mayor.
- All right.

431
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,500
- I'll see you both in here on this next week.
- Thank you, sir.

432
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,600
They're like children.

433
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,600
Demper's always been a hack.

434
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,100
But he's an elected hack,
so we're stuck with him.

435
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,200
But Burrell, though.
You're vulnerable on crime, Clarence.

436
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,500
You need to set some deadwood adrift.

437
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,900
- Burrell's got friends.
- The ministers?

438
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,000
Well, he might be their man, but so are you.

439
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,700
You fire Burrell,
you get some new blood in here...

440
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,600
the crime rate drops, huh?

441
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,000
The ministers will live with it.

442
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,200
So you're tough on deadwood, huh?

443
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,600
In the new 11th district, too, I hear.

444
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,800
Mr. Mayor, it's time for Eunetta to go.

445
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,300
She's had her time. There are better people
out there for the Council.

446
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,100
She's on the team, Odell.
Just like my police commissioner.

447
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,300
I value loyalty. Don't you?

448
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,100
Bunky Bunk, where's my Bunk?

449
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,200
Cole was up, not you.

450
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,400
You're on Dozerman's gun, remember?

451
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,900
Cole was at the courthouse. Sue me.

452
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,700
Rawls and Foerster have crawled up
into my backside...

453
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,300
and they're gonna stay there
until you find Dozerman's gun.

454
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,900
Now, I would like it very much
if I could unclench my ample ass cheeks...

455
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,700
if you don't mind,
and rid myself of that discomfort.

456
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,600
Jay, I just caught one that pushed its way
all the way to the top of my stack.

457
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,900
- A victim, Jay. On the real side.
- Do tell.

458
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,700
Second body in a double.

459
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,500
Girl in her 20s, caught in the middle
of a firefight. Takes one in the dome.

460
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,800
But she's still dead
in a zip code that does not fucking matter.

461
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,800
And you still owe me
a departmental-issue nine.

462
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,500
Find the fucking gun, Bunk.

463
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,800
Fuck me.

464
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,800
Kintel Williamson, who the fuck?

465
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,600
- He has corners in Park Heights.
- But Jesus, who doesn't?

466
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,600
So all day we're calling you, Jimmy,
wondering where you're at.

467
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,600
Kima, maybe you can enlighten us.

468
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,100
Don't look at me.

469
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,800
My running buddy don't even tell me
where he's off to these days.

470
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,100
- I was at the library.
- Bullshit.

471
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,900
I was at the library at M.C.I. Jessup.

472
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,600
D'Angelo Barksdale was not a suicide.

473
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,900
- The M.E. Tell you that?
- He didn't need to.

474
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,600
The physical evidence didn't match up.

475
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,400
Look, I don't like coming up off of Stringer
or Prop Joe any more than you do.

476
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,200
But, McNulty, this shit is kind of weak.

477
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,200
Cedric is under a lot of pressure...

478
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,900
to use this unit
to get the murder rate down.

479
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,200
So for now,
Stringer Bell's jacket belongs in narcotics.

480
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,200
Man took you off a boat, Jimmy.

481
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,400
He want to peel his unit off,
his unit, Jimmy...

482
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,100
and go after the target of his choice,
baby, it's his call.

483
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Lester, I thought you were all about
the best case possible.

484
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,300
When it's there, I am.

485
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,100
Yo, I need y'all to hear this, man.

486
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,800
It was my fault.

487
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,400
You hear me?

488
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,700
I'm sorry, yo.

489
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,300
That don't do nothing for me.

490
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,400
How come...

491
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,800
they know you're police
when they hook up with you...

492
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,100
and they know you're police
when they move in...

493
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,200
and they know you're police when
they decide to start a family with you...

494
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,000
and all that shit is just fine
until one day it ain't.

495
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,400
One day it's,
"You should have a regular job...

496
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,000
"you need to be home at 5:00."

497
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,300
- "You need to call more."
- I'm saying.

498
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,500
"You need to stop fucking waitresses."

499
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,400
I wanna come down here tomorrow
to Western.

500
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,400
See what's what
since those Towers came down.

501
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,400
We're supposed to start
on Kintel tomorrow.

502
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,000
Fuck that chump.

503
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,000
- He can wait a day or two.
- Yeah, okay.

504
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,700
What the fuck.

505
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,900
When you were humping a radio car
in the Western, was this your hole?

506
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
Yeah.

507
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,200
Here and down on Winchester,
under the bridge.

508
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,200
Bet there were a lot of nights
you didn't go home to the missus.

509
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,600
- Don't tell me I'm the same kind of asshole.
- Pucker up, girlfriend.

510
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,600
Jesus!

511
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm turning into McNulty.

512
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,600
Hey. I'm getting ready to go now.

513
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,900
No, Mee-maw, you know I can't.

514
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,900
Times like these, honey, you have to shine.

515
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,800
In your face, in your clothes,
and in your pocket. Now, go on.

516
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,500
- Make sure you get something to eat, hear?
- Go on, now.

517
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,200
- You know them?
- Not a clue.

518
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,200
The crew on that corner looks familiar.

519
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,700
A couple old faces.

520
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,600
Not many.

521
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,400
You go away for a year
and the whole world changes up.

522
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,900
Quiet, though.

523
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:01,700
Barksdale loses the Towers and he's able
to stretch out without bodies falling?

524
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,900
I wonder what the Western guys
have been seeing lately.

525
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah. Hey, Jay.

526
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,900
<i>- You have a minute?</i>
- Yeah.

527
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,200
- What the fuck happened?
<i>- He just collapsed.</i>

528
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,400
When?

529
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,000
How is he?

530
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,500
Shit.

531
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,300
- You're gonna let me know, right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

532
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,200
Okay, yeah.

533
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,000
Thanks.

534
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,700
- You know Ray Cole?
- Homicide, right?

535
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,300
Collapsed in the gym at the Central District
this morning.

536
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,100
- On a fucking Stairmaster.
- Well, how is he?

537
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,400
A Stairmaster.

538
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,300
Hey, Poot, check it out.

539
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,000
- Where they at?
- I don't know.

540
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,100
Shit! Go!

541
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,900
Go! Look out, man!

542
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,500
Break it, break, motherfuckers.

543
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,700
Man said break. Come on.

544
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,500
I was working that bitch.

545
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,800
Yeah, shorty, you hard.

546
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,100
Go. We out of here.

547
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,000
"The Commissioner acknowledged
that money had been budgeted...

548
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,400
"for the academy class...

549
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,900
"but said the department
was awaiting approval...

550
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,600
"of a federal training and education grant
before scheduling the program."

551
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,400
Burrell can talk some shit, can't he?

552
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,700
Downtown in the house.

553
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,000
- Hey, Kima baby.
- Hey, Ellis.

554
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,900
Herc.

555
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,700
So, what do we owe the pleasure?

556
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,700
Cruising your district,
seeing what's up since the Towers fell.

557
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,400
We see Barksdale crews on a few corners,
but no one seems to be beefing with them.

558
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,000
What's up with all this brotherhood?

559
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,300
We keep the lid on tight. You know,
they know we're not their friends...

560
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,300
and they damn well know that
we'll take it to them if they don't behave.

561
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
What do your C.I.'s tell you?

562
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,200
Fuck C.I.'s.
We don't need no stinking C.I.'s.

563
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,800
We tune them up, we beat them down,
we lock them up.

564
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,400
It's the Western District way.

565
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,700
Sergeant, you're wanted in roll call
for a supervisor's meeting.

566
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,800
Gotta go.

567
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,800
Remember what I told you?
Police is only as good as his informants.

568
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,900
Yeah, well, we ain't downtown no more,
Kima. We're in the trenches here.

569
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,200
You want information, you go get
your own C. I. And you shoot the shit.

570
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,900
You're late, Sergeant.

571
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,100
I had a couple of downtown detectives
in my shop.

572
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,600
They were confused
and required assistance, sir.

573
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,000
Well, I'll catch you up.

574
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,700
The new strategic plan for the district
is to move all street-level trafficking...

575
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,400
to these three areas.

576
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,200
- We want to push it.
- Push it, boss?

577
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,700
If they don't go easy, then they go hard.

578
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,100
But we let these knuckleheads know...

579
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,200
that if they move to these areas,
away from the residential streets...

580
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,000
away from commercial areas,
away from schools...

581
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,600
if they take that shit down the road...

582
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,700
they can go about their business
without any interference from us.

583
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,700
It's going to be hands-off
in the Western District...

584
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,800
- for the foreseeable future.
- Bullshit, man.

585
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,900
- No fucking way.
- Wait.

586
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,100
You're saying you want us to give them
a free pass?

587
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,000
- How're we going to look them in the eye?
- Yeah.

588
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,600
They'll shit all over us,
tell their kids to shit all over us.

589
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,800
Hey, the Major wasn't finished.

590
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,400
You got to take the long view here.

591
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,100
<i>Once...</i>

592
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,900
Once they're all comfortable,
once they are all rounded up...

593
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,100
once they've been down there a bit
and they're used to putting their feet up...

594
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,100
and playing with the remote, then we move.

595
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,700
Then we go back and we do police work.

596
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Look at it this way, gentlemen.

597
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,800
Would you rather shoot at fish
in the ocean...

598
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,400
or would you rather gather them up
in a few small barrels...

599
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,800
and start emptying your clips then?

600
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,900
Not to mention, you still get to kick
the shit out of all the mopes...

601
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,300
that don't move off our corners.

602
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,700
So it ain't all bad.

603
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,000
Slow up, girl.

604
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,000
Come on, now.

605
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,700
So this your ride?

606
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,200
- It's nice.
- I suppose you got a Lex.

607
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,000
No, girl. Got a bus pass.

608
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,700
You out the game, then?

609
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,300
Doing a little landscaping right now
but trying to figure things out.

610
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,600
- So what's your boy's name?
- Allen.

611
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,200
- After lverson?
- After his daddy.

612
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,200
What?

613
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,900
I'm trying to picture you mowing a lawn.

614
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,800
Yeah, I don't be wearing this suit.

615
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,500
- You look good in it, still.
- You look good, too.

616
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,400
You know, they bought a lot a folks out
with early retirement in Parks and Rec.

617
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,600
I could maybe hook you up
with someone to talk to.

618
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,600
A man at my church is helping the city
fill a lot of those jobs.

619
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,000
That would <i>be...</i> Thank you.

620
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,200
Write your number there.

621
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,500
He'll call you.

622
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,700
I gotta go.

623
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,000
It was good seeing you.

624
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,900
Grace.

625
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,300
Looking at <i>you...</i>

626
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,900
What?

627
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,700
Hurts.

628
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,900
You shouldn't look then.

629
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,800
A food blast will take your mind off it.

630
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
I'd rather my mind on it, Bubs.

631
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,600
I swear, I'm sick of all of this, man.

632
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,900
Wondering when I got so old.

633
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,700
Some more mac and cheese, huh?

634
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,100
- Hey, Bubs.
- Kima.

635
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,600
- Hey, Bub.
- McNutty, man. My mainest man.

636
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,600
- You ready to put some work in?
- Born ready.

637
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,600
- Snitching? Fuck that, Bubs.
- Hey, no, man.

638
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,800
Better than lifting 500-pound radiators.
I'm up for these two, Johnny.

639
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,200
That's easy money, man.

640
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,800
Come on, let's grab a burger.

641
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,900
You mind if I bang out of here early?
I ain't right with this Cole thing.

642
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,400
There's gonna be a detectives' wake
at Kavanagh's tonight. You gonna come?

643
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,100
I barely knew the guy.
You all laying him out at the bar, huh?

644
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,600
Tradition. Tomorrow night,
he goes to the funeral home for family.

645
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,800
Tonight, Ray drinks with the boys.

646
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,800
Come on, Bubs. We ain't got all day.

647
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,600
He's up for re-election...

648
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,100
and he's never had a single one of his
goo-goo bills pass the committee.

649
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,300
So, he's got one for all-day kindergarten.

650
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,300
I mean who's gonna argue
with more kindergarten?

651
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,100
I mean, this guy has got a bill...

652
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,100
which is the legislative equivalent
of kissing a baby.

653
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,900
So, right, he goes to his chairman,
pleads his case and says...

654
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,900
"You know, this don't go through,
I'm torched...

655
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,700
"and I'm going to be back
in that hardware store, mixing paint."

656
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,800
So, the chairman takes pity and agrees.
He gets the bill to the floor.

657
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,900
But the house speaker, he hates this bill.
So, it gets loved to death, you know.

658
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,700
Slap on an amendment
for another $150 million in costs...

659
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,000
subsidies, handouts...

660
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,700
and the bill goes down in flames.
122 to 10.

661
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,900
The delegate,
he can smell those paint cans.

662
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,400
And the chairman says,
"Hey, sorry, brother.

663
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,700
"I fought like a tiger for that bill."

664
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,200
With friends like <i>that...</i>

665
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,000
You want friends? In this racket?
Get a dog.

666
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,500
- What?
<i>- Look, we're real busy.</i>

667
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,300
- I need to talk to him.
<i>- I gave him the message.</i>

668
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,300
- Look, just tell him it's Donette.
<i>- You're sure he knows you?</i>

669
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,500
Yeah, he know who the fuck I am.

670
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
- Yo, String, she said...
- Not now.

671
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,900
Look, he say not now. I got to go.

672
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,800
Marlo? It's a problem, String.

673
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,100
Club soda and lime.

674
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,100
You'll never get there that way.

675
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,000
Get where?

676
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,400
Excuse me.

677
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,700
How the hell was I to know the Mayor
was gonna put the screws to you?

678
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,000
You read the paper? I look like shit.

679
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,400
Hey, you got your class.

680
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,900
And probably scored points with Royce
out of sheer loyalty, right?

681
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,900
We are police.

682
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,300
So no lies between us.

683
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,600
He wasn't the greatest detective
and he wasn't the worst.

684
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,400
He put down some good cases
and he dogged a few bad ones.

685
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,900
But the motherfucker had his moments.
Yes, he fucking did.

686
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,200
You remember the Mississippi extradition?
The arson murders?

687
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,300
- Right.
- He brought that case home.

688
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,600
And the triple at the after-hours
over on Hudson Street...

689
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,000
that was Ray Cole at his best.

690
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,800
And Fayette Street in '93, the drug wars.

691
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,300
He took a lot of hot corners
and cooled them.

692
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,000
Yes, indeed.

693
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,800
He won as much as he lost.

694
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,200
Much as any of us.

695
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,800
For Christ's sake, Hugh,
play the fucking song, already.

696
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,900
Did he piss off a wife or three?

697
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,500
No fucking doubt.

698
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,600
I think the last one actually
kind of got used to him, thank God.

699
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,200
Did he say the wrong shit now and then?

700
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,600
Did he bust balls and cheat on his taxes...

701
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,400
and forget to call his mother
and fuck the wrong broad...

702
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,800
for the wrong fucking reason
every now and then?

703
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,500
Who fucking doesn't? Christ!

704
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,200
Was he as full of shit as every other
sad-sack motherfucker wearing a badge...

705
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,800
of Baltimore City Police?
Abso-fucking-lutely.

706
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,700
His shit was as weak as ours, no question.

707
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,000
But Ray Cole stood with us...

708
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,100
all of us...

709
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,400
in Baltimore...

710
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,400
working, sharing a dark corner
of the American experiment.

711
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,100
He was called.

712
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,300
He served.

713
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,800
He is counted.

714
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,600
Old King Cole.

715
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,400
Old King Cole!

716
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,800
I'm sorry, but I gotta get these guys home.

717
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,900
But all things considered,
I think they did pretty well.

718
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,300
They were great.
And you were great, really, Jen.

719
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,200
Besides, I think they got
all the family shots they need.

720
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,400
So, you'll be a while, though, huh?

721
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,000
Got to work the crowd, you know.

722
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,800
- Make them think I'm worthy of their faith.
- You are...

723
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,700
- Well, thank you.
...most of the time.

724
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,900
Bitch.

725
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,400
Not too late if you can help it, okay?

726
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,000
Jimmy.

727
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,800
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

728
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,300
Shit is fucked.

729
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,600
You fucking wake up like any other day.

730
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,600
You fucking eat and think about bills...

731
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,700
and dry-cleaning and shit...

732
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,400
and fucking vacation
and your fucking retirement plan and what?

733
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,000
Like that.

734
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,100
Like that.

735
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,900
He checked out of here...

736
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,500
with you still owing him
a clearance on that Omar thing.

737
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,800
I know, I know. I fucking know.

738
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,400
Like that.

739
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,800
On a fucking Stairmaster.

740
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,700
On a fucking Stairmaster.

741
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,900
Wake up and die right, you cunts.

742
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,700
What's going on, man?

743
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,100
That whip is pretty.
I gotta get me one of them joints one day.

744
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,000
Shit, yeah.
