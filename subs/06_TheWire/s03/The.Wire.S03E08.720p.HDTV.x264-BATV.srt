1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,700
Got that reddies, son.
Two for one, two for one.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,700
I got that Rasheed and Beno.
Rasheed and Beno.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,300
Put some ice on his nuts.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,300
Tried and true,
that shit always bring a nigga back.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,600
Where we gonna get ice from down here?

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,000
- Walk him up to Bon Secours.
- Rasheed and Beno. Rasheed and <i>Beno...</i>

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,300
- Can you give me an eight-ball?
- A eight-ball, huh?

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,500
So, how you doing today?

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,200
No offense,
but can you just get the eight-ball?

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,300
All right, all right. Just being social.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,200
Got it right here, yo.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,700
Thank you.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,500
You hear Mack Man jewelers
got took off last night?

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Got all this shit in the row house.
Down yonder.

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,500
Like a must-move situation.
Fifteen on the dollar.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,900
Y'all want some slamming ice,
go inside and tell my man Rafik sent you.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,600
Lighters, pipes, matches. Pipes, lighters.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,400
You need them, I got them.
Right here, pipes.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,700
Reddies. Two for one, two for one.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,500
Ask me if it's loaded, bitch.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Reddies, son, two for one.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,300
- Anything up?
- Just a good package.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,000
Three OD's.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,700
Last one didn't look too good
before the ambo came, neither.

25
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,900
Oh, shit.

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,500
Hey, I'm a cop.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,000
There's more inside, Carv.

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Goddamn!

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,700
Can't you ever get a fucking police
around here when you need one?

30
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,900
Okay, on that burner?

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,300
I called Trac, gave them the serial number.

32
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,900
Trac Corporation told me
that they sent it to Northland...

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
a purchasing corporation.

34
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,200
Northland tells me they sent it
to their distribution center in Hagerstown.

35
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,800
Hagerstown tells me
they sent it to Buddy's Mondo Mart...

36
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,200
at 1440 Propane Road,
Falls Church, Virginia.

37
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,700
That's where it went out into the street.

38
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
What?

39
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,200
Did Buddy have them on display
to the left or the right of the cash register?

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,100
How would I know that?

41
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,100
All right.

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,200
As for the numbers
in the phone's speed dial...

43
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,800
we got one local number.

44
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,200
One number that tracks
to Bodie's grandmother's house...

45
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,600
on West Baltimore Street...

46
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,100
and six other numbers
that are all assigned...

47
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,400
to Trac disposable cell phones.

48
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
And those phones
were all purchased outside the city.

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,900
One each in Catonsville, Laurel, Bethesda...

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,900
and stores in Virginia...

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,500
at Springfield, Dumfries and Lakeside.

52
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,700
Everything's along l-95,
from here to almost Richmond.

53
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,700
They're driving 200 miles
every couple of weeks out of sheer caution.

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,300
It's beautiful.

55
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,200
What is?

56
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,100
The discipline of it.

57
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,700
In your life, did you think...

58
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,200
you would ever again see
Mount and Fayette like this?

59
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,300
Those ain't touts you're hearing, brother.

60
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,200
Those are birds chirping.

61
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,600
- How?
- I'll show you.

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,700
You said no whistles,
no muscle, no flexing.

63
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,200
You supposed to be all over that shit, man.

64
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,900
You even said it's supposed to be
like the Valley of Eden.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,600
- To serve and protect, motherfuckers.
- Call it poetic injustice.

66
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,000
I want to file a report.

67
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,800
- Say what?
- You heard me.

68
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,800
You want to make a complaint to us
that you were selling drugs...

69
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,800
- and someone took your money?
- Fuck, yes.

70
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,100
- Here.
- Fredericksburg?

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,500
They're going all that way
to buy cell phones?

72
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,900
One here, two there.
No wholesale purchases.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,600
They've been dumping phones
every two weeks or so...

74
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,000
and still they're worried
about catching a wiretap.

75
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,000
Just 'cause you're paranoid doesn't mean
someone's not out to get you, right?

76
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Lt'd be nice to know who's buying
all those cell phones, though.

77
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
I'll drive.

78
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,400
Yo, yo, yo, yo. You up, old man?

79
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,900
They do have a point though, right?

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,200
I mean, we tell them to come down here
without the guns...

81
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,200
and then we fall down
on providing protection.

82
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,100
It's like the stickup crews
have these hoppers...

83
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,700
feeling like they live in a lamb pen.

84
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,900
They see one more gun,
Gandhi-world falls apart, this I guarantee.

85
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,900
So what are you doing about it?

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,400
I sent a few of the vics
over to the district with Herc.

87
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Let them play with an Ident-A-Kit,
but you know how that goes.

88
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Can I be honest?
It's not just the wolves circling the corral.

89
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,500
We got 50, 60 kids on the inside...

90
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,300
been fight or flight
since they popped out the chute...

91
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
and right now
they're just thumb-up-their-ass hanging.

92
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,000
All these ex-runners, ex-lookouts.

93
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,200
That shit worries me
as much as any carnivores out there.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If you want to neutralize a threat,
give it a job.

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
- As?
- Auxiliary cops.

96
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,500
Keep an eye out for the predators.

97
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,600
You got the dealers paying them
to do nothing no-how anyway.

98
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,700
- Kill two birds and all that.
- Right.

99
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,100
Throw them some bikes,
maybe police radios.

100
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,300
- We could do that.
- I was <i>being...</i> You're serious?

101
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,200
What in God's name did you do here?

102
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
WMD. Got that WMD.

103
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,600
Hey, how you doing?

104
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,400
We're looking for a guy who came in here,
ten or eleven days ago...

105
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,700
dropped cash
on a couple of disposable phones?

106
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,900
- Ten or eleven days ago?
- Yeah.

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,400
- Black, most likely.
- That really narrows it down.

108
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,400
How about we just check on
some of your security tapes?

109
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,000
From ten days ago?

110
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,800
Unless there's an incident,
we reuse those videotapes every week.

111
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,700
- Every week?
- It's Mondo Mart policy.

112
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,100
That went well.

113
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,500
- Yeah?
<i>- Briana Barksdale called for you.</i>

114
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,500
- Who?
<i>- D'Angelo Barksdale's mother.</i>

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,300
- You get her number?
<i>- You got a pen?</i>

116
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,700
<i>410-718-9433. Got it?</i>

117
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,900
All right.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
<i>- You gonna call her?</i>
- I don't know.

119
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,800
<i>- It's all yours.</i>
- Thanks, Jay.

120
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,400
Hey, check it out.

121
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,300
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart,
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart. We're fucked.

122
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,200
Until we get here.
BaBa Jani Food Mart, Dumfries, Virginia.

123
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,100
We're gonna go 100 miles on the off-chance
this guy has a memory or a camera?

124
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Do you really wanna go home early
and disappoint Lester Freamon?

125
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Who was that who rang?

126
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,400
Guess who's calling Homicide
looking for me on D'Angelo Barksdale?

127
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,200
- His mama.
- Yeah?

128
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,600
Shit, I forgot I even tried
to press that thing.

129
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,700
Now she's calling up asking questions.

130
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,700
Waste of her time as it was mine.

131
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,000
Kind of like this road trip.

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,100
He do look natural.

133
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
That motherfucker Marlo.

134
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,500
We gonna have to get deep on this nigga.

135
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,400
I mean, it feels like ain't shit changed
except for a growing lightness in my wallet.

136
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,700
Where's my letter of approval, man,
from the Preservation motherfuckers?

137
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
- My right-of-way agreement, my sign-offs?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

138
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Everything's right around the corner.

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,500
We got both the plumbing and
the electrical inspectors on for tomorrow...

140
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,500
Tuesday, the fire department's
coming out...

141
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,900
and that should do it, String,
you'll be on your way.

142
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,800
And by the way, congratulations.

143
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,000
You are now a minority contractor...

144
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,800
for the light bulb supply
to the Board of Education...

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
City of Baltimore.

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,800
What the fuck I know
about light bulbs, man?

147
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,400
Do you know how to put the words
on a B&B letterhead?

148
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,100
Come on, man, relax,
white guy's doing all the work.

149
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,600
You're just his beard
for the Empowerment grant.

150
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,600
That's an extra five Gs a month
for just laying in the cut.

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,400
See how it work?

152
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,100
I'm gonna bring you along, String,
but it ain't gonna be an overnight thing.

153
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,400
We spend this year dealing with the city...

154
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,200
the next doing business with the state.

155
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,900
However, year <i>three...</i>

156
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,900
Then we go for the gold.
Then we go federal.

157
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,400
Then we see the man
with his hand on the faucet.

158
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,300
- What faucet?
- The HUD faucet, the money faucet.

159
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,700
Look, man, I don't know why we got to wait
three years for that shit.

160
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,200
- I'm ready to run now.
- No. You're not.

161
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,600
I mean, forgive me...

162
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,300
but you still showing
a little bit of that street corner mentality.

163
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,600
Bugging about every dime you spend...

164
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,300
about the permits,
about setting up a PAC...

165
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,100
about dropping cash
into re-election war chests...

166
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,300
which, by the way, is how I get my gravy.

167
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,100
Look, it takes money
to make money, String...

168
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,700
otherwise, hell, every pauper'd be a king.

169
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,200
And I'm saying I'm ready to run now.

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,900
Three years.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,100
Crawl, walk, and then run.

172
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,900
- No, man, nappy up there a little bit more.
- Yeah, yeah.

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,100
And the <i>eyes...</i> He had little beany eyes.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,200
What the fuck is beany eyes?

175
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,600
- You know, little rat-eyes.
- Yeah, all right. Yo, put a mole on there.

176
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,400
- He didn't have a mole.
- He did, too.

177
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,600
You was just too busy shitting yourself
with that whistle to your dome...

178
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,600
- to see the motherfucker.
- Shit, fuck I did.

179
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,400
- How do you know how to do this?
- Man, how you don't know how to do this?

180
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,600
Make his ears stick up.

181
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,300
- Why?
- 'Cause I told you to.

182
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,900
Oh, shit, okay. Give him light eyes.

183
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,700
- Why?
- 'Cause I fucking told you to.

184
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay, can you make them crossed?

185
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,800
This is fucking cool.

186
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,000
Check out these knuckleheads
on the Make-A-Face.

187
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
Bring that down.

188
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,100
Yeah, hang on.

189
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,900
- My brother, I'm telling you...
- Fuck this shit.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,300
...that is not what this is all about.

191
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,200
Look, I'm just trying
to make my district livable.

192
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,300
I write off a few blocks in a few places,
but I save the rest.

193
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,900
No offense, but you're like the blind man
and the elephant.

194
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's a lot bigger
than what you got your hand on...

195
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
- you just can't see it.
- See what?

196
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,100
A great village of pain
and you're the mayor.

197
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,300
Where's your drinking water?

198
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,800
Where's your toilets,
your heat, your electricity?

199
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,900
Where's the needle truck...

200
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,300
the condom distribution,
the drug treatment intake?

201
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
Half these people are dying on their feet...

202
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
and the other half's gonna catch
what's killing them.

203
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,000
Look, they ain't no worse off
than when they was all over the map.

204
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,500
- Now they're just in one place, is all.
- And that place is hell.

205
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,600
Look, I'm a police.

206
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,400
So I can lock a man up
or I can move his ass off the corner.

207
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,600
Now, you want anything more than that,
you're in the wrong shop.

208
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,300
Hey, yo, make her hair
a little bit more straight.

209
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,000
Make it long. With bangs.

210
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

211
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,000
Now Chinese up them eyes, like Beyoncé.

212
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,600
- Get them cheekbones up a little bit.
- No, man, that's too much.

213
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,200
She's starting to look like a pie tin
with hair now, yo.

214
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,100
- Hang on.
- Yeah, all right.

215
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,400
- Pillow those lips a little bit.
- Oh, yeah, hook me up with that.

216
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,700
Yeah.

217
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,300
Yo, you got one of these does asses?

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,300
- What?
- Yeah, that's what's up. Hey.

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,400
Hey, guys.

220
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,700
How you doing?
We're looking for a cash purchase in here.

221
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,300
Maybe a couple of Trac phones.
Week or so back. Black guy most likely.

222
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh, sure, that guy.
Every two weeks for him.

223
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,200
Last time, eight phones. Almost $900.

224
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,400
That's a lot of Ring Dings, no?

225
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,100
- Ring Dings?
- A joke.

226
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
You got some kind of transaction record?

227
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Seek and you shall find.

228
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,700
Hang on.

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
Hang on.

230
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100
$927.24.

231
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,400
- Can we have the tape for that day?
- No tape. I rewind every day.

232
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,000
- Keep this?
- Sure.

233
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,700
What the fuck do we do now?
Buy this guy a box of videotape?

234
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Or camp out in this shithole for a week,
hoping our boy runs the same route?

235
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,700
I just know I got to put my mind
on something or I'm gonna slide back.

236
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,400
Need to be in control of myself,
you know what I'm saying?

237
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,800
- Take command of your life.
- Something.

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
- Cultivate some self-discipline.
- Or whatever.

239
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,000
What if I told you
that there's a certain liberation...

240
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,200
not in command or in self-control,
but in surrendering?

241
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,500
Well, that depends
on who you surrendering to.

242
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,700
Oh, that. Hey...

243
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,600
all due respect, you can stow that patter
right here and now.

244
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,900
Look, it ain't about me doing for me,
I don't think.

245
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,300
Might need to be about more than that.

246
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,800
So you're bringing in an overall decline
of 2 percent for the month...

247
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,700
but if I read this correctly,
almost half of that's coming...

248
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
from an eight-percent drop
in the Western District?

249
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,300
Major Colvin is himself willing
to acknowledge the possibility...

250
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,800
of a statistical variation from the mean
in his monthly stats.

251
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,200
Variation, huh?

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,600
Gentlemen, if I look through
the Western incident reports...

253
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,100
am I likely to find less crime,
or more incidents...

254
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
which have been downgraded
or unfounded?

255
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,900
Because this kind of variation
screams manipulation to me...

256
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and if I'm wrong about that, if indeed
there is no manipulation involved...

257
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,300
I would like to know exactly what it is
that Major Colvin...

258
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,200
has learned about police work
that eludes the rest of your commanders.

259
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,000
Councilman, I assure you,
these stats are not massaged.

260
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,500
We don't do that.

261
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,600
I don't do that.
And I won't allow my people to do that.

262
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,500
Our feeling is that
it's genuinely an aberration.

263
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,200
And if it repeats itself next month...

264
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,500
then it bears
closer examination. Otherwise...

265
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,700
Moving on to new business, then.
How are we fixed for witness assistance?

266
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,000
Does the Department have sufficient funds
to ensure pre-trial security...

267
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,000
for any endangered witnesses?

268
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,800
We have the resources
that the city can afford, I'm sure.

269
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,200
I understand you're in no position
to criticize the Mayor.

270
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,000
- Nor would I.
- Nor would you.

271
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,500
So allow me to ask the question.
What is this city willing to pay...

272
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,500
to make it possible for ordinary people
to come down to the courthouse...

273
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,300
and perform the civic duty
of bearing witness...

274
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
against gangsters and criminals?

275
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,600
What resources are commensurate
with that kind of commitment?

276
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,700
You can play the good soldier
if you want, Commissioner...

277
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,000
but I want to go on the record here...

278
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,700
in saying that this administration
has passed the buck time and again...

279
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,500
and failed to protect those citizens...

280
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,100
who demonstrate
that kind of commitment...

281
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,200
and put their lives and livelihood at risk.

282
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,600
I would only like to add
that I feel as my colleague does...

283
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,500
that this administration
has failed this community.

284
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,100
Miserably. And we need
to do something about this.

285
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,500
Hey!

286
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,100
Y'all are friends. You're like brothers.

287
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,400
You lose that, you lose every damn thing.
Go on.

288
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,100
Kids messed up a good hoop.

289
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Now they got one
looks like the original peach basket...

290
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,200
and they hanging onto it like a tit.

291
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,900
I don't know.

292
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,400
Maybe I should get up
some kind of tournament.

293
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,200
You play basketball?

294
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,000
Never was much for balls and sticks.
I was all about my hands.

295
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,600
- Boxer?
- Yeah.

296
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,800
Boxing?

297
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,200
I know a place where some of the kids go...

298
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,200
- but it ain't near close enough to here.
- I wouldn't mind taking a look at it.

299
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,200
Get a mental picture at least.

300
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,300
Hey, yo, what the hell's going on here?

301
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,900
Police pushed all the action down here
and a couple other places.

302
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,400
The deacon thinks that
maybe some people should come in here...

303
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,300
and take over the situation.

304
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,200
- Are you that people?
- One of them, maybe.

305
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,800
- Roman, man.
- Dennis.

306
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,300
You should lay back on this one.

307
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,500
Let me go talk to Buford Pusser
in there alone.

308
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,000
Excuse me?

309
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,100
And what it shows people
is that I know my business.

310
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
That I will hold people accountable
based on the facts.

311
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,200
- This is about what's right.
- There you go again.

312
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
What?

313
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,200
Do you think politics
is only about winning the argument?

314
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,400
That whoever has the right fact
at the right moment wins?

315
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Clinton had facts. Kennedy had facts.
Yeah, but Reagan?

316
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,400
He couldn't have summoned a fact
if his life depended on it.

317
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,000
It's not just facts, it's how you use them.

318
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,900
And Tommy,
when you get hold of a fact or two...

319
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,100
you go smart-ass
and start beating on people.

320
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,500
- Yeah, that's...
- Clinton and Reagan...

321
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,100
when they got up to speak...

322
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,700
they gave everyone in the room
comfort and confidence.

323
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,200
You liked those guys.

324
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,700
You were happy to think
that they even liked you.

325
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
You're saying I'm not likable?

326
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Jen?

327
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,700
When you're at home talking with me...

328
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,900
not the Council, not the cameras,
you're great.

329
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,000
When you tell me
what's really important to you, I believe.

330
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,400
You're smart, and you're ambitious,
and you've got a sharper tongue than most.

331
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,800
You can hold court
and you can tell a good story...

332
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,600
and you can win the argument if you want.

333
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,800
All of that shows, Tommy.

334
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,500
And at a Baltimore City Council meeting,
it shows well.

335
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,400
But if you want to be Mayor,
or Senator, or Governor one <i>day...</i>

336
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,200
Show them something more.

337
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,000
Baltimore, huh?

338
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,300
Went up there to the Harbor
with my wife for our anniversary.

339
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,200
- Charged us $12 for two beers.
- Shit, that's the least of it.

340
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,300
The whole damn town's
going to hell in a handbasket.

341
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,800
- And guess who's running the show?
- Who?

342
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,700
Who do you think?
The Department, City Hall, the courts.

343
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,000
Shit, the courts?
You know what they call it...

344
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,700
when judge, jury and perp
all go to the same family barbecue?

345
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,000
- Catch and release.
- No shit.

346
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,800
May God have mercy on any poor white boy
going to trial.

347
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,900
That's when everybody's got their ass
in the air talking about justice.

348
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Can't wait to throw away the key.

349
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,300
I mean, they're not all so bad.

350
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,700
Actually, there's a lot of good ones.

351
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,800
I'm on the radio if you need me.

352
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,900
My wife, Carol-Ann.

353
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,300
- Some very good ones.
- Is there anything specific...

354
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,500
I can help you with
while you're down here, Detective?

355
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,900
Or is this just a courtesy call?

356
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,700
You know, you should meet my partner.
You'd like her.

357
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,400
Can't go through the front on this boy.

358
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,300
So I'm thinking we're gonna have to
creep around the back.

359
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,100
Get Devonne on it.

360
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,700
I got this for that other problem.

361
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,400
- Who this?
- Remember Fatface Rick, right?

362
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,400
Been going to them co-op meetings
with String. That's his cousin, Trina.

363
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,600
- Oh, you mean, Trina with the big old ass.
- Yeah, you on it.

364
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,100
That's her work number.
You know where she working at nowadays?

365
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,000
She over at the Department
of Social Services.

366
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,000
So you think Omar getting a check?

367
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,600
No, not now.
But, I mean, once upon a time...

368
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,000
before some fool gave little Omar Little
a shotgun.

369
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,600
I mean, cocksucker
was somebody's child, right?

370
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,500
So I'm thinking,
somewhere down in them records...

371
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,700
is one or two names of Omar's people.
You feel me?

372
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,600
You sure you want us
on Marlo and Omar both?

373
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,500
I mean, Omar ain't come back on us
since we got his bitch.

374
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,000
- So maybe...
- Look, I'm home, Charles. I'm home.

375
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,300
What's up?
Taking care of business, String?

376
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,100
Me too, man. Me, too.

377
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,500
- East Side wasn't ready for us, huh?
- That's what I'm saying.

378
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,200
Yeah, I know all about BaBa Jani
and his 24-hour turnover.

379
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,600
It's a real pain in my ass, too.

380
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,800
He's got a real problem
with the school kids there.

381
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
Every afternoon come 3:00,
they go in there...

382
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,300
crowd him at the counter,
boost all the car and gun magazines.

383
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,900
That surveillance tape's so grainy now...

384
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,600
it's like watching a herd of buffalo
in a snowstorm.

385
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,700
But my insurance man, Bob...

386
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,100
I got him to turn this camera here
right on BaBa's parking lot.

387
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Now, anytime I have a real problem,
I just come to Bob and pull his tape.

388
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,900
I can get a copy of that for you
in the morning.

389
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,700
Your partner there.

390
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,500
Bit of an asshole.

391
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,300
- For real?
- Yeah.

392
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,100
Yeah, right hand up.

393
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,200
You know what this is? It's moral midgetry.

394
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,700
Turn the fucking world upside down...

395
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,600
and treat these brain-dead corner yo's
like princelings.

396
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,500
You see how clean the corners are?

397
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,100
In every sector,
street traffic is half what it was.

398
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,600
Fuck that. It's wrong, and it's wrong.

399
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,300
Like the other way was right
because we were doing so well.

400
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
And Colvin's answer is what?

401
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,400
Ride shotgun for hoppers?
Drown them in cash money pay?

402
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Colvin? He's always been good police.

403
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,400
Then he's got to know
what a fucking heartbreaker it is...

404
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
to wake up every morning,
suit up for this shit.

405
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
He's got to suit up too, man.

406
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,600
Somebody should dime the brass
about this shit.

407
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,400
- Or the <i>Sun</i> papers.
- Let me ask you something.

408
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,600
Anybody here ever get jammed up
and not have Colvin go to the wall for you?

409
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,400
The man is trying something.
It may be hard to stomach, but it's working.

410
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,000
After 30 years, don't you think he's earned
the right to some elbow room on this?

411
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,100
What the fuck.
This thing is on borrowed time, anyhow.

412
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
And when we do decide
to jump on Hamsterdams...

413
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,800
they're just gonna go back
to their regular corners, right?

414
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,400
If we ever jump out on it.
I don't know that we're gonna.

415
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,500
All I'm saying is let's give the guy
the same backup he's always given us.

416
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
That's all I'm saying.

417
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,700
I swear, as soon as the sun comes up,
we grab that damn tape and go.

418
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,800
This place makes me want to cry.

419
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,300
Hey, I spent half my marriage
in rooms like this.

420
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,400
- How could you do it?
- What?

421
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,800
- Go nonstop hound on your ex like that.
- It's easy.

422
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,100
Just tell her I was on the road
working an extradition.

423
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,200
Lots of extraditions.

424
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,000
Brought back something like 500 fugitives
in a three-year period, I think.

425
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,100
- That's not what I meant.
- Right.

426
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,500
So, you're back in the house, huh?

427
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,200
Ate some shit and she took me back, yeah.

428
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,200
I ain't sure I even want to be back, though.

429
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,400
Extraditions, huh?

430
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,800
- Cheryl would see right through that shit.
- No, it's easy.

431
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,900
You just keep your cell off,
make sure she can reach your partner.

432
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Partner tells her, "Kima's in court"
or whatever.

433
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,300
Partner calls you in the motel,
gives you the heads up...

434
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,100
you call her back later like,
"Hey, what's up?"

435
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,600
Ain't even got a quarter box
for the Magic Fingers.

436
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,300
Maybe you don't need
a quarter box for that.

437
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,700
- For what?
- Magic fingers.

438
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,900
You know me.

439
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,800
- You hustling?
- Educating.

440
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,600
Are you charging for it or tuition-free?

441
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,200
Tuition will come back to him tenfold
in acquired wisdom.

442
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,400
Besides, nothing in the world's
more expensive than "free."

443
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
That's all she wrote.

444
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,500
Let's double it.

445
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,500
No, man, I don't like taking money
from a churchgoing man.

446
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,800
- Triple it.
- Your break, Deacon.

447
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,400
We need to talk
some more about Hamsterdam.

448
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,400
Look, man, I never said it was pretty.

449
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,100
Pretty doesn't even come close
to the problem.

450
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,200
We need to talk.

451
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I've got a COMSTAT meeting.

452
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,600
I'll drop by later on.

453
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,200
- So we good with the permits?
- Yeah, this week, so far, so good.

454
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,600
- All right.
- Look at you.

455
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,000
- Who?
- Chunky Coates.

456
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,100
- Who's that?
- You don't know Chunky?

457
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,600
He's got the properties down the block
and over on the even side of Paca Street.

458
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,800
When I first met that fat man,
he had an office so small...

459
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,800
you had to leave the room
to change your mind.

460
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,400
Then two years ago he started running
with your man, Clay Davis.

461
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,700
Look at you now, you big sassy bitch.

462
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,200
That better?

463
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,400
Hey, Special Agent Fitzhugh,
if that is in fact your real name.

464
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,900
FBI in on this?

465
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,500
I am only loved for my toys.
Lester called and I delivered.

466
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,900
You got the tape?

467
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,400
Date of 10l10l04. 15:04 hours, 30 seconds...

468
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,800
by the register tape.

469
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,600
Mama Barksdale?

470
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,300
D'Angelo's mother.

471
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,900
She cold-called McNulty
about her son on the jailhouse hanging.

472
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,700
She's calling us on that weak shit?

473
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,400
Is this Briana? Right.

474
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,700
You called about your son.
I'm returning that message.

475
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,300
Nothing there.

476
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,400
It's so tiny. No mere mortal <i>can...</i>

477
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
You see what he just did?

478
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,600
What? He did it again.

479
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,700
Who is this man?
Where does he come from?

480
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,400
Can anybody stop him?

481
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,400
Please don't hurt us, please.
My eyes! My eyes!

482
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,200
It's so big and clear and bright.

483
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,900
I'll be at Homicide.

484
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,400
Sometimes you still scare me,
you know that?

485
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,400
In my world,
do you have any idea what I had to do...

486
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
to get where I am today?

487
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,300
And when I say I'm ready,
you best believe it.

488
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,400
Through the effective use of resources,
and increased police presence...

489
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,700
and an intensive reach-out
into the community...

490
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,300
we've been able to have
a significant impact on these areas...

491
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,500
to the effect
of a 12-percent decrease overall.

492
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,200
- Twelve percent.
- Cumulatively.

493
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,900
- Over four weeks.
- Major, I know I gave you shit...

494
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,300
when your stats took a jump
a few weeks back...

495
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
but now you're gonna shove the numbers
right up my ass?

496
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,500
It's kind of pouty of you, isn't it?

497
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,400
Twelve percent. I didn't cook them then,
I ain't cooking them now.

498
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,400
Seriously, Bunny, I already got
the City Council asking questions...

499
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,900
about the eight-percent drop
you posted last week.

500
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,400
We just want to please the Mayor,
not go to jail behind this shit.

501
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,400
You know,
sometimes the gods do listen, sir.

502
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Not in the Western, they don't.
Lieutenant Daniels?

503
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,700
- Sir?
- You want to take credit for any of this?

504
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,300
Your unit's been working in that district
a couple of weeks.

505
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,200
We're barely up on anything.

506
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,100
In fact, the crews we're looking at
are still beefing, still dropping bodies.

507
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Amazing. Crime is down
and no one wants to take any credit.

508
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,600
What is wrong with this picture?

509
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,100
You don't mind
if I have Planning and Research...

510
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,900
pull all your CC numbers.

511
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,100
Make sure there's not a decimal point
missing between the one and the two?

512
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Pull everything, Deputy.
That number will stand.

513
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,900
I called because I heard
you went and visited Donette.

514
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,300
Told her my son's death
couldn't have been no suicide.

515
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,700
- Is that right?
- I did do that.

516
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,700
D'Angelo hung himself.

517
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,100
Not with the belt
they found around his neck.

518
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,300
Not at that distance
between the doorknob and the floor.

519
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,500
So what are you saying?

520
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,500
- What am I saying?
- No.

521
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,500
Nobody would've dared.

522
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,000
- My brother, his uncle, would have...
- I agree with you.

523
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,600
Nobody would've dared.

524
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,300
<i>Unless...</i>

525
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,700
- Avon and D was family.
- Family, right.

526
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,100
This is just you talking, right?

527
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,000
- I mean, anyone else saying it?
- No, just me.

528
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,600
- No one else cares.
- Right.

529
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,400
It's just, I don't know, on the inside...

530
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,300
if somebody's going after you,
has got a beef, sees red, they use a shank.

531
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's quick and it's over.

532
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,000
D'Angelo was strangled, which is planned.

533
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,100
You need the time, you need the isolation.

534
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,100
Look, I'm just sorry I brought
this whole mess up to begin with...

535
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,100
'cause frankly, no one's gonna do shit
about it anyhow.

536
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,400
Whoever killed him
wanted to pass it off as a suicide...

537
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,400
and the cops are happy enough
to have one less murder to investigate.

538
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,300
On top of that, the Anne Arundel
State's Attorney doesn't give a fuck.

539
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,600
I'm not supposed to give a fuck, <i>so...</i>

540
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,800
I guess your son
just got squeezed between the sides.

541
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,900
Squeezed between what sides?

542
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,300
Look, two years ago...

543
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,300
we hung more wire
on your brother's crew than AT&T...

544
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
and at the end,
D'Angelo was this close to flipping...

545
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,000
giving up everybody, everything.
But you know all that, right?

546
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,000
You were the one
who went down to that detention center...

547
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,200
and talked your son out of a deal.

548
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,400
I kind of liked your son, you know?

549
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,800
All things considered,
he was a pretty decent kid.

550
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,100
And it grinds me
that no one ever spoke up for him.

551
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,700
Seems to me that nobody ever will.

552
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,700
But, mostly at this point,
I'm sorry I bothered his girl...

553
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,700
and I'm sorry she bothered you.

554
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,200
Why go to her?

555
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,600
- Why not come to me first?
- Honestly?

556
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,200
I was looking for somebody
who cared about the kid.

557
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,500
I mean, like I said, you were the one
who made him take the years, right?

558
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,600
<i>Red leader to red boys. Red two come in.</i>

559
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
<i>Cheese steak has a problem, bitch.</i>

560
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,700
Save me some fries, yo.

561
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,800
<i>You want fries?</i>
<i>I suggest you bring some cash up here.</i>

562
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,300
Can you believe this?

563
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,700
No muscle, it's all out in the open.

564
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,300
No, no, no, man. This right here, boy.

565
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,700
This too good.

566
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,700
Hey, yo, this some kind of
full-tilt setup, man...

567
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,800
to catch a master scoundrel.
Capone and whatnot.

568
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,300
Boy, they probably got police behind
every one of them row house windows.

569
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,500
Hit this? You must be tripping.

570
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,000
Home, James.

571
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,400
I'm gonna tell you, boy, you better keep
your head back in the game...

572
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,200
or you gonna land us both in the pokey.

573
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,400
- What you looking at?
- You.

574
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
Yeah?

575
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,300
I like your eyes. They're like cat eyes.

576
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,400
- Who you here with?
- Them.

577
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,200
That's it?

578
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,600
What kind of cat?

579
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,100
- What?
- What kind of cat are my eyes like?

580
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
A big cat.

581
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
- You here with them and no one else?
- I said that.

582
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,900
- You want to dance?
- Hell, no.

583
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,600
- You want a drink?
- No, I don't do that neither.

584
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,300
What do you do?

585
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,500
Gene, this spot I'm telling you about?

586
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,900
We're talking TB, HIV, syphilis...

587
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,200
herpes, lice.

588
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,400
It's like a five-acre petri dish.

589
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,000
You get in there now...

590
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,400
you can run every health program
or social program you want.

591
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,700
Hell, every kind of liberal-ass project
never got off the page it was written on.

592
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,100
<i>Jurassic Park.</i>

593
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,700
So, you're saying that this is
a sanctioned open-air drug market.

594
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,800
No, it's not officially sanctioned.
It's more like it's tolerated.

595
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,600
That's why we came to you
and the Public Health School...

596
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,100
not the City Health Department.

597
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Needle exchange, drug outreach,
condoms, HIV testing.

598
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,900
Y'all ain't never gonna reach more people
in the same spot.

599
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,200
So if the city doesn't know about it
then that makes <i>it...</i>

600
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,600
- Complicated.
- That means temporary.

601
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
You move it or you lose it, boss.

602
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,700
That was nice.

603
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,800
It worked for me.

604
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
- You free tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

605
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,600
You could come back to my crib.
Nobody's there but my grandma.

606
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,800
Get us a real bed. Take some time with it.

607
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,800
Give me your number.

608
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,000
The reason I'm saying tomorrow,
not to push...

609
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,900
but day after that
I got to go visit my aunt in Florida.

610
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,800
We hook up tomorrow...

611
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,000
I got something real nice to think about
on that long-ass bus ride.

612
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,900
After you.

613
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,500
- What was it again?
- Devonne.

614
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,200
This guy's running his route
every five days.

615
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,000
- That's a shitload of burners.
- I don't get it.

616
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
They were so careful
spreading out the purchases...

617
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,900
up and down the three states...

618
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,100
you'd think they'd also
switch up rental agencies.

619
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,400
Maybe the guy felt bad for us.

620
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,700
You got a copier, right?

621
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,800
Damn, girl, what, you lose some weight?

622
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,400
- Excuse me?
- It's just a compliment.

623
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,100
Yo, that's Mrs. Omar?

624
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,400
Yeah, his grandmoms.

625
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,800
So what, we jack her and make her talk?

626
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,300
Fool, she probably got no clue
where he lay his head.

627
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,300
No, man, we sit and we wait, right?

628
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,600
Man, wait on what?

629
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,600
Stupid motherfucker.

630
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,600
Now, see, if we go upstairs,
we'll spook him.

631
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,900
So he's coming down. All right?

632
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,200
Russell Bell.

633
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,700
I know B&B
like I know a thousand other outfits...

634
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,800
but I don't know him.
Why should I talk to him?

635
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,100
Because Russell's a good man.
And he's ready to run.

636
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,900
- Then let him run for you.
- Hang on.

637
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,800
Wait a minute, partner.

638
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,300
I don't think you know
who you're dealing with here.

639
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,900
You know who that is?

640
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Got your running shoes on? You're in.

641
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,100
That's the faucet?

642
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Shit, as far as the federal money's
concerned, he's everything.

643
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,500
The faucet, the goose.

644
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,900
- What goose?
- The one that lays them golden eggs.

645
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,700
Madison Square Garden it ain't.

646
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,100
But it could work.

647
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,400
You're gonna need a little help
with the cleanup.

648
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
I'll piece that together.

649
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,600
This my trip, man.

650
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,600
Need to go from A to B all by myself.

651
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,700
<i>... am I likely to find less crime,</i>
<i>or more incidents...</i>

652
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,900
<i>that have been downgraded</i>
<i>or unfounded?</i>

653
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,600
<i>Because this kind of variation screams</i>
<i>manipulation to me...</i>

654
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,300
Slow your words.

655
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,100
Try to lock your eyes
on whoever you talk to.

656
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Make them think they matter.

657
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,700
Use open, warm phrases.
Nothing sharp, nothing that bites.

658
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,900
- Where's the fun in that?
- Do you want this?

659
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,600
<i>What is this city willing to pay</i>
<i>to make it possible for ordinary people...</i>

660
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,700
- It's me.
<i>- Hey. How you, Cat Eyes?</i>

661
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,700
- Yeah, when you say you leaving again?
<i>- Tomorrow.</i>

662
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,300
<i>- Wanna get together tonight?</i>
- Yeah, we could hook up tonight.

663
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,900
<i>- How about coming over to my crib?</i>
- No, not your crib.

664
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,500
<i>- Where then?</i>
- Go to a motel.

665
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,500
<i>You want me to meet you? Which one?</i>

666
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,000
I don't know which one.
I'll tell you when I see you.

667
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,400
<i>- I'd like to see you soon.</i>
- All right, you know Lake Trout?

668
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,500
<i>- Carry-out? Where?</i>
- On Woodland.

669
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,900
<i>- Off Reisterstown Road?</i>
- That one.

670
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
<i>Later this afternoon?</i>

671
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,200
<i>- I'll be there. What time you want to meet?</i>
- Like 5:00.

672
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,600
And 5:00 mean 5:00. I don't truck CP Time.
5:00 and change, I'm gone.

673
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,200
<i>- I ain't gonna be late.</i>
- All right, then.

674
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,800
<i>See you then.</i>

675
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
What you think about that?

676
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,400
I don't know.

677
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,300
Might be walking into something
a little later.

678
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,100
So I'm gonna need for you to go up there
and get me a read up front.

679
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,800
- Where's my brother?
- Shut the door, man.

680
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,400
- Yo, we at war right now, sis. So he on that.
- I need to get with him.

681
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,100
Well, he ain't on the cell phone.

682
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,100
Soon as I speak to him,
I'll get him to you, all right?

683
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
I can't believe this shit.

684
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,200
<i>Look...</i>

685
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,200
Heard from this cop.
He's saying D was murdered.

686
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,600
Oh, that'd be McNulty.

687
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,200
How you know?

688
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,900
Well, Levy figured
he couldn't talk you out of the meet...

689
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,700
but I sure wish he tried.

690
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,700
- I need to get with my brother.
- Oh, come on.

691
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,100
This fucking cop.

692
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:12,000
He trying to drive a wedge up in here,
man. You can't see it?

693
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,700
Look, I can imagine
how hard it is for a mother...

694
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,900
to have to deal with some shit like that.
No doubt.

695
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,300
But the fact is these places,
they press on niggas.

696
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,400
D just figured a way
to get out of there early.

697
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,300
Ain't nothing nobody can do about that.

698
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,000
I mean, how do you protect
a man from himself?

699
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,600
Where Avon at? I'll go to him.

700
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,800
I told you.
We beefing for corners right now.

701
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,500
As soon as I speak to him,
I'll get him to you, I promise.

702
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,200
A cop shouldn't mess
with a mother's pain like that.

703
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,800
No one should.

704
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,900
Yeah, let me get four trout on white,
extra mayo on one...

705
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,500
hot sauce on two
and the other with ketchup.

706
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,300
And four orange sodas.

707
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,600
This clown-ass nigga went and got
four sandwiches and four sodas, man.

708
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,600
- You heard me?
- Cool.

709
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,500
Niggas don't roll out in a few minutes,
we onto something.

710
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,300
Drop one, get one!

711
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,600
- No, baby, this one's sentimental.
- Here, it's bleach.

712
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,100
Soak your works and you're good to go.

713
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,400
Drop one, get one.

714
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,100
Drop one, get one.

715
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,700
Get the other girls to come by.

716
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,700
Wait.

717
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,100
Just pass these out for me, okay?

718
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,200
Yo, I just rolled for peanut butter.
You got anything else?

719
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,500
- The fuck I look like to you, Chef Boyardee?
- Who?

720
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,300
Hey, when all this bullshit falls apart,
I'm gonna kick your <i>fuck...</i>

721
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,700
Go by them slow.

722
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,300
Oh, shit!

723
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,800
Oh, my God!

724
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,900
- You hit?
- No.

725
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,900
Drive, motherfucker, get out of here!

726
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,400
Now your man better be as good
as his word. Or your word.

727
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,700
If you are still in possession
of that kind of mentality...

728
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,900
then you are definitely not ready.

729
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,600
- String...
- Not now.

730
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,800
- It's Avon.
- Shut the door.

731
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,800
Let's do it.

732
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,300
I'll be in touch, partner.

733
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,500
- What is it, man?
- Avon's been hit.

734
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,800
- Where?
- In the shoulder.

735
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,700
Tater got killed. Avon still breathing, man.

736
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,700
But Briana all over me, calling me, man.
I need to tell her.

737
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,300
- No, fuck Briana.
- What?

738
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Just keep the bitch away from me,
you hear me?

739
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,800
If you put them pit bull-style stitches in me,
the next patient's gonna be you.

740
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,100
- For real.
- What, you don't like rawhide?

741
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,400
Marlo!

742
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,300
We finna get back to old times, baby.

743
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,300
Hey, Anthony. Where you at?

744
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,800
First floor, 1034 North Mount, sir.

745
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,000
Good.

746
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,200
They're expecting us to hit back wild.

747
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,800
That's what they're just waiting for,
and we're gonna sit back on it for a while.

748
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,200
- Let them sweat on it.
- Yo, we got to talk.

749
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,500
Hold on.

750
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,200
I mean, he got to come out on his corners,
that's how he make money, right?

751
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,700
We gonna see
who got the bigger war chest.

752
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,900
Avon?

753
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,300
- Straight to the mattresses, huh?
- Whatever. What you want, man?

754
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,200
- "War", man, we past this bullshit.
- Yeah, I forgot.

755
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,600
You know, I knew I forgot something.
We the Trump brothers.

756
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,500
Man, you don't give this shit up...

757
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,000
you're gonna turn everything
we built to shit.

758
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,800
No. The Chump brothers.

759
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,400
You know what the difference is
between me and you?

760
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,300
I bleed red, you bleed green.
What you been building for us?

761
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,300
You know what, I look at you these days,
you know what I see?

762
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,600
I see a man without a country.

763
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,200
Not hard enough for this, right here.
And maybe, just maybe...

764
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,300
- not smart enough for them out there.
- Not hard enough?

765
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,500
No offense,
but I don't think you ever really were.

766
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,800
- You got skills, yeah, no doubt, but...
- What?

767
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,900
What, 'cause I don't shoot up a block,
indiscriminate, I ain't hard enough?

768
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,200
Because I think before I snatch a life,
I ain't into this bullshit?

769
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,300
Snatch a life?

770
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,500
What life you snatch, huh?

771
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,000
You know, Briana went downtown, man,
saw that detective.

772
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,700
Man stoking her head saying
that D'Angelo's death was no suicide.

773
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,600
Yeah, so?

774
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,300
Man ain't wrong about that.

775
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,300
What?

776
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,200
Yeah.

777
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,600
I knew you couldn't do it...

778
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,700
and Briana wouldn't do that shit.

779
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,700
But there go a life
that had to be snatched, Avon.

780
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,100
Yo, man, I took that shit off you,
and put it on me, man...

781
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,600
because that motherfucker
was out of pocket with that shit!

782
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,800
Twenty years above his fucking head.

783
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,600
He flip, man, they got you and me
and fucking Briana!

784
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,300
No fucking way, man. Hell no!

785
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,400
Now, I know you're family.
You loved that nigga.

786
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,000
But you want to talk that
"blood is thicker than water" bullshit...

787
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,800
take that shit somewhere else, nigga!

788
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,400
That motherfucker would have taken down
the whole fucking show...

789
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,200
starting with you, killer!

790
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,200
He was fucking everything and everybody!

791
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,700
Let me up.

792
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,300
Let me up.

793
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,700
Oh, shit.
