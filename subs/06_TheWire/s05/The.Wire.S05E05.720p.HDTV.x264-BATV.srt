1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,300
Joe will be missed.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,100
Very much missed. We liked Joe.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,700
A hard man not to like.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,200
Tomorrow ain't promised to no one.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,900
Meanwhile, we go on.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,000
In business, in life,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,400
what you learn to appreciate the most
is a dependable man.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,900
One day, same as the next.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,200
Yeah, I learned a lot from watching Joe.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,300
We deal with you or your second.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
No one else.
No one else knows our names.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,400
No one else contacts us.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,900
Understand?

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,100
To contact us, use this... only.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,500
Man, I don't talk on no cellphones.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,700
Here. To call for lunch, you can talk.

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,300
To call your girl, you can talk.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,700
To call your lawyer even,
you can talk -

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,700
the law says that
is between you and the lawyer.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,100
All right?

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,100
To find out what movie is playing
down the street, you can talk.

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,300
All of that is good because
all of that tells them

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,100
there is nothing good to hear.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,900
But, for business,

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,500
we do not talk on the phone.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,800
- Never.
- Right.

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,500
I mean, Joe taught me that.

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
But what about... What is...

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
- How'd that play?
- Man overcame his grief.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Do it feel like a crown
on your head right now?

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Do it?

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,300
'Cause that's what I'm
wearin' on my head.

33
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,100
We should celebrate.

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
Yeah?

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,500
Atlantic City.

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,100
Can't play like that now.

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,000
Omar gonna make a move.
You know this.

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,800
Yo, I need to go past home.
You mind a ride?

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,300
You know I like your peoples.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,900
I gotta tell 'em
I'm not gonna be comin' round for a time.

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,100
You stepped up and made your play.

42
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,000
Now I gotta make mine.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,400
- At least four.
- Got it.

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,900
We're going back through old cases,
so we could find more than that.

45
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,900
- What else?
- And the motive now seems sexual.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,200
What do you mean sexual?

47
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,000
Is someone sodomizing homeless men?

48
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,700
I can't get that specific.

49
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,400
How can I not get specific?

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,900
Just say the killer
is acting from sexual compulsions.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,900
Anything more detailed
we need to keep in the case file.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,300
I don't know, detective.
Last time, I couldn't get it out front.

53
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,700
Let me run it by my desk and call you back.

54
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,100
All right.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,900
Anything late from cop shop?

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,900
Follow-ups on the recent murders.

57
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,100
An arrest on one, which was
the domestic cutting from Hampden.

58
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,100
No arrests in a couple of
drug-relateds from East Baltimore.

59
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,000
OK, give me a bit
for the budget line.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,700
Domestic was a Patricia Boggus,
found in her car.

61
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,100
Drug-relateds were one Joseph Stewart,
found in his dining room,

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,500
and one Nathaniel Manns,
found in an alley garage.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,100
A couple graphs on each.
Write it as a single short.

64
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,400
Also, I got word on
another homeless murder.

65
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,000
The detective on it says it's related.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,400
He says it's sexual.

67
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,300
- Sexual? They being raped?
- He wouldn't confirm that.

68
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,800
He just says that the killings
are sexual in nature.

69
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,200
Write what you got.

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,900
I'll run it by the 4:00, see if it takes.

71
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,800
This indictment is the result
of an 18-month investigation

72
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,000
by the State's Attorney's office
and the Baltimore Police Department.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
And it shines a light
on a cornerstone issue

74
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,400
for any representative government -
public trust of public servants.

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,200
Senator Davis abused that trust.

76
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,100
He traded on his power and influence

77
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,700
so that he could use local businesses
and campaign donors

78
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
as his personal ATM machine.

79
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,000
He created a network of charitable
and non-profit organizations

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,600
whose purpose was to accumulate cash
for his private use, betraying...

81
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Rhonda Pearlman? Bill Zorzi,
covering federal court for The Sun.

82
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,900
Right. How do you do?

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,300
Not to be all petulant
on your special day here,

84
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,600
but since when does
a prosecutor in this town

85
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,400
stage a perp walk
and not call the daily newspaper?

86
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,700
We called Gail Gibson.
Left a message on her voice mail.

87
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,200
Gail left for a freelance gig four months ago.

88
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Well, her voice mail still works.
Who's replacing her on city courts?

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,600
From now on,
just don't jam me up like that again.

90
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,400
...he must be held accountable
for his fraudulent actions.

91
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,900
Senator Davis has opened
our legislative body

92
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,100
to monetary persuasions.
He has done this knowingly

93
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,000
and with complete disregard
for the office that he represents.

94
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,200
- It is this kind of impropriety...
- How's it feel, Clay?

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,300
No fun on the ass end, is it?

96
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,900
You said it, Norman.

97
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,900
There's the short con and the long con.

98
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,100
You're gonna need a statement.
Nothing too joyful.

99
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Don't dance on Clay's grave until
you're sure the motherfucker's dead.

100
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,500
Clay ain't getting up from this.

101
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,100
Also, you don't want to piss off his base,
being too gleeful about it.

102
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,400
That guy still has a base?
After all the shit he's pulled?

103
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,300
I'll tell you one thing -
that fella is looking pretty damn mayoral.

104
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,700
More than Nerese, definitely.

105
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,000
With the profile he gets from this,
I'd say it's Mr. Bond's race to lose.

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,700
...and remain under common court.

107
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,700
Senator Davis will have
to account for that money.

108
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,000
- What'd you tell your girl?
- I'm away on business.

109
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,900
I won't be around for a couple weeks.

110
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
- Shouldn't be more than that.
- Better not.

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,800
...Miss Trainor say we
gonna learn a problem like that

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,100
- Every day for this year and the next.
- You mean memorize 'em?

113
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,400
Yeah. Learn it by heart.
Learn the question.

114
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,100
Learn the answer, too.

115
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,000
'Cause them questions gonna be
on the M.S.A. test next year.

116
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,700
Miss Trainor say if the scores
don't go up before the selection

117
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
all the teachers gonna get fired.

118
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Selection? What she mean?

119
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,900
When the people vote for whoever.

120
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,000
You mean an election?

121
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Nigga think you all that.

122
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,500
Now, why you gonna go and do that?

123
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,600
- Dukie about to cry.
- Fuck is wrong with you?

124
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,000
Nothin' wrong with me!
I'm gettin' stuff done.

125
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,800
You up in some house
playin' like a lil' bitch.

126
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,500
- Smack his faggoty little ass.
- Get that little jog-ass!

127
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
...Finally, we've got that 40-inch
thumbsucker on Bud Selig

128
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,100
and baseball's half-hearted response

129
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,500
to the latest recommendations on steroid use.

130
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,000
The owners think Bud is swell,
the players' union is staying mum,

131
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,200
Bonds has a home-run record and everyone's
pretending the issue will go away.

132
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,600
- And there's news in there?
- What do you like for the front?

133
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
The Clay Davis indictment, obviously.
Congressional hearings on Iraq.

134
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
Price's piece on how much Carcetti raised
for his gubernatorial run is solid.

135
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,200
The feature on John Waters
filming in Baltimore

136
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,900
could go out front if the art is good.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,600
We have him posing
with a couple of child actors.

138
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,500
Is that allowed?

139
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,000
Now, now, let's not confuse
the auteur with his art.

140
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,400
- Anything else?
- This came in late,

141
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,800
this business about another
homeless man being murdered -

142
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
- That might have some play.
- Other homeless men were murdered?

143
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
We ran a short piece a week ago

144
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,200
about possible connections in three cases.
Inside metro.

145
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
The motive's said to be sexual,

146
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,200
but the cops are being cryptic
about what exactly that means.

147
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,100
Well, we could run it inside,

148
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,400
but report it some more, see where it goes.
Right now, it's a little vague for A-1.

149
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,200
OK, then, we'll see where
we are in a couple hours.

150
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,900
I told you, Duke.

151
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,200
I fuck 'em up good.
Just say the word, man.

152
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,700
Nah, man, I can't have you
steppin' up for me any more.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,300
Yeah, well. Talk to the man.

154
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,300
He'll set you straight.

155
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Yo, Mr. Dennis.

156
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,200
I need to train with you some.

157
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,900
See that.

158
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,000
What happened?

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,200
It ain't no thing.
I'm gettin' a little tired of it, that's all.

160
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,500
A'ight, son.

161
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Get some gloves on
and let's see where you at.

162
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
It's all pretty straightforward.

163
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,900
I'm surprised your lawyers went to
the trouble of getting it postponed.

164
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Maybe 'cause we was payin' by the hour.

165
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,700
In any event,
you got a lot going for you here.

166
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,400
Car registered to a front,
guns in a secreted compartment.

167
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,300
The woman we registered it to,
she can't do no time.

168
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,100
Just a name we used.

169
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,700
Then get someone who can.
Preferably someone without priors,

170
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,400
someone you trust to stand the charge.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,600
Also came past with this here.

172
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,100
More money made clean.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
When you figure out
what to do with that, holler at me.

174
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,700
How do I do that?

175
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,100
410-915-0909.

176
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,500
Anything else?

177
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,300
Nah, take me off your clock.

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Fuckin' mope pisses me off.

179
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,400
Be generous.

180
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,100
I have a feeling this firm is
going to have quite a payday

181
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,700
from Mr. Stanfield and his people.

182
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,500
He just gave me his phone number.

183
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,200
If Marlo Stanfield is using a cellphone,
it's just a matter of time

184
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,800
before we're up to our
asses in pre-trial motions,

185
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,400
litigating a wiretap case.

186
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Joe gave him to us just in time.

187
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
What now?

188
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,200
You need to attribute that?

189
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,400
- What?
- Fifth graph, the dependent clause.

190
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
The one about a "pattern of
widespread influence-peddling

191
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,100
"over a period of years."

192
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,300
Either the indictment shows it or it doesn't.

193
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,700
Besides which, you begin three graphs
in a row with a gerund. Look.

194
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,800
How do you expect me to write
with your fucking fingers in my eyes?

195
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,400
At least let me turn my copy
in before you stomp on it.

196
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,900
Attaboy, Zorz.

197
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,100
They want more reporting on this,
but I don't see where it can go from here.

198
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
The cops are selling a sexual motive

199
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,700
but they won't explain it any more than that.

200
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,100
Who are you dealing with?

201
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Detective who has the case.

202
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,400
And he wants publicity?

203
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,000
Didn't know if you'd come back.

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
Took a lot of money with you.

205
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,100
It wasn't about the money, bro.

206
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,500
Wasn't never about that.

207
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,700
Is that him?

208
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,800
Old Monk prefer the condo life, I see.

209
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,600
Too good for a row house.

210
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,600
Movin' with muscle, too.

211
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Most likely they expectin'
you to make a move.

212
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,100
An' here I am.

213
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,400
How 'bout that?

214
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,100
Thanks for meeting me again.

215
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,500
This is Scott Templeton.
He'll be working the story with me.

216
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,500
I don't want everyone
at your newspaper knowing my name.

217
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,300
Look, you want these homeless cases
to get attention, right?

218
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,900
That's what you're trying to do.

219
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,400
Guy's a predator. People need to know.

220
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,100
Agreed. And there are things
you need to keep secret

221
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,600
so that you can solve the murders.
I get that.

222
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,600
We can't do much with this story
unless we give it enough juice.

223
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
Juice?

224
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,500
We need to tell people what this is about,
why he's doing it.

225
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
We need to make this thing
come alive on the page

226
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
or they're gonna bury the story again.

227
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,800
I told you, it's sexual.
Compulsion. Obsession, that kinda thing.

228
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,500
But what the fuck does that mean?

229
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,000
It's not like he's carving up housewives
or strangling coeds, here.

230
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,700
Your guy's killing homeless men.

231
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,900
Why exactly? What's in his head?

232
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,300
Is he raping them?
Sodomizing them?

233
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't have any semen
in any of the cases.

234
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,200
But he's doing something, right?

235
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,800
He ties a red ribbon
around their arms.

236
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
A red ribbon?

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,900
Yeah, a bow.

238
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,900
He gift-wraps the motherfuckers.
That enough juice for you?

239
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,100
Yeah, kinky but no one kills people
to tie ribbons around their arms.

240
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,500
Can we say they were molested?

241
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,600
Is it fair to say that?

242
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,300
- We'll go with molested, then.
- You didn't get that from me.

243
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,800
- Another round?
- What else?

244
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,500
You want this story to fly,
give us something different.

245
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,000
Keep what you need,
but give us something with a twist.

246
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,400
A sexual serial killer isn't enough?

247
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
It's a cold world, I know.

248
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,900
He's started biting them.

249
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,500
What?

250
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
He's biting his victims.

251
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,300
Inside thigh,
right ass cheek, left nipple.

252
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
He's a biter.

253
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,200
- Shit.
- Yeah.

254
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,700
That twisted enough for ya?

255
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,000
Are we talkin' cannibalism here?

256
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Just biting for now.

257
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
We'll see where it goes.

258
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,500
And did he bite all of them?

259
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,900
Not all. Just the latest ones.
He's maturing.

260
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,400
- Maturing?
- Yeah, it's a technical term.

261
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,900
It's when a serial killer's
becoming more obsessive.

262
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,800
He starts to develop an intricate pattern
in what he does with the bodies.

263
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,000
It's weird stuff.

264
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,900
- A biter. That's great.
- My name is nowhere on this.

265
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,700
For your tab.

266
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,700
We'd stay and have one,
but we can still make the second edition.

267
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,800
Thanks.

268
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,200
So you thinkin' if you learn to fight some,

269
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,900
people 'round the way gonna leave you be.

270
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,100
Thing is, even if you learn to fight,

271
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,900
people gonna come at you just the same.

272
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,200
It ain't like the movies
where you beat up one bully

273
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,900
and the rest just back the hell up.

274
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,300
Let me ask, why you think
they even bothering

275
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,300
to come at you the way they do?
I mean, why you?

276
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,900
See, all I know is that right there.

277
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,900
I ain't never had no use for other things.

278
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,900
I could fight.

279
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,400
For a time there,
I could run them corners.

280
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,700
Not much life outside that, really.

281
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,900
- I was on the corner for a while.
- How that go?

282
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,500
Yeah, well...

283
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,000
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is...

284
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,400
not everything comes down to
how you carry it in the street.

285
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,700
I mean, it do come down to that
if you gonna be in the street.

286
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
But that ain't the only way to be.

287
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,000
Round here it is.

288
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,800
Yeah.

289
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,000
Round here it is.

290
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,700
World is bigger than that,

291
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,200
at least, that's what they tell me.

292
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,400
Like... how do you get from here
to the rest of the world?

293
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,200
I wish I knew.

294
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
Michael grew up fast.

295
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,600
Yeah, he did.

296
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Anyway, for a kid like that,
my onliest plan might be fine, you know?

297
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,100
Might could work for
a boy like that.

298
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,600
But a kid come to me with other skills,

299
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,400
other way of being,

300
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,500
all I got is hope and wishes.

301
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,500
That's something, I guess.

302
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,400
Wish it was more, son.

303
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,200
I do.

304
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,100
Thanks.

305
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,800
Attagirl.

306
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,100
Alma, you've got the investigation.
Anything from headquarters, that's you.

307
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,600
I thought I'd work back on the victims.
A profile of who these guys were.

308
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,800
That's a nice idea,
but I already sent Fletcher out on that.

309
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,000
- What's left for me to do?
- You can talk to the homeless.

310
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,100
React quotes from the homeless?

311
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,500
Just 'cause they're in the streets
doesn't mean that they lack opinions.

312
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,200
Where am I gonna find homeless people?

313
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,200
Not at home, I imagine.

314
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Go, go, my children.

315
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,200
Read it and weep.

316
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,500
I already did.

317
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
So did the major.

318
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,100
So did the colonel.

319
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
So did our newly christened deputy ops.

320
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,400
- Deputy's over at city hall right now.
- That was quick.

321
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Just 'cause some fuckin' reporter
bought your weak shit

322
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,800
does not mean everyone else buys it.

323
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,200
Five gets you ten,
deputy's over there right now,

324
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,600
talking them back down to earth.

325
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,900
Is this nut raping them?

326
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,500
I haven't debriefed the investigators in detail,

327
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,800
but the reports don't indicate
penetration or ejaculation.

328
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,700
What can we say we're doing already?

329
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,500
We've got good people working it.

330
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,200
It would be better if I could keep them on it.

331
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,300
You're talking overtime.

332
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,100
If you could lift the cap
for this investigation...

333
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,000
Done. Unlimited overtime
for two detectives.

334
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Anything they need.

335
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,600
Sir, a case like this, proactively
trying to prevent additional murders,

336
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,500
requires more than two detectives.

337
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,400
Deputy, the school board chairman

338
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,800
is a short hair away from
laying off 50 middle-school teachers

339
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,100
and shutting down special education
in every elementary school

340
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,800
in violation of a federal consent decree.

341
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,300
If I've got more than an extra couple of dollars,
you aren't getting it.

342
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,400
Embracing the hard choice.
It's one of the burdens of command.

343
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,900
Is there anything you can do
to further protect the homeless?

344
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,600
We can have patrol units
spread the warning,

345
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,900
try to convince anyone
to move into the city shelters after dark.

346
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,500
Can't you have police sit on locations
where the homeless gather?

347
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,100
And still answer the calls?

348
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,000
Not without doubling up post units,
which means overtime.

349
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,400
Overtime, again.

350
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,500
Blood in our veins, Mr. Mayor.

351
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,400
Every day you look more like a boss.

352
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,800
- Fuck you.
- I didn't mean it like a bad thing.

353
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,900
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, I did.

354
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,600
- What's that?
- A gift from your one true partner.

355
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,100
- Cellphone number, Marlo Stanfield.
- How the fuck...

356
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,000
Don't ask, don't tell.
Like those guys sucking dick in the army.

357
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,900
Whatever else I ever did to piss you off,
remember I also did this.

358
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,900
And, Carv?
When you put the bracelets on that bitch,

359
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,700
remind him again of my fuckin' camera.

360
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
You can tell all of 'em -
Royce, the caucus,

361
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,900
all them graspin' bitches who
we put in every city department -

362
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,800
you tell every last one
that I do not fall alone.

363
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,800
You think I'm gonna be the scapegoat
for the whole damn machine? Shit.

364
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Clarence is going to stand with you.
He told me so. He'll be out there.

365
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,300
Easy for him.
He ain't runnin' for nothin' no more.

366
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,700
I don't see you
and your kind with me on this.

367
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,300
A whole mess o' people
think they belong on the fence.

368
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,600
- Clay, it is what it is.
- Y'all better hope not.

369
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,500
Or it ain't gonna end with Clay Davis.

370
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,700
Just think about what you're saying here.

371
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,300
You can have yourself a pity party,

372
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,600
talk all kinda shit to some prosecutor.

373
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,700
You know where you'll be then?
Out in the damn cold.

374
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,500
No connections, no allies,

375
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,700
nowhere to hang your hat
in this damn town.

376
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Or you carry this for all of us,
carry it as far as you can.

377
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,000
And if the worst happens,
if they take your seat,

378
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,400
if you go away for a year or so

379
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,300
to some minimum-security
summer camp, then so what?

380
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,100
You come home to a town
that still knows your name.

381
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,300
Look at Burrell.

382
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,900
He goes quietly
and now he's making 12 a year more

383
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,900
than when he was commissioner,
and working half the hours.

384
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,800
You think that happens
if he does the piss-and-moan?

385
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,200
Prosecutors come and prosecutors go.

386
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,900
But win or lose, you're still gonna be
back around before we know it.

387
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,600
Am I right, Senator Davis?

388
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You want me to find another carry-out?

389
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,600
- Someplace closer?
- You don't like this food?

390
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,700
I don't like the way them Chinky
motherfuckers be acting sometimes.

391
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,600
The way they be lookin' at me.

392
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Don't worry about it.

393
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,900
Chris with you?

394
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,700
Behind me.

395
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,800
- What you got on?
- What?

396
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,400
You want that faggot to know
we waitin' on his ass?

397
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
Just bein' careful is all.

398
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,100
If I can see the vest,
you don't think that he could see the vest?

399
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,500
I'm the one that's baitin' him.
I'm the only one not hidin' out.

400
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,900
Ain't no thing.

401
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,100
'Cause when Omar come at you,
he gon' be gunnin' at your head.

402
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,800
I know I would be.

403
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,100
Stayed outside of Monk's all night.
They left before morning though.

404
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,900
They'll be back. No doubt.

405
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,000
Do you hear a lot of concern
regarding these murders?

406
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,800
- I haven't heard anybody mention it.
- No?

407
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,300
Most of the folks we serve
aren't actually homeless.

408
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,800
Most are working poor.

409
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,500
So most of the people
I interviewed here weren't...

410
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,300
Homeless? No. Some, maybe.

411
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
- Why didn't you...
- You seemed to be doing OK.

412
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,300
- I didn't want to ruin it for you.
- Where would you suggest I go?

413
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
Streets maybe.

414
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,300
The reporter the Sun paper sent over,

415
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,800
not exactly Bob Woodward.

416
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Hell of a job, Bubs.

417
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,500
But we need help tomorrow
waiting tables in the back room.

418
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,200
If you don't like it,
then I won't ask again.

419
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,700
Gotta hold it with both hands, you know?

420
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,000
Tryin' to hit what
you aimin' at, a'ight?

421
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,500
It's not like they do in the movies.

422
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,300
A'ight, so come on, spread your legs.

423
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,500
What's the first thing you gotta do?

424
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,400
Jack a round in the chamber. Like this, watch.

425
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
Go ahead.

426
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,400
It's hard to do.

427
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,600
A'ight.

428
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,600
So then...

429
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,000
try this.

430
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,500
It's a tool, just like a monkey wrench,
that's all it is, a'ight?

431
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,500
- I didn't know it was gon' be so loud.
- Why you want to do this?

432
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,900
What is you thinkin', Duke?

433
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,100
You think if you start carryin'
ain't nobody gonna try you?

434
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,300
Nah. Somebody's always gonna try you.

435
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,900
An' if you carryin' they gonna
make you come out with it.

436
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,400
An' once you come out with it,
you gotta be ready to go all the way.

437
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,700
You can't bring it out
unless you willin' to use it.

438
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,400
Can't be no doubt.

439
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,600
Man, can't shoot, can't fight.
Can't even stand on the damn corner.

440
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,200
You got other skills, man.
You smart like that.

441
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,400
I don't know, Bunk.
You can't believe everything you read.

442
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,700
Well, my little shit-stirrer.

443
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,100
As per your request
for additional manpower and man hours,

444
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,500
unlimited overtime has been approved

445
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,400
for the investigation into
the killings of homeless men

446
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,100
for you and one other detective only.

447
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,500
What about surveillance teams?

448
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,200
We need to be watching places,
watching the smokehounds.

449
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,800
Two detectives only.

450
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,200
You and stalwart detective Greggs here
are what has been authorized.

451
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,700
- Nothing beyond that.
- What the fuck, Jay?

452
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
I'm working a serial killer here.

453
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,800
- Hence the overtime.
- But two detectives?

454
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
What the fuck's wrong with this city?

455
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,500
We need hours for a dozen men.

456
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,800
We need surveillance vehicles, cameras.

457
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,800
What do you want from me?

458
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,400
Ain't you still working that triple
from two weeks ago?

459
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,200
I got stuff I could run down on that,
but Jay put me on this here.

460
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,200
Come here.

461
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,300
Do you even see how fucking wrong you are?
Do you even see it?

462
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,900
They're gonna pay for this case.

463
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
- This is just the beginning.
- What case?

464
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,900
You just took a real detective off a real case.

465
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,000
I'll fix that.
But eventually these motherfuckers

466
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,700
are gonna pay for us to do Marlo Stanfield.
Just watch and learn.

467
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,200
You've lost your fucking mind, Jimmy.
Look at you.

468
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,400
Half-lit every third night,
dead drunk every second.

469
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,800
Nut deep in random pussy.
What little time you are sober and limp-dicked,

470
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,000
you're working murders that don't exist.

471
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,400
Take the O.T. and work your triple.

472
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,000
Don't worry about your reports, I'll cover you.

473
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,300
- What the fuck is going on?
- Work your triple.

474
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,600
I'll cover every hour of it from my case file.

475
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,300
Excuse me, sir.

476
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,500
I'm with the Baltimore Sun.
Can I talk with you?

477
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,200
You make an appointment?

478
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,700
Sorry. I'm booked up all afternoon.

479
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,800
I'm doing a story on the homeless men
who've been killed.

480
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,100
You heard about that?

481
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,400
You got two dollars on you, right?

482
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,700
I was wondering if
the murders had changed things

483
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,900
for you and the other fellas out here.

484
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
You wanna know about them murders?

485
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,900
- That's why I'm here.
- Wanna know who's doing it?

486
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,300
- Do you know who's doing it?
- I do.

487
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,300
- Can you handle hearing it?
- What's your name?

488
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,700
Nathan Levi Boston.

489
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,200
And you know who the killer is?

490
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,800
Do you believe Satan walks the earth
in a fleshly form?

491
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,200
That Satan can occupy the souls of men?

492
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,600
And he's just getting started.

493
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,600
There's gonna be a lot more dead
before it's over.

494
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,200
Hundreds. Maybe thousands.

495
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,300
They still got you working outta this shithole?
I don't believe it.

496
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,400
It ain't much but it's been months
since a boss has been able to find me.

497
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,000
You still have some interest
in Marlo Stanfield, right?

498
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,900
That's his cell.

499
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
He stopped using cellphones.

500
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,800
Ellis, how?

501
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,500
Police work, detective.

502
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,100
- Yo, this the High Hat?
- Say what?

503
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,400
Y'all still open for carryout?
I want some of that pepper steak.

504
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
Wrong number, fool.

505
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,900
I wish I could tell you it's a shock

506
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,800
but it seems to happen in every city

507
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,600
where we get us a place
inside the power structure

508
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,800
- And we become targets.
- I know you're right.

509
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,100
It's not a black-white thing.
The State's Attorney, Mr. Bond, he's black.

510
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,500
But if it serves his purpose -

511
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,400
gets his name in the news,
ups his profile -

512
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,100
he'll do whatever the folks
pulling the strings want.

513
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,300
Whether it be character assassination,

514
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,500
tie the noose in the rope, whatever.

515
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,500
But they picked the wrong man this time.

516
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,500
- They must not heard about you, Senator.
- I don't run from a fight.

517
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,300
- I know that.
- The people know.

518
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
I'm talkin' 'bout the people now...

519
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,800
The people know what I've done
for West Baltimore and this city.

520
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,200
They know the battles I fight every day.

521
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,900
They know these charges
ain't nothing but B.S.

522
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,700
Hold it now, it's radio.

523
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,500
I gotta hold my tongue, I know.

524
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,200
I don't want nobody pullin' y'all's license,

525
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
so I can't say it like I feel it.

526
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,000
But I wanted to come here
on your show tonight -

527
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,100
and thank you so much
for the opportunity, my brother -

528
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,300
but I wanted your listeners to be
the first to hear it from my mouth.

529
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,700
I have committed no crime,

530
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,100
and I am gonna keep on doing
the people's work without breaking stride.

531
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,600
Thank you for that, Senator.

532
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,600
And also I want everybody to know
there's going to be a gathering

533
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,300
at the Mitchell courthouse
tomorrow at 2:00

534
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,500
so that people can be heard on this.

535
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,000
- I hope they come out in good numbers.
- 2:00 on Calvert Street.

536
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,900
- It's time to lift every voice.
- I heard that.

537
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,300
Three detectives for a 24-hour wiretap.

538
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,800
Four more in two-man surveillance teams.

539
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
A pair of unmarked cars.

540
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,200
I'm not asking the world here, Cedric.

541
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,600
Lester, if I had it, you'd have it.

542
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,300
That's the cell number of the motherfucker
who put 22 bodies on us.

543
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,700
- Go to the fucking mayor!
- I've been to the mayor.

544
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,200
I've been to him on my knees twice.
Once for your case, remember?

545
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,600
And all I could bring back was
two men to work Clay Davis.

546
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,600
And yesterday, for the serial killer
that homicide was working, two men only.

547
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,700
I've done my job.
I've gone up the ladder every time.

548
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,300
But if a fucking serial killer
can't bring back more than a couple detectives,

549
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,300
what the hell does it matter
that you have a fresh phone number?

550
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,600
More manpower's been assigned,
according to the P.I.O.

551
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,800
And?

552
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,700
I led with the first victim. Ex-marine.
Bronze-star in Vietnam.

553
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,800
His family begged him to come home,
which he would do now and then,

554
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,900
but they hadn't seen him
in a month before the murder.

555
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,600
Good shit. Real good shit.

556
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,500
Late, but you got
the goods, right?

557
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,300
Half of these guys are whack jobs,

558
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,800
the other half just want
to borrow a fin...

559
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,500
But yeah, I got good stuff.

560
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,300
Got a family of four under
the Hanover Street Bridge.

561
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,000
Father broke down and cried
when I talked to him,

562
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,000
talking about how he couldn't protect himself,
couldn't protect his kids.

563
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
Mother just kept stroking
the youngest one's blonde hair.

564
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,700
- We got names on this, right?
- Yeah.

565
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,600
Guy's name is...

566
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,000
Boston. Nathan Levi Boston.

567
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,300
OK, you got 30 inches,
if you need them.

568
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,800
You're going off the front
in a package with Alma and Fletch.

569
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Olesker wrote a pretty damn good
column, too, for metro front.

570
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,300
Go, go. Write, write.

571
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,300
This serial killer is making one Baltimorean
very, very happy.

572
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,100
Clay Davis.

573
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,400
One news cycle, and his indictment's
gonna be off the front page.

574
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,200
Well, if it bleeds, it leads.

575
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,000
A fucking serial killer.

576
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,900
I give them a sex-crazed madman
who's enough of a freak show

577
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,000
to get the whole city hot and bothered
and what comes back?

578
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,100
One fucking detective.

579
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,200
And who is it? Kima Greggs,
who should be working her triple.

580
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,800
So now I can't give you her hours
without fucking up honest casework.

581
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,600
Well, now it's easier, Jimmy.
We don't need as much.

582
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,800
Now we need a wiretap.

583
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,400
I can monitor that myself.

584
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,700
Shit, anything we get up
is gonna be illegal anyway.

585
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
So we don't want anyone getting near it.

586
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,200
Sydnor, maybe. I can trust him.

587
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,900
You start pulling
information off that phone,

588
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,600
you're gonna need at least a couple
of surveillance cars in the street.

589
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,100
We'll worry when we get there.

590
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,400
The important thing is that
he's making it easy for us.

591
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,900
Before, with all that face-to-face,
we were gonna need what?

592
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,900
Remote cameras, microphones,

593
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,800
half-a-dozen guys
working surveillance 24 hours.

594
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,100
But now he's talking on a phone,
and I got him.

595
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,700
So how do we squeeze a wiretap
out of my serial killer?

596
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,300
He's gotta call someone.

597
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Who?

598
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,800
The mayor.

599
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,100
Cardinal Keeler.

600
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,600
Cal fucking Ripken.
Who gives a fuck?

601
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,200
A bullshit number on
the paperwork to the courthouse,

602
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,700
Marlo's cell number on the tap itself.

603
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,200
This is fucking genius...

604
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,200
Or not.

605
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,200
If that's about your case,
you need to answer it.

606
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Remember you're working
a serial killer.

607
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,400
Nah, it's my ex-wife.
Been calling all night.

608
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,300
Like I got time for her fucking bullshit.

609
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,700
They got to believe it's your killer calling
before they'll pay for a wiretap.

610
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,400
Well, fine. Fuck it.

611
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,100
Call your buddy Oscar,
tell him we need another body.

612
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,500
The sick motherfucker
is gonna call Mr. Ripken

613
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,200
with something only
the killer could know.

614
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,600
That should shake 'em up enough
for a couple of wiretaps.

615
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,500
Monk sure do like to retire early.

616
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,400
Three go in and one come out.

617
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,900
Better odds.

618
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
We're gonna wait on it though.
They'll get better still.

619
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,900
If not tonight, then the next.

620
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
You're a patient man.

621
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,100
Him too.

622
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I tried to reach you on your cell all day.

623
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,200
- I called Beadie, she had no idea...
- I know. It's my fault.

624
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,700
- They still up?
- Yes.

625
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,100
Hey, guys.

626
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,700
Hey, dad.

627
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,300
Listen, Sean, I did everything I could
to get to your play tonight.

628
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,200
Hey, Mike.

629
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,900
It's cool. No worries.

630
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,200
Your mom said you were great.

631
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,100
Why don't you do it now? Let me hear it.

632
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,500
I don't know. It's lame like that.
You gotta see the whole play.

633
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,500
What band is that?

634
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
Dead Meadow.

635
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,000
- Dead metal?
- Meadow. Dead Meadow.

636
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,800
What the hell's wrong
with the Ramones?

637
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'll make it up next weekend.
Take 'em to the ball game.

638
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,800
Hey, this is life, Jimmy.
This is the stuff that actually matters.

639
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,500
- I know.
- I talked to Beadie.

640
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,100
She knows she's losing you.
Like I knew.

641
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,300
I'm not judging.

642
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,100
I'm not saying this to hurt you.

643
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,500
But she knows.

644
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,000
And she's ready for it,
the way that I was ready for it.

645
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,600
You're drinking.
You're out all night.

646
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,400
She doesn't know where you are.

647
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,800
And she's no fool, Jimmy.

648
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,100
I'm sad that it wasn't with me...

649
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,500
but I'm glad for you.

650
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,600
I know, you can imagine that?

651
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,100
I was glad that you found her.

652
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
I was glad for her, even.

653
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,100
For a while there, you were
happier than I've ever seen you.

654
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,800
She's great.

655
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,100
She is.

656
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,600
Don't do this.

657
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,000
You all right, Bubs?

658
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm good. Except for somethin'
that's been on my mind.

659
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,800
- But I see you into somethin'...
- I can take a minute.

660
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,300
Need to find somethin' out.
But I don't know if I really wanna know.

661
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,500
It's best to know, Bubs. I'm living proof.

662
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,700
They got drugs an' shit now.

663
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,500
Why's it on your mind now?

664
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,300
Been volunteering down Viva House,
doin' like you told me.

665
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,300
Man say he want me to serve food.

666
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,300
You can. It don't travel like that.

667
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,600
I know they say so, but I feel...

668
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,600
I don't know.

669
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,500
I went down to the clinic yesterday,
got as far as the door, but...

670
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,900
- Tough to go alone.
- Yeah.

671
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,900
Gimme 10 minutes.

672
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,800
So, where do we take it today?

673
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,000
Unless the story develops,
I think we've covered the bases.

674
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,900
Alma can check on things
and see where we're at by afternoon.

675
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,500
You owe me a Govans story.

676
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,500
And you need to get with Shane
on with that school series.

677
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,900
I don't know, Gus.
I think this thing has legs.

678
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,400
Maybe I go out with the cops.
Watch 'em warn the homeless.

679
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,100
Good thought, but Alma
can work that into whatever she has.

680
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,700
Yeah?

681
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,100
Busy?

682
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,400
No, just...

683
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
Jimmy's not in yet.

684
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,900
I know. He's sleeping one off.

685
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,400
- Late night, huh?
- They're all like that now.

686
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,400
Relax, I'm not looking for a snitch.

687
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,900
I know you're his partner in crime.
I don't care.

688
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,100
Whoa, Beadie.

689
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,600
I just want to know from you
where this is going.

690
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,500
I mean, you know him.
You know what he can and can't do.

691
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,200
Don't know if I can speak on that.

692
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,000
Look, I'm ready to put him out, OK?
For me, for my kids...

693
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,300
I mean, if in the end,
if this is all there is to him.

694
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,400
If he can't be better than this,
I just want to know.

695
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,800
He's working this case right now.
Serial killer, actually.

696
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,300
Don't tell me this is about a case.
Try that shit on some civilian.

697
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,700
Look, he'll get his head in a certain place,
he'll take a drink.

698
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,800
I mean, a lot of us will.

699
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,000
- It's more than a drink he's taking.
- Beadie, I can't tell you what to do.

700
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
I don't like giving up.

701
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,300
OK, I gotta go back to work.
Thanks for letting me vent.

702
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,300
You want to get started today?

703
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,900
- Sooner we decide on...
- After lunch, yeah.

704
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,700
Finally found a line, huh?

705
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,400
Know that wasn't easy.
They been hidin' for years.

706
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,000
- I'm a pro.
- Me, too.

707
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,600
Let me ask you...

708
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,500
When do the results come back?

709
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,700
About an hour from this test.

710
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,700
There you go.

711
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,200
And they want you to believe
that there's only one side to this story,

712
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,600
and that their so-called facts
cannot be denied.

713
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,400
But we have some facts
of our own, don't we?

714
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,600
Yeah!

715
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,900
We know who our leaders are.

716
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,000
And we don't want them picking
our leaders for us, do we?

717
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,300
No!

718
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,400
And we will not stand idly by
as they single out our leaders

719
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,800
and selectively prosecute -

720
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,900
or should I say persecute them -

721
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,600
just because they have the courage
and the fortitude to stand up for us.

722
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,500
Let them hear you.

723
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,200
Let them hear you loud and clear.

724
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,200
Clay Davis isn't going anywhere, is he?

725
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,500
No!

726
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,700
We need him,
we're going to keep him,

727
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,900
and damn anyone who says otherwise.

728
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,500
Clay Davis!

729
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,300
What the fuck is this
I hear about you might not stand tall on this?

730
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,200
You got that wrong, old friend.
I'm gonna carry this.

731
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,500
You damn sure better.

732
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,900
Because if you don't

733
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,300
you won't squeeze another greenback
out of this town

734
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,600
for the rest of your natural life.

735
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,000
We shall not be -
we shall not be moved

736
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,900
Lookie here.

737
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,300
- The fuck is that?
- Change of pace.

738
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,200
They look kinda hot
with their clothes on.

739
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,900
Hey, Clarice.

740
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,400
Your serial killer
called the Baltimore Sun.

741
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,400
Some goof claiming to be your guy
called a reporter.

742
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,000
- Someone's writing this shit up.
- Must be a crank call.

743
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,400
Probably so.

744
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,500
But seeing as it's the fucking newspaper

745
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,500
you go over there
and you set them straight.

746
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,300
Go ahead.

747
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,400
Negative.

748
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,400
- Negative means...
- I know what it means.

749
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,500
Must be wrong.

750
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,800
It ain't wrong.

751
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,400
All the shit I done.

752
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,900
All the works I shared.

753
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,200
My best boy years back?
I fired off the same hypo as him.

754
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,200
He had the bug for sure.

755
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,400
That shit ain't right nohow, man.

756
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,200
You're disappointed.

757
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,300
Shit, this ain't about the bug, is it?

758
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,200
This is you, tryin' to make
the past be everything, mean everything.

759
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,600
You don't even wanna think
about the here and now.

760
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,200
Sorry, Bubs.

761
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,800
Shame ain't worth
as much as you think.

762
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,400
Let it go.

763
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,400
He said he wanted people to know
there'd be 12 bodies before he's finished.

764
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,500
He said, quote, "I came to take 12."

765
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,600
I said, "What happens after 12?"

766
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,900
He said, quote,
"I go somewhere else," unquote.

767
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,300
I asked him about the bite marks.
He said that they wanted him to bite.

768
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,600
He complained that the article
made him sound like a pervert.

769
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,200
I asked him if he was angry at the men.

770
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,500
He hung up.

771
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,900
He called you on your cellphone?
Why didn't he call the paper?

772
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,200
I was all over the city yesterday
handing my cards out to homeless men.

773
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,800
He probably got the number from a card.

774
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,700
Shit, I might've handed him a card.

775
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,000
I think this is the guy.
I mean, a chill ran down my back.

776
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,700
There's no way to know.
I mean, if it's some other nut,

777
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,800
we're gonna look like fools if we print this.

778
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,100
Your cellphone caught the number?
He dialed you.

779
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,300
Yeah, I dialed it back.

780
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,200
Payphone on South Hanover
near West Street.

781
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,500
- What did he sound like?
- What do you mean?

782
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,100
You talk to people for a living.

783
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
Did he sound black, white?
Younger, older?

784
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,800
High-pitched voice or low?

785
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,300
He sounded, to me, like a white guy.

786
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,900
Not a deep voice,
but calm, almost monotone.

787
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:10,000
He sounded older, I would say, 40s.
Not a real young guy.

788
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,700
- Can I have your notebook?
- You can't have his notes.

789
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,400
As this isn't a confidential source,
we won't invoke the Maryland Shield law,

790
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,500
but he'll type up a copy for you.

791
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,300
But the actual document is
property of the Baltimore Sun.

792
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,100
So type it up, like now.

793
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,500
So, you're saying
this could be the killer?

794
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,100
Can we talk off-the-record?

795
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,000
The homicide unit
received a phone call this morning

796
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,400
from a payphone
from the same neighborhood,

797
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:41,100
and based on Scott's voice description,
and the use of the number 12,

798
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,400
let's just say we need to find
whoever made both those calls.

799
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,000
He made another call?

800
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,700
Detective, as a newsman, I'm inclined
to include these details in our coverage

801
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,400
if there's a credible chance
the killer was in contact with our reporter.

802
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,000
Would doing so affect on your investigation?

803
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,700
Actually, these calls are
our best means of finding this guy.

804
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,000
Every call he makes, every word
he says, to you and to us,

805
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,900
can only provide information.

806
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,800
- If we do run a story...
- You can't say he's contacting police.

807
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,500
You can't print that
under any circumstances.

808
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,600
OK, then how do we characterize
what the police think

809
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,900
- About this call to Scott?
- You can say we're...

810
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,400
taking it seriously.

811
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,700
Going forward, is it possible
that you would grant a one-party consent

812
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,600
for us to monitor your reporter's cellphone
and office phones?

813
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,600
- Absolutely not.
- I'm sorry, detective,

814
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,000
but our ability to report is dependent upon

815
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,600
our maintaining the confidentiality
of our conversations.

816
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,600
We're perfectly willing to share
the information this individual has

817
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,000
as he's definitely not a confidential source.

818
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,500
But we're not going to consent
to the Baltimore Police Department

819
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,300
monitoring our phones.

820
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,200
- You'll tap the payphone?
- Don't print that either.

821
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,300
Don't print anything
about where the killer calls from.

822
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,700
He'll change up.

823
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,800
Well, I'll type up my notes quick.

824
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,100
- Big story for you guys, huh?
- 10 minutes ago I'd've said

825
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,100
this whole thing was bullshit.

826
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,000
Shows what I know, I guess.

827
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,400
...which is why I'm gonna fight this thing.

828
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,200
I am innocent and I have done
nothing except serve the people.

829
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,000
Oh, I believe you, Senator.

830
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,800
I've seen the good work
you've done for the community...

831
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,100
That's Eddie Cantor, right?

832
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,900
No.

833
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,500
It's perfect.

834
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,000
- McNulty, it's perfect.
- I couldn't believe it.

835
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,800
I'm sitting there,
all this bullshit coming at me,

836
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,000
thinking, Christ, this is a waste of time.

837
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,100
Then I realized - this is the wiretap.
Right here. They're giving it to me.

838
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,000
Never mind me making a crank call.

839
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,700
This here is Lester Freamon's
motherfucking wire.

840
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,200
What if they check this?

841
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,300
How many guys in this unit
have ever hooked up a wiretap?

842
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,300
They don't know
which wire goes where.

843
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,600
Explain it to me again,

844
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,000
because I think I'm a smart guy,
but this shit makes my head hurt.

845
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,700
They think they're up on
your killer's cellphone,

846
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,200
but they'll never catch a call
because this goes nowhere.

847
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,500
And meanwhile,
using the same court authorization,

848
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,400
I'm on the live wire down at the detail office,
listening to Marlo.

849
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,600
Every day, you file office and court reports

850
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,900
saying there's been no further
contact with the serial killer.

851
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,100
I file exactly nothing,
but use what I hear

852
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,200
to rig the case on our real target.
And when it goes to court...

853
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,800
No mention of a wiretap.
It's all based on a CI

854
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,200
- There it is.
- Four copies signed by the judge.

855
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,400
Emergency order for
telephonic intercept of a cellphone,

856
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,900
number 410-915-0909.

857
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,700
- If the machine is rigged, you're good to go.
- You're up.

858
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,100
- Good hunting.
- Howie, you got midnight shift.

859
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,400
Worden'll be in to relieve you at 6.

860
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,200
After Worden, my squad will pick up
monitoring on the dayshift.

861
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,700
Excuse me.

862
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,400
Don't look so pissy.
We're actually paying overtime for this.

863
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,100
O-dog!

864
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,700
My leg!

865
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,000
Stay the fuck down!

866
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,500
What the...

867
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,100
Damn.

868
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,300
What the...
