1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,600
You know how that go, right?

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,200
Gave myself all these
little rules about what I wouldn't do.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,400
Like, I told myself I'd do
a lot of shit to get high,

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,900
but I swore I wouldn't never trick.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
So, after I'm trickin'...

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
I thought, "This ain't so bad.
I'll do this for a while

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,100
"except I'll make some more rules
for myself, like...

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,800
"I'm gonna use condoms,
and I'm never gonna go

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,000
"with more than one guy
at the same time," and...

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,800
Well, let's just say there are
certain things I told myself

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
I wouldn't never do.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You know what my disease
did to my rules, right?

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,500
Yeah. Whatever it is you tell yourself
you won't do to get high,

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,400
you're pretty much
making a list of everything you will do

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
as soon as your inner addict tells you to.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,300
I mean, that bitch wants to kill me.

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,700
She does.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,900
Even on my way here today,
she was telling me not to come.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,600
She was tellin' me that I was all right
on the street, that it was all good.

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,300
I'm about done.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,900
I want to thank you all
for letting me share.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,300
Amen.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,400
Thanks for sharing, Dee-Dee.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,800
Always lift us.

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,900
We got finished a little early.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,300
Anybody else feel like sharing?

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,900
How about you, Bubs?
Haven't heard from you in a while.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,100
Get up there!

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,000
Come on, Bubs.

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
All right, Bubbles.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,400
Hi...

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,300
- You know who I am.
- Hey, Bubs.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,300
- Bubs. Bubbles.
- What's up, Bubbles?

34
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,500
- I'm a grateful addict.
- Hi, Bubbles.

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,800
Been clean 15 months Thursday.

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800
This is the longest I been off.

37
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,800
I...

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Hey, yo! Let's go!

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,700
I used to get so high, you know.
I used to love to be high.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,300
Y'all see me out there
on Monroe and Fayette

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,200
doin' the dope-fiend lean, right?

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Be like this here.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,200
I come out of it,
get a little more upright.

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,400
Realize people treatin' me
like a lamppost,

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
hangin' fliers on me an' shit.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,400
Come winter, little kids hangin'
Christmas balls on me like a damn tree.

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,800
Summertime, they'd walk me over
to the garden, where the 9-till-9 used to be.

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Make me a scarecrow.

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,100
Yeah. I used to love to get high.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Got to the point...

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,500
You know, I'm not in the right place
to talk about this right now.

52
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,400
Keep comin' back, Bubs.

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,200
Thanks, Bubs. Thanks for sharing.

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,500
Is there anybody else
with a burning desire to share?

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Marvin?

56
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,700
It's quiet up in here.

57
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,300
You got the Bank of America accounts?

58
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,500
That pile there.

59
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,500
So, he claims to be raising
money for some basketball program

60
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,800
or day-care center.

61
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,900
And the money comes in,
and the money goes out.

62
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,200
But no hoops, no day care.

63
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,600
OK, so say we get Clay Davis,
and say he flips...

64
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
- Well, then he takes us up the ladder.
- To who?

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If Clay is stealing from his own nonprofits...

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,100
That's an easy case for us to make
with all the paperwork we got here.

67
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,900
That's a straight-up theft,
maybe a tax charge or two,

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,800
but there's money
that all this paperwork only hints at,

69
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,000
money that doesn't show up
on a campaign finance report.

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,600
My guess is that Clay Davis
knows about that too.

71
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,500
I don't know, man.
I like street work more.

72
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,400
You'd rather sit in a surveillance van
days on end

73
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,600
waiting to catch Tater
handing Pee Wee a vial?

74
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,400
This, Detective, is what you're telling me?

75
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,900
A case like this here,
where you show who gets paid

76
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,600
behind all the tragedy and the fraud,

77
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,400
where you show how the money routes itself,

78
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
how we're all, all of us vested,
all of us complicit?

79
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,000
Career case, huh?

80
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,400
Baby, I could die happy.

81
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,300
Still, man, I wonder
what Marlo is up to right fucking now.

82
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Celebrating.

83
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,200
Yeah, but they still taking pictures?

84
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,100
No. I ain't feel nothing in a while.

85
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,200
We took care that thing
over the Eastside. They ain't on me.

86
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,400
Snoop, she been rolling around all week.

87
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,000
Nothing, no cars, no vans, no helicopters.

88
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,600
Monk, he checked after the re-up,
no problem.

89
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,300
- We wore 'em down.
- Well, what about cameras?

90
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,700
Nothing since the camera
we took out the wall back at the place.

91
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,400
My overnight man, he been watchin',
he ain't seen nothing either.

92
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,200
'Sides, I think we good
as long as we movin' around like this.

93
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,900
Back to bidness, I say.

94
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,200
She ain't had no work in a few months.
She somewhat eager.

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,800
Goddamn right.

96
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,700
Too much fuckin' talkin'
around here lately, man.

97
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,100
Niggers need to shut the fuck up. For real.

98
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
A'ight, first thing.

99
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,600
We go hard at Webster Franklin's crew.

100
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Gave 'em the chance to get on our tit,
he passed.

101
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,700
Now we bang on his corners
a couple of times till he fold.

102
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,200
Now you talkin'.

103
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,500
Yeah. Next, we step to June Bug
for talkin' that shit.

104
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,300
He was a dead man when he opened his
mouth. He just walkin' around not knowing it.

105
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
An' I want that dicksucker.

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Took my money and the whole world know?

107
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Nah. He got to fall.

108
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,300
Omar rolled out in retirement and shit.

109
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,900
- I'm hearin' somewheres south.
- Bring his ass back out of retirement.

110
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,200
- A'ight.
- Yeah, a'ight.

111
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,300
We can step that shit up,

112
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,400
but he's goin' to be comin' at us
like we comin' at him.

113
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,700
I mean, Joe and them,
they said let that be.

114
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,700
The crown ain't worth much

115
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,300
if the nigger wearin' it always gettin'
his shit took,

116
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,100
and Joe oughta know that.

117
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,800
Let him come. Yeah.

118
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,000
What up with that thing down at Jessup?

119
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
You on the list.

120
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,500
Go on down there any time you want.
No problem.

121
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,700
That's the dude right there.

122
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,000
Ya hear?

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,500
Time for y'all to earn your pay, niggers.

124
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,100
Hey, Walon.

125
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,700
I'm like, "What the fuck?
What the hell do I look like?"

126
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Funny how you started out.

127
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,500
- What you mean?
- Dope-fiend lean and all.

128
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,800
Why didn't you keep going?

129
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,200
You know, you hear a lot of
funny shit in these rooms,

130
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,000
people makin' fun of their mistakes,
makin' people laugh,

131
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,000
but in between all the jokes,
there's a lot of truth to be spoke.

132
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,900
Like that girl today.
She damn near bled out, didn't she?

133
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

134
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,100
For a second there,
I thought you might actually stand up

135
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,400
and talk about Sherrod.

136
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,900
"A searching and fearless moral inventory."
That's the step.

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,700
Don't tell me about that.
I live with that every fuckin' day, man.

138
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,500
You got to let it out to let it go.

139
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,900
I'm your sponsor, and I'm telling you,
you got to get out of your head,

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,700
- Outside yourself.
- I ain't never missed a meeting.

141
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,300
I'm not talking about the meetings.

142
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,700
I'm talking about where you go
after the meetings.

143
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,100
I'm talking about what you do,
what you think, what you feel.

144
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,500
I don't feel nothing.

145
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
That was never your problem.

146
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,100
Not even as a low-bottom dope fiend,
that was never the problem.

147
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,500
It would be a fuckin' shame
to make it the problem now.

148
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,200
So Carcetti threw us a bone, huh?

149
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Took the cap off
secondary employment.

150
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,300
Yeah. Even I may have to go out
and find honest work.

151
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,900
There's no money to be
made in this policing shit.

152
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,200
They made that clear enough.

153
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,900
What are you qualified to do?

154
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,500
Aside from that, I mean.

155
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,800
You know I got an in
on the eight-to-four gig over

156
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,700
at Friedman's Jewelry,
you know, off of Reisterstown.

157
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,300
Yeah, 20 an hour.

158
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,800
Stand around with some
shiny shit and get paid.

159
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,700
Work murders and starve.

160
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,300
Fuck kind of shit is that?

161
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,600
Anything from overnight or this morning?

162
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,800
Yeah, midnight shift caught one.

163
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,300
- Solved?
- Open.

164
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,200
Bar cutting from Curtis Bay.
Fahlteich's over at the morgue now.

165
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Slow night.

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, I'm sure things will be picking up

167
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,300
now we're no longer
sitting on Marlo Stanfield.

168
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,900
It wasn't my call to suspend
the investigation, Jimmy.

169
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,800
That decision came from your shop.

170
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,400
Yeah, but nobody from the SA's office
objected, did they?

171
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,000
Just like nobody objected
when Chris and Snoop

172
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,300
got their gun charges postponed
a couple of times.

173
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,300
A postponement or two is
pro forma on Calvert Street. You know that.

174
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,600
Pro forma, from the Latin,

175
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,900
meaning lawyers jacking each other off.

176
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,400
Rules are the rules, Jimmy.

177
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
There are no fucking rules.

178
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,700
Fucking game's rigged.

179
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,300
Gentlemen.

180
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,200
Why the fuck chew on Ronnie's arm, huh?
She ain't the problem.

181
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Tired of being jerked around.

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think I'm gonna get me a secondary job

183
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,400
at that high-end cigar shop
on Baltimore Street.

184
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,500
As what? The Indian out front?

185
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,900
I'd like to scalp your ass, motherfucker.

186
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
Got it.

187
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,000
Who's up?

188
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,300
There you go, givin' a fuck
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

189
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,900
He's a pissy little bitch today.

190
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
I'm worried for the boy.

191
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Some good news for a change,
the test scores for third-graders

192
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,700
going up a good 15 points.

193
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
That's what I get for 54 million?

194
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,400
Hey, you can run on that.
15 points is a nice, solid number.

195
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,100
Whatever bump in the test scores I get,
I got to run on it.

196
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,500
I sure as hell can't
campaign on the crime rate.

197
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,200
Burrell already told us
we don't have a double-digit decline.

198
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,700
A small drop, most likely.

199
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,700
Until we take back the statehouse,
this city will starve.

200
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,400
I get to Annapolis,
and whoever I leave behind as mayor -

201
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,700
Bond, Campbell, or who knows -

202
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,500
they're gonna have a better time of it.

203
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,500
It's not gonna be Nerese
if she keeps goin' like she has.

204
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Sun papers made her look bad.

205
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,900
Yeah. She tells me this real estate flip
was a holdover from the last administration.

206
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,200
True as far as it goes,
but she got herself paid as well.

207
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,400
She looked bad enough
that it'll cost you votes,

208
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,100
people who don't want
to make you governor

209
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,600
if that means Nerese finishes your term
as mayor. She makes you vulnerable.

210
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,200
What, can I ask,
makes the governor vulnerable?

211
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,100
He looked like a petulant little bitch
with that diatribe on Olesker.

212
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,600
He looked paranoid too.

213
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,400
What about his failure on slots?

214
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,200
With a Democratic assembly, everyone
expects a GOP governor will take his lumps.

215
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,600
Besides, voters are split on legalizing slots.

216
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,800
It has to hit him directly.

217
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,700
Well, I'll see what's on the mind
of the PG County boys tonight.

218
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,600
I got dinner with Steny, Miller and Maloney
down in Upper Marlboro,

219
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,200
- Which reminds me...
- You're late to meet Jen.

220
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Doesn't this seem a little thin to you,

221
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,800
running for governor
two years into a four-year term?

222
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,900
Everything's thin.

223
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,500
The whole world shines shit
and calls it gold.

224
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,600
So Somerville, he keeps going back to
ask Tommy the elder follow-ups, right?

225
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,400
One question after another
his editor wants him to ask him.

226
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,400
Somerville, knocking on big Tommy's door,
blaming the city desk,

227
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,900
saying, "I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Mayor,
but my desk wants to know."

228
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,800
- Shit, I see it coming.
- So, three or four times, right?

229
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,400
"My desk is wondering...
I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Mayor,

230
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,900
"but my desk wants to know."

231
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,400
So finally, finally,
Tommy D'Alesandro,

232
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,200
he puts his ear down to his desk like this,
and he says...

233
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,800
"My desk tells your desk
to go fuck itself."

234
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,800
- That really happen?
- Too good a story to check out.

235
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,600
Hey. What's my favorite GA reporter
have today for his favorite editor?

236
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,700
Heartbreaker from Eastside.

237
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Salt-of-the-earth single mother of four
dies from allergic reaction to blue crabs.

238
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,100
Ate them all her life but goes face down
in a lump backfin platter,

239
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,100
pronounced an hour later at Hopkins,

240
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,700
and the sister is starting a scholarship fund
for the kids.

241
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,800
Interviewed the whole family.
Photos, the works.

242
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Attaboy.

243
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,500
Round it off with some medical stuff
on seafood toxicity, huh?

244
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,900
- Growing incidence, all that good shit.
- All right, cool.

245
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,200
You ever notice how mother of four
is always catching hell?

246
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,100
Murder, hit-and-run,
burned up in row-house fire,

247
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,500
swindled by bigamists.

248
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,800
Tough gig, mother of four.

249
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,100
Innocent bystander is worse.
He's always getting the short end.

250
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,600
Not a lot of them around any more.

251
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,700
Not a lot of innocence either, you ask me.

252
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,700
You know who there's less of?
Statuesque blondes.

253
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,200
You don't read about statuesque blondes
in the newspapers any more.

254
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,900
Buxom ones, neither.

255
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,500
They're like a lost race.

256
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,500
What do you got next?

257
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,800
School project meeting.

258
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
Mr. Whiting builds his Pulitzer.

259
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,000
OK. Now I've seen everything.

260
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,400
Why not call a cab, at least?

261
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,300
If I thought these motherfuckers
would reimburse me, I would have.

262
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
So Homicide can't shop cars neither.

263
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,300
We're down to two working units.

264
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,300
One was at the morgue with Fahlteich,
the other was on a fresh call.

265
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,100
Jesus. What a joke.

266
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,900
67-year-old female, mother of four,
grandmother to many,

267
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
lived alone.

268
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,400
Not seen in two days,
so the neighbor called.

269
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,500
- No forced entry.
- You the first officer?

270
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,400
Had to kick in the back door.

271
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,100
- You call for crime lab?
- We're on the list.

272
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,600
Today's list?

273
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,400
Fucking crime lab too, huh?
They've cut everything to the bone.

274
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,000
Been here maybe a couple of days.

275
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
If it was warmer, she'd have bloated.

276
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Yeah, it's probably natural.

277
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,900
I just didn't like the way she looked
laying there with the pillow and all.

278
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,700
Yeah, I bet she died in her sleep.

279
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,600
You ever wake up
with a pillow over your face?

280
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,800
There's mornings with a hangover
I hold the pillow over my face,

281
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,100
just to keep the light out
and the pain down.

282
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,800
Me, I just throw up once or twice
and go to work.

283
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,900
The Western District way.

284
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,000
The word I'm thinking about is Dickensian.

285
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,600
We want to depict the Dickensian
lives of city children

286
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,400
and then show clearly and concisely

287
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
where the school system has failed them.

288
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,600
Not to defend the school system,
but a lot of things have failed those kids.

289
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,200
They're marginalized long before
they walk into class.

290
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,100
You want to look at
who these kids really are,

291
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
the parenting,
or lack of it, in the city.

292
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,000
The drug culture, the economics
of these neighborhoods.

293
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,400
Yet the schools are something
that we can address.

294
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,300
Sure, we can beat up on city schools.

295
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,800
Lord knows they deserve to be beat on
every once in a while,

296
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,100
but then we're just as irrelevant
to these kids as the schools are.

297
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,800
I mean, it's like you're up
on a corner of a roof

298
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,300
and you're showing some people
how a couple of shingles came loose,

299
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,900
and meanwhile, a hurricane wrecked
the rest of the damn house.

300
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,200
You don't need a lot of context
to examine what goes on in one classroom.

301
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Really? I think you need a lot of context
to seriously examine anything.

302
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,800
No. I think Scott is on the right track.

303
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,800
We need to limit the scope,
not get bogged down in details.

304
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,800
To do what? To address
the problem or to win a prize?

305
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,100
I mean, what are we doing here?

306
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,600
Look, Gus, I know the problems.

307
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,300
My wife volunteers in a city school,

308
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,000
but what I want to look at is the tangible,

309
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,100
where the problem and solution
can be measured clearly.

310
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,900
There's more impediments to learning
than a lack of materials

311
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,600
- Or a dysfunctional bureaucracy.
- But who's going to read that?

312
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,300
What is this series about in a sentence?

313
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,800
What's the budget line?

314
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,100
Johnny can't write
'cause Johnny doesn't have a fucking pencil.

315
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,700
Augustus, I'm not as simple-minded
as you might think.

316
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,600
Now what do you want,
an educational project or a litany of excuses?

317
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,900
I don't want some amorphous series
detailing society's ills.

318
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,800
If you leave everything in,
soon you've got nothing.

319
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
I think the schools are ripe for exploration,

320
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,900
and I think Scott might be the man
to lead the charge.

321
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,200
You ain't doin' nothin'
but aggravatin' me now.

322
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,400
Get up in this house
before I beat the black off your ass.

323
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,000
Get up in here, fool. Come on.

324
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,400
Treena.

325
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,100
Treena. Wait for me.
I'm-a come back out.

326
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,000
Stay right here. Don't move.

327
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,400
Come on, girl.

328
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,000
Wooton, you dump in the numbers
from the port story yet?

329
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,400
Shit. I forgot. You want...

330
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,000
- Give them to me. I'll put them in.
- Overall, cargo is down by 12 points,

331
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,600
but roll-on, roll-off gained 6.4% last year.

332
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,800
A'ight. Drop 12, ro-ro's up 6.4. Thanks, got it.

333
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,900
Boss man on your six.

334
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,800
- Whiting?
- Worse. Klebanow.

335
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,400
Augustus.

336
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,400
Who's the lead for opening day tomorrow?
Not the game story but the color piece.

337
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Luxenberg wanted to go with McGuire.

338
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,500
I think Scott would do an excellent job
with the color piece.

339
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,200
I'd really like to
find some chaw-chewing old-timer

340
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,500
who'd die rather than miss
the O's opener,

341
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,700
someone who says "baseball", you know?

342
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
You're the boss.

343
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Scott, put your special touch on it,

344
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,000
like you did with your Preakness piece
last year.

345
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,200
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

346
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,200
Fuck.

347
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,000
- What's wrong?
- It's all right, go back to sleep, baby.

348
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,200
- Metro desk.
- Hey, Spry, it's me.

349
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,400
Hey, is the night man
still on the copy desk?

350
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,400
Sure is. You need to make a change?

351
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Yeah, yeah, I just want
to check on the port story.

352
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,600
I think I might have
transposed some numbers.

353
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,900
Andy, can I get port back?

354
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,400
Yeah, sure.

355
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,600
We got time on the final. Go ahead.

356
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Yeah. Somewhere down in the A-matter,

357
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,400
a graph about the cargo trends
with percentages.

358
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,700
- Ro-ro, cargo...
- Read that back to me.

359
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,800
Cargo down 12%, ro-ro up 6.4.

360
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,500
12-point decrease
and a 6.4 bump on the ro-ro?

361
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
Yep, that's it.

362
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,500
Shit. I woke up in a sweat
'cause I thought I'd fucked that up. You sure?

363
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,400
Tonight, you had the usual
deadline nightmare to no actual purpose.

364
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,300
I guess you're better at this
than you thought.

365
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah, I guess.

366
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,200
- Thanks, Jay.
- Anytime. Good night.

367
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,400
The husband's thinking, "Gosh."
I mean, the police show up at his door

368
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,900
and say, "The lady you married
from the Ukraine,

369
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,200
"A, she's dead,
B, she's got a 2005 gold Mercedes..."

370
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,100
How long till my old lady?

371
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,600
It's gonna be a while.
Got my hands full.

372
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
I'm across the street for breakfast.

373
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,700
- There's only one way to rule.
- Come on. Bullshit.

374
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,900
This is not a murder. He overdosed.

375
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Look, we found his gear
on the bathroom floor,

376
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,200
and his girlfriend, who called 911,
said the two of them were firing.

377
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,600
I don't have the tox results yet,
but even if they find heroin,

378
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
it'd be a secondary cause.

379
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
I've got petechials,
I've got bruising around the neck.

380
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,500
My preliminary is homicide
by mechanical asphyxia.

381
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,000
OK, fine. I'll fucking bring
the paramedic in here,

382
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,800
and he'll fucking explain it to you himself.
Yeah, that's right.

383
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm going to go all the way out to Dundalk,
drag his ass in here

384
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,800
so you can hear it from him,
'cause I ain't taking this as a murder.

385
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Hey, Jimmy.

386
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Hey, Nancy. How's tricks?

387
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,400
- Heard you were working murders again.
- Yeah.

388
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,100
- How's life in the County?
- Worse every year.

389
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,700
You guys can't keep all the dirt
on your side of the line.

390
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,400
What's Kevin so hot about?

391
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,800
Oh, new cutter's dug her heels in,
says it's a murder.

392
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,900
It's not, but I can see why
she'd think strangulation.

393
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,400
Guy's got a fractured hyoid,
petechiae in both eyes,

394
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,100
But it's a freak thing.

395
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,400
If we weren't there to see it,
I wouldn't have believed it myself.

396
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,100
It's all postmortem.

397
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,500
He fires up a speedball,
then blacks out,

398
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,200
falls between toilet and bathtub,

399
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,700
manages to get himself
wedged back pretty good.

400
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
I couldn't make this shit up.

401
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,500
Medics come, pronounce him
right then and there.

402
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,400
But get this - they can't pry the guy out
without grabbing hold of his neck for leverage.

403
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,700
We watched them do it.

404
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,400
This Dundalk medic and the morgue guy
just grab his neck and start yanking.

405
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,900
Finally they get him out, he comes
down here looking like a strangle job.

406
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
They can't tell that it's postmort?

407
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,900
On a fresh body, no one can.

408
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,400
Grab a guy too hard,
and you can cause petechiae,

409
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,300
break a hyoid, even leave bruising,

410
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,800
all after death.

411
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,200
Fuck me.

412
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,500
Yeah. So Infante's about to lose his mind

413
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,000
if he can't talk this thing
out of becoming a murder.

414
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,900
Either that or charge the paramedic.

415
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,500
You goin' across
the street for breakfast?

416
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,900
- Buy me some scrapple, sailor?
- Come on.

417
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,600
Number two.

418
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,800
Surprise.

419
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,000
My man Sergei thought
we should talk first.

420
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,700
Talk about what?

421
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,100
That's on you, young'un.

422
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,100
Whatever business you tryin'
to do through the Russians,

423
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,600
you got to go through me first.

424
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,400
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

425
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,500
'Cause up in this bitch here,
I'm what you might consider...

426
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,900
an authority figure.

427
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,800
You know, everybody got to get my help
or ask my advice,

428
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,600
like, on all kinds of shit.

429
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,400
Sergei step to me the other day
sayin' this nigger Marlo,

430
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,200
who he don't even know,
just be sending him cash money

431
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,200
to get on his visiting list.

432
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,000
So, then he ask me if I knew Marlo.

433
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,400
I tell him, "Hell, yeah, I know Marlo real well."

434
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,000
You know? Over Westside,
everybody know everybody, right?

435
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,000
Let me help you find your tongue.

436
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,500
You tryin' to get to the Russian
so you can get a line to his people.

437
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,000
You tryin' to get to the Greek motherfuckers

438
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,600
because if you can
you want to cut Proposition Joe

439
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,200
and all them other Eastside bitches
out the connect.

440
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,600
I mean, you a natural
businessman, right?

441
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,700
But this is the thing, though,
and I mean, you know,

442
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,900
I'm with you on all that
as far as it goes, you know?

443
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,200
Westside definitely need
to stick together, you know what I mean?

444
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,200
And all the fuss about you
comin' at me -

445
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,100
I say let bygones be bygones,
but fuck all them Eastside bitches.

446
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,300
That's just the way I feel about it.

447
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,300
I got nothin' but love in my heart
for Westside niggers,

448
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,600
nothin' but love.

449
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,100
Of course, I mean, you know,

450
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,800
I got to have my taste too.

451
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,200
Figured that.

452
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,000
So send my sister a hundred large,

453
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,400
and the next time you come to Jessup,
it won't be my grill talkin' at you.

454
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,900
My word on that.

455
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,900
A hundred large, huh?

456
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So what's up, man?
What's up with you otherwise, you know?

457
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,800
The game is the game.

458
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,000
Always.

459
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,000
They do not.
You're making that shit up.

460
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,800
- I'm looking for you, Jimmy.
- Hey, what's up?

461
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
You know Nancy Porter
from the County?

462
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,900
- Lester Freamon.
- Good to meet you.

463
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,800
Well, thanks for breakfast.

464
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
I'll see you downstairs.

465
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,300
I spent last night
sitting on that same McCulloh Street lot.

466
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,400
- They went back there?
- Twice.

467
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,800
Once in the early evening
and once again after three.

468
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,500
They're getting sloppy, Jimmy,
especially now they think we've backed away.

469
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,900
You know, a few good bugs,
a couple of small surveillance cameras,

470
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,700
some man hours,
two weeks, three the most.

471
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,200
That's all this fucking case needs.

472
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,700
Daniels can't give us that.
He made that pretty fucking clear.

473
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Then we go elsewhere.

474
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,500
Right field, number 21, Nick Markakis.

475
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,900
Going to the game?
Long-time O's fan?

476
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,900
I could care less about
opening day at this point.

477
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,300
Between Bud Selig and Barry Bonds,
they've ruined baseball for me.

478
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,500
- You have a minute to talk?
- Late to meet somebody.

479
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,100
How can you commit to a sport where
the commissioner justifies a labor lockout

480
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,800
and cancels the World Series?

481
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,600
How long you been an O's fan?

482
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,500
Actually, I grew up with the Cubs,
but my son, he kind of likes them so...

483
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,500
And then on steroids, which has destroyed
what's left of baseball's credibility,

484
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,900
he's nowhere to be found.

485
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,500
So, you an Orioles fan?

486
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,700
Are you excited that it's opening day
because something like that is...

487
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,000
Fuck baseball!

488
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,200
Peanuts! Get your peanuts!

489
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,500
51, 52, 53.

490
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,000
Hey, Bubs, how you doin'?
Have a seat all the way around the other side.

491
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,400
Much obliged.

492
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,400
Stop crying. Don't grab stuff off my plate.

493
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,200
Mommy's going to whup you.

494
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,500
Do you need some help here?

495
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,700
Because we don't do that here.

496
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,600
In our house, there's no hitting anyone,
especially children.

497
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,400
Do you understand me?

498
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,600
Sorry I'm late. Traffic's a nightmare.

499
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Think you're funny, huh?
Think I still don't have...

500
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,600
All right, I get the point, fuckholes.

501
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,400
Fuck you both, already.

502
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,100
A couple more years of this,
you'll be ready for a radio car.

503
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,700
Why is it you can't come up to my office
and do this like grown-ups?

504
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,300
They still make you sign in
at the front desk out Woodlawn?

505
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,100
Who'd you knuckleheads
piss on this time?

506
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,700
We're still working the edges of something
the bosses shut down.

507
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,600
- Yeah, what are we talking about?
- The bodies in the vacants.

508
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,300
They shut that down?

509
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,700
Jesus Christ.
What, 22 murders doesn't rate?

510
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,800
Not any more.

511
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,500
You were on it more than a year.
Where were you?

512
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,000
Too close to quit.

513
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,200
You know Marlo Stanfield,
Chris Partlow, Snoop Pearson?

514
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,900
Those names ring out.

515
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,700
Well, we got nothing back from any lab work,

516
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,800
there's no witnesses,
nothing to make a murder prosecution,

517
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,200
so we settled in,
sat on them for about a year.

518
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,600
- You got a pattern?
- A good one.

519
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,500
Two or three weeks with some good
FBI cameras and wires,

520
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,600
maybe a half-dozen agents...

521
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,100
Like we tell you boys when the case broke,

522
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,600
we aren't much into ghetto drug shit any more.

523
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,900
Most of our guys are
counter-terror and political stuff.

524
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,700
We already did
all the long legwork.

525
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,900
Two or three weeks,
you guys end up with a big headline.

526
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,200
You federal fucks like headlines.

527
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
I'll run it up the flagpole.

528
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,300
- I'm gonna drive away now.
- All right.

529
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
If it's OK with you two suckholes.

530
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,900
Welcome back to Camden Yards.

531
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,700
As we mentioned a moment ago,
the Orioles know...

532
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,000
I got good stuff.

533
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,600
Hang on. Come here and tell me,
so I can put it on the budget.

534
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,600
I got a kid in a wheelchair
outside the stadium,

535
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,800
wanting to go to the game

536
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,200
but unable because he didn't have the money
for a scalped ticket.

537
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Sounds pretty good. You got art?

538
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,700
Photo said they
were too booked with the game.

539
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,200
This is your main color piece.

540
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,800
You got to have a picture of the kid
if he's your lead.

541
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,700
- Can we send them out now?
- I guess.

542
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,900
- He probably rolled out, but you can try.
- Shit.

543
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,400
- How old is this fella?
- 13.

544
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
What's with his parents?
Why wasn't he in school?

545
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,300
What, in this city? He just cut.

546
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,600
- So what about his parents?
- Both dead. No shit.

547
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,500
- He lives with his aunt in West Baltimore.
- How'd he get in the wheelchair?

548
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,200
Something about a stray gunshot.
It was all pretty vague.

549
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,600
You got a date when it happened?

550
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,600
He was a little hinky
with telling me much.

551
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Fact is, he would only let me go
with his nickname.

552
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Look. I got to start writing
if you want it for the e-dot.

553
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,500
Yeah. Why don't you work in
Metro Write so I can read over your shoulder?

554
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,000
Hey, Scott. What he go by, the nickname?

555
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,300
- E.J.
- E.J.

556
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,100
Hey, Jane, come here a minute.

557
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Check clips for the last three years.

558
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,400
See if we got anything
on a kid in the city wounded by a stray bullet.

559
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,000
He'd be 13 now. Nickname of E.J.
Could be his initials.

560
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,000
Who is he to us?

561
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,300
He's the lead of our opening-day piece.
I'd love to get art on the kid.

562
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,700
Don't hold your breath.

563
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's a hell of a case, really.

564
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And God knows they could use the help.

565
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,700
- Sorry I'm late.
- Anything up?

566
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,800
- Just the usual. You all right?
- Yeah.

567
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,500
We do this right, it is like a spiral.

568
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,200
We start on the outside of the circle,
and we work our way around the edges,

569
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,100
pick up everything we can before we get to
Clay and the people he keeps close.

570
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,800
You think Clay knows
the indictment's coming?

571
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,100
Clay Davis has been waiting
for the other shoe to drop his whole life.

572
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,000
He knows.

573
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,900
And it's your people up in my shit.

574
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,000
Not no feds, not no state people
from Annapolis.

575
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's motherfuckers from my own city.

576
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,700
My hands are tied here, Clayton.

577
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,100
It's a new mayor, a new state's attorney.

578
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,500
I'm out there doing
the Lord's work for you, Erv. You know it.

579
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,900
Who got that pay raise
through the council?

580
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,100
Just enough for you to get that new patio

581
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,900
but not enough for that guy from Pittsburgh
to take your place.

582
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,500
I wish I could.

583
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,500
You know I wish I could,
but with Carcetti in, people are watching.

584
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,900
I got eyes on me now.

585
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,800
You the commissioner still, right?

586
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,600
Yeah, but it ain't like it was.

587
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,400
If you don't control it, who does?

588
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,700
On this, I got to reach around Daniels,
and he's Carcetti's boy.

589
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,600
Look. This is a grand jury investigation,
for God's sake.

590
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,500
We could both be charged
with obstruction of justice.

591
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,700
God damn it, Erv.

592
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,800
I been there for you,
carried water for you, and you do me like this?

593
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,200
Clay, I can't. Nobody could.

594
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,800
You think I'm goin' down, don't you?

595
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,900
You think I'm done.

596
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,500
All y'all ungrateful bitches
thinkin' you can throw me out the boat.

597
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,700
- Clay.
- A'ight!

598
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,700
I'm gonna remember
this moment, Erv.

599
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,900
I'm gonna hold on to this moment. Yeah.

600
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,300
Clay crying to you?

601
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,700
Like I could put brakes on this mess.

602
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,900
Is that...

603
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,200
Yeah. Straight from P and R.

604
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,800
And that's with the numbers bent
as far as we dare.

605
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,100
With city hall asking for clean stats,
there's only so much we can do.

606
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
The hell are we gonna tell the mayor?

607
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,800
I sat there for half an hour
with him and his deputy.

608
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,300
He knows what he's saying no to.

609
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,700
- Then how the fuck...
- It's personal, Jimmy.

610
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,200
Somebody at city hall
really pissed off the US Attorney.

611
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,300
- You're kidding me.
- No, and I got an earful.

612
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,400
You tell Lester I'm still trying
to figure out what the problem is,

613
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,900
but for right now,
you forget about shopping this case anywhere.

614
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,500
DEA, ATF, Customs -
you guys are shut out across the board.

615
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,800
Fish and fucking Wildlife
couldn't help you.

616
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,100
Sorry, brother.

617
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
The kid is nowhere to be found.

618
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,400
I sent photo down there
to try to dig him up. Nothing.

619
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,000
- Probably left.
- OK.

620
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,200
So we got a poor black kid
in a wheelchair with no ticket.

621
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,000
He rolls himself from somewhere
in West Baltimore to...

622
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,800
to "the shadow of the mighty brick-faced
coliseum known as Oriole Park,

623
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,600
"listening to the cheers from the crowd,
which told the whole tale."

624
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,600
We're gonna give good play
to a 13-year-old known only as E. J,

625
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,900
who declines to give his name
because he skipped school,

626
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,900
he's got no parents,
he lives with his aunt.

627
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,800
I'm not saying that this kid
isn't everything you say he is,

628
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,700
but, Scott, damn, as an editor,

629
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,300
I need a little more to go on
if I'm gonna fly this thing.

630
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,700
I resent the implication.

631
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,300
I'm not implying anything. I'm on your side.

632
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,000
But the standard for us has to be...

633
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,900
Scott, just finished your story.

634
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,900
Good read. I'm putting it out front.

635
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,700
I think you've really captured
the disparity of the two worlds in this city

636
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,400
in a highly readable narrative.
I wouldn't change a word.

637
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,600
Thanks, but I'm not sure
everyone shares your enthusiasm.

638
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,400
Jim, aren't you just a little bit concerned

639
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
that we don't even have
a last name for this kid?

640
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,300
I thought we held ourselves up to a...

641
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,600
It's not an ideal situation, no,

642
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,300
but the boy's reluctance to give his last name

643
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,000
clearly stems from his fear
of being discovered as a truant.

644
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,600
You have a problem with it?

645
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,100
A little bit, yeah.
I'm just saying that the standards that...

646
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,100
I think we're on terra firma here.

647
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,000
Gotcha.

648
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,600
The man made a call. You're good to go.

649
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,100
Thanks, Scott.

650
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,100
The nigger Webster's shop right there.

651
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,700
So look, I'm gonna roll up,
and y'all gonna pop out and pop off.

652
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,000
Drop who you can.

653
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,000
Yo. Let's go all West Coast with this.

654
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,200
Say what?

655
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,000
Drive-by. That's how they do.

656
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,300
Drop a motherfucker
and not slow down.

657
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,700
Like Boyz N The Hood.

658
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,200
Shit was tight, remember?

659
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,200
- Yo, there you go.
- What's up?

660
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,600
Man, I ain't even hit near one of them.

661
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,500
This nigger's wound.

662
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,600
Fuck them West Coast niggers,

663
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,600
'cause in B-more,
we aim to hit a nigger, you heard.

664
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,300
Guy leaves two dozen bodies
scattered all over the city,

665
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,600
no one gives a fuck.

666
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,700
It's because who he dropped.

667
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,000
True that.

668
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You can go a long way in this country
killing black folk.

669
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,300
Young males especially.

670
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,100
Misdemeanor homicides.

671
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,900
If Marlo was killing white women.

672
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,200
White children.

673
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,400
Tourists.

674
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,400
One white ex-cheerleader tourist
missing in Aruba.

675
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,000
Trouble is, this ain't Aruba, bitch.

676
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,700
You think that if 300 white people
were killed in this city every year,

677
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,500
they wouldn't send the 82nd Airborne?

678
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,100
Negro, please.

679
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,300
There's got to be some way
to make them turn on the faucet.

680
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,900
Come on, Jimmy.
You're the smartest boy in the room.

681
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,500
You come up with something
in this broke-ass city.

682
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,100
Isn't he married or some shit now?

683
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,600
Did you edit this
opening-day piece?

684
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,500
Whiting himself blessed it as written
before I could take a meat ax to it.

685
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,200
Did it bother you that we
don't have the boy's full name?

686
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,400
Yes, Rebecca, it did.

687
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,300
Don't give me that "huh".

688
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,200
Whiting wasn't buying
any problem I had.

689
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,400
No art of the kid?

690
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,200
None.

691
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,400
How long we been here?

692
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,400
More than a hour.

693
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Why you think we sitting here?

694
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,100
See who home and who not,
who on the block,

695
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,800
police and whatnot.

696
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,600
That's right.

697
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,800
You don't ever want to be
the last man to a party. You feel me?

698
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,300
That's why I show up
to a job an hour before.

699
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,200
Sometimes two.

700
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,800
I don't want nobody settin' up on me
while I'm settin' up on them.

701
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,700
'Cause there ain't no good thing about
motherfuckin' surprises in this line of work.

702
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,700
Why we doin' June Bug anyway?

703
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,800
Heard he called Marlo a dicksuck.

704
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,300
Talkin' shit like that.

705
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,500
You heard? You ain't sure?

706
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,700
People say he said it.

707
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,000
Don't matter if he said it or not.
People think he said it.

708
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,700
Can't let that shit go.

709
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,900
Why not?

710
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,400
I mean, Marlo ain't suck no dick, right?

711
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,500
So, if Marlo knows he ain't suck dick,

712
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,900
then what the fuck he care
what June Bug say?

713
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,900
What anybody say?

714
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,800
Why this boy got to get dead,
just for talking shit?

715
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,700
'Cause he got a big motherfuckin' mouth,
that's why,

716
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,000
and you need to stop
runnin' your own mouth, young'un.

717
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,400
There it is.

718
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,400
And all the muscle he got.

719
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,600
- See it?
- You ready?

720
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,900
Now you handle that thing.

721
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You give me a sign, meet me out front.

722
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,900
Michael, you go round the alley.

723
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,900
Body come bustin' out the back,
you drop that shit.

724
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,700
Shitfuck.

725
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,400
Bunk's usually the one throwing up.

726
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,200
You took aspirin?

727
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,700
Six.

728
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,300
How was that brunette?

729
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,500
Must have been a decent ride
'cause he never went home.

730
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Same shirt as yesterday, Jimmy.

731
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,100
You catchin' hell from Beadie?

732
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,200
No.

733
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,600
Just asking.

734
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,400
Gentlemen.

735
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,200
DOA, Central and Baltimore.

736
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,500
- I took a call two days ago.
- The old lady?

737
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,700
That wasn't a call. That came back natural.

738
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
Look. I'm hung over, Jay.

739
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,000
Both of you. You're up.

740
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,000
Mommy. Mommy!

741
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,900
'Sup, Boris?

742
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,100
You know who I am?

743
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,900
I'm that rich uncle been
putting all that money in your canteen account.

744
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,400
In my country, I was in jail four years.

745
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,600
In my country, this is not prison.

746
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,100
This is nothing.

747
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,500
I don't need money.

748
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,900
I don't need fucking canteen.

749
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,600
I don't need you.

750
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,000
- Gangbanger.
- A'ight. I feel that.

751
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,800
I feel that, but Avon over there,

752
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,200
he thinks you might be able to help get
a message to the Greeks,

753
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,900
to Vondas.

754
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,500
I mean, seeing as
you don't need my money,

755
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,000
Vondas might be happy to have it.

756
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,300
He don't want to see me, he won't,

757
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,900
but if he do, it's you that made it happen.

758
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,900
Hey. Hey, man.

759
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,200
Sonny Mays is running late.

760
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,200
Can you fill in as speaker?

761
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,400
It's time to share, Bubs.

762
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,500
Nah, I don't think so.
I'm not feeling so good today, you know?

763
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,100
As your sponsor, I'm telling you,

764
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,400
you got to step up for something.

765
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,900
I don't care what,
I don't care if it's in these rooms or not,

766
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,900
but there ain't no laying in the cut
on this shit.

767
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,900
You got to step up somewhere.

768
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,000
Detective, can I get a word?

769
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,300
Anything? Anything on the suspects?

770
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
Maybe on your way out, then.

771
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,800
Back door was open.

772
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,400
Can't tell if he ran through
and out the rear.

773
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,300
They. Unless the shooter
put a bullet in her head

774
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,100
for good measure after the shotgun.

775
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,600
Also, two of our street cameras
were disabled. Wires ripped.

776
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,000
Fuck. That's a whole lot of thinking

777
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,500
for any motherfucker to do something like this.

778
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,800
How the fuck?

779
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,100
How?

780
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,400
He must have been in that closet
the whole time. No one heard shit.

781
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,000
Call DSS. Now.

782
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,300
Any media out back?

783
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,200
Bring a cage car around.

784
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,800
Hey. How you doing?

785
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,400
Look, I don't know what I can do to help.

786
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,900
I'm just tryin' to find my way.

787
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,200
Seein' how crowded it is,
maybe I could help you hand out tickets.

788
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,900
That's fine, Bubs, really,
but wouldn't you rather serve?

789
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,400
Serve lunch.

790
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,200
You mean give the food to people?

791
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,300
Isn't that the best part?

792
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,000
Nah, I can't. No.

793
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,400
All right. Come on.

794
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,500
We can always use an extra set of hands.

795
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,300
He fell out.

796
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,700
Last bottle of smoke
probably did him in.

797
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,800
Another drunk found him,
pulled me off post.

798
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,400
10-7 when I arrived.

799
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,700
- You call for a crime lab?
- The wait's two to three hours.

800
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,700
Shit gets worse every day.

801
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,500
Jimmy?

802
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,500
You OK?

803
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,700
Go get yourself a coffee,
do your paperwork, get back on the street.

804
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,500
We got it from here.

805
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,500
We're gonna wait on them anyway.
Go ahead.

806
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,100
Thanks.

807
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,300
Don't let this guy go anywhere.

808
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,500
I forgot something in the car.

809
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,700
Bring the paper in, will you?

810
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,700
We're gonna be here a while.

811
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,100
Hey.

812
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,300
Little early for that, ain't it?

813
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,800
What the fuck you doing?

814
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,600
Just watch the door, Bunk.

815
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,100
Shit.

816
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,500
Come on, Jimmy.

817
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,300
Get a fuckin' grip.

818
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,600
Jimmy.

819
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,200
Have you lost your fucking mind?

820
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,600
Jesus Christ, you sick fuck.

821
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,900
There's a serial killer in Baltimore.

822
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,500
He preys on the weakest among us.

823
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,600
He needs to be caught.

824
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,800
I'm going.

825
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,900
I don't want a part of this.
