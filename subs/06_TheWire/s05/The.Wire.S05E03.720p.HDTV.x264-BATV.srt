1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,600
Type quieter, asshole.

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,600
Early relief.
So get the fuck out of here.

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,500
Jesus, Bunk. What time is it?

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,100
4:30.

5
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
I couldn't sleep,
so get the fuck gone.

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,000
What time did McNulty
leave last night?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,200
Never did. He's in number one.

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,600
Pulling his hair out over some shit.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Think again about what
the fuck you're doing.

10
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,100
Bunk, this can work.

11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,000
It can.

12
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,200
Fuck you. I mean that.

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,900
Jimmy, four in the fuckin' morning?

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,500
So it is.

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
All of these?
Homeless murders from the last five years.

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,900
Everything before that is on microfilm,
but we got enough right here.

17
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,000
- Jimmy.
- Most of it open.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,300
We don't do so well
with homeless killings.

19
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,800
Transient locales, no nearest, no dearest.
No one gives a fuck.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,700
Cases stay open forever.

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,700
You're going to jail behind this shit.
Yes, you are.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,600
You know what they do to police in jail?
Pretty police like yourself?

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,200
Motherfucker, we have kids.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,800
Houses. Car payments. Furniture.

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Jimmy, I just bought brand-new lawn chairs
and a glass patio table.

26
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,300
Now, you don't buy no shit like that if you
planning to lose your job and go to prison.

27
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,900
You won't even get past the ME.

28
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,000
- Watch me.
- You're dumping murders on us

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,700
that we can't solve,
you're fucking the squad's clearance rate.

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,800
Fuck the fucking numbers already.

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,500
The fucking numbers destroyed
this fucking department.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,200
Landsman and his clearance rate
can suck a hairy asshole.

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,900
- Marlo ain't worth it, man. Nobody is.
- Marlo's an asshole.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,400
He does not get to win.
We get to win.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,400
This case doesn't go away just because
the bosses can't find the money to pay for it.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
These are fucking murders -

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,700
ghetto murders, but still,

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,900
I came back out of the Western
to work this case

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,600
because they said it would be worked.

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,400
I came back out on a promise,
and they're gonna keep that promise.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,000
Whether they know it or not.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,700
I'm gonna tell Landsman.

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,100
Yeah. You keep on with it,
I'm gonna rat you out.

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, you do what you got to do.

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,000
My name is nowhere in the file.

46
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,700
I don't want fuck to do with this.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,100
Hey, Bunk.

48
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,500
- What are you doing?
- Final is out.

49
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
I want to see my story.

50
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,300
- Now?
- It's my first time out front.

51
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
- I want to see it.
- This is why we should get home delivery.

52
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,600
Why pay for it when I get it
for free at the office?

53
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,900
Be back.

54
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,400
Brother Ray.

55
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,900
God rest ye.

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,700
When does the Sun get here?

57
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,400
Around now usually.

58
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,200
Anybody got a working car?

59
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,800
I got one, but I'm going
back out to my crime scene for a canvass.

60
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,800
Drop me at the ME?

61
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Jimmy.

62
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,500
My office, now.

63
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,100
I'll get a lift over
from one of the central cars.

64
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,600
This is way past any shit you ever pulled
in your life, Jimmy. Think on it.

65
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,500
You see Greggs out there,
bagging evidence alone,

66
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,800
then going back out to recanvass on a triple?
A triple fucking murder,

67
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,500
a home invasion,
and she's working it alone.

68
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,300
They pulled Crutchfield this morning,
put him back in the rotation.

69
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,800
- That's on them, but you can't...
- Fucking right, that's on them.

70
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,600
A triple murder, and 12 hours later
they leave one detective alone on it?

71
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,900
I guess she's lucky she has a car.

72
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,900
- This shit won't work.
- Then we're no worse than before.

73
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,100
- Extra red name or two on the board.
- Yeah, unless you got caught.

74
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Who in this fucking unit
is gonna catch me?

75
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,300
Most of the guys up here couldn't catch
the clap in a Mexican whorehouse.

76
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,100
What's with the red ribbon?

77
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,400
Barlow had an open strangle
a few years back.

78
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,200
Homeless guy with a red ribbon
tied around his wrist.

79
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
So that's two.

80
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,200
Also, I found an open homeless case
which Ray Cole worked.

81
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
I wrote a ribbon into his office reports.

82
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,400
- So there's three.
- Our guy didn't have a red ribbon.

83
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,300
- That's where I'm headed.
- Jesus. Listen to yourself.

84
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,000
Upstairs wouldn't jump on
a real serial killer -

85
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,000
fuckin' Marlo,
who's got bodies all over him.

86
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,800
Well, maybe they need the make-believe.

87
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,500
Yeah, maybe you're the asshole
just lost his fucking mind.

88
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,600
- Yeah, I'm locked in the box.
- In the box?

89
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,300
- It's no joke. Let me out.
- Be right there.

90
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,600
Jimmy.

91
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,000
He fuck you?

92
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,100
He tried...

93
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
but mostly he just fucks himself.

94
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,000
You ain't seen those yet, huh?

95
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,900
I'll bet you didn't.

96
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,400
Fucking Burrell's asshole
must be so tight

97
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,200
you couldn't pull a pin from it
with a John Deere tractor.

98
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,500
Here you're promising
a double-digit drop,

99
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,900
and he gives you a 4% bump
for two quarters in a row.

100
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,400
- Thanks for bringing these by, Stan.
- I wanted to give you a heads-up.

101
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Truth is, looking at numbers like those,

102
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I'm thinking you could do a lot worse

103
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
than give me a run as acting commissioner.

104
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,800
I know you couldn't make me permanent,

105
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,400
maybe six months
while you keep grooming your boy Daniels.

106
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,200
I'd get a pension bump,

107
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
and you'd get a head start
on clearing out deadwood,

108
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,100
beginning with Burrell and Rawls.

109
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,800
Thanks, Stan.

110
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
- Let me think on it.
- You do that, Tommy.

111
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,700
Even on an acting basis,
can you imagine Nerese

112
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,600
and the ministers dealing with
Commissioner Valchek?

113
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,100
- What are you gonna do about the numbers?
- Fuck can I do?

114
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,600
I cut the department budget
to the bone, right?

115
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,300
Can't very well complain
when the crime rate bumps.

116
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,400
Burrell comes in here
and owns these,

117
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I got to give him a pass,
at least until I can fix his money problems.

118
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,300
Your piece took a bad bite there.

119
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
35 inches down to 12?

120
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,700
Yeah, well, it's my fault for giving it up
to the A-section.

121
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,600
Page-one editor made noises
like it was gonna go out front

122
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,300
and then he tossed it back to Metro
before the double-dot.

123
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,200
Night editor didn't have room
to take it back, so...

124
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,900
Story deserved better. Sorry.

125
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,800
Three people murdered in a house,

126
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,100
and it gets 12 inches below the fold.
Explain that to me.

127
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,700
There's no explaining it.

128
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,700
Advertising's down,
we got a smaller news hole,

129
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,100
we're not managing it well.

130
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,800
We messed up.

131
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,500
That's all.

132
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Wrong zip code.

133
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,300
They're dead where it doesn't count.

134
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,300
If they were white
and murdered in Timonium,

135
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,900
you'd have had 30 inches off the front.

136
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,200
Would have been my first front-pager
where I didn't share a byline.

137
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,200
Yeah?

138
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,500
I drove down to the Port Covington
plant this morning to get a copy.

139
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,700
You ain't the first to do that.

140
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Our 10-7 on the floor yet?

141
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,400
He's by the overhead camera.

142
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I need to grab prints, get him ID'd.

143
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Don't you want to wait for the post,
keep his hands clean for trace?

144
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,800
I need to know who my victim is.
That's the priority.

145
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,400
Finish your breakfast. I got plenty of time.

146
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,300
There's nothing under the nails
that I can see.

147
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,500
I think we can risk prints.

148
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Something's up.

149
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,900
Please. Gather round.

150
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,900
Steve, could someone get word
across the hall to Features and Sports?

151
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
- Sure.
- We want everyone on this.

152
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,900
What, did we get sold again?

153
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,600
First the LA Times buys us up,
then the Tribune.

154
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,700
Law of the fish.

155
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,200
- We're the minnow.
- Maybe we won a Pulitzer.

156
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,600
Pulitzers are still a week away.
It just turned April.

157
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,800
Look at Whiting's pants.

158
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,000
If we won a Pulitzer,
the executive editor would be tumescent.

159
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,200
Tum-what?

160
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
Speak English.
I'm just a police reporter.

161
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,900
Tumescent. Engorged.

162
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,300
Exactly.

163
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,500
It's a bad time for newspapers,
as you all know.

164
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,200
The news hole is shrinking
as advertising dollars continue to decline.

165
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,600
Our circulation numbers are also down
as we compete with a variety of media.

166
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Technology is driving distribution,

167
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,000
and the internet is a free source
of news and opinions.

168
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,200
Seeking a balance in this new world,

169
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,100
we're now faced with hard choices.

170
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,600
We opened our first foreign bureau
in London in 1924.

171
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,800
The Sun's foreign coverage
has been a source of pride ever since.

172
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,000
So it is with tremendous regret...

173
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,200
that I tell you that Chicago has made it clear
that the bureaus in Beijing,

174
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,700
Moscow, Jerusalem,
Johannesburg, and London

175
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
will all be shuttered.

176
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,600
Elsewhere in the newsroom,

177
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,100
there will be a fresh round of buyouts.

178
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Chicago has given us some
specific budgetary targets

179
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,700
that will require some hard choices
throughout the newsroom.

180
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,400
We are, quite simply,

181
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,800
going to have to find ways
to do more with less.

182
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,100
So I guess I will turn this over to Tom,

183
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,700
who will get into the specifics.

184
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,500
I know some of you have questions.

185
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,800
If you could hold them for me
until after I've had a chance to speak.

186
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,300
Pull your clip book together.
Time to find a new home.

187
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,700
First, Chicago has sent us a memo outlining
options that are available to those of you...

188
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
The aorta should have elasticity to it,

189
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
but it's rock hard.

190
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,900
Whoever strangled him
could've just waited a month or two more.

191
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,700
This guy was on his last legs.

192
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
It is what it is.

193
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,900
In addition to the fractured
hyoid and the bruising,

194
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,100
I got signs of a struggle
around the body,

195
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,200
a couple of witnesses who thought
they heard sounds of a struggle

196
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
inside the house.

197
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,200
Also that ribbon you snipped off,

198
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,600
it might tie to other cases.

199
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,400
The ribbon my own investigator
missed at the scene.

200
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,000
It happens. It was high on the wrist.

201
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,900
Cause and manner is
homicide by strangulation.

202
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Good hunting, Detective.

203
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,700
"And anyone requiring
additional information

204
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,900
"on COBRA benefits
and pension payout

205
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,500
"as part of the voluntary separation plan

206
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
"can schedule an appointment
with human resources."

207
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,200
Some of you will migrate
into new positions

208
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,200
while others will of course be moving on
to other opportunities

209
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,100
beyond the Sun, but everyone in this room
has done excellent work

210
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,100
and should be proud of their contributions.

211
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,300
- How many buyouts are there?
- That hasn't been determined yet.

212
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,900
We're talking to the union later today.

213
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,700
How will this affect the upcoming
contract negotiations with the guild?

214
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,000
Badly. Kiss any raise goodbye.

215
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,700
How come there's cuts in the newsroom
when the company's still profitable?

216
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,700
There's nobody that feels
worse about this than I do.

217
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,600
I've seen the excellent work
we've done here in Baltimore.

218
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,100
The sooner we start meeting
with you individually,

219
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,600
the sooner I can answer
all of your questions.

220
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,900
Not O'Mara.

221
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,600
Aw, no.

222
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,000
Good luck, everybody.

223
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,100
No increase in felonies
and a 1% bump in total crime.

224
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Do you vouch for these figures?

225
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
- Sir?
- No increase in crime

226
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
even after I cut you guys to the bone.
This is what you're telling me?

227
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,500
Because the one thing
I'm asking of you guys,

228
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,100
the one thing that I'm asking above all,

229
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,300
is that you bring me clean numbers.

230
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes, Mr. Mayor. You made that clear.

231
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Very good, then.

232
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,400
Burrell is done.

233
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,100
He just killed himself.

234
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,900
We leak the real stats, hold the cooked ones
in case he won't go quietly.

235
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,700
And replace him with who? Rawls?

236
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,700
He came in with the same stats.

237
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,100
If I know Bill Rawls,
he'll be calling over here

238
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,000
as soon as he gets back to his office,

239
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,400
telling us he warned Burrell against
cooking the books.

240
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,800
The ministers won't live with Rawls.
Neither will Nerese.

241
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,200
As acting commissioner,
they will for a few months at least,

242
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,900
if we've got a black candidate to sell them.

243
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Daniels isn't ready.
He's only been colonel for a year.

244
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,900
A year will do in a pinch.

245
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
You float it with one of your bunkies
on Calvert Street.

246
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,000
See how it plays.

247
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Burrell reads that, he'll shit melons.

248
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,600
I fucking hope so.

249
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,400
It's Baltimore.

250
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No one lives forever.

251
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,900
Andreas, right?

252
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
The Russian sent me.

253
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Need you to get a word to Vondas.

254
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,900
He got a new friend.

255
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,600
I never hear the name.

256
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,700
Just let him know Marlo
came past with a gift.

257
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Be at you same time tomorrow.

258
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,300
Any idea how long this could take?

259
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,900
Don't know. Might be here all day.

260
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,600
I have meetings scheduled.

261
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,000
We've got to lay the foundation carefully,

262
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,100
make it so the grand jurors understand
all the ins and outs

263
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,900
so they don't get lost in the details.

264
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,200
Mr. Howard?

265
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,700
Is there any way I could go earlier?

266
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,100
If you're important enough, sure.

267
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,400
I'm the vice president
of a major financial institution.

268
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,900
Who the fuck isn't?

269
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,900
Now, sir, directing your attention
to the document in your hand,

270
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,700
is that also an account statement?

271
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,400
Yes, it is,
for a nonprofit, interest-bearing account,

272
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,900
organizational,
with 501 (c)3 designation.

273
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,400
Can you begin by slowly explaining
in the most basic terms

274
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,000
each of those things,
beginning with the word nonprofit?

275
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,200
- Hey, is box two open?
- Not yet.

276
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,600
What about three?

277
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
Someone's killing homeless men.

278
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Medical examiner says so.

279
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,200
Weird thing about my case, Bunk.

280
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,000
Dead man was homeless,
but he had a red ribbon

281
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,700
tied around his wrist.

282
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,600
What does
a homeless guy have to remember

283
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,500
that he should have a red ribbon
tied around his wrist?

284
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,600
- Barlow.
- What?

285
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Nice out.

286
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,100
Like Chanel No. 5
comes out of your ass, Moreland.

287
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
If you got a problem,
then I got a problem.

288
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,800
That's how the co-op work.

289
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,300
What's the problem?

290
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,000
I got too much money.

291
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,300
Son, believe me, you ain't alone.

292
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,500
What to do with the shit we sell
ain't no thing.

293
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,200
In Baltimore, dope and coke
sell themselves,

294
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,200
but the money that come back?

295
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
Ain't enough mattresses, is there, now?

296
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,700
You got any ideas?

297
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,600
A few. If you askin'.

298
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
- Not Twigg.
- Damn.

299
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,700
Guy gives 20 years to the paper,
and this how it ends?

300
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,500
Fact of the matter is,
it's more profitable these days

301
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
to run a worse paper for less money.

302
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,900
Cut back people and pages,
you increase revenue.

303
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,600
If we're lucky,
they'll just get rid of deadwood.

304
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,100
How'd it go?

305
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,500
"You've done excellent work."

306
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,700
Without being explicit,
they gave me a choice -

307
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,900
- Either the copy desk or the buyout.
- You're kidding, right?

308
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,300
Apparently, they can hire
1.5 twenty somethings

309
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,000
for what it costs to keep
me in print, so...

310
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,900
Damn, Roger.

311
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,200
Sorry, man.

312
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Fuck it. I might as well get to work
on that great American novel.

313
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,700
- Yeah.
- Gus, come on in.

314
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Have a seat.

315
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,200
Relax, Gus. We need you here.

316
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,500
We value your dedication.
You've done excellent work.

317
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,700
We're counting on you
to transition the new team.

318
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,900
There's still going to be excellent talent
out there that needs to be developed.

319
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,000
What kind of team's going to be left?

320
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
We're losing good people,

321
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,300
but we expect to retain the core
of a solid staff.

322
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,800
Doing more with less.

323
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
That's what we have to contemplate
going forward.

324
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,500
More with less, huh?

325
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,800
Look at this.

326
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,200
A red ribbon in one of Ray Cole's files.

327
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,100
Cole left a note with it.
"Found on left wrist of victim.

328
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,300
"Check against other cases."

329
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,300
Hey, hon. How's the stain look
on the cabinets? They dry yet?

330
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Great. I'm on my way.

331
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,900
This is the hard part,
getting these guys to give a shit.

332
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,500
Let's get a taste. I'm buying.

333
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,100
You think I'm drinking with you?

334
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,100
Go home, Jimmy.
Think your weak shit through, man.

335
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,700
Go home? For the love of God,
I'm working a serial killer.

336
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,200
You want to talk on it?

337
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,800
Went with Chris and them,
set up on this family.

338
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
Everything so serious now.

339
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,800
Yo, little man,
you finish your homework?

340
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,700
'Cause it's late now, and it's only gonna
get later if we don't roll home soon.

341
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,600
Ain't no school tomorrow.
Teacher meetings.

342
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,800
We should do something, Mike.

343
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
Got my corner to run, man.

344
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
What?

345
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,000
What, nigga?

346
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,200
Six Flags be open again.

347
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,100
That shit's taking forever.

348
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Complicated stuff, I suppose.

349
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,900
It's more like Joe make it complicated.

350
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,400
That nigga got a thing for conversation.

351
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,000
Not like Marlo.

352
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,200
Definitely not.

353
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,500
Now, see, pastor here, he one of about three
I like to give money to.

354
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Help with his good works and all that.

355
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,900
Good works?

356
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,300
He down with all kind of missionary work
going on down in the islands.

357
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,800
You know, building a church
for some folk,

358
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,800
a schoolhouse for some other folks,
all kind of good shit like that.

359
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,400
And what else y'all building?

360
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,300
- A hospital.
- Hospital, yeah.

361
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,200
Except they been building that mess
for about ten years now,

362
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,500
and nothing ever actually get finished.

363
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,100
How you gonna clean my money?

364
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,000
Got accounts at some of the banks
down there.

365
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,500
Donations come in as cash,
cashier's checks come out.

366
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,400
Tiny-ass Caribbean island
don't truck with no subpoenas,

367
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,000
no court orders, none of that.

368
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,800
You pay ten on the dollar.

369
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,700
Anything beyond that
depends on your generosity,

370
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,200
to save those who want to be saved.

371
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I'm back.

372
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,900
I can see that.

373
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,400
Again.

374
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,200
I saw your text message
on my cellphone today,

375
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
it took me a minute to remember
who the hell you were.

376
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,500
It ain't been that long.

377
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,600
Shit. When you left,
I was still covering the labor beat.

378
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,200
We ain't had a labor reporter
around here in three years.

379
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,900
Yeah, well, now you the big, bad city editor,

380
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,900
and I'm whoring myself for politicians.

381
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,200
You got out just at the right time too.

382
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,200
- That bad, huh?
- Chicago is killing us.

383
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,500
One buyout after another.

384
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,600
I can't even begin to think
what our next round of guild negotiations

385
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,800
is gonna be like.

386
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,300
Enough of me crying.

387
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,500
What are you selling tonight,
dear Norman?

388
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,900
Carcetti's planning to shitcan Burrell.

389
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
He's talking to people
and considering replacements.

390
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
City hall source?

391
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,700
Who's the leading candidate?

392
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,700
Rawls, deputy for operations,
might have the job for a few months,

393
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,500
but there's a front runner
from deeper in the department.

394
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,900
Cedric Daniels.

395
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,600
It's been a while since
I've been on the street there, Norman.

396
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,600
- Who's this Daniels?
- Chief of detectives. Polished.

397
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,900
Holds a law degree.

398
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,300
Brought closure to
some high-level cases.

399
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,300
His ex-wife got herself
elected to the council last go-round.

400
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I always liked photos with my stories.

401
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,300
And this is aimed at who? Huh?

402
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,800
The ministers? Nerese?

403
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,000
You want to see if they
can live with this fella here, right?

404
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,500
A'ight.

405
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
From one whore to another.

406
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,200
Whoa, what the fuck?

407
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,500
Check this shit out.

408
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,300
Beautiful.

409
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,100
Holy shit. Look at this motherfucker.

410
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,000
Hit him with the spot.

411
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,700
CID. Figures, don't it?

412
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,200
Where y'all need to go?

413
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,500
Down Six Flags.

414
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,900
You talkin' round trip?

415
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,100
Run you 200 plus gas.

416
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,900
Where you at?

417
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,500
I got 150, gas included
if it even get us there.

418
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,200
Don't be fretting on the ride now.
This motherfucker tried and true.

419
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,500
A'ight.

420
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,900
I got half when we get there
and half on the way back.

421
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,000
I guess you're not up for a story.

422
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,300
- I need something worked on right away.
- What do you got?

423
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,800
Mayor's thinking about firing
the police commissioner.

424
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,100
- He's floating the idea anyway.
- No problem. I'm all over it.

425
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,900
What do you know about Daniels?

426
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,300
- Who is he?
- CID commander.

427
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,000
Came out of the Eastern DEU,
married to the Daniels

428
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,100
that won the council seat in '06.

429
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Brought in a couple of big wiretap cases,

430
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,300
they gave him the Western,
hoping to clean up that district

431
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,300
after they shitcanned Bunny Colvin.

432
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,600
Since getting separated,
he's been shacked up with Ronnie Pearlman

433
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,400
over at the state's attorney's office.
No suction early in his career,

434
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,500
but now that he's got Carcetti's ear,

435
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
now the brass stay out of his way.

436
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,700
What's the man's favorite color?

437
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,100
- You sure?
- Yeah, what the hell?

438
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
I'm already on the clock.

439
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Ops bureau.

440
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,000
Hi, darlin'.

441
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,700
It's Roger Twigg with the Sun papers.

442
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,600
- Hey, Roger.
- Is the deputy around?

443
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
- Sure.
- Thanks, hon.

444
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,400
Hey, an hour or two,
I'd have had it surrounded.

445
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,600
No doubt.

446
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,700
While Mr. Deadwood here's
working the story,

447
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,400
see if you can feed him some
react quotes.

448
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,800
A generous gift, but your money,

449
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,800
the money you bring me,
I don't need.

450
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,300
Money is money.

451
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,800
What's the difference
who bring it to you?

452
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,600
It's dirty money.

453
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,700
It stinks.

454
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,300
- We ain't in the same business?
- The bills are from the street.

455
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,600
They're dirty, you understand?

456
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,400
Everything runs through Joe.

457
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,800
Everything is clean with Joe.

458
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,900
Ain't a problem.

459
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,200
Good.

460
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,400
Goodbye.

461
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,400
Hey, Bunk. What kind of knot
you say was on that red ribbon?

462
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,600
- The one on the homeless guy's wrist.
- Fuck yourself with your red ribbon.

463
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,900
Just thought of something.

464
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,500
I caught a vagrant months back
had a red ribbon tied around his wrist.

465
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
You remember that?

466
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,100
Hell of a catch, Detective.
Hell of a catch.

467
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,800
Can I see your file?

468
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,400
Homicide?

469
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,200
Nope, just missed him.

470
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Won't be back until about four.

471
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,800
Clean bills?

472
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,700
You mean laundered, right?
I just showed you how.

473
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Nah, nah. He mean clean,

474
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,200
like the money straight out
the bank and shit.

475
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,700
All lookin' nice.

476
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,300
See, people ain't right.
Here you are tryin' to pay a motherfucker,

477
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
an' all he worried about
is what the money look like.

478
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,500
Normally, my fee for this
would be 20 on the dollar.

479
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,400
40,000 to make it look nice.

480
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,500
You need this back today too.

481
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,800
Might ordinarily charge more,

482
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,200
But seeing as how we co-op, no charge.

483
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,100
Speaking of co-op,

484
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,900
tell them niggas that got burnt

485
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm givin' away 50 for a line on Omar's people.

486
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,900
His sister, his me-maw,
some faggy he be with.

487
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,700
All that shit count, you hear me?

488
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,500
I'd let sleeping dogs lie, son.

489
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,000
I know you would, Joe.

490
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
You smart like that.

491
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,500
Yeah. Me?

492
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,700
Anyway, pass that offer on.

493
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,600
Come back for this here in an hour.

494
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,000
That boy want Omar bad.

495
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,100
Man, I ain't giving him
a thing on Omar.

496
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,500
Omar been gone.

497
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,800
Took a lot of bad history with him too.

498
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,600
Why in the hell would I want
that motherfucker back?

499
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,100
How fast you think we were going
on that first drop?

500
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
- 75 an hour.
- That's it?

501
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,400
Felt like I was coming
out of my seat, man.

502
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,300
You always knowing
stuff like that. How?

503
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,000
Over there!

504
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,800
Y'all throwin' some bricks.

505
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,000
Put a little touch on it.

506
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,700
Watch.

507
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,800
Put some backspin on it,
or else it'll bank off the box and not in it.

508
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,600
Hold this.

509
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,200
- So where Fairfax at?
- Northern Virginia.

510
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,500
- How about you?
- I live up Baltimore.

511
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,000
That's so cool.

512
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,800
You two have your own place?

513
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,200
- Yeah, and Bug.
- That's tight.

514
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,100
Madman on the loose, huh?

515
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,400
Three linked cases and counting.

516
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,600
He's killing vagrants, is he?

517
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Don't say I didn't warn you.

518
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,400
Who covers us for the Sun papers
nowadays? Twigg?

519
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,700
Him or this new girl. Alma something.

520
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,900
Baltimore Sun. Gutierrez.

521
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,500
OK. Can I meet you?

522
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,000
Do you know Al Pacino's?

523
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,600
How about half an hour?

524
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,500
OK. See you then.

525
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,700
Good react quote from me
in Metro Write.

526
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Scott, come here.

527
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,000
This quote here -

528
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,400
"Carcetti may be holding the knife,
but Daniels sharpened it for him.

529
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,000
"He's been critical of Burrell
since the election."

530
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,500
Good shit, huh?

531
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,500
Yeah, from a high-ranking
city hall source?

532
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,600
You feel comfortable telling me
where you got that?

533
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,400
Not really, it being a source.

534
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,900
It's a great quote, but if you're gonna
slam somebody anonymously,

535
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,200
I at least have to be sure
that the quote comes from...

536
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,500
Nerese Campbell.

537
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,200
She's not gonna slam the mayor's choice
publicly,

538
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,600
but not-for-attribution, that's her quote.

539
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,500
You got Nerese to say that, huh?

540
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,200
Twigg's not the only guy
who's game around here.

541
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,100
Let Vondas know I ain't mean
no misunderstanding earlier.

542
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,800
How do you know they're connected?

543
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,700
Is there DNA evidence or a signature?

544
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,200
We can't release that yet.

545
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,600
You know, copycats.

546
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,500
So there is a signature.

547
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,400
What?

548
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,100
You're good.

549
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,400
- You're new, right?
- Five months.

550
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,900
I worked at the Sun-Sentinel
in Lauderdale before this.

551
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,000
I've read your stories. They're good.

552
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,500
Bullshit, but thanks.

553
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,100
You're gonna run something right away, right?

554
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,100
We got to get the word out on this.

555
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,200
What kind of name is Alma?

556
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,100
I have a boyfriend, Detective.

557
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,500
Yeah? He bigger than me?

558
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,800
Can I ask you why on the day in question

559
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,300
you were operating the senator's car
when you were detained by city police

560
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,800
with $20,000 in cash?

561
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,000
On advice of my attorney,
I ain't gonna answer that.

562
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,600
Y'all trying to criminate me here.

563
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,400
Mr. Price, you are employed
as a driver for Senator Davis,

564
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,800
earning 30,000 a year,
is that correct?

565
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, so?

566
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,500
Yet it is my understanding

567
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,500
that you are also drawing a $40,000 salary

568
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,400
as the executive director
of the West Baltimore hoops charity

569
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,900
and another 30,000
as the fundraising director

570
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,200
for the senator's day-care initiative.

571
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,900
How are you able to earn three salaries,

572
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,300
working three jobs at the same time, Mr. Price?

573
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
You have a nice day.

574
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,500
Blind motherfucker.

575
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,000
His joint on Collington
on the east side of the street.

576
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,100
If he give up Omar, though,
I want in on that shit.

577
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,600
Nigga put a gun in my face, man.

578
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,300
- Joe know about Butchie?
- Motherfucker, I know about him.

579
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
Joe don't know shit about this here,

580
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,200
and he ain't need to know.

581
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Now where my cheese at, man?

582
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,400
The fuck you been at, nigga?

583
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Wasn't no school today,
so we took Bug to do something. Ain't no thing.

584
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,100
It is when you don't tell no one.

585
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,600
Now I had to come down here
all day long to make sure your shit is straight.

586
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,900
This your corner or what, nigga?

587
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,100
I'm checking now to make sure
shit's right at the end of the day, a'ight?

588
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,100
- Yo, count right?
- Yeah. All straight.

589
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,800
Ain't the point, and you know it.
Chris already heard about this shit.

590
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,700
Nice dolphin, nigga.

591
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,500
Let's go home, man.
I'll deal with this bullshit later.

592
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,200
That's 400 in your own account
down in the islands.

593
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,800
There no hurricane,
department of justice,

594
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,600
or nigga with a gun can tap that.

595
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,800
How I even know it's there?

596
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,800
You check it online any time you like.

597
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,000
On a computer?

598
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,400
- If I can't hold it in my hand...
- A'ight. You got any prior convictions?

599
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,100
No, nothing that rate.

600
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,100
We get you a passport, then.

601
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,000
Take a trip.

602
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,800
Ain't easy civilizing this motherfucker.

603
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
We chose poorly, Gus.

604
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,400
Yeah.

605
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,500
At this rate, there won't
be much to call a newspaper in 10 years.

606
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,300
You know my father
worked over at Armco, right?

607
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,800
And every morning before
he went to work,

608
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,100
he'd sit at the table,
reading the newspaper with a cup of coffee,

609
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,600
and no one could interrupt him for that
15 minutes before he walked out the door.

610
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,600
And I remember watching him, thinking,

611
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,200
"What the hell is so important
about that damn paper?

612
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,300
"I want to be part of that."

613
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,900
Made me want to be a newspaperman.

614
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,600
One day, I was cutting class at Patterson,

615
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,800
and there was this man
on the downtown bus

616
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,800
folding his broadsheet just so.

617
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,700
And the way that man folded that paper

618
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,300
and concentrated on reading those pages

619
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,300
made him look like the smartest
son of a bitch on the bus.

620
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,900
It was just one of those moments.

621
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,500
"If, ever I depart this vale,

622
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,200
"and you ever remember me

623
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,500
"and have thought to please my ghost,

624
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,600
"forgive some sinner,

625
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,600
"and wink your eye at some homely girl."

626
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,000
Fuck Henry Mencken.

627
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
I forgive you, Gus.

628
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,400
Oh, my God.

629
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You see that quote from somebody
about me stabbing Burrell in the back?

630
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,600
That's a damn lie.

631
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,600
So what?

632
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,700
You're going to be named commissioner.

633
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,800
This is good news.
How is this not good news?

634
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,400
Thanks.

635
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Cheap motherfucker.

636
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,500
No, no, see.

637
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,800
If you stack it with the domestic beer,

638
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,900
then I won't know, huh?

639
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,400
Cut a blind man some slack, hear?

640
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,600
Y'all servin'?

641
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,300
If you got some ID on you.

642
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,700
- Who was that?
- Little girl.

643
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,100
Cash is in the register.

644
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,900
Fuck the register, old man.

645
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,400
They all up in your shit.

646
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,600
They going after every damn thing.
Do you hear me?

647
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,200
We going to jail.

648
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,400
Focus, motherfucker, focus!

649
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,900
Look here.

650
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,800
Back in the girdle ads

651
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,200
underneath the story about the...

652
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,000
the school board
approving a name change for PS 114,

653
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,600
it's Jimmy McNulty's ripper.

654
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,500
You know why they call
them homeless, Jimmy?

655
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,900
Because they ain't got a pot to piss in,
and you know why they ain't got a pot?

656
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,100
Because nobody gives a good fuck.

657
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,100
Shake it for another day or two,
and then you're back in the rotation.

658
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,100
You done with this stupid shit?

659
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,400
Who the fuck do you need
to hear it from, Jimmy?

660
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,200
You have to let Burrell know
that this isn't coming from you.

661
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,500
That won't matter.
After what he read today, I'm the threat.

662
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,600
Then you have to tell him
that you won't take the job,

663
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,300
that you don't want his chair.

664
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,800
And he believes me?

665
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,000
The alternative is that
he goes public with what he knows,

666
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,700
whatever he has about the old days.

667
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,600
He sat on it this long.

668
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,300
You said yourself
he'd rather bury that file

669
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,100
than to embarrass the department
on his watch,

670
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,300
but if it's between you and him surviving,

671
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,300
what do you think he'll do then?

672
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,400
How much could even be in that file?

673
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,100
An assets investigation? Some loose talk?

674
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,700
It was so long ago.
Most of those guys have moved on.

675
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,700
He only needs smoke.

676
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,900
He doesn't even need fire
to drag you down, to drag me down.

677
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,700
Everything that we have
worked so hard for.

678
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,300
We've already lost enough.

679
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,800
What other people Omar got?

680
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,500
Cocksucker the one got the trouble.

681
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,700
No need for you to stand tall on it.

682
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,900
It don't have to be messy.

683
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,700
Ain't no other way. I can see that.

684
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
Where I find Omar?

685
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,800
Where Omar at?

686
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,600
You a tough old man.

687
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,000
When word get to Omar,
make sure he hear everything.

688
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,400
We still ain't got no line on the man,

689
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,300
and now he comin' at us.

690
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,200
We gonna change up.
Marlo got to move indoors.

691
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,900
- The rest of us need to live on the run.
- Fucked-up plan, you ask me.

692
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,900
Marlo wants Omar.
What else you need to know?

693
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,800
You making your move on Burrell,
and I don't blame you,

694
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,000
and the thing is, I can help with that.

695
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,800
The ministers, Nerese,
black legislative caucus -

696
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,200
I can bring them around for you.

697
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,500
Feel free.

698
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,000
All I need is some help
with this grand jury nonsense.

699
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,400
You go to Bond, you tell Bond that...

700
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,700
I can't help you with that.

701
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,800
Story's been out all day,
and our phone isn't ringing.

702
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,700
The ministers, Nerese, the caucus,
they're willing to live with Daniels apparently.

703
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,200
Thanks anyway.

704
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,200
Thinking you can cut Clay loose, huh?

705
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,800
Thinking I'm done.

706
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,100
Came to see my account.

707
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,000
Y'all got my money in here?

708
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,900
This mine. Y'all got my money.

709
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,800
What?

710
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,700
Yeah.

711
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,100
So you string together
Barlow's murder and Cole's

712
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,400
unconnected case and yours,
which is natural to begin with...

713
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Instant serial killer,

714
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,900
which I thought would get the brass to begin
kicking out some money to work real cases.

715
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,000
- Like Marlo.
- Like Marlo.

716
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,400
Shit like this actually goes through
your fucking brain?

717
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,400
If you don't want
to listen to your partner, then listen to Lester.

718
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,800
He has all the wisdom you need.

719
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,300
Joke of it is, no one gives a fuck
about a serial killer,

720
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,200
not unless he's carving up
some pretty coed or some shit.

721
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,100
Sun papers put the story
in their back pages.

722
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,600
You fucked up.

723
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,500
Yeah. Tell him.

724
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,900
No. I mean, if you want to do it right,
a straight-up strangle's not enough.

725
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
Not if it's some vagrant.

726
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,800
Sensationalize it.

727
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,700
Give the killer some fucked-up fantasy,

728
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,600
something bad, real bad.

729
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,700
It's got to grip the hearts and minds,

730
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,300
give the people what they want
from a serial killer.

731
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,600
- Lester, what the fuck?
- No. You're onto something.

732
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,500
I only need a few weeks
to pull down Marlo Stanfield.

733
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,400
You fly this mess right,
you can give it to me.

734
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,100
Who gives a damn if we fake
a couple of murders

735
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,500
that we're never gonna solve, huh?

736
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,400
The dead men don't care.

737
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,100
No one cares.

738
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,800
But if it's gonna get the bosses to throw down
enough coin to do police work...

739
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,200
I'm out. I'm out of here.

740
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,300
We got to give your killer a name.

741
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,500
We have to kill again.

742
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,500
Poppy, we've got to
cook one of these one night.

743
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,900
- Yeah, right on.
- Nice little dinner.

744
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,800
Omar, Omar, Omar!

745
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

746
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,600
All right, all right. Here you go.

747
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,800
- Tomorrow, OK?
- Tomorrow.

748
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,800
Hey, 'Naldo, cous' got to find out
where they got Honey Nut, yo,

749
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,600
if they expect us to
call this spit o' land home.
