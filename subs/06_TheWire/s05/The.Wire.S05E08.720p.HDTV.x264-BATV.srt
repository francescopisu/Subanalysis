1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,700
And as you can see
from the locations,

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,300
the killer is working primarily in
the Southern, Central and Southeastern,

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,700
which makes sense given the concentrations
of homeless in those districts.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,900
Vics one and three were killed at night,
two and four had daylight T.O.D.s.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,600
Detective, what about
the missing man, Mr. Butler?

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,400
Is there any lead at all
on his whereabouts?

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,000
No, sir. We...

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,500
we have teletypes with every
police agency in the mid-Atlantic,

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,100
we're also running daily morgue checks
in ten states and the district,

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,600
- But nothing yet.
- Where are we on a profile?

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,500
I've arranged for our people
to travel to Quantico today.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,500
The bureau's been very accommodating.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,100
This is a strange one.
I've heard of people going after street people,

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,100
but it's usually adolescent sadism.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,000
- This sexual thing...
- It is different.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,600
We put it out on ViCAP, and we have
no hits anywhere else in the country.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,100
I mean, I'm all for
a little kinky shit now and then,

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,400
but chewing on a homeless fella?

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,300
You seem to be well grounded
in the case file, detective.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,500
What else do you need?

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, we've developed a rough
list of those adult males

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,400
who were briefly detained
by police near pier five

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,300
soon after the suspect
made his last call.

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,300
We'd like to put some of those
under surveillance.

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,000
They're not suspects but we would
consider them persons of interest.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We've also developed a rough list

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,200
of known adult white homosexual
sex offenders in these three districts.

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,300
And, as we cull that list, we would...

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,700
we'd like to put some of those
under surveillance, too.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,100
- About a dozen men.
- Less, actually.

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,700
We should be able to eliminate many of our
potentials through retroactive investigation.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Do you have your people?

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,100
I've asked the chief of patrol
to detail Sergeant Ellis Carver

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,500
from the Western to Homicide

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,300
for purposes of running
the surveillance element.

36
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,600
Why not a man from one of the districts
where the attacks occurred?

37
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,900
Well, I've worked with Carver on
prolonged investigations in the past,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,300
and his familiarity
with surveillance tactics is relevant.

39
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,400
Also, I would be inclined
to trust his objective assessment

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,200
when choosing surveillance teams.

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,500
Very good. If that works for patrol,
it works for operations.

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
What are we doing to protect people?

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,700
Patrol and tactical are running extra cars
in all three districts

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,700
with special emphasis on posts
where the homeless congregate.

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,700
We have ten undercovers dressed as vagrants
working staggered shifts.

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,800
We're going to need
good undercover cars, as well.

47
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,400
And I'm told that motor pool
expects nothing back

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,200
- From Dickman Street until...
- Whatever you need, detective.

49
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,700
Yes, Mr. Mayor, but we're
being told by Public Works...

50
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
Go to Avis if you have to, Hertz.
I don't give a shit. People are disappearing.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,300
They're dying, for Chrissake.
Just do what you need to do.

52
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,700
The bad news, gentlemen,

53
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,300
is we're actually going to have
to catch this motherfucker.

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,400
The good news is that our mayor
finally needs a police department

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
more than he needs a school system.

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Yo, can I help you?

57
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,600
- I'm looking to work.
- Here?

58
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,100
Yeah, you need anyone?

59
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
- How old are you?
- 18.

60
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,500
A'ight, man, I'm 15.

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,300
I can give you a form to fill out,

62
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,000
but the manager,
he ain't gonna hire no one under 17.

63
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,500
Hey, yo.

64
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,200
You used to run
with the boy Namond, right?

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,600
Yeah, I used to be
on them Fayette corners.

66
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,800
- Oh yeah, man, I remember you.
- Yeah, I just got tired, you know?

67
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
Shit got old.

68
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,200
So, I guess you need to bang
a while longer,

69
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,400
then come back,
see if we got something.

70
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,700
Why me?

71
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Why not somebody from a district where
they caught one of your homeless cases?

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,100
Well, there's a hitch.

73
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
This is some fucked-up McNulty shit.

74
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,300
I don't want me
or any of my guys getting burned.

75
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,100
Look, here's the deal.
Command are throwing more resources at me

76
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,900
than I can use on my homeless stuff.
I got that covered.

77
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,700
But Lester's got
a fresh line on Marlo Stanfield,

78
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,700
and he needs people to run it down.

79
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,400
A fresh line, huh?
He's got a fuckin' wire up is what you mean.

80
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,700
No, there's no wire...

81
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,100
Who the fuck are you kidding?

82
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,400
I handed him a fresh cell number
for Stanfield not two weeks ago.

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Listen, I don't know anything
about any wire.

84
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,100
I'm just saying he's got
a new line on Marlo,

85
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
and he needs people to run it down.

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,700
Bosses stiff-armed him?

87
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,300
Jesus.

88
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,700
Guy drops all those
motherfuckers in the vacants.

89
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,100
Yeah.

90
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,700
So you're throwing people over to Lester,
and paying for it from your case, is that it?

91
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
O.T. out the ass.

92
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,500
- What about the paperwork?
- I'll take care of that.

93
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,800
All the sheets, office reports,
come through me.

94
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,200
All your people got to do
is straight police work.

95
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Daniels gave me a free hand
to pull people from any district.

96
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Just make sure you send me
people who work.

97
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,100
What about cars?

98
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,600
Departmental account
at Enterprise downtown.

99
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,700
Get what you need.

100
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,600
We delay fleet maintenance for Public Works
over the next three months.

101
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,100
We cut snow removal in half
and pray for global warming.

102
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,400
That's enough to avoid any cuts
in school funding for this quarter.

103
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,000
This funds police operations fully, correct?

104
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,900
They're back to where they started.

105
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,500
It's time anyway.
We ducked the teacher layoffs,

106
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,200
and you got the 15 points
on the third-grade M.S.A.s.

107
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,500
But if we don't drop crime
in this quarter and the next,

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,700
you are vulnerable. It's now or never.

109
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,100
Besides, you're getting traction
in this homeless thing.

110
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,500
Governor was on Y.PR Yesterday,
and Steiner laid him out for the state cutbacks.

111
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,700
Health Care For The Homeless have asked
for City Hall's steps tomorrow night.

112
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,900
- Candlelight vigil.
- You said yes, right?

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Norman told 'em they could do it
if I got a chance to say a few choice words.

114
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,400
Speak of the devil.

115
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
I just got off the phone with the Post.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,100
Reporter there wants your comment on a story
he's working about Dobey, down in P.G.,

117
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,600
looking to take you on
in the Democratic primary.

118
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
What? Dobey's getting in?

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,100
Make matters worse, Upshaw's telling people

120
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,500
he might just throw in with said county exec.

121
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,900
Shit, we might have a full-blown
P.G. insurrection on our hands.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,300
- Why would they do that?
- Lots of pissed off black folks down there.

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,500
Lot of grumblin' about
always a bridesmaid, never the bride.

124
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,600
No way can Dobey take the statehouse.

125
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,100
All he's gonna do is make us
spend money we'll need in the general.

126
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,600
When we went a-calling
in P.G. last month, who'd you see?

127
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,600
Steny.

128
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Maloney, Miller, those guys.

129
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,900
White, white and white.

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,300
Not even a cup of coffee with
poor old congressman Upshaw.

131
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,700
I wasn't snubbing the guy.

132
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,300
Folks there are tired
of being taken for granted.

133
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,800
- Fuck, I gotta kiss a ring, don't I?
- More than a ring, actually.

134
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,200
Unlimited O.T?

135
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,600
That's what I'm told.

136
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,900
But you say we might not be working
the homeless cases.

137
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,000
Not all the time.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,700
Major crimes has a drug investigation
that may also need surveillance work.

139
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,500
Shit, who cares what we work?
I need the money.

140
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,400
A'ight then, you'll be working out of homicide.
Report down there to Detective McNulty.

141
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,900
Oh, yeah.

142
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Rented wheels on the back lot.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Fuckin' A!

144
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,600
Ah, man, this is beautiful.

145
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Hell, yeah.

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,700
It's weird shit,
talkin' to a psychopath like that.

147
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,900
I interviewed Dick Cheney once.

148
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,300
What do you think, Gus? Are we hyping this,
or is Templeton writing as it lays?

149
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,500
Police say it's real.

150
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,600
An' those photographs he got sent?
The guy's fucking missing.

151
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,700
I guess we're writing
homeless stories till December?

152
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,400
Why till December?

153
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Pulitzer submissions
run the calendar year.

154
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,700
Anything a newspaper
cares about at Christmas,

155
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,600
they give a fuck about by New Year's.

156
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,800
Homelessness it is there, gents.

157
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,900
Hold on.

158
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,300
Fella in the lobby wants to talk to an editor.

159
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,600
What kind of editor?

160
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,900
The kind that worked on
the story about that homeless vet.

161
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,100
Scott's piece?
Sure they don't want to talk to Scott?

162
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
Says Templeton won't take his calls anymore,

163
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,000
so he walked over here
to talk to somebody else.

164
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Tell him someone's coming down.

165
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,700
That all he say?

166
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,200
Just walked up and said he got Savino.

167
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,700
Said he gonna get more of our muscle

168
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,800
if Marlo don't come
to the street and step to him.

169
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,300
Good thing he didn't make me
from Monk's apartment.

170
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,700
I kept on lookin' away
from the motherfucker,

171
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,400
hopin' he ain't remember me.

172
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,200
He was limpin' bad, too.

173
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,100
He had a crutch.

174
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,800
Wasn't lyin' about Savino, was he?

175
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,500
Everybody sayin'
Omar's on this warpath.

176
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,200
Heard he got a stash house last week.
Everybody's...

177
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,900
Everybody need to shut the fuck up.

178
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,500
Look, I'm just sayin', if Marlo was all that
over June Bug callin' him a name,

179
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,100
so that y'all dropped June and his whole family,
then what the fuck?

180
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,900
Omar out there
callin' 'em bitches every damn day.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,900
Fuck Omar.

182
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,100
What, ya think we ain't gonna
catch this dicksucker?

183
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
This nigger gonna get got.

184
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,600
Y'all gonna tell Marlo?

185
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
We tell him, we don't tell him.

186
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,000
Man got enough on his plate.

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,800
Young on some different opinion shit there.

188
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,200
I dunno. If I was Marlo...

189
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Motherfucker, you ain't.

190
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,200
Raspberry?

191
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Wild strawberry.

192
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,500
- What?
- Nothing, man.

193
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,400
C'mon, man, we gotta get across town.

194
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,600
This bitch is gonna tell you
where there's construction,

195
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,200
gonna tell you left, gonna tell you right.

196
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Pretty much blow you if you ask nice.

197
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,400
And look.

198
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,100
Yo, you gotta play some old school
R'n'B shit on that, man.

199
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,100
New car, O.T.
This fuckin' detail, man.

200
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,200
I hope we never catch
this goofy motherfucker.

201
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,000
Hey, officers. Lookee here.

202
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,500
You got two young bucks
round the corner.

203
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,100
One in the white tee,
the other guy a throwback on.

204
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,100
One got the jump in his dip
and the one with a car tire, ya feel me?

205
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,000
- Round the corner?
- Fulton and Lex.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,700
- A'ight.
- Thanks, man.

207
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah.

208
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,900
Mr. Hanning?
It's an honour for me to meet you, sir.

209
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,300
- Who are you?
- My name's Gus Haynes.

210
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,000
- I edited the story you're featured in.
- Then you're a fucking liar.

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Omar. It's Omar, yo!

212
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
Gotta giddy up an' go, dawg.

213
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,500
Get!

214
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,100
One...

215
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,500
Two...

216
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,100
Three...

217
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,000
Four.

218
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Ya see there? Omar know what one it is.

219
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,700
Look like all your muscle
done up and indisposed now.

220
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,100
So you might as well go ahead
and drop it out, ya feel me?

221
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,800
I'm obliged to walk up in there now.

222
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,900
You workin' a Stanfield corner,

223
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,800
which means you workin'
for a straight-up punk.

224
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,300
Ya feel me?

225
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,300
I'm out here in these streets every day.

226
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,600
Me an' my lonesome.

227
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,800
An' where he at?

228
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Yo, y'all put it in his ear.

229
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,800
Marlo Stanfield is not a man for this town.
You dig?

230
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah.

231
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,600
Yeah, eight men, four cars.

232
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,400
Ellis briefed 'em.
They know what's what.

233
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,800
No, they're just happy for the O.T.
Don't worry, Lester.

234
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,300
Just sign the motherfucker
and shut the fuck up.

235
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,900
Gimme.

236
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
We ready?
'Cause you gotta figure an extra hour

237
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
to get round the Capital
Beltway this time of day.

238
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,800
You ever done an FBI profile before?

239
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,700
- Once.
- How'd it go?

240
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,400
They take your file, read you back
some shit you already know.

241
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,600
- Then why do it?
- So that we can say we did.

242
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Need a pack of Newport. Soft pack.

243
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Let me get one of them, too.

244
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,300
Don't shoot!

245
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Lowenthal. Where the fuck is he?

246
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,000
He's...

247
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,700
There you go, Bunk.

248
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,000
Request for a DNA comparison.
Case 06H-271.

249
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Latent trace to obtained samples.

250
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,600
And it's a part of the serial killer thing.
It's now a part of that investigation.

251
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,700
That's different.
If it's connected to that investigation...

252
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,300
It is, here.

253
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,900
- It's in my notes.
- I never said I was in a firefight.

254
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,800
- Not on that day.
- Sorry, but you did.

255
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,200
I told you the lead vehicle took a hit
from an elevated I.E.D.

256
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,400
Killed the 50 gunner,
and blew the hands off the driver.

257
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,600
That's it. That's enough, man.

258
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,500
- Why make the rest of that shit up?
- I didn't make anything up.

259
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
- We sat there having coffee.
- Coffee.

260
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,000
- Having donuts and coffee. And you said...
- What I say?

261
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,700
- Can I finish?
- I don't know.

262
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,900
I'm hearing about coffee and donuts,
I'm not hearing...

263
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If you're not going to let me
tell my side of the story...

264
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,400
A lie ain't a side of the story, it's just a lie.

265
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,300
- I don't have to listen to this.
- OK. Scott, let's just relax here.

266
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,700
Both you gentlemen,
let's just step back here, please?

267
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,100
Now, Mr. Hanning, forgive me,
but do you drink much?

268
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,800
You think I fucking sleep
under a bridge sober?

269
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,100
Sometimes when I have a few,
and I do like to have a few,

270
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,300
I tend to be a little more descriptive
in the telling of a tale.

271
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,100
I know what it is to tell a story.
I've told plenty in my time.

272
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,800
But there's some things that happen,
you don't ever fuck with them.

273
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,000
I believe you, Mr. Hanning.

274
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,400
I believe that you believe.

275
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,900
That you believe you told me one thing.

276
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,400
But, sir, with all due respect and gratitude,

277
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
for you and the service
you gave to this country,

278
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
you didn't tell me that thing.

279
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,600
You told me something else.
I wrote what Mr. Hanning told me.

280
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,900
- Mr. Hanning, I know you...
- What if one of the guys,

281
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,500
what if a Marine who was there,
he reads that shit that you made up?

282
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,500
That's why I come down here today.
What if one of the guys sees that?

283
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,400
Man, get him outta my face.

284
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,000
Guy's just off. Off in general,
off his meds. I don't know, but off.

285
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,200
- A lot of them are, you know. I hate to say it...
- He puts on a good front.

286
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,400
We'll call the Marines,
get a service record,

287
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
reach out to some people in his unit,
find out what happened that day outside of...

288
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,700
- What was it? Fallujah?
- Yeah.

289
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,500
If it went down
the way you said, we'll let it be.

290
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,200
But if not, we'll chalk it up
as a misunderstanding.

291
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,800
But misunderstanding or no,

292
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,500
we will write a correction
if what we printed wasn't accurate.

293
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
And we didn't have coffee.

294
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,600
We had chocolate milk.

295
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,900
You miss what you had, though?

296
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,100
I still got too much dog in me
to be settled like that.

297
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,100
It wasn't Cheryl. It was me.

298
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,400
Thing is, is I found a connect
with the boy, you know?

299
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,600
That part of it feels right to me.

300
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,300
Kids are great.

301
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,800
Yeah.

302
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,200
What about you and Beadie?
You were quiet there for a time.

303
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,300
Yeah. Bunk once told me
I'm no good for people.

304
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,600
Everyone around me, he said.

305
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,600
- Was he drunk?
- Yeah. But still.

306
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,700
- Omar be dead. I'm tellin' you.
- Heard that before.

307
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,500
- For real.
- You see him?

308
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,600
Seen his dead ass
layin' right up in there.

309
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,200
Boy up on the corner say
he try to rob them Koreans and got killed.

310
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You shoulda let me give him the years, Bunk.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He'd have been better off.

312
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,500
Thanks for calling.

313
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,800
Figured you'd wanna see this,
you being so tight with the mope.

314
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,500
Professional job here.

315
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,000
No. I thought so at first,
but the Korean broad we sent downtown

316
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,500
said he got done in by
a short little fella with a big gun.

317
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Shit, walked in an' lit his ass up.

318
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
How short?

319
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,900
The boy robbed him?

320
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,500
Counter lady said the hoppers
all ran up in here for souvenirs.

321
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,300
Took his shotty and his semiauto too.
Ran all through his pockets.

322
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,000
Be my guest.

323
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Back on the hunt, were you?

324
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,000
Young'un say he out here with no car,
walkin' with a limp an' shit.

325
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,200
He gonna fall, Chris. You gonna see.

326
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,300
- Marlo need a meet.
- For real?

327
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,400
Leander, where we at?

328
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,600
Still setting this up.
Why, did you catch another one?

329
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
6:55 and 34.

330
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,900
We're not on anybody yet,
so we'll pick it up in the morning.

331
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,000
All right, later.

332
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,000
OK. Doze, Truck, you're on Monk Metcalf.

333
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,300
Bobby, you and Brian are on Chris Partlow.
He usually rides with Snoop Pearson,

334
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,000
but if they split, Karen and Tony
will pick up on her.

335
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,600
Marcus, Angela. You're the backup unit
when we need one.

336
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,500
- You're gonna do Stanfield?
- Yeah.

337
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,500
All their business is face-to-face,
and they meet in the open several times a day.

338
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,300
We're just trying to find
the pattern in the meets.

339
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,700
Where do we pick these guys up?

340
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Stanfield has every corner
between MLK and Monroe,

341
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,900
and they start shaping it up
around 11 or so, OK?

342
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,900
That's when the re-up orders
start coming in,

343
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,200
that's when you'll start to see
Monk making the rounds.

344
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Most mornings, Marlo starts off
with a parley or two

345
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,300
on the playground
between Mosher and Lanvale.

346
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Now, these guys
seem to be wholesaling, too.

347
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,800
Other dealers, players,

348
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,000
anyone who wants to get with him
gets him there, OK?

349
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,200
Chris and Snoop are usually with him.

350
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,100
And McNulty's got you
covered for paperwork.

351
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
None of what we do here
is necessary for court,

352
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,900
so rest easy on that, all right?

353
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
So we stage here tomorrow at nine.

354
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,900
No sign of him, but I ain't on nothin' else
for as long as it take.

355
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,900
You ain't heard? Omar bagged up.

356
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,000
Shit, I thought y'all was gonna tell me.

357
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,000
I just got the word myself from Monk.

358
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
- Who got him?
- Some young boy.

359
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,700
- Who?
- Ain't heard a name.

360
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,500
Don't even know if there was a why.

361
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,800
Hopper wanna hear a pop,
see the damage, ya know?

362
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,400
Yeah. That shit is gone.

363
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,000
We done with this next resupply,

364
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,000
you an' me got some time
in AC coming to us, don't we?

365
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,200
Forensically, this guy is all over the map.

366
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,900
Sexual to a point, but inhibited.

367
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,700
Nocturnal on some, diurnal on the others.

368
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,100
And the notion of targeting
the homeless, to begin with?

369
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,000
We've only seen that a couple of times,

370
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,700
but in those instances,
it's been someone within that cohort.

371
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,100
And they're not usually carrying cellphones
and calling newspapers.

372
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,300
You caught a strange one here.

373
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,400
Detectives. Don't get up.

374
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,000
Arthur Toland,
deputy director of the unit.

375
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,700
Just wanted to drop by and make sure
we're progressing your case.

376
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,300
Yeah. Great. Thanks.

377
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,700
You might recognize
the director from television.

378
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,400
- He's done all of them.
- You know those news shows.

379
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
Always want a talking head
when a case comes up.

380
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,000
Greta van Susteren,
Nancy Grace, Chris Matthews,

381
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,700
that fella with the big forehead,
whatshisname?

382
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,700
- Larry King?
- Yeah.

383
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,300
What the hell. It's a chance
to get the word out for the bureau.

384
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,100
And I sell some books.

385
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,100
"Human Hunters - The Rise
of the American Serial Killer"?

386
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,600
They've used a lot of my stuff
on those CSI shows.

387
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
I've consulted for them.

388
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,800
You haven't heard...

389
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,100
So, how long you been doing
death investigations?

390
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,500
Eight years.

391
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,000
We don't see a lot
of serial stuff, actually.

392
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,100
Drug murders.
A street robbery every now and then.

393
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,700
300 or so a year.

394
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,100
Well, you've got a serial case now,
so, I'll leave you to it.

395
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Good hunting.

396
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,800
Art was lead investigator
on the Unabomber thing.

397
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,400
That was, like, 16 years, right?

398
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,100
Yeah.

399
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,300
Then his brother ratted him out?

400
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,700
Homeless is in at 30 inches.

401
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,400
It's good shit there.

402
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,800
No, really. There was a real sense of place,
especially under the Hanover Bridge

403
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,800
when the police came up
under there to give the warning.

404
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,800
Drama in small moments like that.

405
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,100
- Truth is, I had a tour guide.
- Yeah?

406
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,200
Yeah, fella I met at a soup kitchen.

407
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,700
Volunteer there. Ex-addict.

408
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,400
There's something about this guy.
I mean, he's just...

409
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,500
I don't know, the more he talked, the more I felt
like it was him I really wanted to write about.

410
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,300
- Yeah?
- But he's not homeless.

411
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,700
I don't have any peg for him.
Shit, I don't know what the story is.

412
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,100
- He's got a name?
- Reginald Cousins.

413
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,300
Volunteers at a soup kitchen.
What's he do for money?

414
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,100
Sells the Baltimore Sun
every morning out by Light Street.

415
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,100
- Shit. Not exactly a growth industry.
- He lives in his sister's basement.

416
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,300
She'll take a plate down to him now and then
but won't let him upstairs.

417
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,900
- Spend some time with him.
- What about the homeless coverage?

418
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,100
You're covered. Take a couple weeks,
see what you see. A'ight?

419
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,800
Late entries from the copshop.
Two dead in a Charles county house fire,

420
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,700
- And a homicide from the city.
- Ettlin, what do we got room for?

421
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,900
We're shy one brief in the metro digest.

422
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,900
Four paragraphs'll fill.

423
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,600
What's the homicide?

424
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,200
A 34-year-old black male
shot dead in West Baltimore grocery.

425
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,000
Juvenile suspect is being sought.

426
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Write up the fire.
Scratch the murder, we don't have room.

427
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,900
So what we conclude
from a behavioral analysis

428
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,100
of the known forensics is the following:

429
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,600
The suspect is likely a white male,
in his late 20s to late 30s.

430
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,400
He likely is not a college graduate,

431
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,800
but feels nonetheless superior
to those with advanced education,

432
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,600
and he is likely employed
in a bureaucratic entity,

433
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,400
possibly civil service
or quasi-public service,

434
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,400
from which he feels alienated.
He has a problem with authority

435
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,700
and a deep-seated resentment
of those who he feels

436
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,800
have impeded his progress professionally.
The minimized sexual activity suggests

437
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,900
that this is not a primary motive for the killings.

438
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,100
In fact, the bite marks in the last found victim
lacking the DNA of saliva,

439
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,100
indicate to us
possible post-mortem staging.

440
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,500
The suspect has trouble
with lasting relationships

441
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,200
and is possibly
a high-functioning alcoholic,

442
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,700
with alcohol being utilized as a trigger
in the commission of these crimes.

443
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,500
His resentment of the homeless
may stem from a personal relationship

444
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,800
with someone in that cohort,
or his victimization of vagrants

445
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,100
might merely present
an opportunity for him

446
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,100
to assert his superiority
and intellectual prowess.

447
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,400
If you get more, fax it down,
and we can update the profile.

448
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,600
Thanks for everything.

449
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Thanks.

450
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,000
So, what do you think?

451
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,700
They're in the ballpark.

452
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,900
Congressman, I'll do whatever it takes
to make things right between us,

453
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,100
but running Dobey in the primary
is only gonna hurt everybody.

454
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,800
- You mean hurt you.
- I'm the only viable candidate

455
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,400
to beat that Republican prick,
and I know you know that.

456
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,700
At the end of the day,
isn't that what it's all about?

457
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,900
Do not waste your breath

458
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,500
tellin' me what I already know
about our tax-cutting,

459
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,000
dump-it-on-the-counties,
ass-kiss-every-business-interest governor.

460
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,300
P.G. county has 100 murders a year,

461
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,700
school system held together
with spit and glue,

462
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,000
and worse rush-hour traffic than Atlanta.

463
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,300
And the man in Annapolis
wouldn't piss on us if we were on fire.

464
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,000
- Don't hold back, congressman.
- I'm tired of these fuckin' Republicans.

465
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,400
I fucked up, not coming to see you earlier. But
between the votes I can pull out of Baltimore,

466
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,600
Montgomery and your county,
I am gonna take the statehouse.

467
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,300
And then the frustration
that you feel is gonna end.

468
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,700
I know you've heard this
from every other son of a bitch,

469
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,700
but congressman,
I give you my word.

470
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,700
You know, you're right.
I have heard that before.

471
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
You wanna keep P.G. county in your camp,

472
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,000
it's gonna cost you
a lot more than your word.

473
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,300
Fuck.

474
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
You rang?

475
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,700
Funny case you got here.

476
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,700
Your victim had an address.

477
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,800
A home. Paid rent, so we assume.
Maybe even a mortgage.

478
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,600
But not homeless, in any case.
No strangulation, no red ribbon.

479
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,400
A lesser man might get pissy
because you jumped the line, Bunk.

480
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,100
Me?

481
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,100
I remember Partlow's name
from all those cases last year.

482
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,300
- Congrats.
- Yeah.

483
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,500
But...

484
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,700
don't fuck with me like this again.

485
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah.

486
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,000
He lied on his mortgage application, huh?

487
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,400
- We have a name for that over here.
- The headshot. I know.

488
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,900
On a mortgage charge,
he's certain to plead out.

489
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,200
- Billy doesn't plead his clients.
- Then he's looking at a lot of years.

490
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,100
A federal jury is a very different animal
than what they see on Calvert Street.

491
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
I tried to tell him that.

492
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,100
Yeah, but Mr. Bond
wanted to try this himself,

493
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,600
see if he couldn't grandstand
his way to City Hall.

494
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,900
Well, you have the headshot, detective,
but no gun with which to fire it.

495
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,600
- We can't take this case.
- It's all on paper.

496
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,200
You had canceled cheques.
You had bank accounts.

497
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
You had his bag man on the stand.

498
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
We had a city jury.

499
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,700
We've been gathering string on Clay Davis
for six years, detective.

500
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,000
Six years, we've had a file open
on that shakedown artist.

501
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,900
And now, after you
city sons of bitches

502
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,600
have managed, in a single week,
to transform Clay fucking Davis

503
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,600
into Martin Luther King Jr.,
you now come to me with this,

504
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,000
which you had in your
back pocket all along,

505
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,700
looking for the federal jury of mostly
white faces to remedy the problem?

506
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Well...

507
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,600
I'm sorry.

508
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,600
Thank you.

509
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,900
What's this?

510
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,700
From the pocket of a dead stick-up boy.

511
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,700
Omar Little.

512
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,300
Omar? Dead?

513
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,700
You stop readin' the 24s?
Killed yesterday at a grocery.

514
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,000
- Slow to the draw, he was.
- No shit.

515
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,700
One to the back of the head.
Norris and Crutchfield caught it.

516
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,900
They're looking for a juvenile.
He was hunting Stanfield and crew.

517
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
- And this was on him?
- Yep.

518
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Thought of you and Lester
when I saw it.

519
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,500
Payback for you
getting me back some great lab.

520
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,800
Positive DNA on Chris Partlow.

521
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,500
An alley beating,
not one of the ones in the vacants.

522
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,900
Motherfucker. You have all kinds
of news today, don't you?

523
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,700
Going for a warrant right now.

524
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,100
Hey, can you wait to serve it?

525
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,200
- We're right at the edge, Bunk.
- How long?

526
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,700
'Cause this is an honest
fuckin' murder prosecution.

527
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,200
I'll talk to Lester. Congrats.

528
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,500
Yeah. No shuckin', no jivin'. Just good
ol' police work. How about that, Jimmy?

529
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,700
Without my bullshit,
you're still waiting on lab work.

530
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,800
Listen, Jimmy, the Conaway
shooting from Westport?

531
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,500
The transvestite? I go to ViCAP,
there's another one just like it,

532
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,500
down in Carolina, four months ago.

533
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,500
For a road car and two nights in a hotel,
I can put this down.

534
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,000
What are you talking about?
Yours is a 9mm, this one's a .32.

535
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,300
Yours was a bar pick-up,
this one's a home invasion.

536
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,600
Still worth checking out.

537
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,500
I don't see it. Sorry.

538
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,400
You're gonna make me
spit it out, aren't you?

539
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,900
You ever played Hilton Head?

540
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,400
I get a call from my
brother-in-law a few days ago.

541
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,500
He managed to swing
a tee-time for this weekend.

542
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,100
Jimmy, I'm going, goddammit.

543
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
The fuck do I care? Go.

544
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,500
You know, this is some
real cute shit you're pulling here.

545
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Taking the detail money and doling it around
like a priest passing wafers.

546
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,400
I don't know what you're up to but I know this.

547
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,600
If someone picked up a phone around here,
your shit is critically fucked.

548
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,300
Two nights and a road car.

549
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,200
Leander, I'm showing
10:55 and 34 from Marlo's phone.

550
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,300
Anybody on the move?

551
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,400
I got him coming eastbound
on Baltimore Street at Calhoun.

552
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,700
- Who's on Monk?
- Wait one.

553
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,000
23-06 to 23-11. Where you at, man?

554
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
23-11. Southbound MLK,
approaching route 40.

555
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,300
That's the meet, Lester.
Monk and Marlo on the westside. We on it.

556
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,000
Corner of Argyle and Dolphin.

557
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Monk and Marlo, as expected.

558
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,300
Now I got 4:40 and 35
coming into Marlo's phone.

559
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,600
Yeah, he's scoping that, Lester.

560
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,400
We know it ain't Monk callin'.

561
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,200
23-06 to 23-12.

562
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,100
- Who do you have eyes on?
- Both my subjects.

563
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,200
- They go to their cellphones?
- Negative.

564
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,100
- They on the move?
- Negative.

565
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,400
- 23-14, nothing moving either.
- No one else calling or moving.

566
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,900
Means we got somebody else
on this network we don't yet know.

567
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Oh, boy.

568
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,700
- Hey, man, let me give you a hand.
- All right, you ready?

569
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
I don't have no money in the moment,

570
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,700
but I'll be going down
to the scales in a hour or two.

571
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,700
You help me out,
I'll go ten for your trouble.

572
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,200
Got a rag for that behind you.

573
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,500
Junk! Junkman!

574
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,500
Where the fuck are you going?

575
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,500
I gotta see Lester about...

576
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,900
What's all that?

577
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,800
Parole info
on known sex offenders for five zip codes.

578
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,600
I've also got background
info on my desk

579
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,200
for everyone we picked up
at pier five with a cellphone.

580
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,900
- You're actually gonna...
- Compare the FBI profile

581
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,500
with every person of interest I can find?
Hell yeah, somebody's gotta.

582
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,700
- Come here.
- The fuck are you doin'?

583
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,100
Maurice Dobey? For governor?
Of my state?

584
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,300
Shit.

585
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,600
That's some cynical politics, right there.

586
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,500
Playin' like you gonna run a man you know
can't win to scare people into payin' off.

587
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,200
Dobey could bloody you up, Tommy.
In Baltimore and P.G. both.

588
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,600
Playin' that race card. Shameful.

589
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,700
What does Upshaw want
to stay out of the race?

590
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,400
- Too much.
- Are you going to pay?

591
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,600
Let's just say I'm in negotiations.

592
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,900
I'll do everything I can to make sure
this insurrection doesn't spread.

593
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,500
Wonderful!
And how much is the loyal support

594
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,200
of the Eastside Democratic Coalition
going to cost me?

595
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,600
Only an endorsement, given that
this man here is still standing,

596
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,900
I don't believe that Rupert Bond is going
to find his way into this office. Do you?

597
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,100
And for my endorsement,
you will return the favour

598
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,000
and ignore our friends
in Prince George's.

599
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,400
And the loyalty of the westside
is going to cost me what exactly?

600
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,700
Nothin' big. You got three seats
comin' open on the liquor board.

601
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,200
- You get one seat.
- Two an' you have me

602
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,500
raisin' money for you in the primary.

603
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,100
Sold. And it scares me
to think of the damage you can do

604
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,500
with two votes on the liquor board.

605
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,200
- It ain't right.
- No...

606
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,400
- It just is.
- No, I mean, you can't do this.

607
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,000
We're doing it.
Whatever they give us to work the bullshit,

608
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,300
I throw to Lester,
or Crutchfield or Norris,

609
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,600
anyone else who has a case
that ought to be solved.

610
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,100
It's bad enough I wasted your day
yesterday going to Quantico.

611
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,800
I can't stand to see you wasting more time.
You should be working your home invasion.

612
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,300
- Jimmy, you can't do this.
- A couple days more,

613
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,000
and Lester gets his best shot at Marlo.

614
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,800
After that, we'll never hear from
the red-ribbon killer again.

615
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,400
The bosses will lose interest,
I'll pretend to run out a little more string,

616
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,900
and then it goes right back
to the admin office. No harm, no foul.

617
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,600
Whatever you need, Kima,
to work your triple

618
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
or any other case that matters to you.

619
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,900
Manpower, O.T., lab work, cars.

620
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,300
Just let me know.

621
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,800
I gotta go.

622
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Man! Junk!

623
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,600
Old papers!

624
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,000
Sheet metal!

625
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,200
Junkman! Junk!

626
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,300
Cardboard.

627
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,200
- Newspapers.
- Hey, Bug, up here.

628
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,700
Whoa, boy.

629
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,300
I get you that ten tomorrow
and if you're lookin' for work,

630
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,000
I got what needs liftin'.

631
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,500
You know the stable on Bruce Street?
Be there before nine.

632
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,200
Dag, Duke, you a-rabbin' now?

633
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,300
I'm showing 5:15 and 34 seconds.

634
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,700
I'm up Park Heights
but I lost him just past the park.

635
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,600
MTA bus clipped the kerb
and it knocked down a utility pole.

636
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,300
By the time I detoured, he slipped me.

637
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,900
Well, let me know.

638
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,500
Big news.

639
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,900
Bunk has a murder warrant
on Chris Partlow.

640
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,500
- The hell you say.
- Not one from the vacants.

641
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,900
DNA match on an alley beating.

642
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,400
He lets this go now,
these guys are gonna go to ground.

643
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,200
We're right at the edge
of something here.

644
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,500
He's giving us a couple of days.

645
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,600
He owes me.
I expedited his lab work for it.

646
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,500
- And Omar Little? Stick up boy?
- What about him?

647
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,000
Caught one in a Korean joint over westside.

648
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,900
Bunk pulled that out of his pocket.
Mean anything at all to us?

649
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,300
Looks like he was after Marlo's crew.

650
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,600
Cheese. Cheese Wagstaff?

651
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,700
In addition to their corners,
these guys are wholesaling all over town,

652
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,000
so I figured Cheese
was just one of many.

653
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,900
The note reads like Omar
had him under Marlo's wing.

654
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,400
A lieutenant, at least. Anyway, I gotta go,

655
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,500
do more pretending
for the rest of the city.

656
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,200
Oh, by the way, I... I told Greggs.

657
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,600
McNulty, how many more people...

658
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,800
She was about to jump into
the serial murders.

659
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,700
- I couldn't stand to spin her like that.
- How'd she take it?

660
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,100
23-06 to any 23 sequence.
Trying to reconnect with my subject.

661
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,800
- Anyone who can assist?
- 23-15 to 23-06.

662
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,500
I'm in the 2800 block,
Edgecombe Circle South,

663
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,700
sitting on the female subject.
Maybe that's the other end of your meet.

664
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,000
Edgecombe Circle? Where's that 20?

665
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,300
- It runs off Pall Mall.
- Where's Pall Mall?

666
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,900
- I'm not too good up in the northwest.
- Between Pimlico...

667
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,900
Never mind, I got a map book.

668
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,400
OK, see what we got here.

669
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,300
Map 34, grid E3.

670
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,300
Three.

671
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,600
- Whaddya got?
- What'd that last clock show?

672
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,600
And these people
that I share the stage with tonight

673
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,000
are here as representatives
of the hundreds,

674
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,300
no, the thousands of citizens
without shelter,

675
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,200
without protection, in this city tonight.

676
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Why does this have to be?

677
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,400
Certainly, the last seven years

678
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,400
have not brought the same levels
of federal commitment

679
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,900
to American cities as from
previous administrations.

680
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,400
And certainly, our governor has
in the last year placed severe restrictions

681
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,700
on whatever stopgap state programs
were in place.

682
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,300
And what little remained
of our so-called safety net

683
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,900
was simply shredded,

684
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,400
and more and more
of our fellow citizens

685
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,600
found themselves living life
at the broken edges, in the street.

686
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,100
Well, I say that this is not only tragic,
it is unforgivable!

687
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,000
And I am here to say
that no longer can these people

688
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,700
with whom I share this stage tonight
be invisible,

689
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,900
just as all of those
without shelter in this city,

690
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,300
in this country,
can no longer be invisible to us.

691
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,000
And it is regrettable
that it has taken the actions

692
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,400
of a remorseless predator
to make us reflect.

693
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,600
But we in Baltimore
have been tested,

694
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,700
and we have been taught
that all of our citizens

695
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,300
deserve the full protection of the law,

696
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,700
and the full support of the community.

697
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,100
And we are saying
to this senseless killer,

698
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,600
and to all the other ills that prey on
those without shelter in our city,

699
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,400
not tonight can you prey on them.

700
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,100
And not tomorrow. Not any longer.

701
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,400
We will protect you!

702
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,100
Thank you.

703
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,500
She asked you keep that one stirred.

704
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,800
You were on my thing, right?

705
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,500
I guess I owe you a drink on that.
What's your poison?

706
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm OK, senator,
thank you very much.

707
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,200
Obonda, huh? That's a good one.

708
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,500
You know, that was mostly my evidence
you beat back there, right?

709
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,200
- You think you could do that again?
- Excuse me?

710
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,800
Except this time,
the jury's a federal one.

711
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,900
Say, nine white, three black.

712
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,400
Time for you to tip on out, detective.

713
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,500
Bank records on that mortgage application

714
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,500
you made on the Calvert county
property years back.

715
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,800
Now, why don't you
take that back to Billy Murphy?

716
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,100
Ask your attorney
what you're exposed to.

717
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:55,700
At this point, this is just between
us two gentlemen here, senator.

718
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,200
And no one else till I make it so.

719
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,400
What? You tryin' to sell a case back to me?
Motherfucker, if you don't get...

720
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,100
I don't get paid like that.

721
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,400
I get paid when I come back
in a couple nights time with questions

722
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,400
and you, sir, have answers. Or my next call
will be to the US Attorney's office,

723
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,100
and we will go again.
But for real.

724
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,700
You can keep that copy. Ma'am.

725
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,100
Just to let you know, before
the fireworks start, I'm spiking this lead.

726
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,500
- But you got my back?
- As best I can.

727
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,400
I'm spiking your lead.

728
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,100
I'm not running a story
about a public gathering,

729
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,200
a candlelight vigil at City Hall, in fact,

730
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,800
where the lead anecdote and quote
is from an unnamed homeless woman.

731
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,900
She doesn't want to be known as homeless.
I explained that.

732
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,600
Scott, there were hundreds
of homeless down there tonight.

733
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,200
People who voluntarily
attended this event.

734
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,100
And I'd guess that any number of them
would've let you put their names in the paper.

735
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,800
But her story is great.
Look at that quote.

736
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,300
It's a perfect quote.
Best quote I could ever ask for.

737
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,600
That's my concern at this point.

738
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,100
Jesus Christ.

739
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,400
To hell with you
if you think I made it up.

740
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,200
We have a standard that we follow here.
And I'm gonna follow it.

741
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,100
Here it comes, Gus.

742
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,600
Yep.

743
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,100
Gus, you're retopping
Scott's vigil copy?

744
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,300
- I am.
- But I thought...

745
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,500
Anonymous attribution in a public setting.
There's no need for it.

746
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,300
- Gus, let's discuss this.
- Actually, I did discuss it

747
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,600
with the metro editor, and he agrees.

748
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,900
Now, the story's on the copy desk,

749
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and as a line editor working this story,
I feel I've done my job.

750
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,300
Now, you as the M.E.,
if you want to go another way,

751
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,800
you pull the story back and re-edit.

752
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,500
But we have a sourcing policy here,
and I know it,

753
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,800
and I do not feel comfortable
bending the rules in this instance.

754
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,300
Night.

755
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,800
Yeah?

756
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,700
McNulty, it's Christeson.

757
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,500
Listen, my case is down
an' I wanted to thank you.

758
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,300
I couldn't have done it otherwise.

759
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,600
No problem.

760
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,100
- It went great.
- Kids asleep?

761
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,300
Yeah, but they saw you on W.B.A.L.

762
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,100
Anna said your hair looked funny.

763
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,200
Well, just so long as she was impressed.

764
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,700
C.N.N. Was there.

765
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,400
I wonder if they'll cycle
any coverage through tonight.

766
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,800
- A good day for hizzoner, huh?
- I don't know.

767
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,100
Nerese shook me down
for a mayoral endorsement,

768
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,100
and Clay Davis,
back from the grave,

769
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,200
took a couple of liquor board seats.

770
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,500
Just so as they won't join in
Upshaw's war party in Prince George's.

771
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,800
You're gonna endorse Nerese?
You told me you prefer Bond.

772
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,900
I do, but this thing with Upshaw...

773
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,900
Shit, I might even have to give him a bump
just to calm him down.

774
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,800
God. What's he asking?

775
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,500
- There. Look.
- What's Upshaw asking?

776
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,700
Half of any extra school
or anti-crime money

777
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,000
I get outta the legislature for Baltimore
would go to P.G. county.

778
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,900
You take that deal
and Baltimore's out

779
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,400
half of what you want to bring
back to the city schools.

780
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,600
Yeah, but if I don't win, Jen,
I bring back exactly nothing.

781
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,400
Look.

782
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
And we are saying
to this senseless killer,

783
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,400
and to all the other ills...

784
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,600
Go on. Straight to bed.

785
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,800
Hey, kiddo.

786
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,000
Where'd you go to?

787
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,600
None of your business really, Jimmy.

788
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,500
And next time, I'm not going anywhere.

789
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,200
Next time, you're gonna be out on your ass,
because that's my fucking house.

790
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,600
That's police work, son.

791
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,100
I pull the A.D.C. Book to find a location,

792
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,000
and I'm on the same page number
as the second hand.

793
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,900
And I remember we had
a lotta clocks with 34 seconds.

794
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,400
That's the page for West Baltimore.

795
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,400
Right. Now, the second hand
is always the map page.

796
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,400
Longitude, A-through-K, is the hour,

797
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,100
and for the latitude,
they go by five-minute intervals.

798
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,600
Now they know
the meeting spot in advance,

799
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,300
and they code it by the grid square.

800
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,800
But if the clock
has nothing to do with time,

801
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,700
how do they know when to meet?

802
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,900
Everything's less than
a half hour of driving, even in traffic.

803
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,600
My guess is that the standing logic

804
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,200
is that they meet within an hour or so.

805
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You know what else makes sense?

806
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,100
This clock face when no one
was on the move?

807
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,700
The times are all at 35 seconds.

808
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,500
And that's the page for East Bawlmer.

809
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,500
- Cheese.
- Cheese Wagstaff?

810
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,100
Marlo's wholesaling westside through Monk,
and eastside with Cheese.

811
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,800
- He's got the whole goddamn city.
- How do we know it's Cheese?

812
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,700
You, too, huh?

813
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,100
You all are good with this?

814
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,900
Not me.

815
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,100
All the guys at the bar, Jimmy,
all the girls,

816
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,300
they don't show up at your wake.

817
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,300
Not because they don't like you

818
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,000
but because they never
knew your last name.

819
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,300
A month later, someone tells 'em,
"Oh, Jimmy died."

820
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,000
"Jimmy who?"
"Jimmy the cop."

821
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,800
"Oh," they say. "Him."

822
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,100
And all the people on the job,

823
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,400
all the people you spent
all those hours in the radio car with,

824
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,400
the guys with their feet up
on their desk telling stories,

825
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,800
who shorted you on the food runs,
who signed your overtime slips.

826
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,000
In the end, they're not
gonna be there either.

827
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,600
Family. That's it.
Family, and if you're lucky,

828
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,500
one or two friends
who are the same as family.

829
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,600
That's all the best of us get.
Everything else is just...

830
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,000
There is no serial killer.

831
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,600
There are no murders.
I made it all up.

832
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,600
They were shutting us down.
They were just...

833
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,000
It's hard to explain.

834
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,700
I don't even know where the anger comes from,
I don't know how to make it stop.

835
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,300
They fucking task me, they do.

836
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,300
We took the money from
the bullshit investigation,

837
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,200
and rerouted it to Lester.

838
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,600
Now he's got the cake
to take down Marlo Stanfield.

839
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,200
And now that I've done all this,
now that I've watched myself do it,

840
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,200
I can't even stand to...

841
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,100
Lester says he's close.

842
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,700
Time will pass, and I'll be able
to shut this thing down.

843
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,200
If you don't go to jail.

844
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,700
You had no fucking right.

845
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,300
- I know.
- This is my life, too.

846
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,000
You start to tell the story;
you think you're the hero.

847
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,600
And then,
when you get done talking, you...
