1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,900
But if we...

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,700
- But how can?
- Jesus Christ.

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,900
So this means that...

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,500
- What?
- So no one killed any homeless men.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,300
No serial killer.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Some were random killings,

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,200
some were natural deaths
that were likely manipulated.

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,800
- But they're not linked in any way.
- But why?

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,200
The detectives used the money to fund a case
against the drug traffickers responsible

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,900
for the slayings in the vacants a year ago.

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,700
Last week's arrests and seizures
were a direct result.

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,700
So let me just understand this.

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,000
So I've been going out there for weeks,

14
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,700
slamming the Governor
for his neglect of the homeless

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,400
and declaring how we will stop at nothing

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,100
to find the person responsible
for preying on the homeless

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
and all the while...
Hey, Norman, this is my ass here.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,800
That's true, boss.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,000
But it does have a certain charm to it.

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,700
They manufactured an issue to get paid,

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,400
we manufactured an issue
to get you elected governor.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,700
Everybody's getting what they need
behind some make-believe.

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,400
The detectives involved will be suspended
and ultimately fired, at the least.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,700
Beyond that, a criminal prosecution
on fraud and perjury charges is probable.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,800
You're saying
we call a press conference and we say,

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,600
"By the way, all that stuff
about homeless people getting killed

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,900
"and the Governor cutting the safety net

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,000
"and us doing everything
in our power to catch the guy,

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,400
- "guess what, the joke's on us?"
- Not to mention that the evidence

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,700
against the traffickers
arrested last week is tainted.

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,800
That case could collapse as well.

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
I don't fucking believe this.

33
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,700
You two are on point here.

34
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,400
Word of this gets down to Annapolis,
the Governor's gonna wreck me with it.

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,900
And if it comes to that,
you guys drop on your swords, so help me.

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,200
How does word not get out
once we suspend the detectives?

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,400
Never mind sending it to the grand jury
for a criminal case?

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,100
The cops that did this, they gotta go. You
cannot be telling me I have to live with this.

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,200
Deputy, Counselor...

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,700
if you two will excuse us,
we are going to discuss this first

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,700
as a matter of public policy.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Until we can reason
the best way to address this,

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,400
do nothing and speak to no one
about any of this.

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
If this becomes public in the wrong way,

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,000
a lot of people who were legally responsible
for the situation,

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,700
good people who were, nonetheless,
in a supervisory role here...

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,100
are going to suffer.

48
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,800
And that's not the outcome
that anyone wants.

49
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,700
What Mike is saying is that we need to be
very careful about how to proceed.

50
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,800
I wish I was still at the newspaper
so I could write on this mess.

51
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
It's too fucking good.

52
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,200
Lester. What brings you down?

53
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,900
We don't have anything scheduled
from you today, I don't think...

54
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,500
40,000 from the Showboat on the boardwalk.

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
26 at the Borgata.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,100
80 over the last year at the Taj Mahal

57
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,700
and that's just the Atlantic City casinos.

58
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,600
I like to play. So what?

59
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,900
You lost three times your salary
over the last two years.

60
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,300
I ran you through Sentinel Title
and came back with seven pages of liens

61
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,800
and a third mortgage you folded on
two months ago.

62
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,300
Gary, you're done.

63
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,100
What do you mean?

64
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,600
We found sealed grand jury papers
in the houses of drug dealers

65
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
and we've got people naming you on it.

66
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,500
You have a problem, Gary.

67
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,700
But you have friends in this courthouse,
lifelong friends.

68
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,900
Cop to the problem, give up the names
of those that bought from you.

69
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Disbarred? Yeah, no doubt.

70
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
But you play it clean from this moment on

71
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,800
and we both know you'll probably walk.

72
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,300
- Why did you look at me?
- I ran the finances

73
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,800
on everyone who worked this unit
over the last couple years.

74
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,900
You were the only bogie.
If the S.A.O. weren't so screwed up,

75
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,700
they'd have been running
background checks as a routine.

76
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,300
But I guess you knew that.

77
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,800
I always wondered
if they'd get their shit together.

78
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,800
But that's Baltimore, isn't it?

79
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,700
So what happens now?

80
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,400
Well, for starters...

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you're gonna make a phone call.

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,700
McNulty, Freamon, Sydnor...

83
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,400
Any one who has the smell
of this on them should be gone.

84
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,600
Before the close of business,
they should be suspended

85
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
and, before the end
of the week, indicted.

86
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,200
- I know, but...
- But what?

87
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,400
We're gonna let this shit stand
because it'll hurt Carcetti to air it out?

88
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,100
Instead of cleaning house like we need to,
he's up there figuring out how to hide the dirt.

89
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I got a mind to call the Governor myself
and just let it fly.

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,600
- Cedric, you can't.
- Why not?

91
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,700
If I let this thing stand, I might as well
just roll over and play dead

92
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
for every police who knows about this.

93
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,100
- We cover this up...
- Cedric, you can't do anything.

94
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,600
Those are your detectives.

95
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,000
They need someone to blame,
they will measure you for it.

96
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,900
I don't give a fuck.

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,700
And they'll fire me.

98
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,500
You heard Steintorf.

99
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,600
I was in charge of this thing.

100
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,900
I was on that wiretap.

101
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
This is my career.
This is everything.

102
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,800
You go public and it hurts Carcetti.

103
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,100
Maybe he doesn't get to be governor
but he is still the Mayor,

104
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,200
and Bond is still my boss,

105
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,700
and you know the weight will not fall on them.

106
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
- It never does.
- Christ.

107
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,700
Everything I worked for, all those years
in that courthouse...

108
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,300
Please.

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,800
25 cents. Baltimore Sun.

110
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,100
Sir, Baltimore Sun. One quarter.

111
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
- Keep it.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

112
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,200
People tip pretty good, don't they?

113
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,700
"...paying him for what he had done to us.

114
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,400
"I'm sorry for him, man, really,

115
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,400
"but I still can't let him come up
from the basement."

116
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,600
- You gonna put all that in the paper?
- That's the plan.

117
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,600
Even the parts about Sherrod?

118
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeah.

119
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,400
- What good is a story like that?
- Like what?

120
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Like me, Sherrod.
Gettin' high. Not gettin' high.

121
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,100
My sister, all that shit in there.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,500
What good do any of that
do to put it in the newspaper?

123
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,000
People read it, they think about it.
Maybe see things different.

124
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,500
I don't know, man.

125
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Bubs, you don't want me
to do this, I won't do it.

126
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
I don't know.

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,500
Baltimore Sun. A little bit of sun. Sun paper.

128
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,000
Look, Rupert, go public
with this thing if you want

129
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,100
but your shop is gonna come out looking worse
for letting it happen in the first place.

130
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
The better move is to shut it down quietly

131
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,500
and then deal with those responsible
through back channels.

132
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,500
We'll bury these guys softly
and in a hole so deep

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,000
no one will ever get close
to digging them up.

134
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
I can see that.

135
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,200
Commissioner, do you agree?

136
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,800
Well, it is a little more problematic for me.

137
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,200
The offenders are in my shop,
are they not?

138
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
Can I have a word with you in private, Bill?

139
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,200
Hey, if Rawls isn't in, I'm not either.

140
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,700
I wouldn't worry about Bill Rawls.

141
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,300
I believe he's about to have
one of those road to Damascus moments.

142
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
I can see what you're thinking in there.

143
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,500
I can see the gears grinding
in that head of yours.

144
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,200
You're thinking, "Hey,
I might have some wood on Carcetti here.

145
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
"There's no way they can
pin the blame on me for this fiasco

146
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,300
"without doing their boy Daniels, too."
You're thinking we'd have to fire Daniels

147
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,400
to fire you and that wouldn't sit well,
given how much we've already sold Daniels.

148
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,300
Isn't that what you're thinking?

149
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,300
You're telling yourself maybe
there's a way for you to leverage this,

150
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,600
to get yourself a full term as commissioner,

151
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,200
to delay Daniels a few more years
in exchange for you shutting the fuck up

152
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,000
and doing what you're told.

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
And you know what, Bill?
You're not far off.

154
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,300
You do have a little leverage here
but just a little.

155
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,100
I wouldn't overplay your hand.

156
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,700
How would you play it?

157
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
I'd shut the fuck up and wait your turn

158
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,500
and, when Tommy gets to the statehouse,
he brings you with him

159
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
to be State Police Superintendent.

160
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,900
Because while you may be a shade too white

161
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
to run the Baltimore department,

162
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,100
you're just about right for the M.S.P.

163
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,800
- I have your word?
- And I have yours.

164
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,200
Back channel is the way to go.

165
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,300
See? The Police Commissioner
done fell off his ass.

166
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,400
Can I help you?

167
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,700
I need to see Mr. Prezbo.

168
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,700
Someone will come down.

169
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,000
- Are you a student here?
- Ms. Donnelly, it's me, Duquan.

170
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,800
It's good to see you but
you're not a student here

171
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,100
so I can't let you inside.

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
I just came past to see Mr. Prezbo.

173
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,400
Well, he's teaching right now.

174
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,500
I know. I can wait.

175
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,500
You're gonna have to stay outside.

176
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,000
After the bell, I'll tell Mr. Pryzbylewski
you're out here for him, OK?

177
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm going to surprise you with something.

178
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,700
You already have.

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,700
I got a tip from an informant
about a leak out of the grand jury unit.

180
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,700
Sad to say it's checked out.

181
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,900
- We know about the leak.
- But do you know who it is?

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,700
Gary DiPasquale.

183
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Decent enough guy but he's got
a bear of a gambling problem

184
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,600
and a bank of drug lawyers
who are willing to pay for their look-sees.

185
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,300
Troy Sanders, Marvin Bronfman,

186
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,400
Dennis Cray, Sid Silverstein.

187
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,200
And the pick of the litter? Maurice Levy.

188
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
I kid you not.

189
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,500
Gary is their leak?

190
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,500
He broke right away.
He was ready to give it up. Needed to.

191
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,900
One-party consent call
implicating Maury Levy.

192
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,400
- Where's Gary now?
- He went up to the second floor

193
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,700
to hand in his letter of resignation
and went home to wait for the sword to drop.

194
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,900
He's OK, he's better than you'd think.

195
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,800
You know, if we can turn Levy
and some of these other drug lawyers,

196
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,500
we can route the drug money all over town.

197
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,800
It's sad business, I know,

198
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,200
but at least we know the truth now, right?

199
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,100
The truth, you say?

200
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,000
Duquan, hello.

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
Snatch-pops.

202
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,900
Damien. You lost your mind?

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
- But I said snatch-pops.
- I don't care.

204
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
You're gonna buy him a new sandwich,

205
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,100
and past that, you're gonna ask
Mr. Williams for a broom

206
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,500
to clean that up, you understand?

207
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,700
Right now or you're mine
for another week of detention.

208
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,500
I don't want to hear another word.

209
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,400
It looks like you got the hang of it.

210
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,600
What's up with you?

211
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,800
Ain't nothing.

212
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
You still at Southwestern?

213
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,100
Well, I'm, like, needing a semester off,
you know?

214
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm outdoors now.

215
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,600
And...

216
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,000
I was hoping maybe I could get with you

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,500
and borrow some money,
so I can get a place and some clean clothes

218
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,400
and get myself settled
so I can go back to school.

219
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,100
You're on the street?

220
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,700
I got people ready
to give me a really good place

221
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,800
if I can come up
with some money for it.

222
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
How much do you need?

223
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,400
Couple of hundred.

224
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,200
But if you could go one fifty more,

225
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,400
I can enrol in the G.E.D. Program
down B.C.C.C.,

226
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,200
then I could get my G.E.D.
Without having to go back to Southwestern.

227
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Then I can get my work permit.

228
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
I don't think you're eligible
for a G.E.D. Program

229
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,400
if you're still of age to attend high school.

230
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Yeah, you are.

231
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,700
I'll tell you what.

232
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,500
Give me a couple minutes,
I'll drive you down there.

233
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,800
If you are eligible, I'll write a check
right to the bursar's office.

234
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,800
No, Mr. P., you ain't got to go through all that.

235
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Besides, I ain't got the time
to go down there today.

236
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,700
But, you know, I'm gonna.

237
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,000
I can do it, if that's what you want.

238
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,500
And I don't even care about the money.

239
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,200
But understand I'm gonna go down
to B.C.C.C. in a few days

240
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
and find out if you're enrolled.

241
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,100
And if you are, I'm gonna say, "Great.

242
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,300
"Duquan can come past
with his certificate when he gets it,

243
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,500
"and we're still friends.

244
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
"And he can still rely on me."

245
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,200
But if you aren't enrolled, then...

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,600
Well, I imagine I'm not gonna see you again,
am I?

247
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,800
No, Mr. P.

248
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,300
I'm definitely gonna enroll.

249
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,000
You'll see.

250
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,500
I'll get my stuff.
I'll meet you in the lot

251
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,700
and we'll go find a bank machine.

252
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,700
Jay, all I'm saying is we've run down
all the leads we had,

253
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,800
all the office reports are in and, at this point,

254
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,100
barring any new developments,
I don't need all this fucking manpower.

255
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,500
Fuck me, Jimmy.
Last week you were crying

256
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,800
for every swinging dick
you could get your hands on.

257
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,200
The case has gone quiet.
There's no red ribbons,

258
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,700
no bodies, no disappearances.

259
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,400
Not a fucking word on the cellphone.
This thing's useless.

260
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,200
You don't want the wiretap either, now?

261
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,800
The judge gave us 60 days.
Once that runs out, then...

262
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,200
Motherfucker, you were the one
who was all semper fi

263
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,700
for this serial killer
and now you're fuckin' the dog.

264
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm ready to work the case.

265
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,100
But short of any new leads,
what the fuck do you want me to do?

266
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,000
I can't make shit up, can I?

267
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,500
It is what it is.

268
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,500
If I send the surveillance teams back,

269
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,700
don't come crying for more
manpower tomorrow, you hear?

270
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,700
Shit is like a war, ain't it?

271
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,000
Easy to get in, hell to get out.

272
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Pearlman knows everything. Daniels, too.
They figured it out.

273
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,100
- How?
- I don't know.

274
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
- Jesus. What are they?
- I don't know.

275
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,200
She made it clear there are not to be
any further homeless killings.

276
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Nothing more on this case whatsoever.

277
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,800
- Does she know about Marlo, that our case?
- She knows everything. Daniels knows.

278
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,600
They went to the E.C.U.,
dialed up the wiretap number

279
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,300
and up pops Marlo's cellphone.

280
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,900
Why aren't we fired?
Why aren't we in fucking bracelets?

281
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,500
I don't know.

282
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,100
Oh shit, Lester.

283
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,900
We gotta get outta here.
We gotta think this thing through.

284
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,400
Jesus fucking Christ.

285
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,800
Look, meet me down at Kavanagh's
in ten minutes, all right?

286
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,200
How much?

287
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,500
200.

288
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,600
Damn, boy. Teacher must love your black ass.

289
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,000
C'mon with it. They gonna put out testers
up on Poplar Grove.

290
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,800
We gonna be late for it.

291
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,400
C'mon, boy. C'mon.

292
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
Deputy.

293
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
To be continued.

294
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
- Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck.
- What's the matter?

295
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,300
Cottage cheese for lunch
again there, Carl?

296
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,400
Just because it happened
doesn't mean it's news.

297
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,600
There's always a salmonella outbreak
somewhere.

298
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
I don't see why we have to cover this one...

299
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,000
What's the first rule of rewrite, Spry?

300
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,000
Shoot it down.

301
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Did you read this?

302
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,100
We are crediting our own coverage

303
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,800
with changing the Governor's mind?

304
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,300
I'm already to the jump

305
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
and there's not a quote from anyone

306
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,500
crediting us with anything of the sort.

307
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
The guv is restoring funding, all right.

308
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,900
That's 'cause Carcetti's been beating the shit
out of him on this issue.

309
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
We're just an afterthought.

310
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,900
Whiting can smell the public service Pulitzer?

311
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,400
- Seems so.
- You get a chance yet?

312
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,700
Yeah, yeah. I read it.

313
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,300
And?

314
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,900
Beautiful.

315
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,400
No, no, no. I mean it.

316
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,200
You got some real Joe Mitchell
stuff on the page there.

317
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,100
Really makes me feel like
I know this guy and his world.

318
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,500
You just pulled it all through the keyhole.

319
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,700
Thanks, Gus.

320
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,600
We get some good art,
I'm gonna push for the Sunday front.

321
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, I gotta make sure
the guy is good with it.

322
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
What do you mean?

323
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,700
The part of the story
about the kid bothers him.

324
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
When he told me about it,
he was just talking...

325
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,600
You told him you were
writing about him?

326
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,200
I know, but...
I'm putting the guy's life out there.

327
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,400
I wanna feel clean about it.
You know what I'm sayin'?

328
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,100
I remember clean.

329
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,100
Obviously, they're not in a hurry to go public
'cause we ain't cuffed.

330
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,600
They're pretending on this case
like we're pretending. Why?

331
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Carcetti. He's exposed on this.

332
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,800
How? Just blame it all on us,
on the department.

333
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,200
To kill us, they'd have to kill Rawls, Daniels

334
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,500
and half the chain of command.
And he made those guys.

335
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,300
It's his police department.

336
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,200
So he opens himself up
right when he's out there, running for governor.

337
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,700
So they want us to do what?
Run it down quietly? That's no problem.

338
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
Six months from now, after the election,

339
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,300
they might decide to open up
and grand jury us.

340
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,800
We could still go to jail and, if not,

341
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,500
I expect to be back in the pawn shop unit
and you are gonna ride the boat.

342
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,600
So what? It was worth it.

343
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,700
Wasn't it?

344
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,900
Depends.

345
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,900
Are they gonna let the case against Marlo
and his people stand,

346
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,600
knowing what they know?

347
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,400
Why wouldn't they? It still works
on the seizures and cellphones.

348
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,600
- It works without the illegal tap.
- Yeah, it does.

349
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,100
And they made a big deal
about dropping Marlo.

350
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,800
They called that press conference
and linked him to all the bodies.

351
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,100
For them to drop the case now...

352
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,300
You know, you think about it,

353
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,300
we've got almost as much
on them as they do on us.

354
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,300
That Tom Wolfe wannabe

355
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,100
thinks he's gonna
get a phrase like that past me?

356
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,200
No fuckin' way, motherfucker.

357
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,400
It's like a sweater with
the threads hanging off.

358
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Pull any thread...

359
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,200
Mostly exaggerations and too-perfect quotes,

360
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,700
sometimes on the record.

361
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,300
I called some of them back,

362
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,900
asked if they really said those things.

363
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,000
You know what the city
housing commissioner told me

364
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,100
about the quotes in the flipping story?

365
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,200
He wished he'd said some of them
but that he'd never been that smart in his life.

366
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,700
Someone takes the time to...

367
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,800
re-report this stuff, it'll get ugly.

368
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
What're you gonna do?

369
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,200
I don't know, Robert. I don't know.

370
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,900
Keep my name out of it.

371
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,900
No bail.

372
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,900
They're claiming a propensity for violence
and witness intimidation at the bail review,

373
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,600
trying to have you held as the kingpin.

374
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,800
- They can do that?
- They can try.

375
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,900
Depends on which judge they draw.

376
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,500
So they ain't got no bail for Chris, right?
I mean, he got the murder one.

377
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,900
Monk neither.

378
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,900
Too much weight in his car
and he's on parole from the '04 charge.

379
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,800
Best I could do was spring
Mr. Wagstaff on 300,000.

380
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
- He show that kind of money?
- Put up his uncle's house

381
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,700
on surety bond for a third of it.
Bondsman is fronting the rest on a fake lien.

382
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,700
Right now, the important thing is not bail,
the important thing is this...

383
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,500
I need you to tell me
who else knew your clock code.

384
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,100
I told you.

385
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,800
Me, Cheese, Monk, Chris

386
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,600
- And the supply. That's it.
- No one else?

387
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,200
No one else even had my cell number,
except you.

388
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
What?

389
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,200
- There's a lie in here somewhere.
- I ain't lying.

390
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,200
I don't mean you.

391
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,800
Look, the police say the source told them

392
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,500
that you were re-upping on the day

393
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
and word of that might have
slipped out. That's possible.

394
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,200
If you were wholesaling all over town...

395
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,500
They only grab your cells when they arrest you
and then they have to go get warrants

396
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,900
before they can look at
the photos on the phones.

397
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,000
And it's only when they get to the photos

398
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,400
and break the code that they have enough

399
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,100
to type a charging document
for you or Chris, right?

400
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
I mean, you aren't caught with drugs.

401
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,800
But they had the arrest warrants on both of you
within a couple hours.

402
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,600
Which means that they broke
the code almost instantly,

403
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,000
no time at all.

404
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,200
They wiretapped me.

405
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,800
My investigator thinks so.

406
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,600
But he doesn't know for sure
which unit ran the tap or who manned it.

407
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,600
It doesn't add up.

408
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
You gettin' out.

409
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,200
You ain't.

410
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,500
You hit the streets, you round up
as much muscle as possible

411
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,500
and get that boy.

412
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,500
He did Snoop 'cause he knew we was on him.

413
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,900
He knew we was on him 'cause
he the one talked about the re-up.

414
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,600
Get your shit together, man.

415
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,500
The bondsman came in with Levy.

416
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
A'ight. I'm on it.

417
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,700
Man, you got a dollar?

418
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,600
C'mon.

419
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,700
Pal.

420
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,700
Pal, you all right?

421
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,400
OK, here it comes,

422
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,700
the dreaded crab claw.

423
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You know what happens
when crab claw goes...

424
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,500
- It's all crab tonight...
- No crab claw!

425
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Yes, crab claw!

426
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,500
Yeah! Crab claw does it again. Six!

427
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,100
Six and I'm out...

428
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,900
Yeah.

429
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,400
Where?

430
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,000
You're fucking kidding me.

431
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
It's more bull...

432
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
It's bogus, Jay. I'm telling you...

433
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,800
OK.

434
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,800
I gotta go.

435
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,800
I have to keep running the string out.
I've no choice.

436
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,900
You said the bosses know.

437
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,900
Some do, some don't. The ones that do
want us to keep pretending.

438
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,800
We stop pretending, then...

439
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Listen, we'll finish this tomorrow night, OK?

440
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,400
I'll see you in a bit.

441
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,100
What do you think?

442
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,900
I mean, puttin' my shit in the streets?

443
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,600
Well, it's you.

444
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,000
He's got you.

445
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,800
Yeah, well.

446
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I mean he's got what you're about.

447
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,600
The guy likes you,
that shows through.

448
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,300
I mean, you know, he's saying
this giving back that you're doing,

449
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,100
he's putting that up against Sherrod.

450
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,400
He ain't lettin' you
off the hook for shit

451
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,400
but he's just puttin' it all out there.

452
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
You know, the good and the bad.

453
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,300
You know what?

454
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,400
The bad don't bother me to have out there.

455
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,000
Shit, I know the bad.
I ain't lyin' to no one about the bad.

456
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,600
Scared of somebody callin' you good?

457
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,400
A lot of folks volunteer places.
A lot of folks share at meetings.

458
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,700
Plenty of motherfuckers wake up every day
and not get high.

459
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,300
Man makin' me sound special
for doin' what the fuck I need to be doin'.

460
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,600
Read it.

461
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,900
"You can hold back
from the suffering of the world,

462
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
"you have free permission to do so

463
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,400
"and it is in accordance with your nature.

464
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,500
"But perhaps this very holding back

465
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,100
"is the one suffering you could have avoided."

466
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,900
Fran-zee Kafka.

467
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,100
Who's he?

468
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,300
Some writer.

469
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,200
You read his books?

470
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,800
Fuck no. But you remember Flubber?

471
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,200
He handed that to me
the night that he had me start leading

472
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
the Saint Martin meeting.

473
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,400
I kept it ever since.

474
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,600
What it mean to you?

475
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,200
You want these?

476
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,900
Yeah, my man say he need it back
and not to make any copies.

477
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,900
He say he ain't supposed to show it to me
before it goes in the paper.

478
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,700
I mean, if I let him.

479
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,300
You gonna?

480
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Thanks for the crabs.

481
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,000
Gray van.

482
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,000
- You get the tag?
- I couldn't see it from where I was.

483
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,400
Describe the driver.

484
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
White. Six foot.

485
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,500
Not heavy, not skinny either.

486
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,500
Clothes?

487
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,500
Nothing I noticed. Kinda nondescript.

488
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,800
Nondescript?

489
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,300
I was surprised, I guess. I just thought,
"Whoa, what's he doing?"

490
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,700
- Funny it being you to see this.
- It's weird.

491
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,500
If an interview doesn't run late,
I'm not even here tonight.

492
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,000
You mind if I get inside?
I gotta check in with my desk.

493
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,200
You need anything else,
you got my number.

494
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,900
Yeah.

495
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,700
That guy's an asshole.

496
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,900
This smokehound can't remember a thing.

497
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,800
Only motherfucker
he remembers messing with him

498
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,300
is the fella that found him.

499
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,700
Whatever happened before that
is anyone's guess.

500
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,000
Someone try to kidnap you,
drag you into a van?

501
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,900
- OK.
- Who was trying to hurt you?

502
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,700
My father. But he was a drunk.

503
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,400
Detective, there's a vagrant over here
says he saw something.

504
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,100
What did you see, fella?

505
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,600
McNulty?

506
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,900
- Johnny Weaver. Tactical.
- Fuck you. Why didn't you say so?

507
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,900
J.W. Tryin' to keep your cover?

508
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,400
It's better if everyone here
thinks I'm one of the regulars.

509
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,200
Anyway, what's the ruckus with Petey?

510
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,000
- The drunk?
- Yeah.

511
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,700
Sun reporter says he's going into his building,

512
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,400
he sees a guy trying to drag him
into a gray van.

513
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,800
- It's bullshit, right?
- Yeah. Petey was laying there 45 minutes

514
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,800
before that preppy cocksucker
even parks his car.

515
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,400
- Thanks.
- No problem.

516
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,200
Gimme a dollar, make it look right.

517
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,400
Thank you, Jimmy.

518
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,900
What about the reporter? You could charge
false statement, you know.

519
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,400
You lock up every liar, there's no room
in B.D.C. For anyone else, right?

520
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,400
More trouble than it's worth.

521
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,800
Jay, it's horseshit. I'm going home.

522
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,700
Yeah.

523
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,500
Brought home some crabs.

524
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
I already made dinner.

525
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,300
Put 'em in the fridge.
Cold for lunch tomorrow, if you like.

526
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,200
I can't eat 'em all.

527
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,600
We don't run this shit,
especially not off the front.

528
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,000
- I saw what I saw.
- Alma is on the phone with police P.I.O.

529
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And they are telling us on the record and off

530
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
that they are discounting any report
of a possible abduction.

531
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,900
That doesn't mean they're doing their job,
and it doesn't mean we...

532
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,000
Our job is to report the news,
not to manufacture it.

533
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,500
Fuck you, Gus.

534
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,600
Nice.

535
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,000
I know they're jealous of how much play
his stories get but the truth is...

536
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,800
We cannot run this shit.

537
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Are you suggesting
that Scott made any of this up?

538
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,100
You ever notice that the guys who do that,

539
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,500
the Blairs, the Glasses, the Kelleys,

540
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,500
they always start
with something small,

541
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,200
just a little quote that they clean up.
And then it's a whole anecdote,

542
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,200
and, pretty soon, they're seeing
some amazing shit.

543
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,200
They're the lucky ones
who just happen to be standing

544
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,900
on the right street corner in Tel Aviv
when the pizza joint blows up

545
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,200
and the human head rolls down the street
with the eyes still blinking.

546
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,600
The pictures were sent to him.
The police have confirmed...

547
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,100
It always starts with something true,

548
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,000
something confirmed.

549
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,800
But then you've got a son of a bitch

550
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,400
who just happens to be walking
in the Guilford entrance

551
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,100
when the mysterious gray van comes...

552
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,900
Gus, this has gotten personal
between you and Scott

553
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and it's affecting your judgment.

554
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,900
I'm moving the story through the state desk.

555
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,700
You should go home, think this through.

556
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,200
We'll talk in the morning.

557
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,900
Maybe you win a Pulitzer with this stuff

558
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
and maybe you gotta give it back.

559
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,400
It's in my notes, Gus.
Everything that happened,

560
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,600
everything that guy said when I got to him.

561
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,200
Every last word is in my notes.

562
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,100
Home earlier than I thought.

563
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Yeah. Home.

564
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,900
- He hit again.
- Who did?

565
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,100
The serial killer.

566
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,800
Get a grip, motherfucker.

567
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,700
You don't believe me?
Check out his left wrist.

568
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
You fuckin' with me again, Bunk?

569
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Copycat.

570
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,200
Call McNulty. Get him down here.

571
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,400
Been going over the charging documents
on the Partlow-Stanfield drug arrests.

572
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,000
- Problematic to say the least.
- How so?

573
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,700
They grab the phones and, minutes later,

574
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,800
they've cracked an elaborate code
that implicates everyone.

575
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
No one's that brilliant,

576
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,400
not at the B.P.D., anyway.

577
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,500
You don't know Lester Freamon.

578
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,700
I know what I know.

579
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,400
And this feels to me like an illegal wiretap.

580
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,200
Your guys were on those phones,
tracking my clients

581
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,300
- Long before they went near any drugs.
- Untrue.

582
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,700
We get into discovery
and I'm going to have no problem

583
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,200
knocking down that bullshit
about a source of information.

584
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,900
And my sources around here tell me that,
with all the budget cutbacks,

585
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,400
the only wiretap
you all have had up this year

586
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,900
has been on the homeless killer thing.

587
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,900
Whatever else you're running is illegal.

588
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,400
Sources?

589
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,900
Title threes are supposed to be secret.

590
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,300
Are you saying you have a source
of information inside the courthouse?

591
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
It's a figure of speech.

592
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,100
What I'm saying is that
there's shit in the blood of your case,

593
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,900
and, if you wait until this goes past indictments,

594
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,700
I'm gonna run wild with it.

595
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,100
We should talk.

596
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,700
Out of court.

597
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,600
Fuck me.

598
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,000
Is it enough? Do you have enough?

599
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,700
It has to be. It should be.

600
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,900
You can't look at everything
that Robert found,

601
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,000
at the pattern, and not see
what this fucking guy's about.

602
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You know that. I know that.

603
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,100
What, you don't think so?

604
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,000
I think that if you do this,

605
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,100
these son of a bitches will do you.

606
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,100
Come.

607
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,700
Sorry. There's been another homeless murder.

608
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,500
South Baltimore.

609
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,700
Careful, Gus.

610
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,700
I can't protect you.

611
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,900
- No fucking way.
- Dead for a while.

612
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,500
And I can assume, Jimmy,
from the fact that the ribbon ain't red

613
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,600
and the fact that you don't need another body
because Marlo is locked up...

614
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,100
- I got nothing to do with this.
- Wonderful. We've eliminated one suspect.

615
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,700
You see what you started here?

616
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,500
The bosses are gonna toss it
back to you. No doubt.

617
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,800
- The bosses know it's bullshit.
- What?

618
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,200
- Daniels knows. Pearlman, too.
- How the fuck you?

619
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,700
- How much longer does this...
- Can you give us a minute?

620
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,600
You turning the world
upside down with your bullshit.

621
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,500
- How are you not in jail?
- I don't know.

622
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,600
The lie's so big, people can live with it.

623
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:39,100
Jesus fucking Christ, Jimmy. I told you.
I fuckin' told you it was going to come to this.

624
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,400
You played with fire, didn't you?
And now we're all getting burned...

625
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,500
...reporting live from South Baltimore,
where police have found the body

626
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,900
of what appears to be
another homeless man.

627
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,300
This one killed and left in a vacant lot...

628
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,700
...short while ago have refused so far...

629
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,600
Did somebody not get the message?

630
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,700
You're not killing them yourself, McNulty,
at least assure me of that.

631
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,800
And the one you disappeared?

632
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,900
He's OK, last I checked.

633
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,100
Good. That's a start, I guess.

634
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,600
- I thought you got a message.
- Copycat.

635
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
I got nothing on this one.

636
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,100
Jesus.

637
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,700
How did you do it?
How did you get 'em by the medical examiner?

638
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,900
Some were real and I just linked 'em
with the ribbons.

639
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,700
Some I juked as strangle jobs.

640
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,700
- If it matters, I know now...
- Fuck what you know now.

641
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,100
This was all for money, McNulty?
You couldn't live without the O.T?

642
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,000
The Stanfield case. It was that.

643
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I know where it went,
but you got paid, too.

644
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,200
You and Freamon
and maybe a dozen other guys.

645
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,300
It wasn't about the money.

646
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Down the road, when we settle on this,

647
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,300
and we will settle on this,

648
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,500
I don't expect any of you will ever see
another hour of O.T. again.

649
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,100
I don't expect any of you
will be doing police work ever again.

650
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,900
And the only reason this isn't before
a grand jury right now

651
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,800
is because our mayor can't live with that.

652
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,500
Oh, yeah.
The Mayor knows your name.

653
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,100
So this is your last case. Work it.

654
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,300
If you're half the detective you think you are,

655
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,400
you'll put this one down fast
and take us all off the hook.

656
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
The longer this goes on,

657
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
the worse the payback's gonna be.

658
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,200
But what does he really know?

659
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,000
What he knows now isn't half
of what he'll learn when we get to discovery.

660
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,100
They won't be able to produce
a credible source of information.

661
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,800
They don't have to if it's not a registered CI
A source is only...

662
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,000
If he can raise doubts in a judge's mind,

663
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,300
we could be compelled to reveal our source.

664
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,600
At that point, we're giving up the wiretap.

665
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,800
And he gets the paperwork
from the phone company.

666
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,800
Which has Stanfield's number on it.

667
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
God.

668
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,000
The only thing we can do is barter.

669
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,800
Then barter. This can't go to court.

670
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,400
We do have some leverage.

671
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,200
What?

672
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,100
Let's just say Mr. Levy has problems
of his own to deal with.

673
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,300
Make this go away...

674
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,600
and the Mayor will not forget that you did so.

675
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,500
Nor will I.

676
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,600
Jimmy, ass up an' help us with this.

677
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,000
Shit is funky.

678
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,400
- We should take this into the box.
- Where's the pocket contents?

679
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,800
We have questions
about the reported kidnapping...

680
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,100
- Those two bags there.
- Yes, ma'am.

681
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,400
Well, that would seem
to be the newspaper's problem.

682
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,400
I get another fucking call about a gray van,

683
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,800
I'm burning that fucking newspaper building
to the ground.

684
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,300
What?

685
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,800
Your homeless guy from days ago,
what was in his pockets?

686
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,100
- Bullshit.
- You got business cards?

687
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,800
Yeah, but every card has an alibi.

688
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,500
- Let me see.
- I thought we were done with this.

689
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,100
So, where you going with this?

690
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,600
- I think it's down.
- Motherfucker, you ain't that good.

691
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,700
McNulty, what's up with this?

692
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,800
You OK, Gus?

693
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,300
Yeah, I'm good.

694
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,400
What?

695
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,800
Alma, what's up?

696
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,300
- It's empty.
- What's empty?

697
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,100
The pad he waved at you,
saying it was all filled with notes.

698
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,300
It's empty. Every page.

699
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,900
Thanks.

700
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,700
What the fuck is that about?

701
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,600
Alma, TV has police on a sweep
of the homeless

702
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,100
under Hanover street.

703
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,400
I'll get right to the point.

704
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,100
Please do.

705
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,600
- You have Stanfield, right? He's your client?
- Yeah, him and his people.

706
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,400
I have some stuff,
straight from the grand jury

707
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,000
that you're gonna wanna
see sooner rather than later.

708
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,900
- Is this a title three case?
- You'll find it interesting, I promise.

709
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,600
- All right. When can you meet?
- Tomorrow, after work. Same money, right?

710
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,800
- Yeah, the money's the same.
- Good.

711
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,000
We can grand jury
Gary DiPasquale tomorrow,

712
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,800
along with that one-party consent call.

713
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,000
Or...

714
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,200
here's the deal.

715
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,700
No court trials.

716
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,100
Partlow pleads to all of the bodies
in the vacants and takes life, no parole.

717
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,700
We'd want the second shooter, too,
but Pearson's beyond that now.

718
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,200
Metcalf and Wagstaff plead
to possession with intent.

719
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,500
Stanfield takes ten years on conspiracy.

720
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,100
You're blackmailing an officer of the court.

721
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,600
The moment you came in here
and offered that quid pro quo,

722
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,000
you were guilty of obstruction of justice.

723
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,900
You're right.

724
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,600
I could get six to eight years.

725
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,800
And for bribery of a state's attorney
and the violation of grand jury secrecy,

726
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,600
you could see ten to twelve.

727
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,300
I'll be out a couple years before you.

728
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,100
You come home,
first round's on me, I guess.

729
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,800
So you'll let me walk
to keep this case out of open court?

730
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,000
That file must be dirty as hell.

731
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,000
The conspiracy charge on Stanfield falls
without the cellphones

732
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,700
and you and I both know
that if someone does some digging,

733
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,200
they're gonna find an illegal wiretap
and you're gonna lose the phones.

734
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,700
Everhart, 274,

735
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,300
Maryland 459, Ceccolini, 435,

736
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,000
US, 268.

737
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,700
Lying cops don't automatically kill a case.

738
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,800
But that's a lot of risk on appeal.

739
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,000
And a lot of dirt for your office to show.

740
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,100
No. You're scared of the light.

741
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,500
Partlow takes his chances
on the legit murder charge only.

742
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,700
The conspiracy count goes
and Stanfield and the rest walk.

743
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,400
Stanfield walks

744
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,400
but the case goes on the stet docket,
not dismissed outright.

745
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,900
And, although I can tell you
there are people in this city

746
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,600
who can't tolerate a scandal
at this particular moment,

747
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,700
that dynamic changes after November.

748
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,900
- The elections.
- After November,

749
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,800
no one is going to care
as much about showing dirt.

750
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,300
If Carcetti wins, he's in Annapolis.

751
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,100
If he loses, he's an incumbent mayor
who can take a hit or two.

752
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,500
So tell Mr. Stanfield that this is
his only window.

753
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,300
Partlow pleads to all the murders

754
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,200
and both lieutenants plead to the drugs.

755
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,700
Then Stanfield retires.

756
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,400
He's done.

757
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,600
We even get the scent of him
on the street ever again,

758
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,300
this case comes off stet and goes to trial.

759
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,900
And if we have to put a few cops in jail
right behind him, so be it.

760
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,100
We'll bring the evidence and take a hit.

761
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,200
Your client walks away now...

762
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,200
or the both of you don't walk at all.

763
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,300
Let's go. Get up.

764
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,300
That's mine.

765
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,400
It's yours. I know.

766
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,900
Do you have a card?

767
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,700
That's not a card.

768
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,400
We met before, d'you remember?

769
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,200
Liar.

770
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,900
Black liar.

771
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,700
Why'd you kill your friend?

772
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,300
He drinks.

773
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,100
He's always drinking.

774
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,900
But you put a ribbon around his wrist.

775
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,700
Like the others.

776
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,300
- Yeah.
- Did you see that on television?

777
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,500
The ribbon on the wrist?

778
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,800
Did you hear about that from other people?

779
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,500
Why'd you do the thing with the ribbon?

780
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,600
Nobody understands.

781
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
You don't understand.

782
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,400
I always know what I'm going to do...

783
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,100
before I do it. OK?

784
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,700
I always know what I'm going to do.

785
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,800
Did you kill the others?
Did you kill all of them?

786
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,800
Every one of them.

787
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,400
I did it because I knew I was going to do it.

788
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,600
I've killed millions.

789
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,800
OK? And they all killed me.

790
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
So you did all the murders?

791
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,900
You're a coward.

792
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,900
I can tell.

793
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,100
Do you have a card?

794
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,600
Jimmy, reporter's in there waiting
for a photo array.

795
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,300
What? Jay, he's bullshit.

796
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,800
I know he is but the newspaper
made such a fuss,

797
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,900
the major wants us to jerk him off,
just to say we did.

798
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,700
Hey, detective.

799
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,700
No gray van either.

800
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,200
- What?
- He doesn't have a gray van.

801
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,700
No gray van. And he didn't call you
on the phone either, did he?

802
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,300
He didn't call you the first time
and he didn't call you the second. I did that.

803
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,300
Yew mortify me in fronta my fatha...

804
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,100
And those pictures you got.

805
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,600
I took those.

806
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,300
And the missing guy?
He's my second cousin.

807
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,200
We sent him up to Atlantic City
with a roll of quarters.

808
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,400
And you know why I can tell you all this?

809
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Because, you lying motherfucker,

810
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,000
you're as full of shit as I am.

811
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,600
And you've got to live with it and play it out
for as long as it goes. Right?

812
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,500
Trapped in the same lie.

813
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,600
Only difference is I know why I did it.

814
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,100
But fuck if I can figure out
what it gets you in the end.

815
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,100
But hey, I ain't part of your tribe.

816
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,000
- You're not serious? You can't...
- No.

817
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
No, I'm a fucking joke.

818
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,100
And so are you.

819
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,300
Now get the fuck out of here.

820
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,400
You walk.

821
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,900
Chris eats the murders, every last one,
takes life without parole.

822
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,700
- No parole?
- No shot.

823
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,900
They've got him cold on the one
with the DNA

824
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,700
Can you sell that? Is Chris loyal?

825
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,400
Yeah.

826
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,800
As long as I take care of his people.

827
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,300
Cheese and Monk are looking
at up to twenty for the drugs.

828
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,600
But there's gonna be no assets investigation
and you come home with all your money.

829
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,800
Why they letting me walk?

830
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,800
They don't wanna
but there's some shit in their case

831
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,100
and they'd rather not show it in court.

832
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,700
But here's the rub.
If you stay in the game,

833
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,700
they will. They definitely will.

834
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,000
Right now, with an election going on,

835
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
they're willing to give you a bye.

836
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,700
But after November, if they even think
you're still a player,

837
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,800
they can take this case down off the shelf

838
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,200
and the shit in the case might not be enough
to keep you free.

839
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
You understand?

840
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,800
Give up the crown.

841
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,300
Well, that's the deal, kiddo.

842
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,200
There's not a lawyer
who could get better for you.

843
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
How'd that go, boss?

844
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,600
Kiddo, you are a gold mine to me.
You know that?

845
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,000
You've taken this law firm
to a whole new level.

846
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,700
- Me?
- You don't tip me to that bad wiretap,

847
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,200
I've got all kinds of trouble.
But now, if Marlo takes the deal,

848
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,500
he's gonna get a walk after being charged
in a multimillion-dollar drug seizure.

849
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,200
That doesn't happen very often

850
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,200
and, when it does happen,
the name and number

851
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:28,900
of the defense attorney goes in the front pocket
of every respectable drug trafficker.

852
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,000
You're a genius for what
you brought me on this.

853
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,700
I'm just doing what I do, right?

854
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,300
You need to know something,
all you gotta do is ask.

855
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
That's what a detective is, right?

856
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,300
Here. You should come over for dinner tonight.

857
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,500
- Yvette's making brisket.
- Your house?

858
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
You're mishpocha now.

859
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,700
If you say so.

860
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,400
It's down.

861
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,100
Not that this thing is ever going to trial.
That guy has N.C.R. written all over him.

862
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:15,200
Can't argue. A padded room
at Clifton T. Perkins is definitely called for.

863
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,400
- He go for all of them?
- No, sir. Just the last two.

864
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,600
- He deny the others?
- He ain't exactly denying anything in there.

865
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,100
I mean, he'll cop to anything we damn please.

866
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,200
Then go back and get it.

867
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,200
Excuse me?

868
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,000
If he's N.C.R., what the fuck is the difference
if he cops to two or six?

869
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,600
Either way, they tie his arms
and feed him green Jell-o.

870
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,300
Sir, he did the last two.

871
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,500
Motherfucker.

872
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,900
You are a cunt hair away from indictment
and you see fit to argue with me?

873
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,900
I did what I did. I know.

874
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,300
And now I'm standing responsible
for two fresh murders.

875
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,400
I know what I've done here.

876
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But I'm not doing this.

877
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,600
This is over

878
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:12,000
and all of our citizens can rest soundly
in the knowledge that the man responsible

879
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,600
has been apprehended by
the diligent efforts of investigators.

880
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,600
Mr. Mayor, is he being charged
with all of the murders

881
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:23,400
- Or just two?
- It is my understanding that...

882
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,400
We are charging the last two incidents

883
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,900
but it is my understanding that he is suspected
in all of the crimes.

884
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,900
We're waiting for DNA Test results.

885
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,800
Indications are that he may be
mentally incapacitated

886
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:41,400
and therefore additional prosecutions
would prove redundant.

887
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,400
I would also like to credit
Deputy Commissioner for Operations Daniels

888
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,900
with not only bringing these cases
to their proper conclusion

889
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,400
but also for solving last year's slayings
in the vacant rowhouses.

890
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,600
He has given us such excellent work

891
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,500
that I think that now is as good a time
as any to announce

892
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,200
that we will be sending
the deputy's name forward

893
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,400
to the city council for confirmation
as Baltimore Police Commissioner.

894
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,600
Acting commissioner Rawls,
to whom I am also extremely grateful,

895
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,700
will serve in an advisory capacity
pending new responsibilities at City Hall.

896
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,400
You should be working the main bar
on the arrest with Alma.

897
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,400
I...

898
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,000
We're going to want
your byline in this coverage.

899
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,500
Yeah, I don't feel so well. My stomach...

900
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,200
I think I gotta go home.

901
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,700
Sorry.

902
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,600
Having ducked the bullet
on that homeless mess,

903
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,400
I want you to know that the Mayor
and I both appreciate your discretion.

904
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,900
But right now we can't
take our eyes off the ball

905
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,600
when it comes to crime overall.

906
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,500
Looking at your weekly
U.C.R.s from the districts,

907
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,000
I am not seeing the kind of decline
that's going to measure out

908
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,100
to a ten per cent drop in the quarter.

909
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,700
- They're clean.
- Excuse me?

910
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,600
The stats are clean.

911
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,900
They're gonna stay clean.

912
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,500
Either we fix this Police Department
and the crime goes down

913
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,000
or we don't and the crime stays up.

914
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,700
Commissioner, we're talking about a little help

915
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,100
in the next couple quarters. That's all.

916
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,300
No. I can't.

917
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,800
You're quiet on the homeless fiasco
but this makes you squeal?

918
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,200
Tell the Mayor his stats will be clean

919
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,000
before the election, after the election.

920
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,300
You're right. They can't fire you.

921
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,900
Not without it bouncing back on City Hall.

922
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,500
If you don't mind being buried
in some backroom unit,

923
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,500
you can stay for as long as you can stand it.

924
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,900
Or until you get the pension.

925
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,600
But, at the same time,
I can't let you do police work.

926
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,700
Not anything that's going to find its way
into a courtroom.

927
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,600
I won't do that.

928
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,400
For both of you,

929
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,000
that's over.

930
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,000
So Marlo walks.

931
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,900
Or you go to jail.

932
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,500
And you couldn't do any better with Levy?

933
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,500
I mean, giving up the money...

934
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,100
I got what I could.

935
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,500
You lost the money trail, Lester,

936
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,000
when you decided to start colouring
outside the lines.

937
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,100
This isn't on me.

938
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,600
What the fuck you mean you selling?

939
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,900
- I'm sellin' the connect.
- How much, yo?

940
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,700
- Ten million.
- Goddamn.

941
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,400
Or a high bid if I hear ten
from more than one of y'all.

942
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,900
Y'all think it ain't worth that,
I stick that shit back in my pocket

943
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,400
and y'all can go back to runnin'
that stepped-on New York shit.

944
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,000
You don't mind me askin', why you sellin'?

945
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,600
I mean, even from inside here, you can
take a slice for just layin' in the cut, nigger.

946
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,300
Ain't gonna be in here long.

947
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,300
Case they got against me already fallin' apart.

948
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,500
But the truth is,

949
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,000
I'm done with this gangsta shit.

950
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,900
I've been there, done that.

951
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,800
You somethin' else other than a gangsta?

952
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,600
Businessman. Yeah, Tall Man,

953
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,500
I can't get that shit
wrapped around my head neither.

954
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,600
Anyway, y'all can't get my price up,
maybe y'all pool your money.

955
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,000
But supply only gonna deal with y'all

956
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,300
after I make the intro.

957
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,500
Then I'm out.

958
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,600
You've got a problem.
I thought Daniels was your boy.

959
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,200
We both got a problem if crime doesn't drop.

960
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,400
Carcetti loses the statehouse
and you aren't mayor.

961
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,600
And even if he wins, Nerese, you're stuck

962
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,500
with a Police Commissioner
that won't work with you.

963
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,100
I'm not stuck with anything.

964
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,600
Daniels either comes around or he's done.

965
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,200
We just anointed him.
We can't go back on that now. He knows it.

966
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,600
Either he learns his place
or he'll be offering to resign.

967
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,200
You ain't the only one
knows how to play this game.

968
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,300
What to say about this piece of work?

969
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,900
Fucked if I don't find myself
without the right words.

970
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,200
Me, as gifted a golden throat
as any of you cocksuckers

971
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,100
being loosed from religion,
are ever likely to hear.

972
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,400
What can I say about the dearly departed?

973
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,300
- I mean, really...
- He died young.

974
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,400
- Too young.
- Not even 40 years old.

975
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,200
Though, had it lived,
his dick woulda been 134.

976
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,400
Shut up. It's coming to me.

977
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,900
He was the black sheep,

978
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,800
the permanent pariah.

979
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,100
He asked no quarter of the bosses
and none was given.

980
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,100
He learned no lessons,

981
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,500
he acknowledged no mistakes.

982
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
He was as stubborn a Mick as ever stumbled

983
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,600
out of the Northeast parishes
to take a patrolman's shield.

984
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,400
He brooked no authority.

985
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,100
He did what he wanted to do
and he said what he wanted to say

986
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,700
and, in the end,
he gave you the clearances.

987
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,200
- He's natural police.
- Yes, he was.

988
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,500
I don't say that about many people,
even when they're here on the felt.

989
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,200
I don't give that one up
unless it happens to be true.

990
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,200
Natural poh-leece.

991
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,900
But Christ, what an asshole.

992
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:01,100
And I'm not talkin' about the ordinary,
gaping orifice that all of us possess.

993
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,100
I mean an all-encompassing,
all-consuming,

994
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,700
out of proportion to every other facet
of his humanity chasm.

995
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,900
From whose borne,
if I may quote Shakespeare,

996
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,800
no traveler has ever returned.

997
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,300
- The fuck did I do?
- Shut the fuck up.

998
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,400
You're dead to us now.

999
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,700
Here's his partner in crime.

1000
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,000
Now, now. Be gentle. Be gentle.

1001
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I'm a civilian now. Be gentle.

1002
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Your papers went in?

1003
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,600
- Yeah, this afternoon. 32 years.
- And four months.

1004
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,200
Y'all did a fine job with him, you did.

1005
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,500
He look to be about ten years younger
than I remember.

1006
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,200
Well, c'mon, there's enough room
for both of you to be laid out.

1007
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,900
One at a time.

1008
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
You don't crowd a man at his own wake.

1009
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,800
Come on, Lester. Come and snuggle.

1010
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,600
Keep our secrets, Jimmy.
I got Shardene with me tonight.

1011
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,900
If you gentlemen will spare us
this unfortunate homoerotic lapse,

1012
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I will conclude my elegiac remarks.

1013
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,400
Then do it, you gabby motherfucker.

1014
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,900
To conclude. To conclude,

1015
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,000
I say he gave us 13 years on the line.

1016
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,400
Not enough for a pension
but enough for us to know that he was...

1017
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,100
Put the fucking song on.

1018
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,700
...despite his negligible Irish ancestry,

1019
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,700
his defects of personality,

1020
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,200
and his inconstant sobriety and hygiene,

1021
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,500
a true murder police.

1022
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,800
I say this seriously.

1023
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,300
If I was laying there dead
on some Baltimore street corner,

1024
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,200
I'd want it to be you standing over me,
catching the case.

1025
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,900
Bullshit.

1026
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,300
Because, brother, when you were good,
you were the best we had.

1027
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:05,200
Shit, if you was lying there dead on some
corner, it was probably Jimmy that done ya.

1028
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,200
Fuck you! If you caught the case,

1029
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,500
you'd be standing there pissing in my ear.

1030
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,700
How did Nerese Campbell get it?

1031
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,000
You think I asked?
Do you think it even matters?

1032
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,700
She gave it to me because
she thought you'd listen to me.

1033
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,800
So now they want me to go.

1034
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,200
The way she expressed it
is that she wanted you to stay

1035
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,100
if you could come to your senses.

1036
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,100
Come to my senses.

1037
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,800
She wants me to juke the stats for Carcetti,
this quarter and the next,

1038
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,100
hide the crime,
get him elected as governor

1039
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,700
and make her the Mayor.

1040
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,100
So do it.
Burrell juked them before you.

1041
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,700
Warren Frasier before him.

1042
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,800
And, after you're gone,
Rawls or whoever will juke them. So what?

1043
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,300
I'll swallow a lie when I have to.

1044
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,400
I've swallowed a few big ones lately.

1045
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,300
But the stat games, that lie,
it's what ruined this department.

1046
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,500
Shining up shit and calling it gold,

1047
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,200
so majors become colonels
and mayors become governors.

1048
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,700
Pretending to do police work
while one generation fucking trains the next

1049
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,100
how not to do the job. And then...

1050
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,800
I looked Carcetti in the eye.

1051
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,300
I shook his hand.
I asked him if he was for real.

1052
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,800
This is the lie I can't live with.

1053
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,000
If I do, then Nerese has me in her pocket
whenever she wants me.

1054
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,100
And I'm no good to anyone like that.

1055
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,000
Then go.

1056
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,900
Withdraw for personal reasons
or health reasons.

1057
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,400
Whatever.

1058
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,500
You've got your law degree.
You're not gonna starve.

1059
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,300
But if you don't go,
they'll wreck both of us.

1060
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,600
There's not enough in here to indict me.

1061
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,400
And the joke of it is,

1062
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,900
I've seen enough the last few days
to have them indicted.

1063
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,800
For what?

1064
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,800
Then use it, Cedric, or at least threaten to.

1065
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,800
People will get hurt.

1066
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,700
People I care about.

1067
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,700
Then you're done.
There's enough in that file

1068
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,000
that you'll never make it
through confirmation hearings.

1069
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,900
And enough so that my career is dead
before it even gets started.

1070
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,600
The tree that doesn't bend breaks, Cedric.

1071
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,200
Bend too far, you're already broken.

1072
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,100
Marlo on a walk.

1073
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,300
And the money,
she gave that away, too.

1074
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,800
Yeah.

1075
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,800
We don't get to follow the money.

1076
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,000
Hey, wonderin' where you was.

1077
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,300
I didn't know if I should come out on this here.

1078
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,400
Why the fuck not?

1079
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,100
Was me who told Daniels.

1080
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,100
I didn't want to do it behind your back but...

1081
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,900
it had to be done.

1082
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:32,000
Anyway, it was great being on the job with y'all.

1083
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,100
I just wanted to say that too, I guess.

1084
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,000
So what?

1085
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,100
You ain't gonna drink with me?

1086
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,100
I am if you want.

1087
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,500
Detective,

1088
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,400
if you think it needed doing...

1089
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,200
I guess it did.

1090
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,400
You coming?

1091
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,300
Milton came with 600.

1092
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,000
And Little Glen is in for three.

1093
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,900
I got five from me

1094
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,500
and I got five from Chinaman to cover.

1095
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,700
- We still short 900.
- I can go that. No thing.

1096
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,500
What? Motherfucker, where you get
that kind of scratch?

1097
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,300
You don't think Cheese know this here game?

1098
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,500
We sellin' dope an' coke in Baltimore, nigger,

1099
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,400
any of y'all ain't got that kind of money
need be ashamed.

1100
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,800
You still puttin' up more
than your share with that.

1101
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,500
The way I look at it,
we all gonna be more than paid

1102
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,200
once we own the connect, so...

1103
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,900
Shit, nigger, we was good
when your uncle had it.

1104
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,200
You had to go ahead and put up with Marlo.

1105
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,200
See that? See now,

1106
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,500
that's just the wrong way to look at it

1107
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,100
'cause Joe had his time
and Omar put an end to that.

1108
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,700
Then Marlo had his time,
short as it was,

1109
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,700
and the police put an end to that.

1110
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,400
And now, motherfucker, it's our time.

1111
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,900
Mines and yours.

1112
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,600
But instead of just shutting up and kicking in,

1113
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,500
you gonna stand there cryin'
that back-in-the-day shit.

1114
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,600
There ain't no back in the day, nigger.

1115
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,000
Ain't no nostalgia to this shit here.

1116
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,500
There's just the street and the game

1117
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,300
and what happen here today.

1118
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,100
You right.

1119
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,900
When it was my uncle,
I was with my uncle.

1120
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,600
When it was Marlo,
I was with him.

1121
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,500
But now, nigger...

1122
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,600
What the fuck did you do that for?

1123
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,000
Now we short the nine.

1124
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,800
That was for Joe.

1125
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,000
This sentimental motherfucker
just cost us money.

1126
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,100
Hey, Alma...

1127
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,100
I just heard.

1128
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,600
The Carroll County bureau?
That's how they punish me?

1129
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,300
Why not just send my ass
all the way to Pennsylvania?

1130
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,300
What'd they tell you?

1131
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,200
That I did an excellent job,
that this had nothing to do with anything

1132
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,200
but trying to make
the county bureaus stronger.

1133
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,900
Alma, I didn't tell them about the notepad.
I left that part out.

1134
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,900
I told them. When I heard you were in trouble,
I went to Whiting,

1135
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,700
told him I thought you were right about Scott.
I told him about the notepad.

1136
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,800
Did he make all of it up?

1137
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:32,200
- The calls from the killer? The pictures?
- Some, not all.

1138
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,700
- Why?
- Look around.

1139
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,900
The pond is shrinking.

1140
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,300
The fish are nervous.

1141
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,400
Get some profile, win a prize,

1142
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,100
maybe find a bigger pond somewhere.

1143
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,400
Whiting, Klebanow, Templeton...

1144
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,300
They snatch a Pulitzer or two
and they are up and gone from this place.

1145
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,800
For them, that's what this is all about.

1146
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,000
Me? I'm too fucking simpleminded for that.

1147
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:05,400
I just wanted to see
something new every day

1148
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,900
and write a story with it.

1149
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:13,600
Alma, you'll write your way
outta Carroll in no time, watch.

1150
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,500
About as fast as you edit your way
off the copy desk?

1151
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,700
Congratulations, Sergeant Goette.

1152
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,300
I know you'll do well in the Eastern.

1153
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:47,800
Glad I got to do this at least.
Congratulations, Lieutenant Carver.

1154
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:52,400
Thank you, sir. I'm just sorry
it won't be you I'm serving under.

1155
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,300
Word gets around?

1156
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:56,500
It's on W.B.A.L. today.

1157
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,400
They said you're leaving for family reasons.

1158
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,800
I guess I got some kids
somewhere I don't even know about.

1159
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,700
They say on B.A.L. who they're sending up

1160
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:07,000
- As acting commissioner?
- Say it ain't so.

1161
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

1162
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:18,800
as what may be my last official act
as a Baltimore police officer,

1163
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,700
allow me to congratulate
all of the promoted officers,

1164
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,500
their families, their fellow officers
and their friends.

1165
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,700
You ain't careful, they may make you major,
then you'll be truly fucked.

1166
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,100
- Good job.
- Thanks.

1167
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,500
- Proud of you.
- Thanks.

1168
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:01,600
See now, there you go, giving a fuck
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

1169
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,300
- Lehman's squad was up.
- I needed the O.T.

1170
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,000
Yeah, now you got a shooting with no wits,

1171
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,300
no suspect and no prayer
of it going to black.

1172
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,400
Picking up the phone
like a goddamn rookie. Shame on you.

1173
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,900
Stop squealin' like a bitch.

1174
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,300
An' make sure you don't step
on that shell casing behind you.

1175
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,000
I ain't gonna kick no shell casings behind me.
It's there on the side.

1176
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,500
I'm gonna step back and kick no shell casing
you don't mark with letters and numbers.

1177
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I understand.
And you gotta be in the system.

1178
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,100
- They sent you the form.
- They told me that wasn't good enough.

1179
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,100
They said they wanted the other paperwork.

1180
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,300
- And you applied for S.S.I., Mr. Belton?
- Yes, ma'am.

1181
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,100
Well, let's go inside
and look it up on the computer.

1182
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,500
Hey, you remember me?

1183
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:49,700
I brought this guy in a few weeks back,
just wanted to see how he was.

1184
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,600
He wandered out after a couple nights.

1185
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,200
Sorry.

1186
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,400
Where...

1187
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,500
- Where do the homeless go around here?
- Different places. Down by the river,

1188
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,500
over in the warehouse district.

1189
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,700
Some of the places I don't think
it would be safe for you to go.

1190
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,400
I'm police. Well, I used to be.

1191
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,600
Wait here. I'll see if I can find you a map.

1192
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,900
- Thanks.
- Come on, Mr. Belton.

1193
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,600
...and if the major could find his ass
with his hand,

1194
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,600
he'd know that we have more than enough
to be up on a pen register.

1195
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,300
Lieutenant Carver told him so.

1196
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,500
But fuck if he isn't trying
to shut this thing down.

1197
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,800
Alls I'm sayin' is a phone call or two
and you're gonna find out

1198
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,900
that they're getting some kinda pressure
from somewhere to sit on this thing,

1199
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,700
even though we've tied three killings
to this crew.

1200
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,300
Does the Police Commissioner know?

1201
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,800
Him? He wouldn't know police work
if it took down his front door on a warrant.

1202
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:57,900
Just... keep my name out of it.

1203
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,600
New Westport is like Howard Street
ten years ago,

1204
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,300
except the land's cheaper

1205
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,400
and there's more potential for mixed use
because of the waterfront location.

1206
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,800
- There you are.
- You can't put a price on a water view.

1207
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,900
Yes, you can.

1208
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,800
You definitely can.

1209
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,700
Andy, he's gotta meet Tommy
and they're leaving early

1210
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,200
so let me borrow him for a moment.

1211
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,300
Sure, no problem.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stanfield.

1212
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,000
You know who you were talking to?

1213
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,800
Andy Krawczyk.

1214
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,200
Very connected. Very big with development
around the harbour.

1215
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,600
He's someone you're gonna wanna know well.

1216
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,400
But kid, do not...

1217
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,800
Do not get in a room with him alone.

1218
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,200
You want me in there with you, believe me,
otherwise guys like that will bleed you.

1219
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,500
I want you to meet Tommy Flanagan
before he leaves.

1220
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,400
Yeah, gimme a minute. I need to...

1221
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,000
- Bathroom?
- Yeah.

1222
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,900
Down the hall to the right.

1223
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,200
Hey, watch that stuff. You'll put on weight.

1224
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:23,300
But next time, I want you to make sure

1225
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,200
that you watch this money...

1226
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,600
Don't. Don't do it.

1227
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,200
Time to give that up.

1228
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,300
Do you know who I am?

1229
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,900
Name's Vinson. Used to be Marlo's bank,

1230
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:48,800
but Marlo ain't around no more
and you still moving money for other players,

1231
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:53,000
so I'm thinking some of that money
need to be mine.

1232
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,200
Shit. You just a boy.

1233
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,900
That's just your knee.

1234
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,800
That motherfucker shot me.

1235
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,400
Nice doing business, gentlemen.

1236
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,200
No way, that's bullshit.

1237
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,600
I heard it different.
The real story about Omar

1238
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,400
is that a bunch of cops made it look
like them New York boys killed him.

1239
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:28,200
But it was them.
They're the ones that really killed him.

1240
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,800
Listen, motherfucker,
I know what happened to him.

1241
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,700
Them police had nothing to do with it.
No New York boys neither.

1242
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:37,800
So Omar's got an A.K., right?
But he's surrounded.

1243
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:41,600
It's like eight, nine motherfuckers up there
and they all got nines.

1244
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:45,100
- But he like, "You all think you..."
- Fuck you lookin' at?

1245
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,600
- You, nigger.
- Do you know who I am?

1246
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,200
Nigger, you know who I am?

1247
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,400
Shit!

1248
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,800
Yeah.

1249
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,800
...on me, all right?

1250
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,800
Thank you. Thank you.

1251
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,200
Thank you.

1252
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,900
This is a great day for Democrats

1253
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,400
and it's a great day for Maryland.

1254
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,600
I hope I get this by e-dot.

1255
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,900
OK, three minutes, for Christ's sake.
Don't get your panties in a knot.

1256
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,400
Commissioner Valchek.

1257
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,200
Madam Prosecutor, gentlemen...

1258
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,200
The first case up and I have to recuse myself.

1259
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,600
Your Honour, I appreciate your concern.

1260
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,900
Congratulations, Superintendent.

1261
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,100
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Governor.

1262
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,200
- Happy to be aboard.
- Thank you.

1263
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,900
Larry.

1264
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,800
Let's go home.
