Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,543
Yo, the shit is late.

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,442
They're still vialing up.

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,912
Usually come off the train street-ready,
but this time they gotta vial.

5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,210
Y'all got any testers, man?

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,784
- Yeah, later.
- Later?

7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,213
Got any testers, man?

8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,585
Nigger, it ain't even 9:00,
and you fiending on it.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,817
Get the fuck out of here, man. Damn.

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,989
Why you act like that?

11
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:32,492
What, for these junkie motherfuckers?

12
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,659
So you just gonna take his money all day
and treat him like a dog?

13
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,793
- How I'm supposed to treat him?
- I don't know.

14
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,702
- But you ain't got to punk him like that.
- He punked himself.

15
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:44,208
He's a goddamn drug addict.
And you a goddamn drug dealer.

16
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,037
So? So what?

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,974
What, the customer's always right?

18
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,017
We're in the projects.

19
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:56,713
The customer be fucked up.
You can't give these niggers shit, man.

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,322
Why not? Why can't you?

21
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:04,354
Shit, everything else in the world get sold
without people taking advantage.

22
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,456
Scamming, lying, doing each other dirty.

23
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,830
- Why has it got to be that way with this?
- 'Cause they dope fiends.

24
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,305
Yeah, but the game
ain't gotta be played like that.

25
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:19,443
You can't tell me this shit can't get done
without people beating on each other...

26
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:22,207
killing each other,
doing each other like dogs.

27
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,079
Without all that...

28
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:27,346
you ain't got 5-0 here on our backs
every five minutes...

29
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,655
- throwing us around and shit.
- Shit, man.

30
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,658
You think 5-0 would care
about niggers getting high?

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,057
In the projects?

32
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,153
Man, 5-0 be down here
about the bodies.

33
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,994
That's what they be
down here about, the bodies.

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,661
- Squires, young squires.
- What you want, nigger?

35
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,005
A little bag of styles, man,
a little bag of styles for you.

36
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,434
Check it out.

37
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,507
Only $5, what's up with that?

38
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,052
$5 make you
a gallant motherfucker, right there, boy.

39
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:04,820
Him, we know.

40
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,728
What are we facing from the riot?

41
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,430
Three witnesses' statements...

42
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,735
all of them saying the officer's assault...

43
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,605
on the youth was unprovoked.

44
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,268
You know how that goes, Commissioner.

45
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,109
People's idea of police brutality is
whenever we win a fight.

46
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,682
What does the state's attorney say?

47
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,444
He says it goes to a grand jury.

48
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,281
That's him doing Pontius Pilate.

49
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,515
The grand jury doesn't indict,
he looks clean for passing the buck.

50
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,750
- And if they do indict?
- They won't.

51
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:23,618
Criminal histories on our three witnesses...

52
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,629
one longer than the next.

53
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:27,460
Drugs, weapons, assault...

54
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,761
more drugs.

55
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,132
Shitbirds throwing dirt at good police.

56
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,034
Just the same, Lieutenant...

57
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,106
I want you to rethink...

58
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,540
whatever tactic led you to send
three plainclothes officers...

59
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:42,080
to do field interviews at the high-rises
at 2:00 in the morning.

60
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,817
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,181
I take it your people have union counsel?

62
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,754
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,348
Sir, I would request...

64
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:53,554
that pending the grand jury review...

65
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,628
Officer Pryzbylewski be placed
on administrative leave.

66
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,960
I can use him in-office,
but we shouldn't have him on the street...

67
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,328
until the grand jury signs off.

68
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:06,303
That's putting our tail between our legs.
I think our official stance has to be...

69
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:08,100
he did nothing wrong out there.

70
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,004
A 14-year-old is half-blind.

71
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,134
And two of ours were injured as well.

72
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,442
Goddamn right.
They were fucking shooting at us out there.

73
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,046
Bobby, what do you think?

74
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,845
Keep him off the streets...

75
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,920
until it clears the courthouse.

76
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,954
Okay, then, we'll wait on the grand jury.

77
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,931
Lieutenant. A moment, please.

78
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,531
What happened out there?

79
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,974
Did you know they were in the high-rises
without backup?

80
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,008
If I tell you yes...

81
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,309
I screwed up.

82
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,880
If I tell you no...

83
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,077
I'm putting my men in the jackpot.

84
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,989
Do you still want me to answer?

85
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,329
I screwed up, sir.

86
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,591
Good man,
willing to take one for the company.

87
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,064
To hell with the company.

88
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,431
I'm defending my own people here,
that's all.

89
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,597
What Major Valchek means to say
is that he's grateful that you...

90
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,108
extended your support
on behalf of Officer Pryzbylewski.

91
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,508
- Fuck-up that he is.
- He should be off the street.

92
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,444
What can I say? The kid needs...

93
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,880
a little guidance, a little supervision.

94
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,682
Stan here thought that if he got
a young officer back on the street...

95
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,914
where he might start over...

96
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,422
A new unit, a new lieutenant.

97
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,393
- You know, that it might bring him around.
- I understand he messed up here.

98
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:37,860
I understand that.

99
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,632
Which is why I'm saying to you...

100
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,825
I owe you...

101
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,459
for walking him
through this grand jury thing.

102
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,902
And to compensate,
Southeastern is sending you...

103
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,339
two new unmarked units,
and a surveillance van.

104
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,104
Plus, you need manpower...

105
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,873
while these guys are busy
with this llD thing...

106
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,345
all you do is ask.

107
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,047
Lieutenant.

108
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,648
So I've got suction with you, Valchek?

109
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,950
That's what I'm saying.

110
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,054
Deputy, always a pleasure.

111
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,932
A necessary evil.

112
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,375
- What?
- Valchek.

113
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,574
Is it insubordinate
if I ask what's so necessary?

114
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,816
Thanks for not cutting Pryzbylewski loose.

115
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,913
If you had, the department would be caught
between Valchek and city hall.

116
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,455
I owe you for that.

117
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,488
This Barksdale...

118
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,987
he's dug in.

119
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,428
It may take more than buy-bust.

120
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,793
And since it's been
in the press about the witness...

121
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,263
It's not an issue.

122
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,435
Keep it a tight little circle.

123
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,733
Give me three weeks of good street work
and you'll see this through.

124
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,638
A couple of felony warrants,
a little dope on the table.

125
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,404
That's all we need here.

126
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,573
Under no circumstances
is it accurate to suggest...

127
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,948
that this particular homicide
was the result of the victim...

128
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,487
having been a witness in an earlier case.

129
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,048
Reports to the contrary
are without factual merit.

130
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,163
Are you saying that you know definitely
that this man was not killed...

131
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,458
because he testified?

132
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,657
We think that...

133
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,131
I mean, that is...

134
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,702
we're looking into the
possibility that Mr. Gant...

135
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,863
was involved in a street dispute.

136
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,630
Which, of course,
would have nothing to do...

137
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,175
with his being a witness...

138
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,041
in an unrelated case
that concluded weeks ago.

139
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,311
But you haven't developed
a suspect at this time?

140
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,212
No, we haven't.

141
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,721
Bunk, shame on you, lad.

142
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,316
What did you expect him to do?

143
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,755
I don't know, grab the mike...

144
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,350
shove Rawls to the ground,
declare that all of Baltimore...

145
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,727
should rise as one because
they're murdering witnesses in cold blood.

146
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,198
That sounds more like one of your moves.

147
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:01,632
Been working on him two weeks,
we don't even have a photo.

148
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,436
It's fucking embarrassing.

149
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,972
Hey, Pat.

150
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,680
We got a job for you guys
to try to run down.

151
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:10,749
What is it?

152
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,909
We need a photo of this guy, Barksdale.

153
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:14,645
We need to know what he looks like.

154
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,951
- So go down to the B of I.
- You see, that's the problem, guys.

155
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,048
Barksdale's never been arrested
as an adult...

156
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,024
so we don't really have a B of I photo.

157
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,564
He had his juvenile record expunged,
so there's no photo there either.

158
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:27,097
Then you're fucked.

159
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:31,129
Yeah, we are.

160
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:36,137
But seeing as we all came into work today,
I thought, let's try something different.

161
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,634
We know from his mother's
social service record...

162
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,543
that Barksdale grew up
in Franklin Terrace, right?

163
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,312
It occurred to me...

164
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,511
being vaguely familiar
with the high-rises of West Baltimore...

165
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,181
that the housing project
began to take photos...

166
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,123
of every registered resident
as a security measure.

167
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,460
- Am I correct, Detective Greggs?
- Yeah.

168
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,391
So you want us to go down
to the housing department...

169
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,592
- and pull his photo.
- Excellent.

170
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:07,162
You know, you and I, we think as one.
We're like two horses together in a harness.

171
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,937
Why don't you fucking do it yourself?

172
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,635
Sure, if you don't mind sitting in my desk,
reviewing homicide folders...

173
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,875
taking meticulous notes,
trying to run down a few new leads.

174
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
It's boring, painstaking work,
but if you don't want...

175
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,520
to travel to the housing department,
I'll switch with you.

176
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,859
Fuck it, Patrick. Let's take a ride.

177
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,104
- That was inspiring.
- I'm a leader of men.

178
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,550
- What's up with shop?
- No re-up.

179
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,618
- Why not?
- 'Cause we out of red caps.

180
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,816
Stink say we gonna have
a new package tomorrow.

181
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,051
New package?

182
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,624
Yeah, man, this weak-ass stepped-on shit
we got out here...

183
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,391
get these fiends agitated.

184
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:08,432
Look at them, they still buying it, though.

185
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,992
Yes, they're buying twice as much
and only getting half as high.

186
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,971
What was that?

187
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,006
Castle can't move like that.

188
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,270
Castle move up and down or sideways like.

189
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:23,280
- No, we ain't playing that.
- Look at the board, we're playing checkers.

190
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:25,380
- Checkers?
- Yeah, checkers.

191
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,643
Why're y'all playing checkers
on a chess set?

192
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:28,913
Why do you give a shit?

193
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,648
Man, we ain't got no checkers.

194
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,054
Yeah, but chess is a better game.

195
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,192
So?

196
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,393
No, hold up.

197
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,495
Y'all don't know
how to play chess, do you?

198
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,122
- So?
- So, nothing, man.

199
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,430
- I'll teach y'all if you want to learn.
- Come on, man. No, come on.

200
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,630
- We're right in the middle of a game.
- Chill out, I want to see this.

201
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,231
Y'all can't be
playing no checkers on no chessboard.

202
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,604
All right, man.

203
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,235
Look, check it, it's simple.

204
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,305
See this?

205
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,150
This is the kingpin.

206
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,347
And he the man.

207
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,449
You get the other dude's king,
you got the game.

208
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,684
But he's trying to get your king, too,
so you gotta protect it.

209
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,557
Now the king, he moves one space...

210
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,496
any direction he damn choose,
'cause he's the king.

211
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,825
Like this, all right?

212
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,527
But he ain't got no hustle...

213
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,797
but the rest of these
motherfuckers on the team...

214
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,706
they got his back.

215
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,806
And they run so deep,
he really ain't gotta do shit.

216
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,673
- Like your uncle.
- Yeah, like my uncle.

217
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,513
You see this? This is the queen.

218
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,480
She's smart and she's fierce.

219
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,647
She moves any way she wants,
as far as she wants.

220
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,947
And she is the go-get-shit-done piece.

221
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,249
Remind me of Stringer.

222
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,520
And this, over here, is the castle.

223
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,057
It's like the stash.

224
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,499
It moves like this.

225
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,365
And like this.

226
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:53,036
Dog, stash don't move, man.

227
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,463
Come on, think.

228
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,837
How many times we move
the stash house this week?

229
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,035
And every time we move the stash...

230
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,612
we got to move a little muscle with it
to protect it.

231
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,204
True, you're right.

232
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:07,113
All right. What about them little
bald-headed bitches right there?

233
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,686
These right here.

234
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,588
These are the pawns.
They're like the soldiers.

235
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:16,093
They move like this,
one space forward only...

236
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,626
except when they fight.

237
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,754
Then it's like...

238
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,422
or like this.

239
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,495
And they like the front lines.
They be out in the field.

240
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,433
So how do you get to be the king?

241
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:26,968
It ain't like that.

242
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,306
See, the king stays the king, all right?

243
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,200
Everything stays who he is...

244
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,801
except for the pawns.

245
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:35,243
Now if a pawn...

246
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,348
makes it all the way down
to the other dude's side...

247
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,042
he gets to be queen.

248
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,951
And like I said, the queen ain't no bitch.

249
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,889
She got all the moves.

250
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,458
All right, so...

251
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,991
if I make it to the other end, I win?

252
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:55,860
If you catch the other dude's king
and trap it, then you win.

253
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,432
But if I make it to the end...

254
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,568
I'm top dog.

255
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,771
No, it ain't like that, look.

256
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,737
The pawns, man, in the game...

257
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,270
they get capped quick.

258
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,611
They be out of the game early.

259
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,750
Unless they're some smart-ass pawns.

260
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:24,824
Nagras. Can you fucking believe this?

261
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,126
This shit is prehistoric.

262
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,792
What else have they got
down there in Property?

263
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,269
Eight-tracks? Victrolas?
That fucking department's a joke.

264
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,964
We got to get with the feds somehow.

265
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,237
They got light-weights,
wireless micro-recorders.

266
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,237
Yeah, DEA got those.

267
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,640
If I wear this on a warm day,
they're gonna know.

268
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,273
Even if they do a half-assed search,
I'm done.

269
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,351
Nagras.

270
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,717
Jesus.

271
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,119
You can't send his ass into the projects
with this shit taped to him.

272
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,781
That ain't gonna play.

273
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,249
I'm saying.

274
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:55,849
McNulty and the girl...

275
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,191
the lezzer from narcotics,
they've got the file.

276
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,527
- Who are you partnered with?
- McNulty.

277
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,293
But he don't have shit to do with me and
I don't want nothing to do with him neither.

278
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,700
Major, I'm a fifth wheel
on a car that's going nowhere.

279
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,637
Bring me home.

280
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,704
Soon enough.

281
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,246
Look, you're my eyes and ears
in this mess, right?

282
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,409
And I don't want no more surprises,
like that newspaper article.

283
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,953
If McNulty's planning
any more bullshit like that...

284
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,252
I got to be able to tell the deputy
before the shit flies.

285
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,454
Then you come home
with a favor in your pocket.

286
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,025
How bad is that?

287
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,153
Lieutenant.

288
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,326
You get Carver and Prez back tomorrow,
but Prez is in-office.

289
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,901
No police powers, no street work, nothing.

290
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,833
If the building catches fire,
he stays in the office.

291
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,669
- What about Herc?
- Medical, until Monday at least.

292
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,083
I wonder what you gotta do
to get thrown off this police force.

293
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,412
Keep on with some of your shit,
you just might find out.

294
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:32,147
Where are the fucking run sheets?

295
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,556
Behind the board.

296
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,391
You all go for a taste?

297
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,226
We got your picture,
don't you fucking worry, McNulty.

298
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,539
This is Barksdale?

299
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,340
Avon Barksdale.

300
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:57,749
I don't think so.

301
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,043
Read my lips.

302
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,244
Avon fucking Barksdale.

303
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,184
His name's on the form in the file.

304
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,846
Excuse me for giving a shit...

305
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,222
but I can't help but notice
this is a middle-aged white man.

306
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,657
You want something different,
you give me another name.

307
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:15,790
That's the only Avon Barksdale
in the housing department files.

308
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,761
You got your smokes?

309
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,133
Have a nice fucking day.

310
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,543
Maybe he's white.

311
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,511
No, I mean, really. What do we really know?

312
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,185
"Avon Barksdale.

313
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,484
"31 years of age.

314
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,923
"Born Provident Hospital, West Baltimore...

315
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,427
"to Willette Jackson Barksdale...

316
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,187
"father unknown.

317
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,356
"Educated Baltimore city schools."

318
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,925
Address is in the same public housing
where he controls the drug trade.

319
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,664
No flash, no profile.

320
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,936
Pretty much comes up out of nowhere.

321
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,307
No work history.
No tax information we can look at.

322
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,306
No cars in his name, no driver's license.

323
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,439
No kids.

324
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,416
No priors either.

325
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,854
Yeah, here's this vague CI information...

326
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,219
that states he stays in
various apartments out in the county.

327
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,555
Addresses undetermined, of course.

328
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,259
He moves from girlfriend to girlfriend...

329
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,888
might have another girlfriend in New York.

330
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:22,863
He likes to work out...

331
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,903
and he used to box Golden Gloves
when he was younger.

332
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,001
I've been working on him for two weeks
and the truth is, we don't know shit.

333
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,337
Golden Gloves?

334
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,670
How did you hear that?

335
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,342
I don't know.

336
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,048
I think I got that from a DEA File.

337
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,882
Or from a Cl...

338
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,787
who claimed to know him way back when.

339
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,225
So you write everything down?

340
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,065
Yeah, everything.

341
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,808
- Goddamn bomb, y'all.
- Blue-tops, blue-tops.

342
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,506
Double shorts.

343
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,975
In the hole, man.

344
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,170
Got blue-tops. Looking for blues?

345
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,772
In the hole, y'all.

346
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,984
- Blue-tops.
- Red-tops.

347
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,387
- Red-tops.
- Two for $10.

348
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,182
Blue-tops, blue-tops.

349
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:47,774
Keep your jab moving.

350
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,850
Move with your right. Left, right, left, right.

351
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,518
Two punches.

352
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,726
I got a few questions
I wanna ask you, Mack.

353
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,066
Keep your hands moving,
work to the body some.

354
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,071
So who's your target?

355
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,607
- Barksdale.
- Who?

356
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,208
Avon Barksdale.

357
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:14,668
- Never heard of him.
- That's the thing.

358
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,805
This guy's got
the Westside projects locked up.

359
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,941
He's tied to maybe a dozen murders,
he's completely off the radar.

360
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,780
- Avon, what was it?
- Barksdale.

361
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,013
If you say so.

362
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,013
DEA has a couple of pages
on him from NADDIS entries.

363
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,718
Nothing in NCIC, no adult arrests.

364
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,389
I've been working drugs
for the Bureau since '98.

365
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,431
I can tell you, we got
nothing on him that I know.

366
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,901
This little thing...

367
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,830
is the smile of the week.

368
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,097
Watch this.

369
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,965
- What?
- What was that?

370
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:45,940
Get the door.

371
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,146
It's a career case.

372
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:57,551
Not that my bosses
give a damn at this point.

373
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,714
Why not?

374
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,124
Why not?

375
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,786
All of them mopes in bracelets
and not one of them named Osama.

376
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,261
I owe you, brother. What do you need?

377
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:10,061
A couple of lightweight body mikes.
Wireless, remote taping capability.

378
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,394
That's all?

379
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:15,763
Where I come from,
we're just happy to be in the 20th century.

380
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,843
Who's running the case,
so I can tell my squad supervisor?

381
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,276
Daniels, out of Narcotics.

382
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,649
All right, no problem.

383
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,918
Shit! Fucking rain, man.

384
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:34,014
All right, y'all know what the fuck this is.

385
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,253
- Up against the wall, hurry the fuck up.
- Come on, let's go.

386
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,058
Go on to the back.
Ain't got time for this shit.

387
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,430
Got some red-tops, some testers.
Get them around the corner.

388
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,868
Hurry up, take them around.

389
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,333
What the fuck you looking at me for?

390
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,409
Get your ass around the corner.

391
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,920
I want that shit, that's good.

392
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,016
Keep it moving.

393
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,675
- Man, you see that?
- Yeah.

394
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,107
Third from the end. That's the stash.

395
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:31,944
Some real raggedy-ass shit here, boy.

396
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:33,843
Very sloppy.

397
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:41,854
How old are your kids?

398
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,351
Mike is 8, Sean's 10.

399
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,861
That's the hard part.

400
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,195
Yeah, that's the hard part, but you know...

401
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,429
- How often do you get to see them?
- Every other weekend.

402
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,002
Trying to get more, but she's fighting me.

403
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:58,041
- Why would she fight you on that?
- She's getting even.

404
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,771
Getting even?

405
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,869
You must've been fucking around.

406
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,282
- I'm just saying.
- You're right.

407
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,709
It's always the case.

408
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,650
A woman wants to get even,
there's something extra there.

409
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:12,052
How come you got all this wisdom
and your life's so fucking hard?

410
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,284
I've been wondering on that myself.

411
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,429
How about you? You ever been married?

412
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:24,826
What'd I say?

413
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,268
- If you ain't gonna say anything, I am.
- What?

414
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,034
If you're a dog,
you barking at the wrong pussy.

415
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,866
What, so I'm a dog now?

416
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,172
- Meow.
- Bubbles.

417
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,506
I date women.

418
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,550
We've got something else in common.
I date women, too.

419
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,552
So pretty much everyone in CID
has worked this out but me?

420
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,214
There wasn't nothing to figure out.
I told them.

421
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:49,453
- I guess I missed the press conference.
- It's better that than to have every police...

422
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,587
on three shifts hounding you
every goddamned day.

423
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,829
- Cops are dogs.
- Yeah.

424
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,831
It's not like I was walking around...

425
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,530
waving some dyke flag in the air,
or some shit.

426
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:07,043
- I know I look like I could go either way.
- Lord, yes, you do. Yes, you do.

427
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,080
It was something I had to put out there
to get through the day.

428
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:12,809
- I should've known.
- Should've known what?

429
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:17,579
I worked with one other female police officer
who was worth a damn, only one.

430
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,122
- A lesbian.
- Yeah.

431
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:27,523
In the beginning, you're in your radio car...

432
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,095
alone, working your post.

433
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,995
- Most women aren't getting out of that car.
- Right.

434
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,434
Not without side partners showing up.

435
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,709
They're intimidated, physically.

436
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,941
- They gotta be.
- You weren't?

437
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,114
Yeah, at first.

438
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:47,347
But I'm talking about some old
straight-out-of-the-academy-type scared...

439
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,476
you know what I'm saying?

440
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:50,383
I wasn't about to stay scared.

441
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:54,254
You know, you get your ass kicked
once or twice...

442
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,351
you realize
it's not the end of the world, right?

443
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,862
Most of the women,
they don't want to believe that.

444
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:03,593
Some of the men, too.
They don't even want to go there.

445
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,136
- You think 'cause you're gay?
- I don't know.

446
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,996
But is there any other fucking way
to police?

447
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,071
All I know is I just love the job.

448
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:21,046
- That'll be $3.20.
- Keep the change.

449
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,949
Thanks, have a nice day.

450
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,395
Dee coming up.

451
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,148
Where's it all go?

452
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,859
The money. Where do all the money go?

453
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,472
$22,000 or $24,000, give or take.

454
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,374
From the low-rises?

455
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:56,939
Damn, boy!
You must have that crew humming.

456
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,540
I don't remember a day
we ever got this much from the Courtyard.

457
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,514
It wasn't even check day.

458
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,521
You doing good out there, Dee.

459
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,951
We'll be doing even better
when we get that new package.

460
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,163
New package, same as old, man.

461
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:14,454
- Say what?
- Ain't no new package.

462
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,297
Just gonna put that same shit
out in a different color gelcap is all.

463
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,802
Might spike that shit with some procaine
or some caffeine, but otherwise the same.

464
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,398
String, man,
people are already coming back on us...

465
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,172
- telling us that shit is weak.
- I know, the shit is weak.

466
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,803
But shit is weak all over.

467
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:34,107
The thing is, no matter what we call heroin,
it's gonna get sold.

468
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,379
The shit is strong, we're gonna sell it.

469
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,785
The shit is weak,
we're gonna sell twice as much.

470
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,084
You know why?

471
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,455
'Cause a fiend,
he's gonna chase that shit no matter what.

472
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,752
It's crazy, you know?

473
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:50,564
We do worse, and we get paid more.

474
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,933
The government do better,
and it don't mean no never mind.

475
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,935
This shit right here, Dee, it's forever.

476
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,919
That's your bonus right there.

477
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,153
And you buy something
that you wouldn't otherwise.

478
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,452
Thanks, man.

479
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,194
All right.

480
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:43,984
You remember me?

481
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,746
Do I remember you?

482
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,655
I was in here the other day,
you wanted a drink.

483
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,860
- Did I get a drink?
- Afraid not.

484
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,561
Then why would I remember you?

485
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,763
You want to be remembered,
you going about it the wrong way here.

486
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:01,896
All right.

487
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,205
The usual.

488
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:14,081
This here's my uncle's place.

489
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:15,708
You kin to Orlando?

490
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,421
No.

491
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:24,687
Orlando's like the up-front man, you know?
My uncle's the money man.

492
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,929
- Where you from?
- Right here.

493
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:37,004
- Baltimore.
- I know Baltimore, but, like, where?

494
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,737
You know Turner Station?

495
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,005
Down past Dundalk, near the Point.

496
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:47,606
The Point. So, you're a country girl.

497
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:52,282
- You mean county.
- Where I'm from, the county is the country.

498
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,819
Where is that?

499
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:00,455
So...

500
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,058
are you working with your uncle?

501
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,403
I'm his right hand.

502
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,281
Yes, you is.

503
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,983
You want to ride with us in the van?

504
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,118
- No.
- Why not?

505
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,854
You think it's a waste?

506
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,327
Touts and children,
that's all you're gonna get.

507
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,267
Bingo.

508
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:50,805
Where did you get this?

509
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,387
Now, look at this piece of shit.

510
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:09,156
I'm good to go, right?

511
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,360
Come here, let me see.

512
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,403
Detective Sydnor's ensemble.

513
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,134
It's the latest in Westside Project wear.

514
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,403
Have your torn cammies by Versace...

515
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,810
stained sweatshirt by Ralph Lauren.

516
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,813
- Where you miked?
- Down in my dick, man.

517
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,012
I figure they ain't gonna
go down there, right?

518
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:33,056
I don't know, Sydnor,
the way you twirling around...

519
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,318
might be the first place they look.

520
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,515
Fuck you.

521
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:40,930
I ain't showered in two days,
I ain't shaved in four.

522
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:45,000
Right now, I am one ripe,
nasty son of a bitch.

523
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,496
Bubbs.

524
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,701
What you think?

525
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,799
This your man?

526
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:54,770
Yeah.

527
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,739
Is he low-bottom enough for you?

528
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,979
Clothes is tore down enough...

529
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,646
but he could use a little bit more stains,
more dirt.

530
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:10,855
- What's this here, man?
- It's my wedding ring.

531
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,394
Shit, you married to the needle, boy.

532
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,266
That shit been pawned off, if you for real.

533
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,003
It's a dead giveaway.

534
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:24,603
You could stand to lose about 20 pounds,
some yellow in your teeth...

535
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,737
fresh bleeds on your hands.

536
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:30,343
So maybe I should go out
and shoot up dope for a year or two, right?

537
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,282
- Come back when I can carry the look off?
- I'm just saying, man.

538
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,486
The more tore down you look, the better.

539
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,719
You going down in them towers,
they gonna check everything.

540
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,225
How about the shoes?

541
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:47,093
I know you ain't got no problem
with the shoes, fucked up as they are.

542
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,093
Let me see the shoes, man.

543
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,296
See?

544
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,597
You walking down them alleys
of the projects...

545
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:57,697
you stepping on the dead soldiers.

546
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,840
- Dead soldiers?
- Yeah, empty vials.

547
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:05,075
You can't walk down a Baltimore street
without them cracking underneath your feet.

548
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,413
You want to know if a fiend is for real...

549
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,452
check the bottom of his shoes.

550
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,016
Okay.

551
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,149
Have him dance on some empties
before we go out there.

552
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,361
Get us killed.

553
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,532
He hurt your feelings?

554
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:23,861
A little bit.

555
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:29,830
Shit.

556
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,621
Four hand-to-hands...

557
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:05,324
two to me, two to Bubbs,
with me close enough to mark it.

558
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,463
- From who?
- Kids, mostly.

559
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,331
Young-ass hoppers.

560
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,268
It's a start.

561
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,610
They're pretty tight out here, Kima.

562
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,146
If you don't hand no money
to nobody that matters...

563
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,115
you don't get no product
from nobody that matters.

564
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:24,511
You want to go back in?

565
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,716
Shit, we copped from every crew out here.

566
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:33,560
Ain't we supposed to go off somewhere
and fire this shit up?

567
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,729
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.

568
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:53,813
Well, now.

569
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:00,554
Did you get to see where the money went
after you handed it off?

570
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,485
No.

571
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,289
Nothing but touts and runners here.

572
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,492
But then again, you told us so.

573
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,730
I didn't say that.

574
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,531
But as a matter of fact...

575
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,018
- Everyone else roll out?
- I...

576
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:35,659
You were upstairs and out of pocket,
so I cut them loose.

577
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,061
Just as well.
I'll give them the news tomorrow.

578
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,524
What happened?

579
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,733
I told the Deputy we had
a few hand-to-hands.

580
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,857
Low-level people.

581
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,835
He wants us to put everything
into search-and-seizures...

582
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:48,577
and hit the projects Wednesday afternoon.

583
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:49,904
- Lieutenant.
- I know.

584
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,771
Does he think that's what
gets us Avon Barksdale?

585
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,105
The buys we made,
they don't even go past the courtyards.

586
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:00,481
Scratch together everything
we got from the hand-to-hands...

587
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:02,950
and shape it into PC for the warrants.

588
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:04,714
A few locations, at least.

589
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,256
But we don't even know what doors to hit.

590
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:11,692
A few apartments in the low-rises
that we've seen used for stash.

591
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:12,990
Then we write on those.

592
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,930
Lieutenant, these guys change
stash houses every other day.

593
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,025
Look, the man upstairs wants to see
a circus.

594
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:22,196
A couple of days from now,
I got to show him three rings.

595
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,534
Christ.

596
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,603
I'm sorry. We gotta jump.

597
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:44,051
- What, is the Deputy Ops stupid?
- No.

598
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,062
This shit is fucking stupid.

599
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,596
Not if we bring in some arrests...

600
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,565
he takes them to the judge,
he figures the judge goes away.

601
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,364
And then he buries the fucking case.

602
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,442
What are we gonna do?

603
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,841
There's nothing you can do,
except pound out some probable cause.

604
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,710
- We're gonna be here all fucking night.
- I'm not.

605
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:07,873
- Where the fuck you got to go?
- No, I mean, I can't.

606
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,385
I'm not gonna help them gut the case.
I'm sorry.

607
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,218
I know he's your lieutenant.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

608
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,588
But I can't swallow this shit anymore.

609
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:53,785
- Why are you here?
- I'm thinking about something.

610
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:55,964
- Can I come in?
- No.

611
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,056
No?

612
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,429
What's the matter, McNulty?
No one ever tells you "no"?

613
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,564
Sorry. I should've called.

614
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,872
How do you clone a beeper?

615
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,072
- What?
- That's what I need to know.

616
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,883
You show up at my door at 9:00
to ask me that?

617
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,350
They're using pagers, right?

618
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:20,412
Every other drug dealer has a cell phone,
and these guys are all on pagers.

619
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,226
What do you want to do?

620
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,455
Bunk and me, when we jack up
the Barksdale kid...

621
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,125
he's got a Motorola pager.

622
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,465
We give it back, so as not to spook him.

623
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,294
You want to clone it?

624
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,540
Can we do that without a subpoena
to the pager company?

625
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:44,907
Read that.

626
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:48,880
- What is it?
- Affidavit from a state police case.

627
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:52,383
A judge signs something like that,
you can clone a beeper.

628
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:53,581
Christ.

629
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,558
Probable cause,
coupled with an exhaustion argument.

630
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,662
You've got to show the judge
that other investigative methods have failed.

631
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:04,966
You'll also need a supervisor
who wants you to clone a suspect's pager...

632
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,594
knowing that it might lead
to who knows what else...

633
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,366
pen registers, wiretaps.

634
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:11,365
Daniels will come around.

635
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,571
Daniels will have your ass.

636
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:19,449
Thanks.

637
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,240
- That's it?
- What?

638
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,082
No.

639
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:42,636
Let me understand.

640
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,771
You're married,
and a date's a room at the Best Western.

641
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,676
Now you're single, and a date
is you coming over unannounced...

642
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,909
to learn the legal requisites
for a pager intercept.

643
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,251
Pretty much.

644
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:58,822
No.

645
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,058
Okay, I hear you.

646
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,258
You?

647
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,726
As if you give a shit.

648
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,790
You're an asshole, McNulty.

649
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,755
What the fuck did I do?

650
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:22,194
- How much more to that pack?
- 50, 60.

651
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,606
Re-up's late.

652
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,102
Have Wallace hit Stinkum
on his pager again.

653
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,245
You want something from carry-out?

654
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,476
Yeah, lake trout sub.

655
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:36,178
Pay up.

656
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:38,221
Damn.

657
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,457
You asked, I thought you was treating.

658
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,684
You thought wrong, I ain't no bank.

659
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,527
You stingy like one.

660
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,222
Just make sure you give me enough.

661
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,266
- No mayo, extra hot, something to drink.
- All right.

662
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,234
- He's going for food?
- Yes.

663
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:03,538
Why didn't you tell me?
My stomach's growling like a motherfucker.

664
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,945
- Starve, nigger.
- Man, shit.

665
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,611
Re-up's here.

666
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:09,881
Stink, what up?

667
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,215
What's up, bro? 10 minutes.

668
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:14,424
- 10?
- Yeah.

669
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,583
All right.

670
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,230
Who's there?

671
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,744
Y'all got my back, you heard?

672
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,710
Get the fuck in there.

673
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,623
Get your ass down.
Sit your stupid ass down.

674
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:52,559
Get the fuck down. Shit, stay there, bitch.

675
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:56,622
Get down, get the fuck down, motherfucker.

676
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,265
Where it at?

677
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,828
- Ain't nothing here.
- Where it at, man?

678
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,406
Shit! Fuck, my leg!

679
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,813
Where it at, shorty?

680
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:22,720
- Kitchen, under the sink.
- Go on and get that.

681
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,366
Two G-packs. Let's roll.

682
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:43,412
- Just two?
- Come on.

683
00:44:43,513 --> 00:44:45,242
What the...

684
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,883
Stupid.

685
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:03,462
Shit!

686
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:06,502
Let's get the fuck out of here.

687
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,767
Shit!

688
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,772
Come on, Poot.

689
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,351
Fuck!

690
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,336
- So, your man saw them get jacked?
- Yeah, part of it.

691
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:54,110
- And he gets the tag number?
- Good man, that Bubbles.

692
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,213
Listen up.

693
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,615
Western uniforms will meet us
in the Mount Claire parking lot.

694
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:05,388
We start there, and we don't stop
until we take the doors.

695
00:46:05,495 --> 00:46:08,328
I want their lookouts
to have as little chance as possible.

696
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,064
What's with you?

697
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,495
My office.

698
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,951
- I'm not going.
- You're insubordinate?

699
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,785
I'm not jumping out
on something that will harm the case.

700
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:38,088
- You want to write me up on that, you can.
- You think I want this?

701
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,527
I got the Deputy Ops on my ass for this shit.

702
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,928
Now you show me up
in front of the whole detail.

703
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,694
I don't mean to show anybody up.

704
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,359
- Get your vest on.
- No.

705
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,531
I got police work to do.

706
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,070
If you felt this way,
why didn't you call in sick?

707
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,403
I'm not sick.

708
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:55,973
Yeah, you are.

709
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,751
Give me a 95 on why you are physically
unable to participate in today's action.

710
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,051
What, I'm gonna lie so you can save face?

711
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,785
Come on, write it up.

712
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,726
"I can't jump out with my unit
because my tummy hurts."

713
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,421
I'm not gonna help you gut this case.

714
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,398
If you want to pretend to be police,
you go ahead.

715
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,446
Let's do it.

716
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,053
I'm up.

717
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,326
- You're on medical.
- I'm up, boss.

718
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,232
Give him a vest.

719
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,773
No, motherfucker.
It ain't just up to Stinkum to be muscle.

720
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,215
You got the Pit.

721
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,617
Your people supposed
to be ready for the re-up.

722
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,785
You supposed to be steady for him.
But where you at?

723
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,917
You in the goddamn sandwich shop.

724
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:21,562
You got $20,000, Dee,
coming into your shop...

725
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,293
and you ain't even around
to see that shit right.

726
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,698
Look, I thought re-ups...

727
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:29,465
No, thinking was what you wasn't doing,
and now we look like bitches.

728
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,599
You feel me? We got to come back on them.

729
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,303
And you can't even tell me shit
about who they was.

730
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,880
One of them was named Omar.

731
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,350
- Omar?
- Omar, that's the name I heard.

732
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:46,087
- And they had a white van.
- Yeah, I saw the van...

733
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,090
- What kind of van?
- Five-0.

734
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:08,337
- Wrong door.
- Yeah?

735
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,572
Yeah, switched it yesterday.

736
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,547
Let's see your hands.

737
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,584
Get out of the way. Let's see your hands.

738
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:18,381
Up, motherfucker, up. Turn around.

739
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,954
All the way up.

740
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,766
Police. Put your hands up. Put them up!

741
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:37,096
Turn your monkey ass around.
Put your hands at your back.

742
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,799
Why you fucking with us, man?

743
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,844
Come on, man, damn,
I wasn't even doing shit.

744
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,540
Come on, man.

745
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,876
Cuff that one, and that one.

746
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:53,785
Motherfucker, how's that feel?

747
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,121
You fucked up now. You feel it, right?

748
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,527
Why you ain't swinging?

749
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,235
Motherfucker. Go ahead,
play that cowboy shit, motherfucker.

750
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:10,965
Hold him down. Hold his arms!

751
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:15,244
Spread your legs.
Don't make me kick your ass, too.

752
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:16,367
Come on!

753
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,107
Get him. You don't hit a cop.

754
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,913
What's wrong with you, boy?
You wanna hit a cop?

755
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:57,420
If you'd been here earlier,
you'd have seen a beating.

756
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:01,447
Clean. Not a fucking thing in there.

757
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,527
Pick any door in the low-rises.
What are the chances?

758
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:26,542
Channel 2 wants to know if she can film
some of the places we raided.

759
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,448
She says whatever we got, she'll put on film.

760
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,414
- Whatever we got?
- Drugs, weapons.

761
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:35,290
We ain't got shit.

762
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,443
I can tell you were never in patrol.

763
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,716
Right.

764
00:52:14,497 --> 00:52:16,829
- Sorry I'm late.
- What's up?

765
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:22,161
I didn't want to tell you in front of the girl,
her being from Narcotics and all.

766
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,171
Daniels is dirty.

767
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,166
What?

768
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,406
The guy running your case,
he's got dirt on him.

769
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:30,870
You know this?

770
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,309
Your own agency came to us with
concerns about him last year.

771
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,884
Integrity questions.

772
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:39,954
They didn't want to go to internal Affairs.
That office leaks like a sieve.

773
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:43,082
Plus they couldn't handle a case
if their lives depended on it.

774
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:45,923
- That, too.
- You looked at Daniels specifically?

775
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:48,293
We did a two-month assets investigation.

776
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:51,299
The man has a couple hundred thousand
more in liquid assets...

777
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,631
than any police lieutenant should ever have.

778
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:57,264
Maybe he goes to Atlantic City. Seriously.

779
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,177
You look at his background?
Maybe he's got other sources of income.

780
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,539
Maybe. We never got the chance
to go further.

781
00:53:03,646 --> 00:53:04,613
Why not?

782
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:08,543
We went to your Deputy for Operations
and told him what we had.

783
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:11,586
- You took it to Burrell?
- He says, "We'll take it from here."

784
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,384
So, we backed away and waited
for something to happen.

785
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,722
- And waited.
- That was a year ago?

786
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,459
Maybe more.

787
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,493
And that fucker's still
the Supervisor for Narcotics.

788
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,266
So, you tell me what the hell's going on.

789
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,973
Anyway, if he's running your case,
I just thought you'd want to know.

790
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:34,844
Thanks.
