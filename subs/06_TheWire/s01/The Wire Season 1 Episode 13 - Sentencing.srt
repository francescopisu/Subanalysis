1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,700
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,856
Hey, now.

3
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:35,138
We called earlier, they said you were up...

4
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:38,072
and by the time we get here,
you're back asleep.

5
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:44,245
- Been there long?
- No.

6
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:47,310
20 minutes.

7
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:52,222
You know, we didn't want to
exactly disturb you.

8
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:54,591
I'm bored, is all.

9
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:56,756
Yeah, but still.

10
00:00:58,331 --> 00:00:59,821
So, what you got for me?

11
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:03,995
- Spreads?
- Yeah.

12
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:13,106
Little Man. For sure.

13
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,974
That's good. Are you able to write?

14
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:28,926
Okay. Number two.

15
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:42,769
I can make Little Man,
because he's in the front...

16
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:46,304
trying to snatch the cash off the dashboard.

17
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:53,148
But the other one, he's outside in the dark.

18
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:58,286
- So...
- So, you know, it's okay.

19
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:05,156
Is there anyone here that you do recognize?

20
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:08,256
Sure. Wee-Bey.

21
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:15,363
All right.

22
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:20,204
Let me tell you where we're
coming from with the shooters.

23
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,175
We tracked their escape route,
and Landsman came up with their hoodies.

24
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,541
Now, DNA matched...

25
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:29,217
human hair from one of the hoodies
to Wee-Bey.

26
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:32,251
Freamon, he tracked
a call from the pay phone...

27
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:35,919
near the scene, to Stringer Bell's pager.

28
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:38,757
Now, the caller was
using Bey's beeper code.

29
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:42,724
Crime lab, they lift a print...

30
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:46,336
off a soda can near that phone,
and that matches Little Man.

31
00:02:47,674 --> 00:02:51,371
You know, so, you know, I'm saying...

32
00:02:57,984 --> 00:03:00,817
Okay, hear me out.

33
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,181
There's a downside here.

34
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:06,883
We don't have the guns...

35
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:10,294
no prints from the scene, no witnesses.

36
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:14,858
But worse, we're going to be dealing
with a Baltimore city jury...

37
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,401
and a good man is hard to find in this town.

38
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:21,236
Twelve of them together, especially.

39
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:30,774
An ID of both your shooters...

40
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,153
will play a whole lot easier come trial.

41
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:41,684
Yeah.

42
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:46,723
Sometimes things just got to play hard.

43
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:38,470
We got everyone on our list except C.C.O.

44
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:40,411
We hit his mama's house...

45
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:43,641
and she says that he went up
to Wabash for some court date.

46
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:47,185
You can get on the computer
and see if any of the Sheriff's deputies...

47
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:49,550
can snatch him up in some courtroom.

48
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:54,616
Yeah. No, we got Ronnie Moe.

49
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,429
I'm looking at him
go in the jail van right now.

50
00:05:58,531 --> 00:05:59,555
All right.

51
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:04,662
- Fished our limit. Let's go home.
- "Sir."

52
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,204
- Huh?
- "Let's go home, sir."

53
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:11,106
You're looking at
a soon-to-be-made sergeant.

54
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:14,011
So what I'm saying is,
when we're around the troops...

55
00:06:14,113 --> 00:06:16,673
you got to get used to
showing the proper respect.

56
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:19,979
So, "Let's go home, sir." All right?

57
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,498
What's the count?

58
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,967
So far we've picked up 12.
That leaves seven on the wing.

59
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:45,107
Anything worthwhile?

60
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:49,078
Some phone numbers that match,
scraps of nicknames, not much else.

61
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,170
We need something now.

62
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:54,185
They'll shut us down unless we come up
with something fresh to run with right now.

63
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:57,256
The wires are dead.
The bug in the club is useless.

64
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:59,916
They're moving out of there
even as we got up on them.

65
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,653
- To where?
- No clue.

66
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:04,355
But they're going to have to set up again.

67
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,860
Either Barksdale moves
to reset his distribution...

68
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:08,126
or he gives up the towers.

69
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,862
- If not Avon, then Stringer.
- And why not Avon?

70
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,900
With no priors, he's out
two hours after the bail review.

71
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:17,199
What we put on Barksdale
barely makes him break stride.

72
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,938
Okay, so we get a hint of
where they're setting back up.

73
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:21,946
We ask the State's Attorney for a new bug...

74
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,777
maybe even a wire if we get onto a phone.

75
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,441
Not while the deputy breathes air.

76
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:28,452
We'll be reassigned
before you finish typing up your affidavit.

77
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:30,021
How about the feds?

78
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:33,458
You think the Deputy's
going to let you take this mess federal?

79
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,390
Why does the Deputy need to know?

80
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,926
McNulty, you are a piece of work.

81
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:43,626
McNulty.

82
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:46,838
Yeah?

83
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:51,737
No shit.

84
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,039
No fucking shit.

85
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,783
It's Rhonda Pearlman.

86
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,285
She just got a call from an assistant
public defender in North Jersey...

87
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:05,482
who claims to represent
a man by the name of D'Angelo Barksdale.

88
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:08,725
Meet me in Homicide. Bring a tape recorder.

89
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,092
No drug lawyers? No Levy?

90
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,061
- Case got some legs on her, don't she?
- Don't she?

91
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:19,700
Quarter of a million dollars bail.
You believe that shit?

92
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,898
It hurts to even show that kind of money.

93
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:27,202
- Where Levy at? He ain't at the club, is he?
- No, club's out. We can't talk there no more.

94
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:32,210
- Come on, man, let's get out of here.
- What's up, baby?

95
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:37,750
So, this is it?

96
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,155
Look, before you go anyplace else,
before you talk anyplace else...

97
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:43,556
we got to think this through.

98
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:46,856
We're up to almost 20 arrests at last count.

99
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:50,264
And if you look at the probable cause,
they all read just like yours:

100
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:52,366
Information from a confidential source.

101
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:55,065
Don't this seem way too much
for one snitch?

102
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:58,541
I agree. My gut tells me a wire.

103
00:08:58,644 --> 00:09:03,104
Either a phone or two,
or maybe something in a room somewhere.

104
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:05,909
Talked to your nephew
on the phone about the Jersey thing?

105
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:07,883
No. Of course not, man. No phones.

106
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:12,117
When I talk to him, I talk to him face-to-face,
in my office, in the back of the club.

107
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,852
- Fuck.
- It's good you moved out of there.

108
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:18,794
I don't know, man.
I mean, if they got a mike up in there...

109
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:21,128
they got you and me saying all kind of shit.

110
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,961
That reminds me. He said he'd be in tonight.

111
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:30,637
- Thing is, they take you and leave me?
- That's what's fucking me up, too, man.

112
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:34,372
Look, we'll know soon enough,
as soon as I start pressing for discovery.

113
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,948
What do you want to do
about the people they locked up?

114
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,950
- We got to pull them.
- That's showing a lot of money.

115
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,919
If we don't,
we run the risk of making them enemies.

116
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:45,490
Speaking of which,
where are you with your nephew?

117
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:47,491
Is he going to see the light or what?

118
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:50,357
Let me tell you something, man.
He family, all right?

119
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:51,790
He not going to buck.

120
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:54,661
A day or two in the New Jersey bullpen,
he gonna be crying...

121
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,962
waiting for bail money like the rest of them.

122
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,093
All right.

123
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:02,170
So, let's run the money through the families,
that'll hide it some.

124
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:05,269
- And don't use the same bondsman.
- All right.

125
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:07,072
Look, gentlemen, I know it's early...

126
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:09,545
I want you to start thinking
about who was charged...

127
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:11,411
and what kind of time they can do.

128
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:15,648
One of the ways to limit your exposure
is what's called a structured plea.

129
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:18,724
That means that you're going to
have to deliver your people...

130
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,054
all of them, down to a man.

131
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,924
I saw your girl today, for the idents.

132
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:27,023
How's she doing?

133
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:29,033
Okay, I guess.

134
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:32,095
She's out of the ICU.

135
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:34,434
Moving slow, but moving, you know?

136
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:38,570
Jimmy, you ain't been to see her?

137
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:40,440
No. I couldn't go in.

138
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:43,304
This ain't about you, right?

139
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:46,776
I get back from Jersey, I will.

140
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:51,382
I will.

141
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:56,355
You know, Cole and me,
we showed her the spreads.

142
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:58,322
Picked out Little Man, no problem.

143
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,194
Wouldn't go for Wee-Bey.
So, I tried the fat finger.

144
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,730
Damn near down on my knees begging her...

145
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:06,430
to make this play easier in court.
You know what she said?

146
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:09,465
"Sometimes things got to play hard."

147
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,342
Real police.

148
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:14,773
Oh, yeah.

149
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:26,818
- What the fuck did you do to her?
- I don't know.

150
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:32,256
You two in the same car
going to make for a long-ass drive to Jersey.

151
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:33,657
Shit.

152
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:15,102
Damn, man, it's just too still in here.

153
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:32,853
You know what? We can...

154
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,056
This place will be fine.

155
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:42,156
All we really got to do
is put a little safe in here someplace...

156
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:44,793
and let them know the count
comes here from now on.

157
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,194
Period.

158
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:50,602
Damn, boy, when y'all change up, y'all...

159
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:55,672
Y'all that paranoid?
You ain't even been up in there before.

160
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,849
I'm telling you, sis, this shit is different.

161
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,147
We are not going to talk about
nothing indoors. It's a new day.

162
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:04,022
Thing is, man,
we got to get back on our feet.

163
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,114
You know, I mean, the longer we hold off...

164
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:08,489
the harder it's going to be
to maintain the towers.

165
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:11,893
You want to get it back up,
you lean to me and String here.

166
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:14,090
- No, I ain't down yet.
- You need to step back.

167
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:16,793
She's right, bro.
You can't take a second chance here.

168
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:18,469
You know what I'm saying?

169
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:21,062
Until you fixed,
sis going to handle that money...

170
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:22,970
I'm going to handle the products.

171
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:24,906
- We're here for you.
- All right.

172
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:29,042
But you tell Roberto,
he got to make it a serious smoker.

173
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:31,480
I want them motherfucking fiends
in the projects...

174
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,847
I want them dropping like flies.
You feel me?

175
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:37,480
You send out the word,
you let them know we ain't dead yet.

176
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:41,855
- What about my nephew?
- Don't fret.

177
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:46,288
Give me a chance to get with Roberto,
and I'll get up to Dee.

178
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:48,059
Do what needs doing.

179
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,697
Tell him I'm sorry for putting him
out there like that.

180
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:54,833
And that I'm going to make it up to him.

181
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,635
You going to make it up.

182
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:57,834
Most def.

183
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:06,747
But again, I want to make it clear...

184
00:14:06,852 --> 00:14:10,151
that all of this cooperation
is contingent on a commitment...

185
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:12,223
that my client finds acceptable.

186
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:13,382
Failing that...

187
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:16,825
- everything said in here, stays in here.
- Damn straight.

188
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,387
I'm sure a proffer in Maryland
plays much the same in Jersey, counselor.

189
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,557
And I do agree that with regard to matters...

190
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:25,694
involving drug trafficking,
your client has been helpful.

191
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:29,871
He's indicated a willingness to testify
that he was a lieutenant...

192
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:32,739
in Avon Barksdale's
drug distribution organization...

193
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:35,780
sold large quantities of drugs for his uncle.

194
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:38,475
Delivered money,
attended organizational meetings...

195
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:42,418
and on one occasion made a trip
to New York on the behest of his uncle.

196
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:45,490
All of which corroborates
much of what we already know.

197
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:48,921
What else is there?

198
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:50,827
The murders.

199
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:53,397
Man, why do you keep on that?

200
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:55,522
I already told you...

201
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know nothing about
that witness being killed.

202
00:14:58,103 --> 00:14:59,570
Which witness?

203
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:02,640
Remember her?

204
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:04,733
Jesus.

205
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:09,478
- They did her?
- Yeah, about the same time they did the boy.

206
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:20,491
All of them bodies.

207
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:28,093
- They covering up, man.
- Yeah, that's what we think.

208
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,033
- No loose ends.
- I can understand the guard.

209
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:33,405
She got paid, so she had to go.

210
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:37,803
Orlando, he knew too much,
got to snitching, so he had to go.

211
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:40,945
But then there's the kid...

212
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:43,036
Wallace.

213
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:48,685
But I need to go past Argyle Street tonight.
Check in with Wallace.

214
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:49,754
Wallace?

215
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,982
He off the hook
since we helped the tower crew...

216
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,080
get that stick-up boy.

217
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:54,955
I'm telling you, man, Wallace is bugging.

218
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,494
Don't hardly even come out
of that room no more.

219
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:00,622
- Now, why he be like that?
- I'm thinking he might be getting high.

220
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:03,064
- Wallace?
- The boy's scaring me with his shit.

221
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,659
- All right, holler at me later.
- That'll work.

222
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:09,706
You got that shit on tape?

223
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:18,344
- God!
- His name is Brandon Wright.

224
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:22,415
Burned him, broke fingers,
gouged an eye out, all kinds of fun.

225
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,712
Wallace was the one who saw.

226
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:29,324
He saw the boy.

227
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:32,894
But he really didn't
think about what they'd do.

228
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:36,627
You must have known.
You were standing there by that pay phone.

229
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:38,635
- You knew.
- What was I going to do?

230
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:43,901
I don't call String, word get back uptown,
what's going to happen then?

231
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:47,172
So, you told Wallace to wait,
then you called Stringer...

232
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,474
and Stringer, he gathered the troops.

233
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,116
Yeah.

234
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:54,680
And down at the Greek's,
they got Wallace to point the finger, right?

235
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:59,416
Then they went in like cops with handcuffs,
so they could take their time on Brandon.

236
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:02,085
They dropped the body where we'd see it.

237
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:05,524
"Send a message to the 'jects," they said.

238
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:06,928
Wallace...

239
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,196
he couldn't handle that.

240
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:13,293
After seeing that, he wanted to get out...

241
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,863
go back to school.

242
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:20,738
We even joked about it,
him being 16 and all...

243
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,214
needing to go start back
over again as a freshman.

244
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,945
About a week ago, my uncle and String,
they called me down to the club.

245
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:32,347
Stringer, he's all worried about Wallace,
and I told him.

246
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,652
I said, "Wallace ain't no snitch."

247
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:37,626
Plus, he's out the fucking game.

248
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:40,325
I told him that.

249
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,326
But I needed to do more.

250
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,201
I should've done more...

251
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,634
but I didn't, and, fuck, that's on me.

252
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,538
Any idea who they sent at Wallace?

253
00:17:58,183 --> 00:18:01,209
Come on, Dee, wild guess.

254
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:05,787
Man, I don't know, could've been anybody.
You know, shooters come cheap.

255
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:08,323
I don't think so. Not in the Pit.

256
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:12,030
Not in his crib.
I counted seven beds when I was up there.

257
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,965
- Where were the young'uns?
- Look, if I knew, I would tell you.

258
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:20,403
All right? I swear to God, I would tell you.

259
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,838
They've charged with Orlando
and the undercover cop...

260
00:18:26,378 --> 00:18:27,970
but we're still hunting.

261
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:34,018
Him, he in Philly.

262
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:38,650
- How you know?
- I know 'cause I dropped him there.

263
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:39,746
Where?

264
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:43,089
I don't know, a corner, North end,
I don't know where he be staying.

265
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:45,755
Did Wee-Bey say anything
to you about the shootings?

266
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:49,491
We don't talk shop in the car.
It's a rule we got.

267
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,165
So, is that it?

268
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:57,868
Your client must realize
that any agreement...

269
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:00,809
is dependent on his full cooperation.

270
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:02,539
There ain't nothing else.

271
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:12,883
Deidre.

272
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:19,730
Tap, tap, tap.

273
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:27,532
She was one of my uncle's girls.

274
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:30,767
But we got people who put you with her
the night she's killed.

275
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:33,242
Yeah, I didn't know
that he was going to do her.

276
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:35,341
I swear. They played me.

277
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:36,939
How so?

278
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:43,586
My uncle gave me an eight-ball of coke.

279
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,820
Told me to take it over there to her.

280
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:49,854
I was surprised, 'cause, you know,
I thought he dumped her.

281
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:52,259
But he said, no, it wasn't like that no more.

282
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:55,028
So, he had Wee-Bey take me over there.

283
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,828
You know, I walked up,
knocked on the door...

284
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:01,337
she came to the door, all naked and shit,
with this little-ass robe on.

285
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,739
So, she's your uncle's girl,
but she comes to the door for you naked?

286
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:07,311
She used to do that shit
with me all the time, man.

287
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:10,973
Teasing. You know how girls do.
Maybe you don't.

288
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:13,915
I don't know.

289
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:18,552
Anyway, I'm like,
"Ain't you going to let me come in?"

290
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,750
She says "No,"
because she got to get ready...

291
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:22,588
for my uncle to come by later.

292
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:24,919
So, I give her the coke.

293
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:29,098
She laughs about how she's going to
put that shit on ice, for later on.

294
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,768
Refrigerate it.

295
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:37,064
I don't know shit about no refrigerator.
Like I said, I didn't go in.

296
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:39,541
I turned around,
started walking back to the truck...

297
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:41,043
and I heard this shot.

298
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:44,912
Wee-Bey, he come running back with
this big-ass .45 he liked to use so much.

299
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:47,814
Tells me how he was tapping
on the window, real soft.

300
00:20:47,986 --> 00:20:50,511
How with the lights on,
she had to walk all the way up...

301
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:53,420
because she couldn't see
what was on the outside.

302
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:57,286
And when she gets up
to the window and looks out...

303
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,033
You did good, D'Angelo.

304
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:08,705
Yeah, you did.

305
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:26,382
Y'all don't understand, man.

306
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:29,255
Y'all don't get it.

307
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,287
You grow up in this shit.

308
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:36,792
My grandfather was Butch Stamford.

309
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:40,130
You know who Butch Stamford
was in this town?

310
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:47,503
All my people, man,
my father, my uncles, my cousins...

311
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,113
it's just what we do.

312
00:21:53,618 --> 00:21:56,746
You just live with this shit...

313
00:21:57,656 --> 00:21:59,419
until you can't breathe no more.

314
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:06,055
I swear to God,
I was courtside for eight months...

315
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:10,858
and I was freer in jail than I was at home.

316
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:14,570
What are you looking for?

317
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,342
I want it to go away.

318
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:22,480
- I can't...
- I want what Wallace wanted.

319
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:24,748
I want to start over.

320
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,317
That's what I want. I don't care where.

321
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,547
Anywhere. I don't give a fuck.

322
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:34,785
I just want to go somewhere
where I can breathe like regular folk.

323
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:38,286
You give me that...

324
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:42,397
and I'll give you them.

325
00:22:47,138 --> 00:22:50,297
No, that's great. Really great.

326
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:52,467
Yeah.

327
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:56,138
That's our move.

328
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:03,177
Okay.

329
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:15,560
We broke it open tonight. Wide open.

330
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:18,099
I'm bringing this case in big.

331
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:25,972
So, this squares things with Burrell, right?

332
00:23:29,948 --> 00:23:31,472
To hell with the man.

333
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,347
But I think we might have enough
to reach out to the feds...

334
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:36,283
try to run this thing through them.

335
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:37,377
Cedric.

336
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:39,787
He knows about the money, Marla.

337
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,959
He's known for a long while.

338
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:45,856
Fact is, I wouldn't be surprised
if it's why he picked me for this case.

339
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,227
What does he... What are you going to...

340
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:53,532
He's got me if he wants me.
Thing is, I don't think he wants me.

341
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,067
Too much at stake.

342
00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:58,503
Too much mess.

343
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:05,314
Kind of like this case.

344
00:24:09,187 --> 00:24:12,782
I have to admit it, Jimmy,
this is a great case.

345
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:16,292
Not just because of Greggs,
because it goes to that and answers that...

346
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:18,919
but because of how deep it goes.

347
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,521
I mean, the murders, the money...

348
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:26,031
Jesus, I feel like I've been drunk
ever since that kid started talking to us.

349
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:27,661
You okay to drive?

350
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:30,240
I can drop you home.
You can pick up your car tomorrow.

351
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:35,245
No, I'm good.
I'm great, this was fucking great!

352
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:40,017
You want to try to go federal with this?
I am up for it.

353
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:44,817
I get cross-designated as an AUSA,
and we can really run with it, you know?

354
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:49,557
Career fucking case.

355
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,692
Anyway...

356
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:05,634
Ronnie, the thing at...

357
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:09,880
Levy's the other day, I was...

358
00:25:10,315 --> 00:25:11,373
I was...

359
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,492
Jesus, Ronnie, not here.
What are you doing?

360
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:27,357
Like you never did it
in the headquarters garage before?

361
00:25:44,883 --> 00:25:47,545
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

362
00:25:47,652 --> 00:25:50,455
Look what just walked in
without a fucking escort.

363
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:54,080
Downtown Roy Brown, the living legend...

364
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,217
in his own mind.

365
00:25:57,395 --> 00:25:59,329
Uptown Lester Freamon.

366
00:25:59,864 --> 00:26:01,991
Fuck me, how long's it been?

367
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:05,725
Your retirement party, wasn't it?
And this is retirement?

368
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:07,862
Yeah. Nice fucking digs?

369
00:26:08,373 --> 00:26:11,399
I asked my supervisor when
I'll see a little sunlight.

370
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:15,043
Runt cocksucker says,
"When your unit turns a profit."

371
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,240
But enough of my joy.

372
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:20,612
What do you guys need?

373
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:23,847
We need a trap and trace,
but not in Maryland.

374
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:27,888
- Pennsylvania, Philly.
- You got to go through them.

375
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:30,756
We try that, we lose a week,
they tell us it can't be done...

376
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:32,887
then another week to okay our subpoena.

377
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:35,795
It's a little more complicated
than just a straight-up trace.

378
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,030
We actually need a list of phones in Philly
that called this number in the past week.

379
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:44,337
- What's the number?
- Drug lawyer, downtown office.

380
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:48,068
Thought Billing would be the place to look.

381
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:52,281
If we can do it, and I'm not saying we can...

382
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:54,908
it's going to be a fucking week, maybe two.

383
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:58,381
Thanks, Roy.

384
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,220
Lester, isn't this supposed to be the time...

385
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:04,386
you tell me how
all-fired fucking important this is?

386
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:14,902
The Philly number gives us the mope
who shot that female undercover.

387
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:23,642
I'm telling you, Fitz, it's the perfect case.

388
00:27:23,748 --> 00:27:25,739
- You'll love it.
- It sounds great.

389
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:29,676
But like I said, Jimmy,
we're not fishing for drug cases anymore.

390
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:31,379
Try DEA.

391
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:33,889
No, that field office is too close to our CID.

392
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:36,825
We go there, our bosses know it
before a meeting is scheduled.

393
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:39,396
Your bosses don't know you're doing this?

394
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:42,891
Who'll be coming?

395
00:27:43,234 --> 00:27:45,998
Me, a detective name of Freamon,
and Daniels.

396
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:51,199
I can speak for Daniels, brother.
He's played this thing out with real heart.

397
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,710
Come on, set something up.

398
00:27:57,215 --> 00:27:58,239
All right.

399
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,591
Could I get 10 copies?

400
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:14,188
- 10 copies?
- 10, right.

401
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,074
No problems?

402
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:27,268
No.

403
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:29,635
No?

404
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,115
All right, man, I'll get at you.

405
00:28:46,264 --> 00:28:47,731
You locked that door, right?

406
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:52,362
Yeah? All right, so listen.
It's not street-ready, all right?

407
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:55,165
So, everybody got to work
on their own cut and vial up.

408
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:58,436
Now, listen to me,
tell them to get this straight.

409
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:04,513
Three parts of this, all right?
To one of raw, all right?

410
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:07,174
And that's how we gonna do
until we get the new stash.

411
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:10,584
And I want you to put the word out there
that we're back up.

412
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:12,622
Understand me?

413
00:29:12,824 --> 00:29:14,018
We're back up.

414
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,820
It's a good target.

415
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:18,525
You guys have a pretty good case here.

416
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,927
Look at the violence alone.

417
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:23,398
There's at least a dozen murders,
including state's witnesses.

418
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:27,335
If you can help us squeeze the Barksdale kid
into a witness protection program...

419
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:28,803
we can run wild with this thing.

420
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:32,673
- No suppliers though.
- We're still looking for a way into that.

421
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:35,977
There was nothing on the wire
that took us toward New York.

422
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,483
The trouble is,
we have these post-9I11 protocols.

423
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:42,945
We can't pick up any new narcotics work...

424
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:45,716
unless it goes to priority
organized-crime targets.

425
00:29:45,823 --> 00:29:49,725
Meaning Cosa Nostra or Colombians.
Or Russians maybe.

426
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:51,795
We don't have any Colombians in Baltimore.

427
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:53,158
We don't have any wise guys.

428
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:56,893
All we got is a whole lot of locals
a little busy tearing the Westside apart.

429
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,902
I hear you,
but the Bureau-wide protocol applies.

430
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:03,331
To run with you on this,
we need a recognized OC target...

431
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:06,569
or, even better, a connect to
counterterrorism or corruption.

432
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:08,236
You go near stuff like that...

433
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:10,746
we have something
we can bring to our ASAC.

434
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:12,577
What kind of corruption?

435
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:14,084
Don't know.

436
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:15,777
What kind you got?

437
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,590
Poot, we up yet?

438
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:23,854
- Where Roc-Roc at with the shit?
- Package in.

439
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:25,851
Who is it?

440
00:30:25,964 --> 00:30:28,524
- Onion and them off-brand niggers.
- Onion?

441
00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:33,767
- What the fuck they got?
- Some shit they call yellow tops.

442
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:35,332
Yellow tops?

443
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:39,769
Got them yellow tops, y'all, yellow tops.

444
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:46,507
Yellows tops.

445
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:49,518
- Got them yellow tops.
- Motherfucker, what the fuck is up?

446
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:51,748
Fuck is y'all doing?

447
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:55,620
Do what you feel.
But be ready to finish what you start.

448
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,656
What you doing?
This ain't no open market, you know that.

449
00:30:58,763 --> 00:31:00,003
Ain't no market at all, nigger.

450
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:03,090
You ain't got shit to sell.
Back that ass up for those that do.

451
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:05,135
- You know what?
- What?

452
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:07,397
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

453
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:15,503
- See, that's why we can't win.
- Why not?

454
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,877
- They fuck up, they get beat.
- We fuck up, they give us pensions.

455
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,754
Close it! Get the fuck out of here!

456
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:46,969
Heard you ain't much as an eyeball witness.

457
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:50,175
Bad as any civilian.

458
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:52,776
Guess so.

459
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:58,586
Where we at?

460
00:31:59,624 --> 00:32:00,921
With what?

461
00:32:01,025 --> 00:32:02,754
With the case, fool.

462
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:05,792
Jesus, give it a rest.

463
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,663
What's on the wire?

464
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,661
- Come on, man.
- Wire's dead.

465
00:32:16,174 --> 00:32:18,904
They changed up after we
hit them with raids.

466
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,978
Daniels didn't tell you?

467
00:32:21,512 --> 00:32:22,774
Hell, no.

468
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:25,982
He only talks to me about the good shit.

469
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:29,514
About how y'all were
onto my shooters and stuff.

470
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:34,284
Yeah, well, we lost the wire,
but the good news is D'Angelo's flipped...

471
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,456
- and we're talking to the feds about maybe...
- Fuck both y'all.

472
00:32:43,768 --> 00:32:45,235
She wants me to quit.

473
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:50,065
Says there ain't nothing worth this.

474
00:32:50,842 --> 00:32:53,072
So, I promised her I'd think about it.

475
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:57,010
What do you say?

476
00:32:59,717 --> 00:33:01,014
I don't know.

477
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:06,320
I guess you should do what you need to.

478
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:09,391
But she's right.

479
00:33:11,028 --> 00:33:12,518
It isn't worth it.

480
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,489
No?

481
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:21,700
Yeah. Probably not.

482
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:32,348
Anyway, what took you so long
getting up in here?

483
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:36,912
Shit, no cards, no flowers.

484
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:39,182
I mean, what the fuck, Jimmy?

485
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:40,551
I couldn't, I...

486
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:44,256
I felt...

487
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,490
A case like this, it's always you or Sydnor...

488
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,796
or some other black cop
who ends up going undercover.

489
00:33:57,842 --> 00:33:59,833
I swear, if I could do it over...

490
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:04,875
If I...

491
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:07,744
If I could do it over...

492
00:34:10,288 --> 00:34:11,812
you know what I'd do?

493
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,059
Put more tape on that fucking gun.

494
00:34:20,865 --> 00:34:22,196
I'm sorry, Kima.

495
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:25,797
I'm sorry.

496
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,542
Anyway, since I got you up in here...

497
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:34,338
acting like my bitch and shit...

498
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:38,348
with all your guilty-ass crying
and whatnot...

499
00:34:41,352 --> 00:34:43,183
maybe you can do something for me.

500
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:47,447
She said you were doing good.
Said she was proud of you.

501
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:52,218
How's she doing?

502
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:54,857
Still shook.

503
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:57,966
But she wanted you to have that...

504
00:34:58,069 --> 00:35:01,129
and told me to tell you
she's sorry to be late with it.

505
00:35:02,473 --> 00:35:04,668
Girl got such heart, you know?

506
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,367
Yeah.

507
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:12,478
This is enough for what
I got going now, man.

508
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:15,551
You give the rest back to her.

509
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:18,815
Are you sure?

510
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:30,161
Give her my love.

511
00:35:31,002 --> 00:35:32,060
Right.

512
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:36,631
McNulty.

513
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:42,039
Don't tell her.

514
00:35:51,188 --> 00:35:53,019
- What you got, man?
- Over there, man.

515
00:35:53,557 --> 00:35:57,926
Un-fucking-believable.
Five guys got jumped. Not just you.

516
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:01,360
- Four other guys jumped me.
- I'm sorry, man.

517
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,759
It's got to be all the brutality complaints...

518
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,327
which means it ain't never gonna matter
how well I do on no fucking test.

519
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:11,272
You don't know that.
You might make the next list, you know?

520
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:12,969
You don't know.

521
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:16,142
Guess I ain't leadership material.

522
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:18,875
- Congratulations, Carv.
- Thanks.

523
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:22,609
Yeah?

524
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:41,864
The world is on its ass.

525
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,010
Guy called for you from the phone company.

526
00:36:48,112 --> 00:36:51,013
Says he's got the number you wanted
for a house in Philadelphia.

527
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:52,446
Beautiful, thank you.

528
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:03,089
- Good casework.
- Thank you.

529
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:05,058
I don't think I'm giving anything away...

530
00:37:05,162 --> 00:37:07,926
by telling that Arnold here
has had a file on Senator Davis...

531
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:09,032
for two and a half years.

532
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,331
It took us a while to see it,
but the quid pro quo is right there...

533
00:37:12,436 --> 00:37:14,734
in that Westside redevelopment mess.

534
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:18,138
Barksdale, or his fronts,
grease enough city politicians...

535
00:37:18,242 --> 00:37:22,269
and word comes back years in advance
where the development zone's going to be.

536
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,871
He buys up every piece
of garbage real estate he can...

537
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:27,473
flips it three or four times,
exaggerating the values.

538
00:37:27,585 --> 00:37:29,075
The city's gonna pay him millions...

539
00:37:29,186 --> 00:37:31,484
to condemn the properties
for the renewal project.

540
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:34,080
It's a lot to work with, but we're willing.

541
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:38,020
The question is,
can your cooperator give us the senator...

542
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,753
or any other political figure?

543
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:42,597
- The cooperator?
- D'Angelo Barksdale.

544
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,867
What does he have for us on the money?

545
00:37:50,074 --> 00:37:51,268
Nothing.

546
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:54,103
He gives you the drugs and the violence.

547
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:56,475
He gives you Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.

548
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,811
- And they give us the senator.
- Maybe, yeah.

549
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:03,080
You're talking about turning Barksdale
and Bell into cooperators...

550
00:38:03,187 --> 00:38:05,280
and making the politicians
the primary target?

551
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:06,549
Of course.

552
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:09,519
No, fuck the politicians. It's Barksdale and Bell.

553
00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:12,557
Those guys have
turned West Baltimore into a free-fire zone.

554
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:13,960
No one's saying they walk.

555
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:16,555
What you are saying is that
if we bring you the case...

556
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:19,761
it's your intention to let Barksdale
and Bell reduce any sentence...

557
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,201
they get through cooperation?

558
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:24,638
Jesus Christ, are you kidding?
You're seeing all this ass-backwards.

559
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:28,405
Detective, in this office we have a mandate
to pursue political corruption.

560
00:38:28,512 --> 00:38:29,945
Can you believe these guys?

561
00:38:30,047 --> 00:38:31,844
- Jimmy, look.
- What?

562
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:35,778
Drugs and murder don't cut it anymore?
How about terrorism?

563
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,186
These guys have dropped 14, 15 bodies.
The witnesses, cooperators...

564
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,919
That kind of hyperbole
doesn't serve anyone, detective.

565
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,932
I think we're going with
a different direction on this.

566
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,732
Thank you for your time.

567
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:03,007
West Baltimore is dying,
and you empty suits...

568
00:39:03,113 --> 00:39:06,879
are running around trying to pin
some politician's pelt to the wall.

569
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:11,746
Thought you was real police, brother.

570
00:39:37,715 --> 00:39:40,081
So, they got you all the way out here?

571
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:43,378
I started out thinking you was in Jersey.

572
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:45,783
You ain't in Jersey.

573
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,018
I figured they still got you
down in Central Booking.

574
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:52,058
But, all the way out here...

575
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,754
Do send a message, though.

576
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:57,390
Yeah, a message needs sending.

577
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:00,302
How y'all even find me?

578
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:05,002
Ain't no one going to keep
a mother from her son, right?

579
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:13,678
You know, he's always talking family.

580
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:17,343
"Family is the heart," he say.

581
00:40:17,755 --> 00:40:19,985
Well, I'm family...

582
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,114
ain't I?

583
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:26,152
What about me for once?

584
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:29,032
It ain't right.

585
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,967
What's right?

586
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:37,902
You like for him to step up,
take all the weight, and let you walk?

587
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:41,304
Because he will. You know he will.

588
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:44,380
But if he got to go away...

589
00:40:44,615 --> 00:40:47,175
that mean you got to step up
and fill his shoes.

590
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:49,149
You ready for that?

591
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:51,684
Ma, you know I ain't.

592
00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:55,090
I ain't ready,
and I'm never gonna be ready for this game.

593
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:56,682
- Dee, come on.
- Look.

594
00:40:57,561 --> 00:41:00,257
They're giving me a chance to walk away...

595
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:02,756
to start again someplace else.

596
00:41:04,935 --> 00:41:06,698
And what you giving them?

597
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:13,867
Look...

598
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:18,913
He messed up, Dee, he knows it.

599
00:41:20,618 --> 00:41:23,678
Now if you want to get even
with him, you can.

600
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:27,520
But if you hurt him,
you hurt this whole family.

601
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:31,389
All of us. Me and Trina and the cousins.

602
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:34,921
And Donette, too. And your baby.

603
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,031
Your own baby boy.

604
00:41:38,836 --> 00:41:41,396
This right here is part of the game, Dee.

605
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:43,265
And without the game...

606
00:41:43,374 --> 00:41:45,899
this whole family would be
down in the fucking Terrace...

607
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,170
living off scraps.

608
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:49,905
Shit, we probably wouldn't even be a family.

609
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:52,805
Start over?

610
00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:57,181
How the fuck you going to
start over without your peoples?

611
00:41:57,354 --> 00:41:59,049
Without your own child, even?

612
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:06,390
If you ain't got family in this world...

613
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:08,560
what the hell you got?

614
00:42:13,504 --> 00:42:17,201
This motherfucker Wee-Bey twitches,
there won't even be a trial.

615
00:42:19,743 --> 00:42:22,303
Detective Carver, a word?

616
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,151
Shut the door.

617
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,066
What's up, Lieutenant?

618
00:42:46,737 --> 00:42:48,398
Anything you want to tell me?

619
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,708
Been weeks now...

620
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:57,838
the Deputy Ops knows what's going on
in this unit almost before I do.

621
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:01,347
Except last week...

622
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:04,415
we run the bug up
into Barksdale's club office...

623
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:08,547
and Burrell, for once, he's a step behind.

624
00:43:09,626 --> 00:43:10,786
You see it?

625
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,256
- Maybe he...
- I see it.

626
00:43:18,135 --> 00:43:19,864
I look around the office...

627
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,963
and I see that one of my people
is at the academy for in-service.

628
00:43:27,044 --> 00:43:29,308
Lieutenant, I swear, it wasn't my idea.

629
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:32,946
I'm minding my business,
doing my fucking job...

630
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,314
when the man calls me
for coffee and a Danish.

631
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:38,980
I mean, I never even been on
the eighth floor of that fucking building.

632
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:40,716
And there's the Deputy fucking Ops...

633
00:43:40,824 --> 00:43:43,349
telling me how concerned
he is about the case...

634
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:46,762
how he needs to be informed.

635
00:43:49,066 --> 00:43:51,728
I mean, he's the Deputy fucking Ops, man.

636
00:44:05,382 --> 00:44:07,077
Couple weeks from now...

637
00:44:07,518 --> 00:44:09,486
you're gonna be
in some district somewhere...

638
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:12,851
with 11 or 12 uniforms
looking to you for everything.

639
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:17,286
And some of them
are going to be good police.

640
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:19,920
Some of them are going to
be young and stupid.

641
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,930
A few are going to be pieces of shit.

642
00:44:22,032 --> 00:44:25,593
But all of them will take their cue from you.

643
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:29,662
You show loyalty, they learn loyalty.

644
00:44:29,773 --> 00:44:32,537
You show them it's about the work,
it'll be about the work.

645
00:44:32,643 --> 00:44:36,579
You show them some other kind of game,
then that's the game they'll play.

646
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,182
I came on in the Eastern...

647
00:44:48,892 --> 00:44:51,986
and there was a piece-of-shit lieutenant
hoping to be a captain...

648
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,359
piece-of-shit sergeants
hoping to be lieutenants.

649
00:44:54,464 --> 00:44:58,901
Pretty soon we had piece-of-shit patrolmen
trying to figure the job for themselves.

650
00:44:59,002 --> 00:45:03,098
And some of what happens then
is hard as hell to live down.

651
00:45:16,486 --> 00:45:21,116
Comes a day you're going to have to decide
whether it's about you or about the work.

652
00:45:34,938 --> 00:45:36,906
Grand jury came in Tuesday.

653
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:39,437
But you knew that, right?

654
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:44,178
We're working a flight warrant today.

655
00:45:44,548 --> 00:45:48,314
There's a lot to do here, in-office.

656
00:45:50,254 --> 00:45:52,484
I'd be careful with that, though.

657
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:55,319
I understand the trigger pull
used to be light.

658
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:29,191
Keep him down, keep him down.

659
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:33,725
You got him? Get him up there, get him up.

660
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,059
Bunch of low-bottom bitches.

661
00:46:39,703 --> 00:46:42,501
- Get his wrists.
- Y'all didn't have to fuck with my ride.

662
00:46:48,312 --> 00:46:50,109
Motherfuckers got lucky.

663
00:47:04,628 --> 00:47:05,652
Yeah?

664
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:13,530
Podunk lawyer in Denton's
giving the guards a hard time...

665
00:47:13,637 --> 00:47:16,435
about moving D'Angelo
from original jurisdiction.

666
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,530
Put the call through.

667
00:47:19,576 --> 00:47:20,565
Okay.

668
00:47:22,379 --> 00:47:27,078
Officer Mace, ASA Pearlman,
you got a problem with the lawyer?

669
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,420
Okay, put the asshole on.

670
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:36,385
This is he.

671
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:50,737
You do not make it easy, Jimmy.
I have to admit, I am deeply ambivalent.

672
00:47:51,441 --> 00:47:53,409
- Excuse me?
- Sit.

673
00:47:54,277 --> 00:47:55,437
Sit!

674
00:47:57,547 --> 00:48:01,142
- Here.
- I heard from Bunk.

675
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:03,751
Philly. Great work.

676
00:48:04,221 --> 00:48:05,848
You all did great work.

677
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:08,987
And the number of clearances
I'm looking at here...

678
00:48:09,092 --> 00:48:13,426
Christ, for the first time this year,
we got the clearance rate up over 40%.

679
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,861
That's on the one hand.

680
00:48:15,198 --> 00:48:18,861
On the other hand, I know the Deputy Ops
got a call from the first deputy...

681
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:20,402
U.S. Attorney this morning...

682
00:48:20,504 --> 00:48:24,099
asking whether an asshole such as yourself
really works for us.

683
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:28,237
Of course, this is the first the Deputy
hears his troops...

684
00:48:28,345 --> 00:48:30,779
are creeping behind his back
to take a case federal...

685
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:33,941
when they've already been told
the case is closed.

686
00:48:35,652 --> 00:48:37,381
You're a good detective.

687
00:48:37,754 --> 00:48:40,484
And I've got to admit
you got some stones on you.

688
00:48:41,058 --> 00:48:44,084
Did you actually call
the first deputy an empty suit?

689
00:48:48,832 --> 00:48:50,800
I want to see you land okay, Jimmy.

690
00:48:51,535 --> 00:48:54,561
So, tell me, where don't you want to go?

691
00:48:58,442 --> 00:49:02,538
You all know that Baltimore city jurors
are capable of just about anything.

692
00:49:02,646 --> 00:49:05,171
Now, look, you want to sit
around for months on end...

693
00:49:05,282 --> 00:49:07,011
going through a bunch of half-heard...

694
00:49:07,117 --> 00:49:10,348
half-said telephone conversations
and see how well you do...

695
00:49:10,654 --> 00:49:13,919
- I'll certainly respect the effort.
- It's not just talk on the wire.

696
00:49:14,024 --> 00:49:16,458
We've got seized money
and lot of dope on the table.

697
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,527
And a lot of violence.

698
00:49:17,627 --> 00:49:19,959
All of which stops
way short of Mr. Barksdale.

699
00:49:20,063 --> 00:49:21,052
You know this.

700
00:49:21,164 --> 00:49:24,861
All of it except for the New Jersey bust.
That one he eats.

701
00:49:25,602 --> 00:49:27,069
Maybe he does.

702
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:30,103
Maybe he pleads to one count
of attempted possession...

703
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:32,607
and takes, I don't know, maybe three, four.

704
00:49:33,143 --> 00:49:35,703
Maybe he can arrange
for everyone you have...

705
00:49:35,812 --> 00:49:37,677
on those tapes to follow suit.

706
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:42,141
Maybe you get five-year pleas from those
with no prior felony convictions...

707
00:49:42,252 --> 00:49:45,949
10 years for those with one prior,
15 for two or more.

708
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:47,648
What about the murders?

709
00:49:47,757 --> 00:49:50,157
Maybe we acknowledge
you've got Mr. Brice cold for...

710
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,024
murder of Orlando Blocker
and wounding of the police officer.

711
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,394
- Who?
- Wee-Bey.

712
00:49:55,665 --> 00:49:57,292
Representing Mr. Brice...

713
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,028
I'm fairly confident that
to avoid the death penalty...

714
00:50:00,137 --> 00:50:04,164
he'll proffer to at least a half dozen
of your open murders.

715
00:50:04,274 --> 00:50:06,139
Naming co-conspirators?

716
00:50:06,243 --> 00:50:09,610
For that kind of cooperation,
I'd be willing to consider straight life.

717
00:50:09,713 --> 00:50:10,680
No, indeed.

718
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,409
I believe Mr. Brice is ready
to take sole responsibility...

719
00:50:14,518 --> 00:50:16,076
for all of his crimes.

720
00:50:16,186 --> 00:50:19,519
Still, you walk away
with at least a half-dozen clearances.

721
00:50:19,623 --> 00:50:20,612
Assets.

722
00:50:20,724 --> 00:50:23,625
You take the strip club,
you take whatever trucks and cars...

723
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:27,356
you can link to the drug trafficking,
and also whatever cash you've seized.

724
00:50:27,464 --> 00:50:31,423
He's got dozens of other properties:
the funeral parlor, the towing company.

725
00:50:31,535 --> 00:50:35,434
No. You get the cars, because you
can tie them to illegal activity.

726
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:37,336
But there's nothing else of his to take.

727
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,034
So, you keep most of the money,
most of the real estate...

728
00:50:40,143 --> 00:50:43,943
and Stringer Bell stays on the street
with his hand on the throttle.

729
00:50:44,347 --> 00:50:47,248
If you have a charge against Mr. Bell, file it.

730
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:51,810
Otherwise, I understand that nothing
in all those hours of tape implicates him.

731
00:50:56,092 --> 00:50:58,788
Three or four years ain't enough, Maury.

732
00:50:59,462 --> 00:51:01,327
Not for Avon Barksdale.

733
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:02,455
No?

734
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:07,727
Make an offer.

735
00:51:07,837 --> 00:51:11,170
Part 14 of the circuit court
of Baltimore City now in session.

736
00:51:11,274 --> 00:51:12,441
- Be seated.
- First up.

737
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:13,431
- Be seated.
- First up.

738
00:51:13,543 --> 00:51:16,478
State versus Avon Randolph Barksdale,
Your Honor.

739
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,014
One count of possession
with intent to distribute...

740
00:51:19,115 --> 00:51:20,446
to wit, a kilogram of heroin.

741
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,848
- You have a statement of facts?
- Yes, Your Honor.

742
00:51:22,953 --> 00:51:25,046
Mr. Barksdale is offering a plea of guilty...

743
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:27,817
in exchange for a maximum
of seven years in DOC...

744
00:51:27,924 --> 00:51:30,552
in consideration of
the following agreed-upon facts:

745
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,220
On or about the date
of September 17, 2002...

746
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,890
in the jurisdiction
of Essex County, New Jersey...

747
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:38,559
Trooper Robert Warren
of the Newark barracks...

748
00:51:38,668 --> 00:51:41,136
effected a traffic stop
on a rented Ford Taurus...

749
00:51:41,238 --> 00:51:43,365
traveling southbound near Exit 13.

750
00:51:43,473 --> 00:51:45,907
That traffic stop resulted
from information gleaned...

751
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:50,036
from electronic surveillance of Mr. Barksdale
and his nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale...

752
00:51:50,146 --> 00:51:52,171
by detectives assigned to a special detail...

753
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:54,716
under the command
of a city narcotics supervisor.

754
00:51:54,818 --> 00:51:58,515
A search of the vehicle, rented
from the Avis location at B.W.I. Airport...

755
00:51:58,622 --> 00:52:00,783
revealed that a kilogram
of nearly pure heroin...

756
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,757
was concealed beneath
the spare tire in the car trunk.

757
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,387
In accepting this plea, Mr. Barksdale
acknowledges his role in procuring...

758
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:11,524
those drugs with the intent to dilute,
package, and sell retail amounts of heroin...

759
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:15,696
Deidre Kresson, Roland Leggett,
Toreen Boyd, all tied to the same gun.

760
00:52:15,805 --> 00:52:19,536
Plus, we got the stick-up boys,
Brandon Wright, John Bailey.

761
00:52:19,643 --> 00:52:21,838
With Orlando, that makes six.

762
00:52:21,945 --> 00:52:23,970
Plus the attempted murder on a police.

763
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,308
That it?

764
00:52:25,582 --> 00:52:29,382
- I do better if I give them more?
- Life, no parole, means what it says.

765
00:52:29,486 --> 00:52:32,080
This proffer keeps you off death row.
That's all it does.

766
00:52:32,188 --> 00:52:35,021
You were on the wrong side
of a cop getting shot, Mr. Brice.

767
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:37,719
You want to dream
about straight life for these bodies...

768
00:52:37,827 --> 00:52:40,022
you got to wake up
talking about Avon Barksdale...

769
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,291
- and Stringer Bell.
- No.

770
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:45,197
But for murders, you might as well
give them what you have...

771
00:52:45,302 --> 00:52:48,135
because anything you leave out
is outside the deal.

772
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:50,832
If they learn about it later,
they can charge you later.

773
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,998
Fuck it then.

774
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:54,770
For another pit sandwich
and some potato salad...

775
00:52:54,878 --> 00:52:56,573
I'll go a few more.

776
00:52:58,848 --> 00:53:02,284
- How you want that?
- Medium rare, a lot of horseradish.

777
00:53:07,324 --> 00:53:09,383
All right, I did Little Man...

778
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:11,960
thinking he might get weak
on that cop getting shot.

779
00:53:12,062 --> 00:53:14,030
Yeah? Where's the body?

780
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,894
Druid Hill. Behind the reptile house.

781
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,436
You get back in them weeds,
you might could find what's left of him.

782
00:53:20,537 --> 00:53:23,199
All right, that's seven. What else you got?

783
00:53:25,108 --> 00:53:27,076
How about them witnesses?

784
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:32,206
The security lady,
and what's his name, the maintenance man?

785
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,317
Gant?

786
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:36,282
Yeah, Gant.

787
00:53:36,786 --> 00:53:38,515
You did Gant alone?

788
00:53:43,126 --> 00:53:45,617
They're out of potato salad.
How about slaw?

789
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:50,165
Information gleaned
from electronic surveillance...

790
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:53,827
would also show that
Mr. Watkins, a.k.a. Ronnie Moe...

791
00:53:53,937 --> 00:53:58,169
was integrally involved in the distribution
of heroin and cocaine in the high-rises...

792
00:53:58,274 --> 00:54:01,334
at 734 Fayette and 221 North Fremont.

793
00:54:01,444 --> 00:54:04,572
In exchange for his pleading guilty
to one count of conspiracy...

794
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:08,014
he agrees to a sentence
not to exceed 15 years in DOC.

795
00:54:08,118 --> 00:54:11,178
Mr. Watkins, who is on probation
for a drug distribution charge...

796
00:54:11,287 --> 00:54:14,222
that was adjudicated
in judge Prevas' court in August, 2001...

797
00:54:19,896 --> 00:54:21,090
Cedric!

798
00:54:22,832 --> 00:54:24,322
Major Cantrell.

799
00:54:25,735 --> 00:54:27,202
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

800
00:54:27,303 --> 00:54:30,500
- So, where they sending you?
- Northwest. Spurgeon's retiring.

801
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:35,144
- I heard that was going to happen.
- Ever feel like a change, give a yell.

802
00:54:35,245 --> 00:54:36,872
I could use a good shift lieutenant.

803
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,540
I mean, right now, the whole
fucking district's a mess.

804
00:54:39,649 --> 00:54:41,048
What isn't?

805
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,449
- Good seeing you.
- You, too.

806
00:54:50,226 --> 00:54:53,389
You see, this ain't no DEU. It ain't like that.

807
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:56,964
When you all came downtown,
the job changed.

808
00:54:57,066 --> 00:55:00,263
Down here, we make big cases,
big hairy-balled cases...

809
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:02,133
like this Barksdale thing, right?

810
00:55:02,238 --> 00:55:05,366
And all that mess
you call police work down in the districts...

811
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:09,002
all that fuck-somebody-up
and rip-and-run bullshit...

812
00:55:09,112 --> 00:55:10,670
it won't play down here.

813
00:55:10,914 --> 00:55:14,372
You think I'm kidding.
This is what makes cases, gentlemen.

814
00:55:14,484 --> 00:55:15,418
This!

815
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:18,618
Remember that.

816
00:55:33,803 --> 00:55:35,168
Nicely done.

817
00:55:44,814 --> 00:55:47,715
Motherfucker, I been here
since lunch, waiting.

818
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:50,081
Ain't nobody been through here.

819
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,047
You hear me?
I been waiting and y'all ain't about shit.

820
00:55:55,525 --> 00:55:57,254
Yeah, listen, listen to me.

821
00:55:57,627 --> 00:56:00,255
Look, if you feel like that,
then get off this phone...

822
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:02,729
come down here
and step to me then, nigger.

823
00:56:03,032 --> 00:56:04,590
Yeah, all right.

824
00:56:05,535 --> 00:56:08,299
Yo, if Roc-Roc ain't here
in 10 minutes with my re-up...

825
00:56:08,404 --> 00:56:10,099
whoop his ass, man.

826
00:56:24,787 --> 00:56:27,085
I understand you did
a tour in Homicide years ago...

827
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:31,149
but let me tell you how I run this unit,
because how I run it is how it runs.

828
00:56:31,294 --> 00:56:34,286
We work on a strict rotation.
You're up until you catch a call...

829
00:56:34,397 --> 00:56:37,833
then you step down, work your case,
and someone else steps up behind you.

830
00:56:37,934 --> 00:56:41,768
This is the way we do business in a town
with 250, 300 murders a year.

831
00:56:42,138 --> 00:56:43,571
And it works.

832
00:56:45,508 --> 00:56:48,807
You do not play the game for yourself,
you play it for us.

833
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:50,842
If you remember these few rules...

834
00:56:50,947 --> 00:56:53,711
you'll find me to be
supportive and reasonable.

835
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:55,579
Very reasonable, sir.

836
00:56:56,686 --> 00:56:59,814
- That's what they say about me.
- They say that, they do.

837
00:57:25,815 --> 00:57:27,043
Yo, Dink!

838
00:57:31,854 --> 00:57:33,845
What the fuck was that?

839
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,715
You take a nigger's money,
then you serve him?

840
00:57:36,826 --> 00:57:38,293
What the fuck?

841
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:44,792
I'm saying, you take their money...

842
00:57:44,901 --> 00:57:47,665
then you send them round
and let some other nigger serve.

843
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,135
The way you doing it...

844
00:57:49,238 --> 00:57:51,536
someone snapping pictures
got the whole deal.

845
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:52,903
You hear?

846
00:57:58,948 --> 00:58:01,178
We got to tighten up around here, yo!

847
00:58:09,759 --> 00:58:10,885
Jimmy.

848
00:58:13,363 --> 00:58:14,853
Hell of a case.

849
00:58:15,164 --> 00:58:17,428
Read all about it in the papers.

850
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:19,262
You done good, kiddo.

851
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:24,704
I gotta...

852
00:58:32,782 --> 00:58:34,977
D'Angelo Barksdale
supervised distribution...

853
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:37,780
in the low-rise courtyards
and was also involved...

854
00:58:37,887 --> 00:58:39,878
in the violence attributed
to the organization.

855
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:42,480
Further, he was arrested
by authorities in New Jersey...

856
00:58:42,592 --> 00:58:46,722
in possession of a kilo of raw heroin
intended for distribution in Baltimore.

857
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:49,127
He acknowledges his role
as a leading conspirator...

858
00:58:49,232 --> 00:58:52,292
and is already on parole
for two earlier counts of distribution...

859
00:58:52,402 --> 00:58:54,336
dating from March, 1999.

860
00:58:54,437 --> 00:58:56,029
What are you asking here?

861
00:58:56,139 --> 00:59:00,667
As Mr. Barksdale has two prior convictions
and is insisting that the effort to purchase...

862
00:59:00,777 --> 00:59:03,245
and transport the kilo
was done on his own behest...

863
00:59:03,346 --> 00:59:06,406
and is refusing to cooperate against others
in the conspiracy...

864
00:59:06,516 --> 00:59:10,384
the state is offering only the maximum
allowable 20 years, Your Honor.

865
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:15,050
Mr. Levy, this is your understanding
of the plea agreement?

866
00:59:15,158 --> 00:59:17,991
- Yes, sir.
- Very well then, Mr. Barksdale.

867
00:59:18,094 --> 00:59:20,927
- Can you hear me distinctly?
- Yes.

868
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,255
Are you now under
the influence of alcohol...

869
00:59:23,366 --> 00:59:25,334
- Wee-Bey, man.
- How'd it go?

870
00:59:25,435 --> 00:59:28,996
For life, no parole,
he puts himself in for Orlando...

871
00:59:29,105 --> 00:59:31,164
and the attempt murder on Greggs.

872
00:59:31,674 --> 00:59:34,199
Then he also takes Nakeisha Lyles...

873
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:38,371
Deidre Kresson, the two project murders
that match that gun...

874
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:41,348
both the stick-up boys, and Little Man.

875
00:59:41,718 --> 00:59:42,707
Little Man?

876
00:59:42,819 --> 00:59:45,947
Yeah, body found up behind
the reptile house in Druid Hill.

877
00:59:47,123 --> 00:59:51,583
He gave us that one just for fun, I think.
He also takes William Gant.

878
00:59:53,663 --> 00:59:55,153
I know, it's bullshit.

879
00:59:55,264 --> 00:59:56,856
How'd he tell it?

880
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:01,866
- Boom.
- He said a contact wound?

881
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:06,069
It doesn't play.
Gant had no compression, no stippling.

882
01:00:06,175 --> 01:00:08,507
Wound was to the front.
Bey's talking out of his ass.

883
01:00:08,611 --> 01:00:12,206
I know, but this motherfucker's
just taking murders just to take them.

884
01:00:12,315 --> 01:00:15,250
He's taking life, no parole,
for shooting a cop, what the fuck?

885
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:17,546
Might as well try to spring Bird
for killing Gant.

886
01:00:17,653 --> 01:00:18,711
All rise.

887
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:49,417
Jesus, what the fuck did I do?

888
01:00:54,056 --> 01:00:55,853
You happy now, bitch?

889
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:55,597
Are you the man with them jumbo sixes?

890
01:03:55,972 --> 01:03:59,635
- How many you fucking want?
- Take about three or four hundred.

891
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,470
Damn.

892
01:04:07,783 --> 01:04:09,512
All in the game, yo.

893
01:04:15,524 --> 01:04:17,219
Right, but I didn't think...

894
01:04:22,765 --> 01:04:23,566
For sure.
