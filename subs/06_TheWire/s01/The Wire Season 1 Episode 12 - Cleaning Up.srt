1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,700
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,781
How is she?

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,379
In and out of the morphine drip.

4
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,052
They got her stabilized is all I know.

5
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:27,322
Go on in.

6
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:29,687
No.

7
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:33,229
Unfreeze your ass off that wall, then.

8
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,330
Either pay your respects,
or get your head back into this case.

9
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:40,137
- Fuck this case.
- Fuck it?

10
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:43,535
Now you're just gonna, what,
call off your little crusade?

11
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,408
Is that what you think it was? A crusade?

12
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,382
Avon Barksdale was a way
to show everyone how smart I was...

13
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:53,579
and how fucked up
the department is, that's all.

14
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:56,287
Just put Jimmy McNulty
up on your shoulders...

15
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,417
march him around the room,
break out the keg.

16
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:04,465
It was never about
Avon Barksdale, Lieutenant.

17
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,330
It was all about me.

18
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:09,667
You think I didn't know that?

19
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,633
You think we all didn't know?

20
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,406
Listen, this case is gonna move forward...

21
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,212
with you or without you.

22
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,873
This case got her shot.

23
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:24,508
I put a battery up her ass...

24
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,247
and got her thinking
this case meant something.

25
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:31,085
And you know what?
Burrell, Rawls, and them, they were right.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,487
This case means exactly shit.

27
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,256
I know it meant damn near nothing to me
when you came in beating the drum.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,925
But now we got that woman
in there, that good police...

29
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,733
breathing through a fucking tube,
because it meant something to her.

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,298
And the shooters who dropped Kima?
They're still in the wind.

31
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,901
And whoever sent those motherfuckers
into that alley...

32
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:53,947
he needs to get got, too.

33
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:57,347
So you can stand there,
dripping with liquor-smell and self-pity...

34
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:00,012
if you got a mind to, but this case...

35
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:03,350
it means something. Now.

36
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,328
You hit them again?

37
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,403
I been calling them all morning.
They ain't hit me back yet.

38
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:59,098
Damn, we gonna tap out by noon.

39
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,405
Poot! What we got over there?

40
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,209
200, maybe.

41
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,606
What the fuck is this?

42
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,476
What the fuck you think, nigger? Fish food.

43
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,314
Give me my shit.

44
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,191
Heads up.

45
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,559
String.

46
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,830
I need your pagers.
All of y'all, the whole crew.

47
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,272
- Who else?
- Sterling, Cass and Manny.

48
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:38,368
- All right, go get them shits.
- How am I gonna talk to my girl?

49
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,141
Talk to your hand, nigger,
that's the only girl you got.

50
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,183
No more... Get out of here.

51
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:46,042
Just get the fuck out of here, man.

52
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,752
No more pagers.
Touts, lookouts, off the air, all right?

53
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:54,153
Nobody gonna use these cell phones
except for you and Bodie...

54
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,423
and y'all don't say shit on these,
you understand me?

55
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,159
We got the numbers
and we the only niggers that need them.

56
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:03,135
Not your moms, not your girl, nobody.
You feel me?

57
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,932
You use these phones to set up a meet,
go to that meet...

58
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,140
and talk face to face, period.

59
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,110
- So no more pay phones?
- You deaf? I said no phones.

60
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,872
How I'm gonna reach y'all?

61
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,652
All right, top number's for re-ups...

62
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,346
second number's for muscle.

63
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,685
You need me, hit me on the third number.

64
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,782
Learn them shits, then throw that shit away.

65
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,453
- You doing this in the towers, too?
- Doing it everywhere.

66
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,427
Pagers, pay phones is dead.

67
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,088
- All right?
- Yeah.

68
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,761
String.

69
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:38,535
We need some re-up, man,
we gonna tap out by noon.

70
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,107
Re-up from where? You niggers ain't heard?

71
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,199
Knockos took the main stash.

72
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,939
Why the fuck you think we changing up?

73
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,977
Back the fuck up, young'un.
These shits ain't for you.

74
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,251
All right.

75
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,626
Cool. There you go.

76
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,663
There we go. All right.

77
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,896
The gift of corrected vision.

78
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,339
Compliments of the BPD.

79
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:18,537
- Dang, y'all are focused.
- What man wouldn't be?

80
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,861
They been cleaning us for the past few days.

81
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,330
- Last night they burned us all the way.
- I knew it.

82
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,025
I fucking knew it.

83
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:43,399
I swear to God,
I'm in this motherfucker's head.

84
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,631
Not a message since early morning.

85
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,799
Shit, I even had to cut Prez loose.

86
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,240
- Send his ass on down to Annapolis.
- For what?

87
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,211
State campaign finance reports.
I checked all the stuff here.

88
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:55,544
But I got the feeling
Barksdale's money has legs.

89
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,809
Shit.

90
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:59,385
All the work we did
to get up on this fucking wire.

91
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,820
You don't hit these guys
and expect them to stay in the pocket.

92
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,484
- Plus, they know they dropped a police.
- Then we need to change up, too.

93
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,788
Come on.

94
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,257
Shardene!

95
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,161
Honey, this is Detective McNulty,
who's working with us.

96
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:16,334
She works at Orlando's,
helping us out there from time to time.

97
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,701
And now I think
that she can see well enough...

98
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,398
to match faces to voices.

99
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,602
Lester, look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I'm scared of this shit.

100
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,407
Time comes, though,
I know you gonna step up.

101
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:29,108
We're gonna need Pearlman
to approve her wearing a wire.

102
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,707
- Can I get a cup of coffee?
- What do you take in it?

103
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,481
I'll get it. A little cream, right?

104
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,960
Those knockos motherfuckers
cleaned my shit out.

105
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:47,159
- You can replace product and currency.
- Yeah, he right.

106
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:50,328
- We gotta focus on what's real, here.
- All of this shit is real.

107
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,397
They wanna put me in a box.

108
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,998
Listen, I think what's important
is to take stock.

109
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,772
Ask yourself what's out there
that can still hurt you.

110
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,574
Where are you weak?

111
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,849
Where you need to clean up?

112
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,149
Think it through.

113
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,453
Start with Orlando, if Orlando rolled.

114
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,620
You know he talked about the club, at least.

115
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,493
That punk-ass nigger
ain't talk about shit else but the club.

116
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,999
That's all he knew about.
He wasn't rolling with us.

117
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,436
We kept him on the outside.

118
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,433
So you walk away from the club.

119
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,063
You're not on the license,
you're not a listed owner.

120
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,971
They can't make a connect.

121
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,941
When did this shit start up?

122
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,843
About the time that
your nephew beat that charge.

123
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:39,445
After, maybe when they found that witness
with the lead in his dome...

124
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:40,747
the shit hit the newspapers.

125
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,346
But around that time,
the cops was on our shit.

126
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,585
The security guard,
the one whose testimony sprung D'Angelo...

127
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,217
- Nakeisha Lyles?
- Yeah.

128
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,797
Bug-eyed ass bitch. But we hooked that up.

129
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,727
- So she can still hurt you, right?
- Yeah.

130
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:58,260
The point is anybody
who can hurt you can be put into play.

131
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:01,436
- The less I hear, the better.
- All right, yo.

132
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,466
Hey, yo, lock that door?

133
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,217
So we got Bird and Bey.

134
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,978
- Bird will stand tall.
- He already in jail, and Bey about to go, too.

135
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,251
And Wee-Bey hard like a rock.

136
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:19,991
And we got Savino.

137
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,824
Savino know it ain't nothing
but an Arm and Hammer charge.

138
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,922
I mean, he ain't gonna flip out
over a motherfucking three years.

139
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,057
True.

140
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:31,264
Then we got that shit with Orlando,
and the only problem there was Little Man.

141
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:32,930
Was.

142
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,106
Who else?

143
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,146
It's over, your wire's cold.

144
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,149
The court orders give me
a total of 90 days on five phones.

145
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,513
I'm doing the full 90.

146
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,988
You want to sit listening to a bunch
of broke-ass pay phones, have at it.

147
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,524
But you don't need
all that manpower to do it.

148
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,356
You want some bodies back,
I'll send a couple, no problem.

149
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,295
Hold on, Lieutenant.
I gave you those people.

150
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,367
I decide who comes back.

151
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,367
But feel free to speak your mind,
if it were up to you.

152
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,168
He asked you a question, Lieutenant.

153
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,209
I have no opinion. Take your pick.

154
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:16,406
What's the name of that
old detective from Pawnshop?

155
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:20,886
And that young one,
Valchek's brain-dead son-in-law.

156
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,557
Freamon, Pryzbylewski.

157
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,090
Keep them.

158
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,563
Send back Sydnor and Santangelo.

159
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,300
And, Lieutenant, if you want
to do anything beyond...

160
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,496
listen to those dead phones...

161
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,938
you need to brief me first.

162
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,682
You did good, Cedric.

163
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:53,810
You play your cards right, all the work
you did over the past few months...

164
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,946
will speak volumes for you.

165
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:59,548
And Maj. Spurgeon is saying
that he's retiring at the end of November.

166
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,491
Which opens up the Northwest Command.

167
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:02,857
That's right.

168
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,197
Hi, Ronnie. Come in. Sit.

169
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,763
- Sheila, send Patrick in.
- Yes, sir.

170
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,864
- Anything up?
- With me?

171
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,171
Same shit, different file.

172
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,145
- How about the Barksdale thing?
- You've got my office reports?

173
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,216
Wire's dead, but we're looking into a bug
in the man's nightclub.

174
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,808
Aside from that, you're doing what?

175
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,649
Pulling campaign finance reports
for every politician...

176
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,417
in the city of Baltimore, right?

177
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,513
I am?

178
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:33,817
We are?

179
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,823
And making calls to some contributors...

180
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,429
asking questions,
doing background checks.

181
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,869
I don't know anything about this.

182
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,996
I mean, Ronnie,
where the fuck is all this going?

183
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,142
Those are public reports, right? I mean...

184
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,403
No one on that detail
has come to me for any kind of subpoena.

185
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,710
You got back-doored, too?

186
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,948
Just so there's no misunderstanding...

187
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,379
I want to give you this.

188
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,290
Copies of checks on the account
of my re-election committee...

189
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,091
representing the return
of five separate contributions...

190
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,688
totaling $4,500.

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,099
Also copies of the checks...

192
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,433
from the donor are represented in there, too.

193
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,406
Kind of like Caesar's wife and all that shit.

194
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,276
The only thing that we could come up with
were those five checks.

195
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,871
And I don't know those people,
and I don't know why they gave.

196
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,507
That money's gonna be returned
to the donors immediately.

197
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,143
Guys, listen to me.

198
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,583
I don't know a fucking thing...

199
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,716
about anyone looking
at campaign contributions.

200
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,724
Be that as it may...

201
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,132
this should make it clear
that our hands are clean.

202
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,724
Ronnie, I want you to take that back
to whoever's on the hunt...

203
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,461
and I want you to tell them
they've got no quarrel with me.

204
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,711
What's up, String?

205
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,681
So y'all want to get with me?

206
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,880
Yeah, we need to holler at your boy...

207
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,321
you know, the one
that dimed on Omar's bitch.

208
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,154
Can't recall his name.

209
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,554
Which one?

210
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,789
The one that was at the Greek's that night.

211
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:21,231
- And we paid him for the lookout.
- What y'all need him for?

212
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,431
What's it to you?

213
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,099
- You ain't got to worry about him.
- Say what?

214
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,573
He's gone, he's out the game.

215
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,200
Out the game?

216
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,212
Yo, the man asked you a simple question.

217
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:38,208
I don't mean y'all no disrespect.
You know I don't.

218
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,550
I am sitting here telling you
that the boy is out the game.

219
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,216
And even if he wasn't out the game,
he wouldn't be no problem.

220
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,260
But you know we just want
to talk to him, Dee.

221
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,392
Let the boy be.

222
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,233
Just let him be.

223
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,356
Honey, just leave the damn thing alone.

224
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,292
- Where'd you get these, man?
- Prevas.

225
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,092
Broadway market?

226
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:04,193
- Best chili dogs in the city.
- No, man, not even.

227
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,173
I'll give you $10
if you can name a better dog.

228
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,002
- George's Lunch on Light Street.
- The Greek joint?

229
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,603
That place closed back when you were
still sucking on your mama's nipples.

230
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:17,616
My mama's nipples?
I was sucking on them plums last night.

231
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,185
You owe me $10.

232
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,449
I said, name a better dog
you can have today, not in world history.

233
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,389
- You just said a better dog.
- You go get that dog right now.

234
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,585
- You cannot go get that now.
- And you tell me...

235
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,491
- the best fucking dog.
- Physically...

236
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,793
Can you please keep it down?
I can't hear a goddamn thing!

237
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,064
You'd know how much I got...

238
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,142
if you laid something on me.

239
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,677
- You like that freeze?
- If you holding.

240
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,844
I'm fixing to be.
That's why I'm here, you know?

241
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,174
To discuss some things.

242
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,953
When you done discussing, you come back.

243
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:03,659
All right, then.
Hold that pose right there, shorty.

244
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,762
I'm gonna hook you up with some uncut.

245
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,601
Y'all niggers talk too damn much, man.

246
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,706
Who the fuck is she? Housing police?

247
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,648
No, she's one of them civilians
they got doing security.

248
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:29,145
- Housing cops wear the gray uniforms.
- So she's not armed or nothing.

249
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,856
Do she look it?

250
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:38,224
You leaving early?

251
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,766
I was early, I worked the lunch crowd.

252
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,305
She's out.

253
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,182
- Anything?
- Table scraps.

254
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,082
What we want is being said in that office.

255
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:04,385
There's no reason for Shardene
to be in there long enough for us to get it.

256
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,987
- Take it out, I can't do this anymore.
- You won't have to, darling.

257
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,894
I think they'll look at me and know.
I need to quit.

258
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:14,900
I don't need you wearing
this wire, all right, honey?

259
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,470
I just need you to go in there
and do one more thing.

260
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,532
Look at this country nigger.

261
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,571
- Damn, Wallace.
- Wally!

262
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,947
He kept crying till I sent him bus money.

263
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,214
All right. I just got tired
of that same old country scenery.

264
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:35,879
It was just too slow for me.

265
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,617
Yeah, but did you get
some of that country ass?

266
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,488
And if he did, it was on four legs.

267
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:44,826
Nigger, they got no farms down there, man,
but they did have some Bamas though.

268
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,798
They got their Saturday night
shit down at Sears.

269
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,064
- They was like, you know...
- Tears, right? You were about to cry.

270
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,695
That where you got them Die-Hards?

271
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,502
- Man, these Timbs.
- Yeah, they Timbs.

272
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,839
I can see the tree on the side of them.

273
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,572
So you gonna put me back on the money?

274
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:04,412
Hold. Look, if we do put you back on...

275
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,281
you have to start as lookout, man.

276
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,980
You lost your spot
when you bucked town, dawg.

277
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,489
Come on, a real man
would stay with his people...

278
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,752
he wouldn't run at the first sight
of some blood.

279
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,760
Y'all can still holler 5-0, right?

280
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,729
If he want back on the money,
he back on the money.

281
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,424
If he want it.

282
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,968
My man might be thinking of going
back to Edmondson...

283
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,004
like we talked about, right?

284
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,471
Come on, nigger, let's walk.

285
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,547
Dawg, you ain't cornholed
no animal for real, did you?

286
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:37,141
- Go ahead, Poot.
- You're stupid.

287
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,085
Don't be fucking with my Sean John.

288
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,685
- So who caught it?
- Garvey.

289
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,422
He knows about the whole witness angle...

290
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,620
but he doesn't want to run it up
to the bosses until he knows more.

291
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,960
Why ace Nakeisha Lyles now?

292
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,033
Because now they know we're for real.

293
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,625
Avon's cleaning house all the way.

294
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:59,262
First the phones go dead
and then anyone he thinks...

295
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,306
we might be able to flip.

296
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,542
What about the boy?

297
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,610
Fuck me.

298
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,621
We took him to the shore Friday
and the plan was to bring him back up...

299
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,157
- on the Monday for the grand jury.
- And what happened?

300
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,318
- Greggs got shot.
- Trooper Reese?

301
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:24,624
This is Lieutenant Daniels
with the Baltimore Department.

302
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,722
Is there someone that can
go near Cambridge...

303
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,960
check on a kid we got stashed down there?

304
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,764
- Call him.
- No, there's no phone there.

305
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,135
- Can you hang on?
- I'll hold, yeah.

306
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,767
Have Sydnor pull a car from motor pool.

307
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:38,606
We get the kid back up here tonight,
he sleeps on my sofa...

308
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,112
and we grand-jury him in the morning.

309
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,515
- What about your stripper?
- The woman's got heart.

310
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,011
I mean, I want her protected.
No more bodies, hear?

311
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:50,952
I got room at my place,
she can lay up with me.

312
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:54,390
- I got no problem with that.
- Remember who you are, Detective.

313
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,363
Protect and serve, Lieutenant.

314
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:04,870
I'm saying, this here game,
it ain't gonna work for you no more, man.

315
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,440
You leaving, you stirred up some shit.

316
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,934
- I'm saying it ain't your fault.
- Dee, look.

317
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:16,243
I appreciate what you trying to say and all,
but I grew up in the courts, all right?

318
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,147
I been with them niggers since forever.

319
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,617
This is home, right?

320
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:26,117
You ain't hearing me, Wallace.

321
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,293
Anybody asks you whether
you in this game...

322
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,627
you tell them you in it for life, all right?

323
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,761
You play it hard, you play it tight...

324
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:38,133
and make sure niggers know
you gonna stand by your people.

325
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,139
No loose talk, no second thoughts,
and no snitching.

326
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,309
Play it like that.

327
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,415
- What you doing down in the PJ's, you lost?
- I'm looking for you.

328
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:58,958
- You know I be down here working.
- A working man got to eat.

329
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,358
- My favorite spicy fish cakes?
- On the saltines with the mustard.

330
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,523
You gonna make me cry, you know.

331
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,363
I need to get up out of here
and get back to it.

332
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:12,362
- You be safe.
- You, too.

333
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:13,769
All right.

334
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,066
This here.

335
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:21,440
Sterling's, baby, we're about to feast.

336
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,345
What the hell is Sterling's?

337
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,078
Sterling's, up on 29th Street?
Don't you know nothing?

338
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,314
Shit, if it ain't up on the Westside,
I don't know shit.

339
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,749
'Cause this shit...

340
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,155
this is me, yo, right here.

341
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,255
Who was that, your new girl or something?

342
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:39,298
No, nigger, that's my mom.

343
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,169
You know Senator Davis?

344
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,240
No, sir.

345
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,306
Lieutenant.

346
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:57,715
Clay wanted to meet you,
see if there was any help he can offer.

347
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,413
Help?

348
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:04,718
Your people are apparently
pulling finance reports...

349
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,759
and checking up on some
of the contributors.

350
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,655
I wanted to reassure you on that front.

351
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,426
I'm not involved in drugs, Lieutenant.

352
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,526
Good.

353
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:18,465
And this business with the senator's driver.

354
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,201
Mr. Price, Damien.

355
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,835
Day-Day.

356
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,811
This business with Mr. Price,
this is a misunderstanding...

357
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,577
that is really of no concern to the police.

358
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:35,084
He had $20,000 of cash on him...

359
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:38,652
delivered out of a project tower
by a known drug suspect.

360
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:42,358
The money was banded
and manicured by denomination.

361
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,229
There's no crime here.

362
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,364
That was money that Damien
already had on him...

363
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,266
when he drove down to Franklin Terrace.

364
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,238
Money from a cash-bar fundraiser
the previous weekend.

365
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:58,333
We filed an amended
finance report that shows...

366
00:22:58,445 --> 00:22:59,571
Fine.

367
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:04,476
There's no probable cause
for a search of Mr. Price.

368
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,948
I think we are in agreement on that.

369
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,813
No, there was PC for the search.

370
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:14,019
You're saying you have evidence
that a senatorial aide is involved in drugs?

371
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,320
I'm saying we had reason to stop Mr. Price...

372
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,126
and effect a body search,
after which we discovered...

373
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,225
$20,000 in cash in banded, manicured bills.

374
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:25,065
That's all I'm saying.

375
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:29,900
Will you explain to this motherfucker
just what it is he's doing here?

376
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,410
- Lt. Daniels...
- Excuse me, sir.

377
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,036
But it's pretty basic.

378
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,881
If the senator is not involved
in anything illegal...

379
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,211
then he doesn't need to worry.

380
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,513
I can't be any clearer about it than that.

381
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,349
Fool, what do you think?

382
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,089
That we know anything
about who gives money?

383
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:48,718
That we give a damn about
who they are or what they want?

384
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,364
We have no way of running down
them or their stories.

385
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,290
We don't care.

386
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:57,802
We just cash the damn checks,
count the votes, and move on.

387
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:04,103
Anything else, Deputy Burrell?

388
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,179
Gentlemen.

389
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:18,682
You need to put his ass on a foot post
so far out in the sticks...

390
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:22,228
that he's gonna see
the Philadelphia cops walking towards him.

391
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,325
Now you just ain't talking to me now, Erv.

392
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:27,263
You talking to the Mayor...

393
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:30,234
the city caucus, the state central committee.

394
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:33,239
And right now,
you got your hand in our pocket.

395
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:35,101
Eighteen, baby!

396
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:43,983
Eighteen with a bullet, baby.

397
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:47,947
Det. Sgt. Hauk reporting for duty, sir.

398
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,655
And the best part? Carver's 37.

399
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,659
You know, it helps
if you know them by the numbers.

400
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,923
It makes you sound more professional.

401
00:24:58,031 --> 00:24:59,055
Fucking Carver...

402
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,566
he gets back from in-service training,
he's gonna kiss the stripes...

403
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,466
I'm gonna make him kiss the stripes.

404
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:07,472
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

405
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,168
- Sgt. Hauk?
- God help us.

406
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,942
- Daniels.
- Daniels, this is Trooper Reese.

407
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:22,453
Grandmother says this kid's
been gone two days.

408
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:25,857
Wallace is out of pocket. Two days.

409
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,025
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

410
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,926
Ain't no re-up in the towers, neither?

411
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,561
Shop dead, yo.

412
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:01,253
- What up, man?
- Same old.

413
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,026
What's up with that boy?

414
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,595
He's just a punk, that's all.

415
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:11,804
Dee put him back on count though.

416
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,237
Word? I heard he was out the game.

417
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,169
He was, but he back now.

418
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,568
Where he been at?

419
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:22,277
Down his granny house, he says.

420
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,476
Right, his granny house.

421
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,114
I heard he damn near shit his pants...

422
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:30,917
when he saw what happened
to Omar's bitch.

423
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:35,116
He just ain't built for this, you know.
His heart pump Kool-Aid.

424
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:38,391
Right. What about you?

425
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,533
You built for this shit?

426
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,031
No doubt.

427
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:48,334
You ready to put the work in?

428
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,976
You got heat?

429
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,550
All right, soldier.

430
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,621
It's clear upstairs.

431
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,800
No extension cords. No juice boxes.

432
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,408
No Wallace.

433
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,941
Dang, boy, Chink Bob's...

434
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,516
never be putting no napkins in the bag.

435
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:07,012
Motherfucker, because
napkins expensive and shit.

436
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,917
So is my money.

437
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,855
All right, come on, go. Something to eat?

438
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,523
Y'all know what's here.

439
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,456
Let's go, y'all need
to get up in this Chinese food...

440
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,499
'cause, you know, I'm looking
kind of needy right about now.

441
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,365
What you listening to?
Hold up, take them plates first.

442
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:30,033
Big Tymers, their new video
on 106th and Park.

443
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,077
- 106th and Park?
- The joint is vicious.

444
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:33,167
- Yeah.
- For real?

445
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,543
- What they call you?
- Buff, 'cause I got the stuff.

446
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:37,013
You got the stuff?

447
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:40,486
Buff, you need to get up in
these egg rolls or something.

448
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,515
Any word on the kid?

449
00:28:42,622 --> 00:28:45,682
I rolled around Cambridge
all night with his B of I.

450
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,260
If he's down there, he ain't got no profile.

451
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:50,989
We got lookouts to every car
in the Western and Central.

452
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:53,793
We're trying for an address on his mother.

453
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,134
- Detective.
- Lieutenant.

454
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,269
Wire's dead...

455
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:01,670
so we've been ordered
to begin sending bodies home.

456
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:04,902
Sydnor, we have a little longer,
because Cantrell still owes me.

457
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:08,538
- You okay with Rawls?
- I gave him his clearance, right?

458
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,672
What's he gonna do to me?

459
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,811
Keep it warm, Sanny.

460
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,156
What's that?

461
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,693
Plans for what is now Orlando's.
The upper floors.

462
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:24,353
This is the property next door.

463
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:26,523
- How'd you get them so quick?
- CoStar search.

464
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:29,157
Plan is to get a remote mike into the office.

465
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,293
Maybe even some fiber-optics.

466
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:33,565
Only we don't know
where Avon's office is yet.

467
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,868
Which is where Shardene
helps us out in a big way.

468
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:39,274
What she gonna do? Take out a tape
and ask Avon to hold the other end?

469
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:41,506
Ain't none of y'all ever been in the military?

470
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,980
How do you learn a 30-inch, quick-time?

471
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:50,679
Draft-dodging peace-freaks.

472
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:54,887
- Get me a ruler and some string.
- Why me?

473
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:05,730
Why?

474
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:09,830
- Because the man said so, that's why.
- Wallace ain't no snitch.

475
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:13,434
Man, how you know?
How you know where he been running to?

476
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:16,874
He was getting high. I've seen him cop.

477
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:20,248
He probably went down to the shore
to clean that shit up.

478
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,621
Man, if he using,
then you know he ain't reliable.

479
00:30:23,723 --> 00:30:25,281
Come on, think.

480
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:30,289
Look, the man gave the word, all right?
We either step up or we step the fuck off.

481
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,789
That's the game.

482
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:36,196
That's the fucking game.

483
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:46,506
Cedric.

484
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:52,647
You ever hear of an elected official
in Baltimore giving money back?

485
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:58,119
Whatever you're doing
scared my boss shitless.

486
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:00,986
He calls me in and hands me that.

487
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:10,959
Forgive me for prying
into the details of our investigation.

488
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,767
I know, it's annoying.
But what the hell are you guys doing?

489
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:15,932
Yeah?

490
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:18,473
Is that Avon's money?

491
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,077
Eastside addresses...

492
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,515
but maybe Barksdale has fronts
we don't know about.

493
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:29,452
- State's attorney's returning this?
- Fast as he can.

494
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,615
Y'all are stirring some shit here.
Why didn't you tell me?

495
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,459
Aren't you better off that we didn't?

496
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:00,952
I remember my mom used to bring me here.

497
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,078
We used to go to a place
called Fruit Fantasy.

498
00:32:03,189 --> 00:32:06,283
- Like orange soda, some shit like that?
- No, these shits was fresh.

499
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,451
My mom used to pour
mad Bacardi in hers though.

500
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:10,256
Wasn't much she didn't pour it into.

501
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:13,491
Look at you, talking about your mama
like you're still a kid.

502
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,066
I got to thinking on her.

503
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:18,227
Your ass ain't got to be hard
all the goddamn time, neither.

504
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,396
Soft link break the chain.

505
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,473
What are you, a boy or a man?

506
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,810
I'm a man.

507
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,115
So what are we gonna do, man,
go have some fun?

508
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:59,843
Okay, on this floor.
It's the second room from the rear.

509
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,478
The stairs start 30 paces from the front...

510
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:05,142
there's 24 stairs, about a foot each.

511
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:07,082
When you get to the top floor...

512
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,484
it's eight paces to the door
of the dressing room...

513
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:11,784
and then another 10 to the back room.

514
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:14,018
80 to 110 in from the front.

515
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:20,692
Third floor of this building is vacant.

516
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,026
Otherwise we'd need a warrant.

517
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,540
- $15.
- Here take $10.

518
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:30,871
- $15.
- Motherfucker, I don't see no meter.

519
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:32,842
Get the fuck out of here.

520
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,681
It's 2:30 in the morning.

521
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,918
Easy now. Hole only needs
to be as big as your finger.

522
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,788
Not those Esskay sausage-looking
fingers you got.

523
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,123
You know what big hands mean.

524
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,298
You know what big hands mean, right?

525
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,494
Lieutenant...

526
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,570
I just pulled a fresh address
for Wallace's mother.

527
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,463
We're okay here.

528
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:07,309
Where y'all at?

529
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:14,152
All right, when I find y'all, y'all gonna get it.

530
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,083
You better come out now.

531
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:22,290
Where y'all at?

532
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:30,194
Look, I'm not even playing
with y'all right about now.

533
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,633
You hear me?

534
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:44,544
Game over. Where the fuck y'all at?

535
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:47,611
When I find y'all, I'm beating your asses.

536
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,244
Now where y'all at?

537
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,782
Don't let me find y'all.

538
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:02,362
Check this, Poot.
Little Man left his player and shit.

539
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,510
You a weak-ass nigger, man.

540
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,712
You should've stayed down
in the country, man.

541
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:27,292
Y'all my niggers, yo.

542
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:29,361
You fucking brought this on yourself.

543
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:31,692
- We boys!
- You brought this on yourself.

544
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,662
Why it gotta be like this?

545
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,699
You my niggers from B.C., remember that?

546
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:40,465
Come on, wetting your fucking pants,
like you a little boy.

547
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:43,736
Be a man! Stand up
like a motherfucking man.

548
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,440
- Y'all my niggers.
- You said you a fucking man.

549
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,446
- Stand up straight!
- That's us, man.

550
00:35:55,688 --> 00:35:57,519
Do it goddamnit, if you...

551
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:36,657
Darcia Wallace? We're looking for your son.

552
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,060
Thought you might help us out
as to his whereabouts.

553
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:40,359
Where-a-who?

554
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:43,060
Shit, I be looking for that
smart little nigger, too.

555
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:44,636
Boy took me for $10.

556
00:36:44,737 --> 00:36:46,728
- Recently?
- What's going on out there?

557
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:47,965
Nothing.

558
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,444
Couple of police interrupting me,
while I'm trying to get my drink on.

559
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:55,070
Your son might be in some danger.

560
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:57,513
He gonna be in some danger
right here if he shows up.

561
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:59,846
Snatched that $10
out my purse without asking.

562
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,978
- I'll slap the bright out his eyes.
- Here's my card.

563
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,116
You run into him, you call me.

564
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,209
- Y'all got ajeep?
- Over there, man.

565
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,686
All right, let's see what we got here.

566
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,555
He's packing shit up.

567
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,438
What you scratching your head for, man?

568
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:06,643
How y'all get the safe in here,
and you can't get it out?

569
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,746
Just dial 911 and talk to whoever pick up.

570
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,516
Don't say your name or nothing.

571
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:14,320
Just say there's been
an animal hurt inside the house...

572
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,223
and then you hang up.

573
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,034
What up? So what do you need from me?

574
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,804
I need you to run up to N. Y.C.
to pick up a little something.

575
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,772
Look, I know we tapped and all.

576
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:38,315
Shit, everybody waiting on the re-up,
but I never made that run before.

577
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,215
Listen, I feel like I don't have
that many people around me...

578
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,719
I could really trust.

579
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,187
Not like I can kin. You follow me?

580
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,517
- All right?
- How much is it?

581
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:50,993
We just need to maintain.

582
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:53,894
Put out enough so we can
keep hold of them towers.

583
00:38:57,736 --> 00:38:59,795
- When?
- Tonight.

584
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:04,368
All right.

585
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,675
What am I driving?

586
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:10,237
- A rental, no flash.
- Where from?

587
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:14,308
I don't know where from, man,
one of those places by the airport.

588
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,116
- Yeah.
- We got something real.

589
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,583
- I'm on my way.
- All right.

590
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,137
Shit!

591
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:47,581
- Which one?
- The rental there, the Taurus.

592
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:58,689
I gotta say, Lieutenant,
you got mad suction with the federales.

593
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,951
Yeah, Daniels.

594
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,563
Where?

595
00:40:38,237 --> 00:40:39,431
Wallace?

596
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,139
Poor fucking kid.

597
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:30,115
With Wallace gone,
that's Stringer out of the box.

598
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:43,234
He was in there
changing his fucking clothes.

599
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,562
You believe that?

600
00:41:47,406 --> 00:41:49,567
Boy had to get himself correct.

601
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:01,281
We're on. No need for an eyeball.

602
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,616
Let the satellite do the work.

603
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:21,439
How about I call my lawyer...

604
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:24,938
have him explain
that whole profiling thing to you?

605
00:42:25,177 --> 00:42:27,771
Mr. Barksdale, our tollbooth cameras...

606
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,644
have you on the G.W. Bridge at 2310 hours...

607
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,316
then re-entering
the turnpike at the same exit...

608
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:34,715
35 minutes later.

609
00:42:35,154 --> 00:42:38,453
Why did you drive all the way
to New York for half an hour?

610
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,625
Step out of the car, sir.

611
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:44,095
Keep your hands where I can see them.

612
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:46,960
Turn around, face the car,
put your hands on the roof.

613
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,465
- Are you carrying any weapons, sir?
- No.

614
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,331
- Any knives, any needles?
- No.

615
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,904
Any illegal substances
I should know about?

616
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:56,304
Okay. Spread your legs back.

617
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:58,766
Spread your legs back more.

618
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:05,848
Okay, slowly bring your
right arm around your back.

619
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:07,914
Now bring the other one.

620
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:24,332
- Remember me?
- Lawyer.

621
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,802
Easy. We're just getting started.

622
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:28,429
Lawyer, motherfucker.

623
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,872
Okay, so you're hard, but guess what?

624
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,773
- I could give a fuck.
- You?

625
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:34,401
I'm tired of your games.

626
00:43:34,513 --> 00:43:37,243
What, you want me to write a letter,
or some shit like that?

627
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:40,580
No game we need to run.
You're popped with a kilo of uncut.

628
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,877
Not that you messed up.
You did everything right.

629
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:47,686
Speed limit, turn signals, working taillights.
Question you gotta ask is...

630
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,091
how'd those troopers know
to pull you over?

631
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:52,925
Someone else fucked up. You following me?

632
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:57,027
But it's you they're gonna blame,
and you who's gonna do the jolt.

633
00:43:57,736 --> 00:44:00,728
- Lawyer.
- That'd be Levy, right?

634
00:44:02,374 --> 00:44:05,207
He's getting paid by your uncle,
is that right?

635
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:08,141
Yeah, he's looking out for your interests.

636
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:09,509
More than you.

637
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:11,711
Listen...

638
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,545
I ain't saying another damn thing...

639
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:18,054
to nobody but my lawyer.

640
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:25,489
By the way...

641
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:28,691
your boy Wallace,
shot dead in the low-rises.

642
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,968
That's how y'all take care
of your own, right?

643
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,098
You're a lying motherfucker.

644
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,735
So what?

645
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:40,436
You want me to write
a letter to his mom, too?

646
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,448
Get the fuck out of here.

647
00:44:57,796 --> 00:45:00,788
You didn't have to send him
the way you did.

648
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,597
In one car?
He should've been trailing a mule.

649
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,467
95 or on the train,
it don't make no difference...

650
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:09,096
he shouldn't have been there alone.

651
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,301
- Look here, Brianna...
- Ain't you ever heard of a trap-car?

652
00:45:12,411 --> 00:45:14,606
You send my son to New York...

653
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,806
in a motherfucking rental...

654
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,543
and you just let him ride
with that package in the trunk?

655
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:22,051
- I'm sorry...
- That won't bring him out of prison!

656
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:26,147
Better make sure that Jew lawyer of yours
earns his money, all right?

657
00:45:26,258 --> 00:45:29,159
- D'Angelo gonna have to do his part.
- Meaning what?

658
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:31,821
You like the car you driving there, right?

659
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:35,466
You like this crib? I put you in this crib.
You like it?

660
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:38,268
Yeah, I mean, we all got a lot
to protect here.

661
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,701
You need to remind him of that.

662
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:42,638
So when it come down to it,
he can stand up tall.

663
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,380
You ain't gotta worry about my child.

664
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,413
I raised that boy, and I raised him right.

665
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,420
It wasn't me who fucked up.

666
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,496
Really? So who did?

667
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:12,060
Why the fuck are we here?

668
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,435
Listen, all you need to do
is keep your head through the bail hearing.

669
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,440
We got a good shot
at bringing you home here.

670
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:18,839
Then what?

671
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:24,547
Who gonna take the weight for all the shit
in the trunk of that car?

672
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,448
Where's Wallace at?

673
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,694
Where's the boy, String?

674
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:41,722
D'Angelo, shut your mouth.

675
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:47,799
Where's Wallace? That's all I want to know.

676
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,801
Kid, you better think.

677
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,135
Where the fuck is Wallace?

678
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,342
String!

679
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:58,516
Look at me!

680
00:46:58,617 --> 00:47:00,517
Where the fuck is Wallace?

681
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:03,611
I don't want this Payless-wearing
motherfucker representing me.

682
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:05,587
I'm gonna get my own man, all right?

683
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,387
So just get back in your car,
and get the fuck back down south.

684
00:47:10,262 --> 00:47:13,197
All right, you stupid motherfucker.
You made your decision.

685
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:15,459
Yeah, I made my decision.
Where's Wallace at?

686
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,728
Where the fuck is Wallace?
Where's Wallace, String?

687
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:21,933
String, where the fuck is Wallace?

688
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,872
Stringer!

689
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:25,306
Bring him in.

690
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,900
- You're done.
- Why?

691
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:29,437
We have the charge whenever we want it.

692
00:47:29,548 --> 00:47:31,982
Why not stay up on the bug
we've got in his office?

693
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,517
The bug you didn't brief me about.

694
00:47:35,654 --> 00:47:38,282
I thought your little bird
told you everything we did...

695
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,982
a minute after we did it.

696
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:42,958
One of our people got hurt.
That's supposed to mean something.

697
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:44,756
We're hunting her shooters...

698
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:47,525
and by the grace of God
and your good work...

699
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:50,595
we've got a viable case on our main target.

700
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:53,728
Just charge Barksdale
with the attempt purchase...

701
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,137
from New York and bring it all home.

702
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:57,936
What about Stringer, his number two?

703
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,443
He slipped off the hook
when we lost the boy witness.

704
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,410
We've done all we can.

705
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:04,372
Are you hearing me?

706
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:07,611
These are the people responsible
for dropping a police.

707
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:10,719
Not just the shooters,
but the ones who make the dirt happen.

708
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:14,724
I'm trying to put them down for real,
not for some short-time bit.

709
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:17,287
That all you're trying to do?

710
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:20,725
If that's all you're doing,
how is it you have people...

711
00:48:20,832 --> 00:48:23,426
pulling campaign records
and finance reports?

712
00:48:23,702 --> 00:48:26,170
What the fuck has that
got to do with anything?

713
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,296
The money is part of my case.

714
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:31,936
There was a time
when I was willing to say otherwise...

715
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:35,240
to let you and all your friends
hide some of that dirt, but not now.

716
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,780
You want to talk about dirt? Have at it.

717
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:40,610
Talk some shit about
your Eastern district days.

718
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,485
Talk about what was going on back
when you was running wild in the DEU.

719
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:47,387
- That's just talk.
- Just talk?

720
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:57,497
FBI field reports.

721
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:01,935
You came into a lot of money, quick.

722
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:04,498
And you can go to jail just as quick...

723
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:08,136
if I start asking the right questions.

724
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:10,814
This case ends, or you are done.

725
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:14,113
Hell, I don't even need you
to lock up Barksdale.

726
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:18,417
I'll have your major debrief your detectives
and type the warrants himself.

727
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:21,356
This case is done!

728
00:49:25,664 --> 00:49:27,131
You do what you feel.

729
00:49:27,933 --> 00:49:30,868
You wanna pull Avon in on half a case?
You go ahead.

730
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:34,369
You wanna put my shit in the street?
Feel free.

731
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:38,431
But the Eastern had a lot of stories.
Mine ain't the only one.

732
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:41,034
A lot of people came through that district.

733
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,675
If you were gonna do me,
I'd already be done.

734
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:49,520
But there ain't nothing you fear more
than a bad headline now, is there?

735
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:53,352
You'd rather live in shit
than let the world see you work a shovel.

736
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:56,951
You can order warrants, and I'll serve them.

737
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:59,656
But as long as I have days
left on those dead wires...

738
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:01,755
this case goes on.

739
00:50:13,612 --> 00:50:16,513
Yo, look at these Delta Force
motherfuckers, man.

740
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:18,812
- Look at them.
- All right.

741
00:50:20,752 --> 00:50:23,721
- What's up with Levy?
- He said he gonna meet us down there.

742
00:50:24,089 --> 00:50:26,557
I still didn't get this safe
out of here yet, man.

743
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:28,125
How much money in it?

744
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,160
- $150,000.
- $150,000?

745
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:34,357
Open it up, man.
No sense in ruining a good safe.

746
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:56,045
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

747
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:58,349
The SWAT guys do love
to break out their toys.

748
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,083
They think it's Tony Montana up there?

749
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:02,751
They probably haven't
touched a gun in years.

750
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:06,862
Fuck this shit.

751
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,597
You and me, Lieutenant.

752
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:15,564
What units are in the alley?

753
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,900
Any sightline to the rear door?

754
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:22,480
10-4, who has the roof?

755
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:26,481
We're gonna move in on my command.
Everyone stand by.

756
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,752
We're not gonna need your men today.
Call them back.

757
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:33,688
- Now wait a minute...
- My case, back your men off.

758
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:31,782
Catch you later.

759
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:49,753
Good.

760
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:55,561
Barksdale's wearing bracelets.

761
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:59,901
Still no Wee-Bey, no Little Man?

762
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:01,766
No, nothing there.

763
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:16,120
This is the best work I ever did.
I never did a case like this.

764
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,384
But it's not enough.

765
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:21,654
I gotta go back to Auto tomorrow morning.

766
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,853
I just feel like this just ain't finished.

767
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:26,760
Detective.
