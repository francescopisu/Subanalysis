1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,700
Yo, J, what up, son, where you been?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,800
I ain't been nowhere, T.
Just laying low, man.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,700
Now watch, you gonna see
Darnell's little brother...

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,000
come on out with that laundry basket.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,000
- And the take's in the basket?
- Once in the afternoon, and one at night.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,400
Always the same laundry basket.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,800
How you know?

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,600
That money got to come out somehow, man.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,600
So, we ain't got to blast our way
to the top floor.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,000
We just wait till they're in the street
with their shit.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,600
We gonna do them tonight, you heard?
After it get dark.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,000
Just like you say.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,900
Put the basket down now, put it down!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,400
- Fuck, I said put the basket down!
- Easy girl, chill.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,600
You all niggers, you got caught slipping.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Sorry it had to go down like this, baby,
because your ass is cute.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,500
But you got got.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,500
Nice, very nice.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,900
Bitches!

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,200
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

21
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,900
No English.

22
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,400
Kunta Kinte...

23
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,200
yabba dabba dabba doo.

24
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,100
Mishy gishy gushy gushy
mishy meshy mushy, motherfucker.

25
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,400
Negro, you cannot travel
halfway around the world...

26
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,600
and not speak any motherfucking English.

27
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,400
English, motherfucker!

28
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,300
Two missing, and the rest
ain't saying shit we can understand.

29
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,700
I tried to tell you,
with the questions you all are asking.

30
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,700
We step off ship,
English is once again heard, right?

31
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,500
Pretty much, yeah.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,600
Here's what's left of Osman.
He was with us since Trieste.

33
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,100
Choksey took all his gear when he jumped.

34
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,500
- You get a lot of guys jumping ship?
- Some.

35
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Usually after a pay,
which we made in Norfolk.

36
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,100
Choksey actually asked for an advance,
which we did using ship's scrip.

37
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,600
Nothing here in the way of ID papers
or money. He grabbed that at least.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,900
Anybody else ask for any advances
while you were at sea?

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,600
- More than usual.
- Yeah?

40
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,900
A few of them were coming back
day after day, scripting more and more cash.

41
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,500
We figured they were
gambling down in the holds.

42
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,400
And maybe not, right?

43
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
The can with the girls was in Bay 9
on the bottom, outside.

44
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,900
- Did you check that bay?
- I did.

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,600
It's full of cans for export,
loaded in Hampton Roads.

46
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,100
No sign of anything
except a fresh stack of containers.

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,100
I'm not gonna lie to you. If you hold us
another day and bring in interpreters...

48
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,000
they're still not gonna say a thing.

49
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,400
The unwritten rule is that what happens
below decks stays below decks.

50
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,300
Sit up, Nicky,
we got paying customers waiting.

51
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,100
Ashley, sit down.

52
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,700
You think I cut it too short?

53
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,800
Just don't make me look funny.

54
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,600
Ashley's preschool called.

55
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,600
- They want more money?
- Just what we owe them.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,500
- And her teacher says that --
- Teacher?

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,900
- They ain't nothing but baby-sitters.
- Whatever.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,400
Ashley's been talking in class
about how Mom and Dad don't live together.

59
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
Who asks her about that?

60
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,300
No one asks, she just talks.

61
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,200
Kids notice stuff like that.
They talk, you know?

62
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,000
By the time she's in elementary school,
it's going to be an issue.

63
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,900
Time she gets that far,
we'll be under the same roof.

64
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,000
You said that last Christmas.

65
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,200
Christ, Aimee!
You pulling it out or cutting it?

66
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,400
Listen, Nicky.

67
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,300
You want to go get to some place better,
I'm with you.

68
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,100
You wanna keep on like this,
then I got to rethink stuff.

69
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,800
Do what you feel.

70
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,600
As soon as I start getting more hours,
the first thing I do is get my own place.

71
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,100
You wanna move in with me, great.

72
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,400
You don't want to,
at least I did my goddamn best.

73
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,700
You want a streak or something?
I could put a little purple in it.

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, and right after that...

75
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,700
I'll just go ahead
and stick my tongue up some guy's ass.

76
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,400
Got you good, huh?

77
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,300
You think?

78
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
No, I mean, not really.

79
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,700
Not if Evidence Control
is the posting you want.

80
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
- Sorry, Lieutenant.
- Fuck it, right?

81
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,600
We brought in the case at least.
Heard you were on the boat.

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,400
Ain't so bad.

83
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,700
How's Kima?

84
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
She's inside.

85
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,300
Asset Forfeiture.
And she's second year pre-law.

86
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,600
Housecat. That ain't her.

87
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,100
- This coming back?
- Yeah.

88
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
It's the Gant case right there.

89
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,600
Nathan looked over our weak shit...

90
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,200
told me to go find Omar this week
or she drops charges.

91
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,500
- You got a line on him lately?
- I haven't a clue.

92
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Last thing I did
was put him on a bus to New York.

93
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,300
You keep your head low, Lieutenant.

94
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,900
A year or two,
you'll be back in their favor, right?

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
Year or two, and I'll be a lawyer.

96
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,200
I got 22 years in.
I'm putting the papers in this week.

97
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,100
You're gone?

98
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,900
What the hell am I doing down here
with a law degree, right?

99
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,400
You take care, McNulty.

100
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,400
You, too.

101
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,500
Kimmy, all I'm trying to say is,
if you'd stop lighting up all the damn time...

102
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,400
- Maybe you'd understand --
- I'm gonna light up regardless.

103
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,300
- It took us too long.
- You know I love you, but if your ass...

104
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,200
don't get to finishing counting
all my motherfucking money...

105
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,000
- Shit, you know I love you, but damn.
- Almost five.

106
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,300
We got them motherfuckers good.

107
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,500
Let's see them motherfuckers slip next time.

108
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
Who the fuck is you?

109
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,900
- Omar come a-calling.
- Omar? Shit.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,400
Ain't that nigger dead?
I heard them project niggers lit him up.

111
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,400
No, I heard they ran his ass up
out of this town.

112
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,500
Spread the word, darling, Omar back.

113
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,200
Look at the way
Crutchfield spelled "prostrate."

114
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,500
Look at it.

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,900
"The above referenced victim
was prostate on the floor."

116
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,400
"Prostate on the floor."
That's a victim, all right.

117
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,000
That hurts bad.

118
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,800
I love this job, I do.

119
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,900
- You want to hear about Philly, Sarge?
- Just the dirty parts.

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,200
The ship's a dead end.
The cargo bay that held our container...

121
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,600
is full of new boxes,
nothing to recover there.

122
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,400
And all them sailors, they lied to us
in every language past English.

123
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,800
Gibbering motherfuckers.

124
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,000
Sailing up the coast right now,
laughing at us.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,100
Is that it?

126
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,900
Two guys jumped ship.
We'll put out teletypes...

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,100
in case that has
anything to do with anything.

128
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
One of them left his gear, and we kept that.

129
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,800
- Sounds like some weak-ass shit to me.
- Because it is.

130
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,100
But your suspect
had to be on the boat, right?

131
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,700
And your boat has sailed.

132
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,000
Jay, what the fuck were we supposed to do?

133
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,700
Hold the ship while we chat up
a crew of 40 in 53 dialects? Come on.

134
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,800
If that isn't the plan, what is?

135
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,600
- Officer...
- Russell.

136
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,000
I am informed that you are detailed
to this case...

137
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,500
as a liaison with the port police.

138
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,400
I also understand
that you are the only help...

139
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,000
that your department is sending.

140
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,200
That so?

141
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,200
Although there is some small charm
to a woman in uniform...

142
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,400
the fact remains
we work plainclothes in Homicide.

143
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,400
Which is not to say
that the clothes need be plain.

144
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,400
For you, I would suggest some pantsuits,
perhaps muted in color.

145
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Something to offset Det. Moreland's
pinstriped lawyerly affectations...

146
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,100
and the brash, tweedy impertinence
of Det. Freamon.

147
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,300
Rawls is watching on this one.

148
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Let's at least pretend we got a fucking clue.

149
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,600
Tweedy impertinence?

150
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,200
- I like that.
- You know what I'm saying?

151
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,100
- It's not here, Major.
- I can see that. Where is it?

152
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,500
The Flex Squad used it last Tuesday.

153
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,700
The vehicle log says
they parked it at 22:00 hours...

154
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
returning the keys to the OIC.

155
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,900
- And?
- We have the keys.

156
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
But not the van?

157
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,200
Are you telling me that a fully equipped...

158
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,800
$120,000 surveillance van...

159
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,400
assigned to the southeastern district
cannot be located?

160
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,100
- Around the world...
- In 880 days.

161
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,800
- Do we have a plan?
- A plan?

162
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,700
- For targeting this guy, Sobotka.
- I don't know.

163
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,900
Maybe find out where his union hangs...

164
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,100
go down there with a CI or two,
make some hand-to-hands.

165
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
- How about some DNRs on his phones?
- DNRs?

166
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,200
See who he's calling,
and look for any kind of pattern.

167
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,600
Hand-to-hands for now, I think.

168
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
600 series, and that's it.

169
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,500
That's right.

170
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,500
This is too nice a block for a prison guard.

171
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,700
Shit, you couldn't pay me enough
to work in no prison, man.

172
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,600
Yeah, right, no.
I want you to drop all the cellular joints.

173
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,600
- Yeah, all of them, Nokia, Motorola.
- Listen to Stringer play Wall Street.

174
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
All right, so call me, yeah.

175
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,900
String, why you so down
on the phone companies, man?

176
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,300
While back, I took a stroll through the Pit.

177
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,500
I saw that kid
we got running things down there, Poot.

178
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,100
He got the cellphone I gave him
for the business, right there on his hip...

179
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,300
but the nigger got another cellphone
that only ring when the pussy called.

180
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,900
Now, if this no-count nigger
got two cellphones...

181
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,600
how the fuck you gonna sell
any more of them motherfuckers?

182
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's market saturation.

183
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Look here.

184
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
That Tilghman right there.

185
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,100
- Dressed like a prison guard and all.
- Yeah, I see him.

186
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,400
Steel door.
The boy on the step is all, though.

187
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,200
Stump is sitting in the front room window,
staring at the damn television.

188
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,400
- You all could see that from the step?
- There in his damn drawers.

189
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,000
Shut up, dog!

190
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,700
Rat make that trash, he home free.

191
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,500
Junk better get in closer
if he want a shot at him.

192
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,600
I got $20 on Mr. Rat. Anyone fade me?

193
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Move along. Come on, get there.

194
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,300
$100 says it ain't over.

195
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,700
Shit, I got to take easy money.

196
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,900
What the fuck?

197
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,700
- Motherfucker.
- Sounds about over now, though.

198
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,500
How the hell you know
what the rat gonna do?

199
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Junk do know his varmints.

200
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah.

201
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
What's wrong with you, boy?

202
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,700
Look, I done told you before, man.
Those two babies don't move me that way.

203
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,600
If I come up with a plan
to do Stump without them...

204
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,400
you cut them loose?

205
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,100
Now you gone and got strategic on me?

206
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,700
We do like last time,
and wait for him to come out.

207
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,700
Only problem is,
Stump live in that rat hole, baby.

208
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,900
So, he ain't got to bring the cash out.
See what I'm saying?

209
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Then we charge in, guns a-blazing.

210
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,100
Steel door, right?

211
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,300
What's it gonna take
for you to be convinced, man?

212
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,300
I don't bag no babies.

213
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,700
What you think?

214
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,700
You gonna have to do better than that.

215
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,200
Indeed.

216
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,700
Thinking, maybe do a quarter this time,
if it's not too much.

217
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,100
That a problem?

218
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,800
No.

219
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,300
I'm just saying, you back right quick with it.

220
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,900
It ain't like them motherfuckers
got anything else to do up in there, right?

221
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
- The shit is everyday, man.
- Sounds right. It count right, too?

222
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,500
Boy'll bring it to you outside.

223
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,200
There's Tilghman.

224
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,500
So, his shit coming from Butchie then?

225
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,100
- All right.
- Lying Butchie.

226
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,200
- Santa's elves are short.
- Santa's elves aren't real.

227
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,700
The elves in Lord of the Rings
are, like, real elves.

228
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,500
- Real elves?
- They should be short, then.

229
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,400
Dwarves are short, hobbits are short.
Elves are tall and immortal.

230
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,400
If you weren't too scared to watch the movie
then you'd know all about it, doofus.

231
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,700
Bite me, dickbreath.

232
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,700
- Sean, knock it off.
- He started it.

233
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,700
Okay, upstairs right away,
brush your teeth, pajamas.

234
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
It's a school night, Sean.

235
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,700
Can I tuck them in?

236
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,500
My lawyer's gonna be
sending you something in the mail.

237
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,300
- You're kidding.
- It's not a divorce, it's an agreement.

238
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,300
- A separation agreement.
- A separation agreement?

239
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,900
Just read it. Okay? It's for the both of us.

240
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
It's to protect the both of us.

241
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,100
This is about what?

242
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,100
It's just...

243
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,700
You should just read it, okay?

244
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
Okay.

245
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,800
Another goddamn day we put our cards up
and get nothing.

246
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,600
- Zig, I don't know why I fucking bother.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

247
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,600
One ship today, nothing yesterday.

248
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,000
Wait for Thursday,
a couple ROIROs hit the berth...

249
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,700
and congratu-fucking-lations,
you grab a day.

250
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,600
Friday's quiet again.

251
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,000
Look at it this way, you know,
at least you get the day off.

252
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,600
Days off is the fucking point, Zig.

253
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,800
I can't keep waking up in the morning
not knowing if I'm gonna get paid.

254
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,300
I got a kid, right? I got a fucking kid...

255
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
and a girl that wants
to get married, for Christ's sake.

256
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,200
What the fuck you wanna get married for?

257
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,100
Not saying I do.

258
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,700
But fuck if I even could,
without no pot to piss in.

259
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,300
Aimee is like, "What's the plan, " you know?

260
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,000
And I'm down here
wondering if I'm gonna get a day or two.

261
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,100
Aimee's sister broke up with Petie, right?

262
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,000
That's your problem, Zig,
one of them, anyway.

263
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,400
You let that thing of yours lead you around.

264
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,400
You know me, whiskey, cock, and 5:00.

265
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
- Just get off me.
- Nicky, look.

266
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
If it's money that you're worried about, shit.

267
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,300
Let's pool a few dollars together.

268
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,500
I'll get us hooked up
with a little Yeyo, you know...

269
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,500
turn it around this morning,
we make more money before lunch...

270
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
than we can down here all week.

271
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,900
I ain't standing out on no corner
like some fucking project nigger...

272
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,500
so that I get popped for pocket change.

273
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,200
Fuck that shit, Zig. Seriously.

274
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,300
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll think of something.

275
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,300
11900 on that one.

276
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
We're looking for 14580, by the manifest.

277
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Can't be, the numbers don't go that high.

278
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,200
You had to figure it'd be this way,
the way the port works.

279
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
Yeah?

280
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,500
Why have anything
other than fake companies...

281
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,800
and addresses on the manifest
if you're moving a can with contraband?

282
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,300
And on the other end, too, right?

283
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,000
You can work it back through customs,
but chances are...

284
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,100
this box wasn't picked up anywhere
near this Rue de Rivoli address...

285
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,400
in Le Havre, France.

286
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,100
Hell, there might not even
be a Rue de Rivoli in that town.

287
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,300
A can full of dead girls,
sent to nowhere from nowhere.

288
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
- He been good business for me, though.
- Yeah?

289
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,000
Two, three quarters a week.

290
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,600
Mr. Tilghman's money always right,
always on time.

291
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,400
That's why we coming to you for the setup.

292
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
- You the man to him.
- I'm just saying.

293
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,000
I know, the money, and you know
we gonna find a way to make that right.

294
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,000
But like I said, I'm not asking for myself.

295
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,900
Now I'm asking for my man.

296
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,800
- Avon's call?
- Wouldn't be here otherwise.

297
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,700
- Avon is Avon.
- Always.

298
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,600
He probably gonna roll past tomorrow.

299
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,100
That'll work.

300
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,200
You see what I'm saying, right?

301
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,100
It makes no sense to bring the girls
all this way and then kill them.

302
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,100
You go all that way to dump it on your boss,
and now you're worrying yourself.

303
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,400
- It's got me thinking is all.
- It's a little late for that, McNulty.

304
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,000
What connects the one girl in the water
with all the other ones in the can?

305
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,900
- If you're right and she isn't local, then --
- She's definitely not local.

306
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,700
The low level of mercury viscosity...

307
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,600
in the amalgam restorations
says Eastern Europe.

308
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,600
- If you say so.
- Trust me, she's not from Dundalk.

309
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,900
Eastern Europe?
Can you narrow it down some?

310
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,100
How's this? Three of the dead girls were
in Budapest, Hungary sometime last year.

311
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
How'd you know that?

312
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,400
They bought tits there.

313
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,900
Three of the girls had breast enhancements.
We looked at the bags during the post.

314
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
We pulled the lot and serial numbers...

315
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,900
and they trace back to an outpatient
plastic surgery clinic in Budapest.

316
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Would you call them?
Might pull an ID from patient records.

317
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,600
The best they could tell me is the implants
were used some time this fall.

318
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,600
Three girls, three surgeries,
same clinic, right?

319
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,800
- What else?
- What else?

320
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,600
- Fuck you, Jimmy McNulty.
- Okay, you're a fucking God.

321
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,300
There's no one in the game
who can stand in your light, Dr. Frazier, sir.

322
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,900
You have to admit that whole
Budapest thing was a hell of a pull.

323
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,500
- Where's the paperwork on this cat?
- I got it over here.

324
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,100
So go on, what else?

325
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,900
Not much, except the swabs show
that at least seven of the girls in the box...

326
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,900
had vaginal intercourse
within 24 hours of death.

327
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,800
Two had anal and six came back positive
on the oral.

328
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
You tell Cole about all this?

329
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,100
I sent the findings off to Homicide,
but Cole ain't on the case, brother.

330
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,000
- No, who is?
- It's your man, Bunk.

331
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,100
And that older guy, his partner, they ate it.

332
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,800
Thanks.

333
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,800
I told you, I brought you a soda.

334
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,300
That better?

335
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,600
Now, look at me.
Don't let those mean boys see you crying.

336
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,900
- Okay?
- Okay.

337
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,400
I'll take care of you.

338
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,800
Mr. Stump!

339
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,900
Them boys been teasing Chantelle again.

340
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,400
You know it.

341
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,600
- Morning.
- Morning.

342
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,400
- Bobby, how you been?
- Not bad.

343
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,600
- Working the tier today?
- Yeah, on J.

344
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,900
- Have a good one.
- Yeah, you, too.

345
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,000
You happy now, bitch?

346
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,500
How was I gonna know
Landsman would pull Cole...

347
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,000
and stick you guys?

348
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,900
You right here with them?

349
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,400
- What did he call Cole?
- "Collateral damage."

350
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,400
I'm feeling pretty damn collateral myself,
I got to say.

351
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,100
Which is why I went to see Dr. Frazier
and work some things out in my head.

352
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,500
Officer McNulty could've
paid this thing no mind, but no.

353
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,100
When his friends are suffering,
he bleeds, too.

354
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,300
Did you see the preliminary?

355
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,400
Positives for oral, vaginal, anal.

356
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,500
No IDs, no passports, no visas,
no real money.

357
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
And they're coming
across the water like that.

358
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,900
- Yeah.
- McNulty has a theory.

359
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,000
- Does he now?
- You deductive motherfucker, you.

360
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,500
So he's gonna wander in here
with some Johnny-come-lately bullshit...

361
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,700
about how these girls
are all coming over here as prostitutes...

362
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,900
talking about how if they ain't got the cash
to travel better than a container ship...

363
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,700
then they sure don't have the money
for a plastic surgeon.

364
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,700
Then he's gonna say something
about that one in the water...

365
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,400
being tossed off the ship
after she's already dead from a beat-down.

366
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,200
But why she got beat?
He's gonna ask us that, like we don't know.

367
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,400
He's gonna answer his own question,
saying her swabs are negative, right?

368
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,800
Fuck or fight with all them sailor boys,
and she fought.

369
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,700
So, it got a little rough.

370
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,000
She gets banged around,
she comes up dead.

371
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,000
And then somebody panics,
tosses her in the harbor overnight...

372
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,300
before the ship ties up.

373
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,700
But the other girls saw.

374
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,100
So now, the other girls,
they get told to get back in that can.

375
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,700
And our man, to cover this shit up...

376
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,700
he gets up on top
and bangs down the air pipe.

377
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,700
- Anything else you want to tell us?
- When did you guys get there?

378
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,700
Yesterday, when the ship's first mate
told us that while the ship was at sea...

379
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,600
half the crew came to him
for advances on their salary.

380
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,300
They had one hell of a dice game
going on below deck...

381
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,300
or the boys popped them girls
out of that can.

382
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,700
You talk to the crew?

383
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,900
- In what language?
- Crime scene?

384
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
- Nope.
- Anybody missing?

385
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,900
Two guys jumped ship.
One in Philly, one in Norfolk.

386
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,900
But that shit happens all the time,
apparently.

387
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,700
- Got yourself a hell of a case.
- Fuck you very much.

388
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,300
You know what happens to all the girls
if you don't ID them?

389
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,500
Anatomy Board as medical cadavers.
Then a crematorium.

390
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,700
Then that mass grave out at Crownsville.

391
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,300
That bothers you?

392
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah, a little.

393
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,400
Me, too.

394
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,200
- Thanks for hosting this, Father.
- Hope it helps.

395
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,800
You guys have really done
the background on this.

396
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,900
This is more presence
than the port unions have shown in years.

397
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,500
- Is the governor listening?
- It's now or never for us.

398
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,300
And not just the grain pier,
but with the dredging.

399
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,900
I don't care
what the Corps of Engineers' study says.

400
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,600
- The fact remains --
- Excuse me, Bobby.

401
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,400
I just need him to work
the other side of the room on something.

402
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,700
You're wasting time here.

403
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,500
Bobby's District 7, which is middle river...

404
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,900
which means every vote he gets
is somebody with some port connection.

405
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
He's a good vote, no matter what we do.

406
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,300
The guys you need to be working
are the guys...

407
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,000
who wouldn't have come
if we hadn't been throwing money at them.

408
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,000
- Like who?
- Like John Carney, from Anne Arundel.

409
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,300
Liz Tobin, from Montgomery.
Clay Davis, from over Westside.

410
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,200
Keep hold of them,
some of your stuff stays in the budgets.

411
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,900
- And they're with us?
- Carney is pretty firm.

412
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,000
Liz will stay solid if the environmentalists
don't get to her.

413
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,300
Clay Davis... that guy, you wanna make sure
you're the last man out of the room.

414
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,800
What do you mean?

415
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,300
I mean, we've given forty large
to the Westside Democratic Organization...

416
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,500
and this motherfucker still has his hand out.

417
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,300
We spent $40,000 on that guy?

418
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,000
Worth it, if he lets your projects
sail through the conference committee.

419
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,900
- Forty fuckin' thousand?
- Am I your lobbyist? Are you paying me?

420
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,400
Trust me. With the players in this room...

421
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,600
the presiding officers and a little help
from the governor's office...

422
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,200
we might squeeze some things out
this session.

423
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,000
Now, go make nice.

424
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,000
- Senator Davis.
- Excuse me.

425
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,200
Hey, partner.

426
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,500
People tell me
it just might be a good year for the port.

427
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,900
Might be.

428
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,700
You all have been stepping up
in a lot of ways.

429
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,400
Hope it continues like that.
You all making friends in a lot of places?

430
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,300
We're friendly guys.

431
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,900
So they came back murders?

432
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,200
I admit, I didn't see that coming at all.

433
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,500
Who could've seen that?

434
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,500
For whoever was having
these girls brought over...

435
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,100
- The net loss is in the millions.
- That much?

436
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,800
One of these girls on the circuit,
going club-to-club on the East Coast...

437
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,400
can bring in half a million
over the next two years.

438
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,900
And that's just
for club work and prostitution.

439
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,600
- So somebody messed up.
- In a big way.

440
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,000
You guys called it.
No such address in Le Havre.

441
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,800
Or for that matter, anywhere in Brittany.

442
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,000
The name and ID of the driver
who signed the bill of lading...

443
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,600
doesn't correspond
to their motor vehicle database.

444
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,500
Dead ends either way.

445
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,600
The girls, they know
what they're coming over for?

446
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,800
Some do.

447
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,500
Some get told they're gonna dance,
or be secretaries.

448
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,000
You gotta understand, they're coming
from places that don't have much.

449
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,400
Romania, Moldavia, Russia, Albania.

450
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,800
40,000 or 50,000 undocumented women
working in the US alone.

451
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
50,000? Jesus.

452
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,200
They need a whole new agency
just to police them.

453
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,300
What they need is a union.

454
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,700
- To Stan and Kate.
- Stan and Kate.

455
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,800
Happy anniversary!

456
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,900
Thanks a lot.

457
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,100
- Good time here?
- Yeah.

458
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
How is my detail coming?

459
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,400
Lt. Grayson is on top of things, right?

460
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,700
Burrell recommended him.
Said he was really good at property crimes.

461
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,100
- It's gonna take a while.
- You think?

462
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,200
Why? What are you doing?

463
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,500
Not much.

464
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,200
We got no DNRs up.
We're not looking at any union assets.

465
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,700
We're not collecting tag numbers
or anything.

466
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,700
We're not looking for patterns at all.
And that's the thing.

467
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm trying to tell you
about the Barksdale thing.

468
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,100
If you go in with the idea
you're gonna eat around the edges...

469
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,500
you never get a meal.

470
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,900
With Barksdale, Daniels and Freamon
had us pulling all kinds of stuff.

471
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,600
DMV records, phone logs,
corporate charter stuff...

472
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,400
political campaign contributions.

473
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,700
If Burrell didn't
break the case down so fast...

474
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,500
we would've brought back $3 or $4 million
in downtown real estate...

475
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,600
not to mention the money
those guys gave to political campaigns.

476
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,300
We were deep, really deep.
I've been trying to tell you.

477
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,500
If it wasn't for Burrell,
that would've been a major case.

478
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,000
- String.
- You know, I just came to check up on you.

479
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
- See how you holding it down.
- I'm all right.

480
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,200
- Where the little man at?
- I just put him down.

481
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,000
You want something to drink?

482
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,000
Do D'Angelo know what he's missing?

483
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,900
I'm sure he do.

484
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,500
You just reminded me about something.

485
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
Tag's still on it.

486
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,000
He bought it
before he got stopped in Jersey.

487
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,000
Never been worn.

488
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,500
You know,
it's a shame to let things go to waste.

489
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,100
You know,
you can give away the man's clothes...

490
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,700
but that don't make him gone, right?

491
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,000
I ain't forget him.

492
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
You ain't been to see him
much neither, though.

493
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,400
- It's been hard.
- It's been hard?

494
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,000
It's been hard on him, too.

495
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,200
A lot of bad things
caught up in a man's head...

496
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,300
when he's on lock-down.
Man need to see his baby mama.

497
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,800
Need to see his child, too.

498
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Only one thing he needs to be secure about,
and if not...

499
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,100
then he might start thinking
he can't do that time...

500
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,400
and then we all got problems.

501
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,500
You understand me?

502
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,300
How you set here?

503
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,500
The apartment, the car,
the money's all right?

504
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,700
- It's good.
- It's good?

505
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,200
I know it's good.

506
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,100
But you know what I'm talking about, right?

507
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,300
We all got a job to do, and your job
is to let D'Angelo know we still family.

508
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,300
It's important.

509
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,500
I'm an XL.

510
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,700
No doubt.

511
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,700
- Your round, Jimmy.
- Jesus.

512
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm gonna owe the baby-sitter
half my salary...

513
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,200
if I don't throw myself out of here right now.

514
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
- You got kids?
- Two.

515
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,900
- Daddy working late, too?
- Not a day in his goddamn life.

516
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,100
You barely made a dent.

517
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,300
Good night, gents.

518
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,200
- Good night.
- Good night.

519
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,500
- What's that about?
- I don't know.

520
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,700
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

521
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,300
- Solve the fucking case?
- Not a shot.

522
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,300
- I'm gonna give this one a name.
- A name?

523
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,600
She's not going
out to Crownsville, this one.

524
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,800
- Not on me, she's not.
- So what are you gonna do with her?

525
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,800
Pay for a box and a mortician
and ship her back to Bumfuck, Europe?

526
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,200
No, I'm gonna find where her people at.

527
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,500
How does that matter?
You see, this is that Catholic shit, Jimmy.

528
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,100
This is that little altar-boy-guilt talking.

529
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,300
What the fuck I got to feel guilty about?

530
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,300
Let me count the ways.

531
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,600
Good morning, Major.

532
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,900
What the...

533
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,900
Wilmington? Son of a bitch!

534
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,500
- Frank?
- Ring, how's it hanging?

535
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,000
Not so good.

536
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,100
- Not right now.
- Yeah?

537
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,200
I'm late on my dues. You know that, right?

538
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,700
You're late, yeah.

539
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,700
And I'm parking that piece-of-shit Buick
two blocks from the house...

540
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,900
hoping for a lazy repo man.

541
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,600
That bad?

542
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,700
I know you ain't been getting hours,
it's been slow.

543
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,100
Five days last month.

544
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,100
- That's all.
- Is that all?

545
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,800
Look, I got to shit or get off the pot here.

546
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,300
- I'm gonna go with 47.
- Do me a favor.

547
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,100
Frank, you been fair,
I ain't saying otherwise.

548
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,600
It's just there's 60 checkers above me
with more seniority, and that's all she wrote.

549
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,100
Do me a favor.
Go down Clement Street tonight...

550
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,100
give this to Dolores,
tell her you need a beer and a shot on me.

551
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,800
Just do that much.
You have a round on me, you go home.

552
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,900
You wanna come in tomorrow, tell me
you're going with 47, I'm with you on it.

553
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,000
Thanks.

554
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,700
Lane 4, you got a trucker's code and tag.

555
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,500
Pick me a winner, Johnny.

556
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,200
- You're ugly enough to be a teamster.
- Lick me, you whore.

557
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,400
It'll be up on wheels. K-row, slot 122.

558
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,100
Roger that.

559
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,300
Look, misdelivery.

560
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,000
Can was supposed to go ashore at Norfolk.

561
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,600
- Yeah, where you want it?
- I'm gonna need it on wheels at K-122.

562
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,300
My man'll pick it up there. Thanks, Horse.

563
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,400
Wrong box, misdelivery.

564
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,600
No need to count, Butch.

565
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,900
- My shit always right.
- Hearing.

566
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,500
Hearing is believing.

567
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,100
Boy'll meet you outside
when you ready to roll.

568
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,700
I'm ready now.

569
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,600
No, dog. Not from me you don't.

570
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,800
Later, Butchie.

571
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,500
Your man Avon ain't got no flex.

572
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,300
Afraid not.

573
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,300
Who you like better?
Ultimate Spiderman or regular Spiderman?

574
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,800
- What's the difference?
- See, I'll have to teach you everything.

575
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,600
Excuse me, gents.

576
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,400
What's up, man? How you liking the library?

577
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,800
It'll do.

578
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,000
It's easy on you.

579
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,100
I know a lot of people put in for the gig,
but the gig go to you.

580
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,100
Funny how that go.

581
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,300
So you want me to say thanks?

582
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,300
You ain't got to say shit.

583
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,900
But you need to take heed
of what can be done for you...

584
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,700
if you keep your head straight.

585
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,200
You're just full of favors, ain't you?

586
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,000
You shut your mouth and open your mind...

587
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,800
and you ain't gonna be doing
but a small piece of this 20.

588
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,000
Just like I'm only gonna do
a year or two on this seven.

589
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,700
- Feel me?
- I got priors.

590
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,500
Best I can do is half.
That's 10. I can count to 10.

591
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,100
Some shit is coming down, Dee, okay?
You need to think.

592
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,300
You need to trust,
and you need to get your head right.

593
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,700
Man, my head is where I want it.

594
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,200
- You look dusty lately.
- So what?

595
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,300
What, you my mom up in here now?

596
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,700
That's the weak man's road you're taking.

597
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,800
I ain't never seen you as weak.

598
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,700
Look, I'm just, you know,
every now and again.

599
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,400
That's all I got
to get my head up out of this shithole.

600
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,100
Ain't no more than that?
Because if that's all it is...

601
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,500
you should be able
to give it a rest for a few days.

602
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,300
- Because it ain't no thing, right?
- Yeah, it ain't no thing.

603
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,400
Then you gonna do that?

604
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,200
I'm asking you, man, out of love.

605
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,100
There's always love, Dee.

606
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,000
All right. Yeah.

607
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,600
A few days. Sure, a few days.

608
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,400
Right.

609
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,100
All right, what have you got?

610
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,600
All digital. Four megapix,
16 megs of memory...

611
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,300
3X optical, 4X digital zoom.
That's brand new on the market.

612
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,300
That's the Cadillac of cameras right there.

613
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,900
- How many?
- 400.

614
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,000
- You are talking a big number.
- That's showtime. This ain't the WNBA.

615
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,200
I'm thinking with these features,
this brand...

616
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,400
I can get, maybe, $350 each at retail.

617
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,100
- All right, cool.
- Nope, not cool.

618
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
$500.

619
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah, I've been calling
some of the local chain stores.

620
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,000
You know, Best Buy, Circuit City.

621
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,700
This model goes for $550,
$500 when they're on sale.

622
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,300
Okay, $500.

623
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,200
- Times 400 units, that comes to --
- That's $200,000.

624
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,900
What are you looking for?

625
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,700
Twenty percent. There's three of us.

626
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,500
I want a woman with thin ankles.

627
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,900
But I'm going to go home tonight,
and there's going to be my wife.

628
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,200
Eight percent. $16,000.

629
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,700
That's over $5,000 apiece
for you and your friends.

630
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,200
$20,000. Upfront.

631
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,700
Because I like you.

632
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,300
Look at that.
It's a Kodak moment in the house.

633
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,700
I got to run this by my people.

634
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,300
They okay it, I'm going to give you a call.

635
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,800
All right, cool.

636
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,000
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

637
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,100
You gonna insult my ace,
you check-and-raise piece of shit?

638
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,200
- Fuck you, Augie, see it or fold.
- I'll see it and raise you back.

639
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,200
- Talk to me, Augie.
- Ten-hut.

640
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,500
Where's the lieutenant?

641
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,900
He's on the street.

642
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,400
I'm not a politician.
I wouldn't even know how to count votes.

643
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,200
Maybe they know it's our time.

644
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,600
Tony.

645
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,400
Too soon to call you Commissioner?

646
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,300
Excuse me one sec.

647
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,200
- You sent me humps.
- Major?

648
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,900
You sent me a detail of humps, Ervin.

649
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,800
- We can discuss this tomorrow.
- No, I think we discuss it now...

650
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,200
or I'm gonna walk in there and tell Santoni...

651
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,900
to vote against this goddamn coronation.

652
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,400
And more than that, I'm gonna talk
some shit to some of my friends...

653
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,200
about what happened
at the end of the Barksdale case.

654
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,300
You hear me on that?

655
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,600
The Barksdale case
was a successful prosecution.

656
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,500
Up until our people
tried to chase the cash, maybe.

657
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,700
We have a quorum, I believe.
Council members can take their seats now.

658
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,600
Tell you what, Deputy.
You probably still got enough votes...

659
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,100
but I can make it uglier than you want it.

660
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,500
What do you want, Stan?

661
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,100
I want a real detail,
with real police and a real unit commander.

662
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,700
Fine, done.

663
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,000
Give me that black lieutenant
that did Barksdale.

664
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,400
Daniels put in his papers.
He's gone, out the door.

665
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,000
Did he meet the pension board yet?
I suggest you talk to the man.

666
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,900
- I'll do what I can.
- Don't fuck with me, Erv.

667
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,500
I got as many friends
here in the hall as you do.

668
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,800
And with what I'm learning
about the Barksdale case...

669
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,400
I got all kinds of shit I can throw.

670
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,400
- Lock-down in 20.
- All right.

671
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,300
What's up, Ice?

672
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,600
- You done with that Green Lantern?
- You can read it, but I want it back.

673
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,800
- You hit Dee?
- Dee ain't up.

674
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,700
Four hundred good cameras, Spiros.

675
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,900
Who brought them in?

676
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,700
The young stevedore, Niko,
and that idiot cousin of his.

677
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,900
And I think he uses, too.

678
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,800
Stefanos.

679
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,400
I don't give a damn nothing about him.

680
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,800
Listen, I'm paying 10 cents
on the dollar for the cameras.

681
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,300
We're going to clear $180,000.

682
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,500
- What about Niko?
- He's smart.

683
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,700
Make the deal.

684
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,800
What the hell's wrong with you tonight?

685
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,100
- What?
- You're acting normal.

686
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,600
You know what, Dolores?
I made money today.

687
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,700
Yeah? What ship was in?

688
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,600
Hey, Zig.

689
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,600
Shot and a beer, Dolores.

690
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,000
Frank Sobotka says I needed it.

691
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,900
Thanks.

692
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,000
- What's this?
- Your change. Or so says Frank Sobotka.

693
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,300
- Sure?
- It ain't mine, for Christ's sake.

694
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,300
If you don't take it, someone else is gonna.

695
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,000
Your pop's a good man, Zig.

696
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,000
Yo, up here!

697
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,800
T.C., what's up?

698
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,200
What's going on?

699
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,500
- They falling out, four that I seen.
- What?

700
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,800
What the fuck is going on?

701
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,400
Bad package. Hot shots.
