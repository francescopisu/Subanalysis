1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Wake up, Baltimore. It's 6:00 a.m...

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,700
Police!

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,300
Ready?

4
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,100
Freeze, FBI!

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,900
- All clear.
- Check upstairs.

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
Turn around.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,700
Put your hands up. Behind your neck.

8
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,700
Keep them there.

9
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,400
No, nothing here. All clear.

10
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,500
All clear.

11
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,800
You won't find a goddamn thing!
I can tell you that right now.

12
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,700
Ain't got shit on me.

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,300
Fuck! You ain't got nothing.
I'm telling you. Nothing!

14
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,800
Move, shitbird.

15
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,000
FBI, show me your hands!

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,900
Get down, fuck! Get down!

17
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Nice.

18
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,500
Bingo.

19
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,300
- From behind your clothes washer.
- That's heroin, 300 gelcaps.

20
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,700
And on today's Chip Franklin Show
at noon...

21
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,300
Chip will be live at Arundel Mills Mall
asking local retailers:

22
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,700
"What do you get
for the guy who has everything?"

23
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Now here's Steve Stewart with sports.

24
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,300
The Orioles continue to...

25
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,400
- We could take him now.
- Not enough profile.

26
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
Fucking feds.

27
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,400
Be advised, target 27 is on the move.

28
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,900
I don't get it.
Why leave Vondopoulos out on the street?

29
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,900
The text message that told him to clean up,
it came from someone higher up.

30
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,300
Someone we don't know.

31
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,500
We leave him on the street
after these raids...

32
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,100
he'll probably make contact
with whoever's above him.

33
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,800
Either another text message or a meet.

34
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,000
What's with George Glekas?

35
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,900
I'm afraid he's gonna duck this warrant.

36
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,000
- Chester Karol Sobotka?
- It's Frank Sobotka's kid.

37
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,400
Frank's kid kills one of our targets?
Are you shitting me?

38
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,900
Why? What for?

39
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,000
We hit the store this morning.

40
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,100
Every shred of paper's gone.
Just a bloodstain on the floor.

41
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,300
So we go over to his house a half hour later
with the warrant...

42
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,900
and it's full up with red-eyed Greek relations
looking at us like we're braindeads.

43
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,500
Homicide, Shea.

44
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,200
- This is Daniels, out at Southeast.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,100
Who caught the Highlandtown murder
the night before last?

46
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,900
Jay Landsman, sir.

47
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,600
I'll be right over.

48
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,000
Go get the interviews started.

49
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,200
- Lieutenant?
- Hey, It.

50
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,100
What the fuck is that about?

51
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
How did we do this morning?

52
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,500
Eton and Sergei are in. So is the madam.

53
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,500
Glekas, I'm not sure.

54
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,200
- The feds are waiting on Sobotka.
- What are they waiting for?

55
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
You don't wanna know.

56
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,100
Jesus, Larry...

57
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,700
The thing is, I think we gotta reach out
to a criminal lawyer real quick.

58
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,900
If the union guys can't handle this mess...

59
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,900
he's gonna have a bail hearing tomorrow.

60
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,600
- Do you have any details?
- I don't know nothing...

61
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,300
except he's locked up for it.
I can't see him till 10:00.

62
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,200
- That's the only time?
- Visiting hours, yeah.

63
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,300
Look, everything's gonna be fine.

64
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
- FBI! All of you move, now!
- What the fuck is this?

65
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,800
- FBI, move!
- Against the wall.

66
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,000
He's here.

67
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,300
Got another problem here, Larry.

68
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,500
Big man on the docks.

69
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,400
You don't look so big now, do you?

70
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Ma.

71
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
Pop.

72
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,200
It's gone.

73
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,200
And the money, too.

74
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,200
They say you need to come in.

75
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,200
They said the warrant
is at Southeastern police district.

76
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,100
They're out there now.

77
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,400
Showtime, Franky.

78
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
- Frank.
- Sir, any comment?

79
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,800
Is it just you, or is it the whole union?

80
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,200
What's your comment
on the charges being brought against you?

81
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Sir, do you have anything at all to say?
Any comment at all?

82
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,800
How will you answer
the charges against you?

83
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,100
Let me ask you, who exactly am I working
all these dead girls for?

84
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,600
The Homicide unit, right?

85
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,600
The same Homicide unit that can't put
two and two together and pick up a phone...

86
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,400
leaving me to read it a day-and-a-half later
in The Baltimore Sun.

87
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,600
- What did you take from the scene?
- Photos, latents, spent casings.

88
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Fuck.

89
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,700
They cleaned everything else?

90
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Even for a supremely
fucked-up police department...

91
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
this takes the prize.

92
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,600
How'd the kid play it?

93
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,300
He signed a full statement.

94
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,800
He said that there was an argument
about a stolen car or two.

95
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,800
Think he'll open up and talk more?

96
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He's been processed and assigned a PD.

97
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,400
If you want to take a run at the kid,
you're gonna have to get around his lawyer.

98
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,300
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. It's my bad.

99
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,600
State your name, asshole.
What's your name?

100
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
What's your name?

101
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,800
State your name.

102
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,900
Come on, you know this part.
Give us a name.

103
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,100
There is your name.

104
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
State your name.

105
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,100
No name?

106
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,900
- For now, we'll just call you Boris.
- Boris.

107
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
Why always "Boris"?

108
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,500
Racketeering. Wire fraud.
Conspiracy to import heroin.

109
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,700
Conspiracy to violate
federal customs statutes.

110
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,300
White slavery.

111
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,400
Today we're only charging
the customs violations, Mr. Sobotka.

112
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,300
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.

113
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,000
Name names, and come clean.
You help yourself and your union.

114
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,400
Help my union?

115
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,700
For 25 years,
we've been dying slow down there.

116
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,000
Dry docks rusting, piers standing empty.

117
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,200
My friends and their kids,
like we got the cancer.

118
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,000
No lifeline got thrown all that time.
Nothing from nobody.

119
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
And now you wanna help us?

120
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,800
Help me?

121
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,800
- What's your full name?
- Michael McArdle.

122
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,600
- White Mike.
- Yeah, that's right.

123
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,000
Listen to this, Mikey.

124
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,700
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

125
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,000
dropped that body on Potee Street
the other night.

126
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,600
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with a Greek-ass name...

127
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,500
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

128
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,100
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

129
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,100
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

130
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,900
We hit your suppliers.

131
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,200
They cleaned up
and left you holding the dirt.

132
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
- Suppliers of what?
- You discussed a drug buy on this tape.

133
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,200
We also have photographs
tying you to your stash house...

134
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,300
and putting you at The Greek's warehouse
over on Newkirk Street for re-ups.

135
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,200
Do yourself a solid here, Mike.

136
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,400
- What's the plan?
- This is just a detention hearing, Frank.

137
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,200
You're not a flight risk,
you have no meaningful priors.

138
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,700
And so far they've only hit you
with one count.

139
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,700
The magistrate's gonna ask us
some basic questions.

140
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,300
Barring anything unforeseen,
you're out in an hour.

141
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,000
- I said nothing to them suits.
- All the better.

142
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,900
- This Eton, he's in charge of what exactly?
- The dope.

143
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,400
He's what, Greek?

144
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,900
He's a Jew.
You know, from that Jew country they got.

145
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,200
- And what about the guy they call Sergei?
- Sergei's straight muscle.

146
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,500
- Look, I need something to eat.
- Okay, what do you want?

147
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,600
Two hot dogs and a strawberry soda.

148
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,500
I'd fuck the order up.

149
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
It's gotta be strawberry?

150
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,600
Hook a brother up.

151
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,300
Big man, that ain't gonna work for Omar.

152
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,400
It's all right.

153
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,700
Been what, a year?

154
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Boy, you don't know,
I been dreaming of running into you again.

155
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,900
You got a focus. I give you that.

156
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,000
Man be like that when he got work to do.
You know what I mean?

157
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,700
I think you've done enough.

158
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,700
Bird gone.
Wee-Bey copped out to all them murders.

159
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,200
He in jail now forever and a day.

160
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,500
Stinkum? I mean, you closed the book
on that nigger your damn self.

161
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,300
Avon, he out of pocket for the time being.

162
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,400
Leaving you.

163
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,000
- You looking for closure?
- Lookit, man, ain't no closure.

164
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Not unless Brandon walk up out his grave
and come up in this room right now.

165
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,800
See, all I know is whoever did him that way,
they gets got.

166
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,100
Whoever did him that way,
they still out there right now.

167
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,900
So now you gonna play like
you had nothing to do with it.

168
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,500
No, I can't lie.

169
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,000
I put the motherfucking paper out on y'all.
But y'all was fucking with my stash.

170
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,900
Anything after that, part of the game.

171
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,400
Maybe. But see,
I went past that with Brandon.

172
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,600
That wasn't me. That wasn't Avon, either.

173
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,400
Bird and them were there to see it.
But another man did all the extras:

174
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
all that cigarette shit...

175
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
all that bullshit with the eyes.

176
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,900
See now, this man,
he building a rep for himself...

177
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,100
and he wants you bad.

178
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,500
The brutal shit, that's his calling card.

179
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Little bow-tie wearing motherfucker
from out of...

180
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
NYC?

181
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,300
Yeah, small dude.

182
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,600
What he go by?

183
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,600
Brother Mouzone.

184
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,300
I know you heard of him, right?

185
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,900
So if y'all got the mind to go after him...

186
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,100
I might be able to point you
in that direction.

187
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Why?

188
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,000
What happened to your boy was business.

189
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,300
But how that shit happened,
you got the right to take that to heart.

190
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,600
I figure that'll make us even.

191
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,900
Now, you wanna know where this nigger is?

192
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,900
- We need to sit down and talk, Frank.
- I gotta see my son.

193
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,700
The man's right.
Let's grab a cup of coffee or something.

194
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,000
Not now, I need to get clean.

195
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,400
Sergei and them...

196
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,400
they did Mau Mau Willis.

197
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,400
- Why'd they chill him?
- He was welshing on the Jew.

198
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,800
Okay, Sergei's a soldier.
But he and Eton report to somebody.

199
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,400
- Who's above those two, Mike?
- I don't know.

200
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,000
- You don't know?
- Never did wanna know.

201
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,500
God in heaven, Zig,
the cops do that to you?

202
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,500
Ain't the cops.

203
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,300
Lawyers are saying the bail might be tough.

204
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,200
I'm trying.

205
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,700
You know I'm trying, right?

206
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,000
- What happened?
- I don't know.

207
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,300
I got tired.

208
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,900
I got tired of being the punchline
to every joke.

209
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,800
You had problems,
you could've come to me.

210
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,100
You could've said something.

211
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,300
You wouldn't have heard.

212
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
You were always too busy
dredging up the canal.

213
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,600
Making sure the right bum got elected.

214
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,100
Buying another round for the house.

215
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,400
I always used to think you were working
all them hours you spent away.

216
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,400
It was all work, Zig, even when it wasn't.

217
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,700
For you, for your mother.

218
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
I bet you didn't even tell her
I was in here, did you?

219
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,200
Maybe you did...

220
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,500
and she already took three Nembutals,
sleeping the day away.

221
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
- Leave her out of this.
- She's out of it, don't worry.

222
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Pop...

223
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,800
when I seen what I did
to that kid down at the store...

224
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,100
it made me sick to my stomach.

225
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,900
- That ain't you, Zig.
- It ain't?

226
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,100
Because the same blood
don't flow for us, Pop.

227
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,800
I mean, I wish it did, but it don't.

228
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,500
You're more like me than you know.

229
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,100
You're a Sobotka.

230
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,700
Fucked is what I am.

231
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,200
What the fuck can I say?

232
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,700
Best progress so far
is "White Mike" McArdle.

233
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,500
He's standing on the edge of the cliff.

234
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,600
We're gonna get Pearlman in today
to see what she can do to step him off.

235
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,600
Also, we're still hunting
the Sobotka nephew.

236
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,400
Herc and Carver are on that.

237
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,400
Still, my guess is the drug players...

238
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,500
even if they roll, give us Eton and Sergei.

239
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,200
The case gets thin when we get up to this...

240
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,600
Spiros Vondopoulos.

241
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,100
Boy, them Greeks
and those twisted-ass names.

242
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
Lay off the Greeks.
They invented civilization.

243
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,500
Yeah? Ass-fucking, too.

244
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,400
What exactly do we know
about Vondopoulos?

245
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,400
We should stay on him, see who he really is.

246
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
How about it?

247
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,500
Throw us a few
of your well-equipped surveillance teams?

248
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,500
In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant,
I'm the only fed still in the room.

249
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,400
The US attorney has what he wants
with the union guys...

250
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,100
which means my field office
is pretty much over this case.

251
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,100
Okay, we're on Vondopoulos ourselves.

252
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm sorry for him...

253
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,800
and for you.

254
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,500
We should've paid more attention
to our own.

255
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,000
Like I could've stopped Ziggy
from what he'd done.

256
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,700
Like anyone could ever control him.

257
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,000
I was thinking of my boy, too.

258
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,700
They're dropping the net on all the guys.

259
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,700
Ain't no secret
things get lost in them cans now and again.

260
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,500
He'll be all right.

261
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,300
They tossed my house, Frank.

262
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,600
They don't do that when there's
a couple of cases of vodka missing.

263
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,600
They made me sign the search warrant.
That's a receipt-like for what they found.

264
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,800
Heroin, Frank. From this house.

265
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,400
No, that ain't right. That can't be right.

266
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,300
I knew Nicky and Zig was boosting stuff.
Cameras, shit like that. Nothing like this.

267
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,600
You knew?

268
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,900
And once Nicky got used to boosting stuff
and seeing a little money...

269
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,300
what did you think he was gonna do?
Turn straight all of a sudden and give it up?

270
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,100
No, Frank.

271
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,000
Once you gave him
a taste on the house, just...

272
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,300
That was never... I mean, he knew. He knew.

273
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,100
Everything I did, the cans I let through...

274
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,800
the money we got from that
went to keeping what we had.

275
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,600
God damn it, Frank!

276
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,900
Don't let that excuse this. Not this.

277
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,200
Uncle Frank, with the big shoulders.

278
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,500
"If it's broke, give it to my uncle.

279
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,100
"He can fix it."

280
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Hey, Killer.
I got something for you, come here.

281
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,200
You got the new Harper's yet?

282
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,800
Now, you know stores down the way...

283
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,800
don't have nothing past Vibe
and Handguns Today.

284
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,600
Some titty mags, too, if you need.

285
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,900
All right. I got you.

286
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm gonna hook you up, though, all right?

287
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,700
Hey, boy. Told you I had something for you.

288
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,400
There you go.

289
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,900
That's my good boy.

290
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,500
Good day for a ship.

291
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,700
This is the hiring hall, Frank.
Working stevedores only.

292
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,200
Big Roy, let me have your card.

293
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,700
What do you want my card for?

294
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,500
Not you. Little Big Roy,
let me hold your card.

295
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,700
I need it.
I'm gonna work the Cape St. George today.

296
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,400
- I'll work it for you.
- Work it for me?

297
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,200
I work the ship on your card.
You work a barstool down Clement Street.

298
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,500
End of the week, you get paid.

299
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,900
Hey, Phil.

300
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,500
I'm putting up for the Cape St. George.

301
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,700
I don't see no resemblance.

302
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,200
We're both bald, we're both Polacks.
What the fuck else you need to know?

303
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,900
Who's gonna work for me?

304
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,100
- A different look for our boy.
- Perry Ellis or something.

305
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,500
How would a just-rolled-out-of-bed-looking
motherfucker like you...

306
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,300
know the designer?

307
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay, I'm guessing.

308
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,700
It's a Joseph Abboud.

309
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,400
He puts dark buttons instead of brass
on his blazers.

310
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,400
That's the Abboud signature.

311
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,300
You know what they call a guy who pays
that much attention to his clothes, right?

312
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,800
A grown-up.

313
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,100
We're up.

314
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,200
- 12-14, let's go.
- Copy, 11-34.

315
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,700
- That's a first.
- Sweat from a checker.

316
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,000
- You all right?
- Ready.

317
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,600
Maybe you ought to set up an easel
on the sidewalk...

318
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,500
- And do a sketch instead.
- I'm fine.

319
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,100
- Anything I ought to know?
- Yeah. Use the city.

320
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,200
Windows, mirrors, reflections,
anything like that.

321
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,500
Stay on my frequency, hear?

322
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,200
Vondopoulos should be coming out
of the garage on foot...

323
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,400
- Right about now.
- Copy that.

324
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,400
Beadie Russell. She wasn't much
when we started, you know.

325
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,400
But now she's got game.

326
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,600
Thank you.

327
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,800
12-14. I got him going into
a fifth floor room.

328
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,200
Note the number
then get down to the lobby.

329
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,000
- Wait on him there.
- Copy.

330
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,600
She's got Vondopoulos in a room.
It could be a while.

331
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,300
Copy.

332
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
- All this shit's going out to chassis?
- That's what they tell me.

333
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,500
We need a forklift. We're almost done here.

334
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,000
12-14. Vondopoulos and another man,
middle-aged, blue suit...

335
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,600
leaving the front door of the hotel.
They're just behind me. Copy?

336
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,700
Copy.

337
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,500
11-34.

338
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Subject and companion, blue suit,
leaving the hotel any moment now.

339
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Copy, we got the eyeball.

340
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,000
The man with Vondopoulos
has got to be big.

341
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,600
- I mean, look at that expensive suit.
- Yeah, with them buttons and all.

342
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,700
We leave the Benz here?

343
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,700
It's hot.

344
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,200
They didn't come back to the Benz.
You got them down there?

345
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,500
Negative.

346
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,400
- You about done?
- These nine here still got to be stripped.

347
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,900
- Harder than it looks.
- What ain't?

348
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,100
- You hear how Moonshot got his name?
- Yeah, and I could give a fuck.

349
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Who was the room registered to?

350
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,900
Stephen Rados.
He gave a Northwest D.C. address.

351
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,400
Maybe that's the man with the good tailor.
Maybe not.

352
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,100
We should run out the paper trail
on this guy, see what we turn up.

353
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,400
As to our only tangible piece of progress
from the raids...

354
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,200
what can we do for our friend White Mike?

355
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,200
He rolls on his suppliers,
and he can walk with a long probation.

356
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,800
- And we can move him, if he needs.
- Witness protection?

357
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Why have the feds with you if they're
not gonna step up every now and then?

358
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,500
Wait a second. You're gonna give
a drug dealer a ride like that?

359
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,100
What about Frank Sobotka?

360
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,600
The feds took a shot at him and got nothing.

361
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,100
Or so they tell me.

362
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,200
The way I read it, they cared more
about busting up the union --

363
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,000
Than anything else in the case.
If we came at Frank straight?

364
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,200
You can't make him
any kind of specific offer yourself.

365
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,800
Only I can do that, and only after
I get an okay from my front office.

366
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,500
- She could plant the seed.
- There's no better messenger, Counselor.

367
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,500
Take a shot.

368
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,000
- You going to his house?
- The Union Hall. That's his house.

369
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,000
Thanks for waiting, Brucie. Sorry I'm late.

370
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,200
I shouldn't even be seen with you
at this point.

371
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,600
I just wanna settle our business
while we still can.

372
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,800
It ain't like I'm gonna get my hands
on more cash, obviously.

373
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,800
The grain pier is dead.

374
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,900
Half the votes we had lined up
are walking sideways now.

375
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,500
They read the paper, Frank.

376
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,600
So what? So I'm dirty.
The grain pier's still the grain pier, right?

377
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,200
They ain't voting for me, Brucie!
It ain't about me!

378
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,400
I'm not gonna lie.

379
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,100
No one is gonna stand with us
now that the FBI is on you.

380
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,400
- They're scared.
- Of what?

381
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,500
They took the money, Frank.

382
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,600
And now if they deliver the votes,
they figure the feds will be on them, too.

383
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,300
I'm sorry, Frank.

384
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,400
You find a way
of putting this FBI thing to bed...

385
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,200
maybe we can come back the next session
with the grain pier.

386
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,500
You'll have a couple of people down there
knowing they owe you a vote or two.

387
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,600
I don't know what else to say. I don't.
I'm sorry, Frank.

388
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,500
You know what the trouble is, Brucie?

389
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,100
We used to make shit in this country.
Build shit.

390
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,500
Now we just put our hand
in the next guy's pocket.

391
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,600
Come on, you can't eat only olives.
Order something. Lamb or something.

392
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,500
I'm not hungry.

393
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,400
All this trouble.

394
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,100
- So, our associates, they are strong?
- Yes.

395
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't worry about our people.
We can try to get them out before the trial.

396
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,200
If not, they will stand for us.

397
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,200
We have shown them too much.
There will be no more trouble.

398
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,300
We must make certain of this.

399
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,500
- Maybe there's another way.
- There is only one sure way.

400
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,900
Hear me out.

401
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,600
If I could guarantee
that Frank Sobotka and his nephew...

402
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,400
would be silent...

403
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
wouldn't you prefer that?

404
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,800
But you cannot guarantee this.

405
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,300
Frank's son,
the idiot who shot George in his store...

406
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,800
he is going to jail for a long time...

407
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,900
unless...

408
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,300
There was a young clerk wounded that day
in the store.

409
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,000
The prosecutors want to use him
as a witness.

410
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,800
I know his family.

411
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,600
Frank Sobotka will have his son back.

412
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,800
If a man can have this,
why would he talk to the police?

413
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,100
What about Frank's nephew?

414
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,500
He is the idiot's cousin.
He wants the same thing as Frank.

415
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,700
Anyway, I don't worry about Niko.

416
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,200
You are fond of him, Spiros.

417
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,100
You should've had a son.

418
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,100
But then I would've had a wife.

419
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,900
If this maggot doesn't post by midnight,
I'm gonna take it personal.

420
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,500
The shitbird lives in his parents' basement.

421
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,100
Where's a guy like that gonna run?

422
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,800
You wanna go with Auntie Tasha? Come on.

423
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,800
Nice and easy, honey.

424
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,600
- Come here.
- All right, come on, baby.

425
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,700
What's up, big man? Where the party at?

426
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,900
Ain't no party up in here, girl.

427
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
We thought Darnell and everybody
was gonna get their smoke on.

428
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,200
Don't you know Darnell?

429
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,700
What's this good boy's name?

430
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,300
Hey, boy.

431
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,700
How you doing today?

432
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,000
You been good? This a good boy.

433
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,100
- There it is.
- Car will be running.

434
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,800
What is it, Lamar?

435
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
No need to prolong this.

436
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,500
No, we got time.

437
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,600
- You kill my man?
- No, he's resting.

438
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,700
- I'm saying, ain't you wanna know?
- Not particularly.

439
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,000
About a year ago, a boy name Brandon got
got here in Baltimore.

440
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,500
Stuck and burned before he passed.

441
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,200
- The game is the game.
- Indeed.

442
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,000
See, that boy was beautiful.

443
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,700
Wasn't no need for y'all to do him
the way y'all did.

444
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,200
You feel me?

445
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,800
- A year, you say?
- About that.

446
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,400
You've got some wrong information.

447
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,800
Man, you lying to live.

448
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
I'm at peace with my God.

449
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,400
Do what you will.

450
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,900
So you know?

451
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,200
What happened to your boy,
it's not my style.

452
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,800
The way you bleeding out your back,
looks like that bullet bore clean through.

453
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,800
9mm at close range will do that.

454
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,300
Emergency. Do you need police
or ambulance?

455
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,200
I wanna report a shooting
over here at the new motel.

456
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,600
- On North Avenue. Room 221.
- Sir?

457
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,100
My pal, Beatrice.

458
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,200
What, you gonna run me in again?
Isn't that like double jeopardy or some shit?

459
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,100
Stop it, just stop it.

460
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,600
- Talk to me.
- And say what?

461
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,500
I'm sitting here trying to figure it out myself.

462
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,700
It didn't happen overnight.

463
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,700
I knew I was wrong.

464
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,900
But in my head, I thought I was wrong
for the right reasons, you know?

465
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,500
There are different kinds of wrong.

466
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,200
What're you doing here, Bea?

467
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,500
I'd like you to come in. Not in cuffs.

468
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,900
Because you want to.

469
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,600
I'm opening a door here, Frank.

470
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,200
I can't promise you anything.

471
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,500
Just come in. We'll start from there.

472
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,200
You're better than them you got in bed with.

473
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,900
- Our man Vondopoulos didn't come home?
- Maybe he got lucky.

474
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,800
Maybe we didn't.

475
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,200
You think he ditched the Benz
because he picked up the tail?

476
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,800
Nicky from the docks.

477
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,300
If you hadn't called last night,
I'd have never found you.

478
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,200
Relax, Niko, come on.

479
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,900
It's like I told you on the phone.

480
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,200
It is going to be all right.
We can make it all right.

481
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,900
I should have never gone down the road
with you people.

482
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,900
Come on.
You tried to make something of yourself.

483
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,100
There's no harm in that.

484
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,600
And you still have friends.

485
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,300
I'm busted.

486
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,600
So is my uncle and the whole fucking union.
And Ziggy?

487
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,500
- Christ!
- We will be a friend to him, too.

488
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,000
Nothing your people can do about that.
Ziggy's done.

489
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,100
Nothing is done, Niko. Nothing.

490
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,100
Take a look.

491
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,000
That's not your name.

492
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,900
Many names, many passports.

493
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,200
We can do many things.

494
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,200
What can you do for Ziggy?

495
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,100
We ask only loyalty.

496
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,800
Why do they need sticks?
Can't they kick it with their feet?

497
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,800
She asked me straight-up to come in,
so I'm here.

498
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,200
First, we need to know
what you're looking for.

499
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,100
We don't want any misunderstandings
later on.

500
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,600
I'm just looking for, you know,
some help with my son.

501
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,300
- He can't jail where they got him.
- We move him to a county facility.

502
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,500
- What about my nephew?
- He gets arrested and charged.

503
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,100
But for his cooperation and yours...

504
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,500
we can live with straight probation.

505
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,400
But what we can and cannot do
for you and your family...

506
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,600
- Depends on the level of your cooperation.
- You mean, how much I give you?

507
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,700
I got dirt on all of them.

508
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,200
I'll put myself in, too. Whatever you need.
Anything but the union.

509
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,100
I ain't putting in no union men.
I'll give you them dead girls in the can.

510
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,500
I'll give you The Greek,
all them sons of bitches...

511
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,900
just to have it off my chest.
Just look to my son and my nephew.

512
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,500
Mr. Sobotka, at this point
I have to advise you...

513
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,000
you need to retain
the services of an attorney.

514
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,400
We're not gonna do this now?

515
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,400
You need to have a lawyer
present in the room.

516
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,300
You have that, we can make this happen
first thing tomorrow.

517
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,600
Mr. Sobotka, I gotta ask.

518
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,600
Why did you stop using your cellphone?

519
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,400
You guys flagged it.
You think I didn't know?

520
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,800
Under the bridge?

521
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,600
It's out in the open.
I guess the cops can't bug it or nothing.

522
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,100
These guys,
they got a big operation to protect.

523
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,800
They're global-like.

524
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,200
- They're really something?
- You got no idea.

525
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,500
I think I got a pretty clear picture
of what they're about.

526
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,900
We ain't talking about a bunch of thieves
rolling drums of olive oil off the docks.

527
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,100
Heroin?

528
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,600
How the fuck did that happen, Nick?
Look at me!

529
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,100
You ain't much more than a kid.

530
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,100
Me, I should've known better.
I put you up with them, for what?

531
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,100
I flushed my fucking family, for what?

532
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,600
You know what that is, Nicky? Do you?

533
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,800
A condominium.

534
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,600
I ain't going down there.

535
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,200
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna go in and talk with the police.

536
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,700
That's right. I'm gonna do
to those cocksuckers what they did to me.

537
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,900
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

538
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,000
They wanna meet with us on Ziggy.

539
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,400
They can lean on that witness...

540
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,600
that kid that he shot,
the one that was there in the store.

541
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,100
The kid's gonna say that
Double G had the gun.

542
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,000
That it was like self-defense or some shit.

543
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,100
Ziggy could walk, Uncle Frank.

544
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,200
He could.

545
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,200
- And for that they want what?
- Loyalty.

546
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,200
Motherfuckers!

547
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,800
I'll hear them out.

548
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,200
- All right, I'll drive.
- No, it's just me.

549
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,800
You ain't dealing with those guys no more.

550
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,100
- Uncle Frank, me and Spiros --
- I don't fucking want you with me, Nick!

551
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,500
Go home!

552
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,500
Your way...

553
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,400
it won't work.
