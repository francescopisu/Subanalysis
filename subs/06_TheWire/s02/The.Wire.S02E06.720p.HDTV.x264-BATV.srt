1
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,700
Ain't working out for y'all, huh?

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,500
- Mars is the God of war, right?
- Planet, too.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,800
I know it's a planet.
But the clue is "Greek God of war."

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Ares.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,700
Greeks called him Ares.
Same dude, different name, that's all.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,300
Ares fits. Thanks.

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,900
It's all good.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,600
See, back in middle school and all,
I used to love them myths.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700
That stuff was deep. Truly.

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,600
You're up.

11
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,600
State calls Omar Little, Your Honor.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,500
Faggot.

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth...

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,800
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,100
I surely do.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,400
- State your name for the record.
- Omar Devon Little.

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,700
- Mr. Little, how old are you?
- About 29, thereabout.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,000
- And where do you live?
- No place in particular, ma'am.

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,700
- You're homeless?
- In the wind, so to speak.

20
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,700
- And what is your occupation?
- Occupation?

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,500
What exactly do you do for a living,
Mr. Little?

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,600
I rip and run.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,900
- You...
- I robs drug dealers.

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,100
And exactly how long has this been
your occupation, Mr. Little?

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,500
I don't know exactly.

26
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,000
I venture to say
maybe about eight or nine years.

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Mr. Little, how does a man rob drug dealers
for eight or nine years...

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,500
and live to tell about it?

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,700
Day at a time, I suppose.

30
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
What do we know?

31
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,800
On Sobotka, very little.
He seems to live within his means.

32
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,500
House in Glen Burnie,
paid-off truck, modest savings.

33
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,700
- Credit history is okay.
- There's no flash to him, nothing dramatic.

34
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,900
Doesn't sound much
like a money man to me.

35
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,500
- Or maybe he's hiding it.
- The union is also a little threadbare.

36
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,300
They paid the taxes on union hall
almost a year late...

37
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,800
and that was only after
they got hit with liens.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,300
Looking at their books --

39
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,900
- You subpoenaed their books?
- You don't need to.

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
IBS books are open
to the Justice Department...

41
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,300
under the terms
of a federal racketeering case...

42
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,200
- That came out of New York five years ago.
- We called Washington.

43
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,900
They sent us a copy of everything
the Baltimore locals have filed.

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,700
The books show
that there's less than a 100 checkers...

45
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,000
still paying dues to 15-14.

46
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,900
And that's down from about 300 in the '70s.
They're hurting.

47
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,700
So where's all this money
Valchek is talking about?

48
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,400
The IBS hired Bruce DiBiago
to lobby Annapolis this session.

49
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,000
And through individual officers
and union members...

50
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,000
they've paid about $70,000
to various PACs...

51
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,500
and Democratic organizations
in the last eight months.

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
They show any of that on their books?

53
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,100
No, we pieced that together
from the campaign finance reports.

54
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,000
That's just what was in the names
of the union officers we cross-referenced.

55
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,700
- So, where's the cash coming from?
- Drugs?

56
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,500
So far, DNRs
on the union hall phones don't show much.

57
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,900
Union business and personal calls,
but no beepers...

58
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,400
and not much in the way of cell numbers
or payphones either.

59
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,000
What's with those hand-to-hands?
Anything connect?

60
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,200
We're buying from a lot of white boys.

61
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
O'Donnell Heights, Greektown,
Highlandtown above the park.

62
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,400
- But any port connections feel random.
- The money comes from somewhere.

63
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,800
Maybe it's what the checkers do.

64
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,500
I mean...

65
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,900
they monitor what comes in
and out of the port.

66
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,100
- That's what they do, that's their value.
- They're bringing the shit in?

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Or they're letting it happen.

68
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Like that can full of dead girls.
They kept that out of the computer.

69
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,000
Which is why we're gonna quietly do
some work on that side of things.

70
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,300
Kima, Prez,
I want you to start looking at girls.

71
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
No problem.

72
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
If they're coming into Baltimore,
who's working them?

73
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,500
Are they club dancing, whoring?
We need to plug into that circuit.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,400
As for the rest of you...

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,500
Lester is gonna stay with the paper trail
and with the DNRs...

76
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,700
looking for connections to the union money.

77
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,900
Herc and Carver...

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,900
you guys keep working the drug corners
near the port.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Officer Russell here and Bunk Moreland
are assigned to Homicide...

80
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,300
but for the time being they'll be with us...

81
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,300
running the port database, looking
for any pattern involving contraband.

82
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Questions?

83
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,700
Excuse me.

84
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,400
- I'm Thomas.
- Beadie.

85
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,900
Would you like to go to Royal Farms,
maybe get a cup of coffee?

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,100
Right.

87
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,900
Yo, I'm Thomas. You want a coffee?

88
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,900
Listen, I was gonna ask her for her panties
to make some soup with...

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,600
but I was afraid she'd take it the wrong way.

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,700
You were at the opposite end
of the parking lot...

91
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,300
- When the assailant drew his gun?
- Thereabout.

92
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Do you see the gunman who killed Mr. Gant
anywhere in the courtroom today?

93
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,100
Yo, what up, Bird?

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,000
For the record, you are identifying
the defendant, Marquis Hilton.

95
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,000
It's just Bird to me.

96
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,300
And Mr. Little, you had seen him
many times before, had you not?

97
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,800
- Yeah, we jailed together down the Cut --
- Objection, Your Honor. May we approach?

98
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,200
Quite a witness, ain't he?

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Word on the street is, Omar ain't
nowhere near them rises when the shit pop.

100
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,700
Street said little cocksucker
was over on the East Side...

101
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,200
sticking up some Ashland Avenue niggers.

102
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,500
That's the word on the street, huh?

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,800
Trouble is, String, we ain't on the street.
We're in a court of law.

104
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,700
Your Honor --

105
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,500
Objection is noted and preserved
for the record, Mr. Levy. Move on.

106
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,400
Thank you, Your Honor.

107
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,800
Jurors will disregard that last comment
from the witness in which he explained...

108
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,700
where he had last
encountered the defendant.

109
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,900
Yes or no, Mr. Little?

110
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,900
Prior to the shooting,
did you know the defendant?

111
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,500
I knew the man,
but wasn't like he was no friend or nothing.

112
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,400
So you would have no trouble
recognizing him from a moderate distance...

113
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,000
say 20, 25 yards in daylight?

114
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,100
No problem.

115
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,300
Mr. Little, do you recognize...

116
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
this particular weapon?

117
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah, that's Bird's gun, the .380.

118
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,900
- You've seen it before?
- Bird always flashing that thing.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So you'd actually seen it
before the day in question.

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,400
- And on the day in question?
- It was in Bird's hand.

121
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,700
- When he shot at Mr. Gant?
- Yes, ma'am.

122
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,100
- Bird covet them shiny little pistols.
- Objection, Your Honor.

123
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,900
And the boy too trifling to throw it off
even after a daytime murder.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're a lying cocksucker, man.
I'll rip your heart out your goddamn chest!

125
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,500
The defendant will regain control
or he will be forcibly restrained...

126
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,300
and I will clear the court.

127
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,200
The witness's last answer is to be stricken
and disregarded by the jury.

128
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Niko.

129
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,000
Eton is my friend.

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,500
It's good to have friends meet, no?

131
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,900
Eton, huh?

132
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,700
That's from the Greek, meaning what?

133
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,900
No Greek. Israeli.

134
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah?

135
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,100
'Cause you look Greek, no offense.

136
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Either way, I mean...

137
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,500
- You have the chemicals?
- I can get them, as much as you want.

138
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
When?

139
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,200
I was gonna do something this week.
There's been a problem, though.

140
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
- What problem?
- My cousin Ziggy.

141
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,800
He got into a beef
with these East Baltimore guys.

142
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,700
Drug dealer by the name of Cheese
took his car, burned it...

143
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,900
now he's saying he's gonna dust Zig
if he doesn't pay.

144
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,700
Yeah, malaka, right.
Zig fucked up the package.

145
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,800
So, you bring us the chemicals, we pay.

146
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
Then you pay your debt.

147
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,800
It was $2,700, right?

148
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,000
Now, this asshole is saying it's double.
$5,400, you believe that?

149
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,900
First he takes the car...

150
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,500
and now he's jacking us around
on the money.

151
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,700
- You want, we kill him.
- No.

152
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,700
- That ain't it either, no.
- Why no?

153
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,900
'Cause first of all, Zig fucked it up.
He owes $2,700.

154
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,000
And second, you kill Cheese...

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,600
and we're gonna have a fight
with his people, right?

156
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,900
A year down the road...

157
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,500
some nigger sees my cousin
coming out the burger shop...

158
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,800
putting gas in his car on Central Avenue,
no questions, puts a cap in his ass.

159
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,700
He's smart, huh? Niko, smart.

160
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,400
We don't have the muscle
to go talk to this guy, make things right.

161
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,300
I was hoping maybe you do.

162
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,200
Mr. Little...

163
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,800
can I ask why you came forward
in this case?

164
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,600
- I told the police what I know.
- Were you offered anything in exchange?

165
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,800
- Like what?
- Were you arrested?

166
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Were you going to be charged with a crime,
and by testifying...

167
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,700
did the police agree to drop those charges?

168
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,500
No, man, it ain't even about that.

169
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
How many times have you been arrested
as an adult, Mr. Little?

170
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,600
Shoot, I done lost count.

171
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Enough, though, not to take it personal.

172
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,400
Possession of a handgun...

173
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
possessing a concealed weapon,
assault by pointing...

174
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
robbery, deadly weapon,
possession of a handgun again...

175
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,100
followed by violation of parole
on weapon charges...

176
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,000
followed by
one count of attempted murder...

177
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,800
and use of a handgun
in commission of a felony.

178
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,200
That wasn't no attempt murder.

179
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,300
What was it, Mr. Little?

180
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,600
I shot the boy Mike-Mike
in his hind parts, that all.

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,400
Fixed it so he couldn't sit right.

182
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Why'd you shoot Mike-Mike
in his hind parts?

183
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
- Let's say we had a disagreement.
- A disagreement over?

184
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,600
Mike-Mike thought he should keep
that cocaine he was slinging...

185
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,600
and the money
he was making from slinging it.

186
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,400
I thought otherwise.

187
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,400
So you rob drug dealers?
This is what you do.

188
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,500
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,500
You walk the streets of Baltimore
with a gun...

190
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
taking what you want, when you want it...

191
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,000
willing to use violence
when your demands aren't met.

192
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,800
This is who you are.

193
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,200
Why should we believe
your testimony then?

194
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,800
- Why believe anything you say?
- That's up to y'all, really.

195
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,600
You say you aren't here
testifying against the defendant...

196
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,900
- Because of any deal you made with police.
- True that.

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,900
That you are here
because you want to tell the truth...

198
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,500
about what happened to Mr. Gant
in that housing project parking lot.

199
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Yup.

200
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,700
When in fact you are exactly
the kind of person who would...

201
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,600
if you felt you needed to...

202
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,900
shoot a man down
on a housing project parking lot...

203
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
and then lie to the police about it,
would you not?

204
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,600
Look, I ain't never put my gun on no citizen.

205
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,900
You are amoral, are you not?

206
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,600
You are feeding off the violence
and the despair of the drug trade.

207
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,100
You are stealing from those who themselves
are stealing the lifeblood from our city.

208
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,300
- You are a parasite who leeches off...
- Just like you, man.

209
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,000
...the culture of drugs... Excuse me? What?

210
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,600
I got the shotgun. You got the briefcase.

211
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,800
It's all in the game, though, right?

212
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,400
And with the economy, what it is...

213
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
you can really consider coming in
10% or 20% below asking...

214
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,700
and still feel competitive.

215
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,100
- Even on the Hamburg Street address?
- Absolutely.

216
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,800
I have to admit, I like the house at 1501.

217
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,600
Although I didn't like the color
of the whirlpool tub...

218
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,700
in the master suite bathroom. Magenta?

219
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,400
- That's cosmetic.
- If they want to make the sale...

220
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,200
they should have some amount
of couth to change the color.

221
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,800
I know it's such a tiny point to harp on.

222
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,600
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just keep looking.

223
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,600
We shouldn't settle for just anything.

224
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,500
And you think that there will be
some new open houses this Sunday?

225
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,400
- I'm sorry, what were you saying?
- We're gonna keep looking.

226
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,000
- You'll take us around again on Sunday?
- Definitely.

227
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,600
- Okay then, see you Sunday, early.
- Great.

228
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,900
Thank you.

229
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,400
I'll see you then.

230
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,900
You are a child, you know that?

231
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,400
- What do you want?
- Dinner and a movie.

232
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
- Come on, stop it.
- Why not?

233
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,100
This isn't going anywhere, Jimmy.

234
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,700
Dinner and a movie,
then I'll walk you to the door...

235
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,000
and you tell me to go fuck myself
like you should've done way back when.

236
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,700
How about I tell you to fuck yourself
here and now?

237
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Then you can save that money
for someone else.

238
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,300
Come on, Elena.
Come on, I signed all your damn papers.

239
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,500
Give me another shot.

240
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,400
Friday. You pay for the sitter.

241
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,200
- So how that D.C. game, man?
- Same as it ever was.

242
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,500
Chocolate City, I ain't been there in a while.

243
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,600
Call it Drama City nowadays.

244
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,600
Otherwise, same old gogo. Same old Bamas.

245
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Same soup, just reheated,
know what I'm saying?

246
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,600
If you need anything to make this happen,
you gotta get it yourself.

247
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,500
I can't go through my people.

248
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,000
If Stringer Bell reaching
all the way past Baltimore...

249
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,600
with this kind of work...

250
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
then we got a real mystery
going on, don't we?

251
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,700
Don't worry, no mistakes.
Nothing that might come back on you.

252
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,700
- You sure of your people?
- My cousin up in there...

253
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,900
- He on it.
- All right.

254
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,900
I can't stand that gogo shit, anyhow.

255
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,500
Ain't heard it live, then.

256
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,900
I know a club in Oxon Hill
that would wreck y'all.

257
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
All right.

258
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,100
If I'm around the way.

259
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,600
So, how you doing?

260
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,100
- Nursing school right now.
- Good, that's good.

261
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,400
Lester's been pushing me, you know.

262
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,900
He does it, kind of without you knowing
that he's doing it.

263
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Yeah, I know what you mean.

264
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,000
He said that you would be by today
to talk about the clubs.

265
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
About some girls, Russian.

266
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,700
- Or from that part of the world.
- The ones on the circuit, yeah.

267
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
You should try this place called Nightshift
down off of Holabird.

268
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,500
I have a friend who works there.

269
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,300
She worked with a bunch of Russian girls
last year for about three months.

270
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,200
- Think she'll talk to me?
- Only if I ask her.

271
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,200
Thank you, Detective, nothing further.

272
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,700
- Anything more on redirect, Miss Nathan?
- No, Your Honor.

273
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,500
Let's take 10 minutes
and then run the closing arguments.

274
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,800
I have every intention
of beginning tomorrow...

275
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
with jury instructions.

276
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,800
- How'd Omar do?
- You didn't see it?

277
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,300
Not the cross. That bad?

278
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,600
- You have no problem.
- No?

279
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,600
To start, he wants you to pay $5,400.
Then we talk.

280
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,900
- He says, "No, you pay just the $2,700."
- Yeah, I saw how you talked.

281
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,100
But you will not pay the $2,700.

282
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Instead you will get the money
for the car that burned.

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,600
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

284
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,200
Him we don't know.
But the one he calls boss, him we know.

285
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,000
You gonna sit there and pout?

286
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,300
I know you don't think I'm going down
to that club just to look at pussy.

287
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I know you know me better than that.

288
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,100
- I ain't even looking.
- Everybody's looking.

289
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,000
- Most of them women are dykes.
- Cheryl, it's police work.

290
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,500
What, so that's supposed
to make me feel better?

291
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,800
Kima's out on the street
doing her detective thing?

292
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,400
All that hospital shit, all that rehab...

293
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,900
- All them promises --
- We talked about this.

294
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,400
No, you talked.

295
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,400
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.

296
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,500
- Where you going?
- With you.

297
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Excuse me?

298
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,900
Who knows? I might see a little something
I happen to like.

299
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,900
So all of that's on the table?

300
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,500
There's money in the transport budget
for the grain pier.

301
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,200
Also, a bond issue that pays
for maintenance dredging...

302
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,500
on the main shipping channel.

303
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,100
- But not the canal?
- Nope, not the canal.

304
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,600
For that we'll have to fight
a little longer and dig a little deeper.

305
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,900
So says Frank.

306
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,200
I gotta say, for my money,
we're lucky if we pull out the grain pier.

307
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,600
Be that as it may,
we spent the money and took our best shot.

308
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,500
Hired a couple lobbyists,
made some smart contributions...

309
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,800
paid for a consultant's report...

310
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,200
to argue against
some of the environmental stuff.

311
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
It cost, but we're starting to see it.

312
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,200
- So where y'all find the cash?
- I've been robbing liquor stores, two a week.

313
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,100
Seriously.

314
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,800
We got some help
from the national office on this.

315
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,100
There've been some timely donations
from a few friends here and there.

316
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,100
The point is, at the very least...

317
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,900
we're likely to see
the grain pier back up by next year...

318
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,600
which means a couple hundred
more ships a year, at least.

319
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
- If.
- And it's a big fucking "if."

320
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,000
- If that Polack motherfucker --
- Hey.

321
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,900
No offense.

322
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,100
If Krawczyk don't fuck us by throwing up
waterfront condominiums first, right?

323
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,900
Nat's right. The back door threat
is that Andy Kraw or some other developer...

324
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,400
gets enough last-minute votes
to sink the rehab money for the grain pier.

325
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Those guys are looking at that location, too.

326
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,900
So we need everybody making phone calls.

327
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,600
Let your legislators know
that we're watching on this.

328
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,600
The money only goes so far.
Now we gotta make some noise, right?

329
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,100
- Make some noise.
- Okay, enough talk.

330
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,400
Some of youse got ships
to work in the morning.

331
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,500
- The rest of youse need to be drunk.
- I'll drink to that.

332
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Help from the national office, huh?
Timely donations from friends?

333
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,300
Watch your ass, Frank.

334
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,500
- This is it?
- Yeah.

335
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,700
Just picked it up
from the port administrator.

336
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,300
So what am I looking at?

337
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,600
The Atlantic Light on the day
the can with the women was offloaded.

338
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,700
The boxes are containers.

339
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,700
This one's being offloaded
and set on a chassis.

340
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
Here's the time: 10:31 hours.

341
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,300
See? It was moved to Lane L,
Stack 6, Row 3...

342
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,500
by an RTG at 10:37 hours.

343
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,100
- RTG?
- Rubber tire gantry.

344
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,100
So from ship to stack took six minutes.

345
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,100
That's the way it's supposed to work, but...

346
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,600
"AQQZ, " as in zebra...

347
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,500
"396594."

348
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,200
Check digit, seven.

349
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,100
That's the container number
of the can with the women in it.

350
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
See that?
It was never entered by the checker.

351
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
So as far as the computer is concerned,
it no longer exists.

352
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,300
Sobotka says that that can happen
when the radio waves get knocked down...

353
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,200
or when a checker inputs
a bad serial number.

354
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,200
It came off Atlantic Light at 11:26 hours.

355
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,700
And it doesn't show up
in the computer again until 15:12 hours.

356
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
I find it two hours after that.

357
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,600
So for nearly four hours,
it's out on the docks, unaccounted for.

358
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,800
Sobotka says cans get lost all the time.

359
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,600
When they get found,
they get put back into the computer.

360
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,200
You believe him?

361
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,700
No, not this can.

362
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,300
So what's the plan?

363
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,700
The database on this computer...

364
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,300
has records for every ship
that berthed at Patapsco...

365
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,900
over the last two years.

366
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,700
We gotta go back through
and find what other cans...

367
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,200
might've disappeared like that.

368
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,600
- See if there's a pattern.
- How many ships we talking about?

369
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,800
Hundreds.

370
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,100
It ain't like I got a prayer of bringing
this case in otherwise.

371
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,300
- That's what I'm talking about.
- All right.

372
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,800
- What the hell is your problem?
- Nothing.

373
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,700
Yeah, you look like you about to be sick
or something.

374
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
I just can't look at them.

375
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,400
Prez, you ain't never been to a titty bar?

376
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,800
Yeah, sure. But not with women.

377
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,200
You're sure you're not gonna have
a problem for talking to us?

378
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,100
I don't give a shit.
You friends with Shardene, all that matters.

379
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,500
Besides, I'm from Westport,
and I told them club owners straight-up...

380
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,300
I was here before them ho's got here...

381
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,800
and they better make sure
I'm here after they leave.

382
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,200
- So how long ago did they came through?
- Six months back was the last batch.

383
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,100
Russians, I think,
but shit all sound the same...

384
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,200
when you can't understand
a damn word, right?

385
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,000
- Who brought them?
- Club owner pays extra for them.

386
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,800
There was a woman...

387
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
she was like the madam
who handled the cash.

388
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,600
- But I ain't get a name.
- She Russian, too?

389
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,500
She was something. She had an accent.

390
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,200
So it's like, one day all Baltimore girls
are at the bar...

391
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,700
and the next, what?

392
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,300
- All foreign girls?
- That about right.

393
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,800
They was making so much money
with them new girls...

394
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
they let some of their regular dancers go.

395
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,600
Not me, 'cause I mean, I got clientele here.

396
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,700
- But some of the others...
- Where'd the girls stay?

397
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,500
Where they told. Shit, they ain't here legally.
They don't know shit.

398
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
They ain't got no family.

399
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,000
The men they got handling them
are always with them.

400
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,600
Right there to take them
from whatever motel they use...

401
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,900
to the club and back.

402
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,900
Right there when they need to get food,
or go to the Rite Aid.

403
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,500
Right outside the motel door
when they up in them rooms with the johns.

404
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,400
Anyone try to get away?

405
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Shit, I seen one of them get lit up
with one of them stun guns...

406
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
for going down the block
to get some dinner.

407
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,400
They barely let them girls
go to the bathroom by themselves.

408
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,100
And if they see one getting
too close to the johns...

409
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,800
that's when they move the whole crew
to another town.

410
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Keep it so they don't get no help.

411
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,500
You up after the next song.

412
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,600
Push my numbers then.
I gotta go get paid, honey.

413
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,000
You need anything else, you can call me.
Help if I can.

414
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,500
I'll tell Shardene you said hi.

415
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,000
She must be doing good,
to be out for so long.

416
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,900
She must've landed a rich one, right?

417
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,000
- You her girl?
- Yeah.

418
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,500
I wouldn't let mine come in here either
without me.

419
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,500
These bitches in here are no joke.

420
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,000
Thirteen of them.

421
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,100
They had about a third of that space
hidden behind the fake wall.

422
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,300
A few flashlights, some junk food,
some water.

423
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,600
A portable toilet they had to share.

424
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
And not enough air.

425
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm going to schedule sentencing
for the third week of next month.

426
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,500
Anything else today?

427
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,500
Your Honor, my client,
having preserved the necessary grounds...

428
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,500
for appeal in the record,
wishes me to state unequivocally...

429
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,400
that regardless of this jury's verdict...

430
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,200
he is the victim of wholesale perjury
on the part of the state's key witness.

431
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,200
We ask that an appeal bond be set...

432
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,800
so that he can participate fully
in this investigation.

433
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,500
An appeal bond on a conviction
of first-degree murder?

434
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,800
- Mr. Levy, get a grip on yourself.
- Your Honor --

435
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,700
Not only will there be
no bond pending sentencing...

436
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,500
but as far as I'm concerned...

437
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,100
the pre-sentencing report
is a mere formality.

438
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Mr. Hilton has been found guilty
of killing a state's witness...

439
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,900
who testified in this very courtroom.

440
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
He did so in cold blood, and for pay.

441
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,600
Unless the pre-sentence report
indicates that he is, in fact...

442
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,100
the Messiah come again...

443
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,200
he will very likely be sentenced
to life, no parole...

444
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,000
by a Baltimore judge who,
for once in his life...

445
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
gets to leave his office feeling
that his job actually matters.

446
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,900
Mr. Hilton, are you the second coming
of our savior?

447
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
- Excuse me?
- Are you Jesus Christ come back to Earth?

448
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,000
See you at sentencing.

449
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,400
Was it good for you, too?

450
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,500
Mr. Little, this is good to get-out-of-jail-free
one time only...

451
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,100
on anything up to aggravated assault.

452
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,900
- Why thank you, ma'am.
- No, thank you.

453
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,100
A rare pleasure.

454
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,000
Time for the ceremonial eyefuck.

455
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,700
Come see me down the Cut,
you punk-ass snitch.

456
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,200
I'll shove a shiv down
your cocksucking throat!

457
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,600
You think on it, Bird.

458
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
You think on Brandon
while you doing that time?

459
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,500
I'm gonna see you, man, I swear to God!
Fuck that, I'll do you like a dog.

460
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,700
You really see him shoot the man?

461
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,900
You really asking?

462
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,800
But it's fucked because the man
got to where he needed to be...

463
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,200
and she wasn't even worth it.

464
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,800
Daisy wasn't nothing past any other bitch,
anyway, you know?

465
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,800
And he did all that for her and in the end,
it ain't amount to shit.

466
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,400
Fitzgerald said that
there were no second acts in American lives.

467
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,500
- Do you believe that?
- Man, shit, we locked up.

468
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,300
We best not believe that, right?

469
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,700
He's saying that the past is always with us.

470
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,500
And where we come from,
what we go through...

471
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,900
how we go through it, all that shit matters.

472
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,600
- I mean, that's what I thought he meant.
- Go ahead.

473
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,100
Like at the end of the book, you know?
Boats and tides and all.

474
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,700
It's like you can change up, right?

475
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,400
You can say you're somebody new,
you can give yourself a whole new story...

476
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,900
but what came first is who you really are...

477
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,300
and what happened before
is what really happened.

478
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,900
And it don't matter
that some fool say he different...

479
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,300
'cause the only thing
that can make you different...

480
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,700
is what you really do
or what you really go through.

481
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,200
Like, you know,
like all them books in his library.

482
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,000
Now, he fronting with all them books...

483
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,900
but if we pull one down off the shelf,
ain't none of the pages ever been opened.

484
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,800
He got all them books,
and he ain't read near one of them.

485
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,000
Gatsby, he was who he was,
and he did what he did...

486
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,600
and 'cause he wasn't ready
to get real with the story...

487
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,100
that shit caught up to him.

488
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,200
I think, anyway.

489
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,900
Sorry, homey.

490
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,200
You done with your trial?

491
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,400
- All right then, let's take her on out.
- Tomorrow.

492
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,100
- I'm back with you tomorrow, Diggsy.
- You got something else to do today?

493
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,100
Yeah, last bit of business.

494
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,400
- This is your business.
- This is retirement.

495
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,200
And after today, I'm retired.

496
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,900
Talk when I say, not before.

497
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,400
- Tovarich.
- Serge, my nigger.

498
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
- You're losing weight.
- Shit.

499
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,200
You are down to nothing.

500
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,300
In this country, supermarkets are cathedrals.

501
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,500
- I worry for you, buddy.
- How your peoples, dog?

502
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,500
Same, good.

503
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,000
You talk to the man
about that other thing, right?

504
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,600
Because I can get behind
that business in a big way.

505
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,500
- We will talk later. Now, another business.
- Right.

506
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,900
This the man with the raggedy-ass Camaro?

507
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,900
Wasn't mine, it was my cousin's.
It wasn't all that raggedy.

508
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,600
Sorry. Nicky is with us. His cousin...

509
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,000
But family cannot be helped.

510
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,400
Who you telling?

511
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,800
I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws
fucking all my shit up all the time.

512
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,200
And it ain't like I can pop a cap in their ass
and not hear about it Thanksgiving time.

513
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,000
For real, I'm living life
with some burdensome niggers.

514
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,800
So what the fuck?

515
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,600
You ain't pay my boy Cheese,
and Cheese ain't paying me, right?

516
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,200
I ain't talking
about all the money in the world.

517
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,400
But it ain't like Cheese be in a position
out on that corner...

518
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,400
to let your cuz exemplify shit, you feel?

519
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,600
The man cut you some slack...

520
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,100
and soon every fucking-up white boy
be on his titty.

521
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,100
We wanna pay what we owe.
The $2,700 anyway.

522
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,400
- We're gonna have it soon enough.
- Your man doubled it, though.

523
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,100
He also burned the car.

524
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,800
Now the blue book
on that Camaro was $5,100.

525
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,300
Now, let me understand.

526
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,700
You gonna come up in here,
having fucked up a package...

527
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,900
asking me to tell Cheese,
who you fucked it up on...

528
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,200
to pay you out $2,400.

529
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,500
He gets to keep the Camaro.

530
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Just how good a friend
is this motherfucker to y'all?

531
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,100
The Cheese ain't gonna be happy
having to pay me back...

532
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,700
so I would advise y'all
to give him some distance.

533
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,500
Just so he don't come back on my cousin.

534
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,800
Anyway, thanks for being straight on this.

535
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,200
Fool, if it wasn't for Serge here...

536
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,800
you and your cuz both would
be cadaverous motherfuckers.

537
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,700
I went through INS, customs,
even the State Department. Nothing.

538
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,800
It's time, Jimmy.
You did what you could, right?

539
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,800
Yeah, fuck it, let her go.

540
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,700
This one to the anatomy board
in the morning.

541
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,400
Jane Doe on the paperwork.

542
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,400
- Ain't right, Doc.
- What the fuck ever is?

543
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,300
You leave it to Avon...

544
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,900
he's gonna get some years
off your sentence.

545
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,700
No doubt, knowing Avon.

546
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,700
It's all good, D.

547
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,900
Just show up,
and say what Levy tells you to.

548
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,700
What the hell is wrong with you?

549
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,500
I'm asking you.

550
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,200
Those hot shots, that was Avon.

551
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,000
I want you home, D.

552
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,400
You asked me to carry this. I'm carrying it.

553
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,900
- This is mine, right here, right now.
- Boy, you ain't listening to me.

554
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,600
- I am telling you --
- Ma.

555
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,100
You remember we used
to lived on Linden Avenue?

556
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,700
Remember that house?

557
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,100
I was about 6 or 7 years old.

558
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,500
I was playing on the porch.

559
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,600
Them twins came by,
started picking on me, messing with me.

560
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,500
Remember that?

561
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm banging on the door,
trying to get inside...

562
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,700
and you standing right there
to open the door...

563
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,100
except you ain't letting me inside.

564
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,900
You told me to go back out there
and fight them...

565
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,500
whether I lose or not.

566
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,700
Remember?

567
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,300
- They beat the shit out of you.
- Yeah.

568
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,200
Then you say to me:

569
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,100
"Boy, I might have brung you
into this world...

570
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,500
"but you the one
who gonna have to live in it."

571
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,000
Ma, I'm still here.

572
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,400
Me. You gotta let me live like I need to live.

573
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,700
You tell Avon, Stringer, and Donette...

574
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,600
all of them, to leave me be.

575
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,300
All right, look, fuck y'all. I need a drink.

576
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,500
- Come on, we're almost through 2002.
- No.

577
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,200
- Tomorrow is another goddamn day, right?
- Yeah.

578
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,600
They look thirsty, a round on me.

579
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,300
Yo, Mr. Sobotka,
friend to the working man...

580
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,900
master of the game.

581
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,000
How many votes we get down
in Annapolis tonight, Frankie?

582
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,900
- Been here long?
- Since my hair was brown.

583
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,500
I was telling Chess about Benny.

584
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,700
- Benny with the harelip?
- That's a good one.

585
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,800
See, Benny was working the hole
and he got hit with a shackle.

586
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,700
Chunk of steel clocked him good,
but he didn't tell nobody.

587
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
Not until he came in here.

588
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,300
That's when Little Nose told Benny
to call the union lawyer.

589
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,700
- Paul Sevel?
- Yeah.

590
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,200
God rest his soul.

591
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,600
So Benny calls Paul.

592
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600
"Me been hit with a 'ackerel, " Benny says.

593
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,200
"A mackerel?

594
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,200
"You working frozen foods again?"
Paul says.

595
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,800
"No, 'oddamn it, a 'ackerel."

596
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,600
Then he slams the phone down.

597
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,600
"'Other'ucker on 'is way over 'ere.

598
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,800
"Says he can't undertan' me."

599
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,800
Little Nose says, "Why he wanna do that?

600
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,700
"Benny don't talk
no fucking better in person."

601
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,000
So that's it? Me and Cheese are straight?

602
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,600
Yeah, you're straight.

603
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,700
That there's $2,400 for Princess.

604
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,000
She was worth more than that.

605
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,300
Dolo. One for the bar, hon.

606
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,700
You win the lotto?

607
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,100
If my old man can do it,
who the hell says I can't?

608
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,500
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Nick, when I'm flush, I'm flush.

609
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,800
- We ain't gonna live forever, right?
- Next round's on me.

610
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,500
- Not for me, I'm gonna head out.
- Come on, Frank, belly up.

611
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,500
Take a rain check.

612
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,300
- And that one as well, huh?
- Makes 22.

613
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,000
All on the Talco line.
All with Horseface Pakusa working the ship.

614
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,800
- We're on it then.
- You gonna call Bunk?

615
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,100
Detective Moreland is indisposed.

616
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,600
- You with Daniels and them?
- No.

617
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,100
We just parked the computer down there.
We're orphaned, man.

618
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,200
- Orphaned?
- Yeah.

619
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,100
Rawls is talking like...

620
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,400
if I don't come home with 14 clearances...

621
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,200
I can't come home at all. Lester, too.

622
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,600
Where's the love, Jimmy?

623
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,100
Where is the motherfucking love?

624
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,500
- So what's up with you, man?
- Nothing.

625
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,300
Nothing, huh?

626
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,600
I'm done, Bunk.
Bird is my last piece of old business.

627
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,100
I got nothing new.

628
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,100
I was trying for an ID on this one...

629
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,500
and I can't even tell you why.

630
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,100
Just a way to pretend
I was still a murder police, I guess.

631
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
Who gives a fuck, right?

632
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,500
Elena and I are gonna try again.

633
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Shit.

634
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,100
I'm done fucking myself up, Bunk.
I am done.

635
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,800
Come on, man, let's go home.

636
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,300
All right, man.

637
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,200
Over here, shitbird.

638
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,300
What the hell happened to you?

639
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,100
- I fell down.
- How many times?

640
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,600
Let's walk.

641
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,500
- Pop, I'm --
- Walk with me, Zig.

642
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,900
Votes break for us,
that pier comes back online by next spring.

643
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,900
- More ships, more work.
- Yeah, great.

644
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,900
- What the fuck are you about?
- What?

645
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,900
Is that my son lighting
hundred dollar bills like an asshole...

646
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,900
in a bar full of working stiffs?

647
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,200
- What the fuck is that?
- Just a smile.

648
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,200
- A smile?
- Yep, a smile.

649
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,100
You wanna hit me again, Pop,
go ahead, take a shot.

650
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,000
Where you come by that kind of cash?
You know you ain't had the days.

651
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,600
Definitely not.

652
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,000
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.

653
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Seniority prevails, Zig.

654
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,800
- It's the only way to keep it halfway honest.
- I know, I ain't complaining.

655
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I wish I could give you more.
You don't think I want to throw you more?

656
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,900
- You throw plenty.
- It's just, Christ, Zig.

657
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,000
If I'd listened to your mother,
she's the one always talking about --

658
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,100
It's cool.

659
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,400
You should do community college
like your brother.

660
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,400
Pop, don't.

661
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,300
You wanna know what I remember?

662
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,500
Do you?

663
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,200
I remember you, and Uncle Jerry...

664
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,400
and Uncle Walt Pe-Pop...

665
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,600
all sitting around the kitchen table,
talking shit about this gang and that gang...

666
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,900
who's better with the break-bulk...

667
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,500
who could turn it around faster, who's lazy.

668
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,300
- Always a fucking argument, right?
- Four Polacks, six opinions.

669
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,200
I remember when youse all
went down to picket them scabs...

670
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,000
at Covington Piers...

671
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,300
how Jackie Taylor got run over
by a police car...

672
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,200
in the middle of that whole goddamn mess.

673
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,700
I remember when the Paceco
fell during that windstorm.

674
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,800
You remember, right? Killed Fat Rick dead.

675
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,600
Yeah, what else you remember?

676
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,500
Everything.

677
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,100
So tell me, Mr. "Back In The Day"...

678
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,900
what are we doing down here
with the wharf rats...

679
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,400
in the middle of the goddamn night?

680
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,000
Beats the fuck outta me.

681
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,000
Every one of those Post-its
is a can that disappears...

682
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,300
when it's being offloaded.

683
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,700
The yellow slips, they show up again...

684
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,100
with legitimate cargo intact
and are re-entered...

685
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,100
so you figure those are honest mistakes.

686
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,000
But the pink and the green,
those cans never come back.

687
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,800
They stay out of the computer for good.

688
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,200
And the pink one,
like the can full of dead girls...

689
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,500
they're all from
the same shipping line, Talco...

690
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,400
and on all of them, the same checker,
this guy Thomas Pakusa...

691
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,500
he goes by Horseface, he's the one working.

692
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,900
You went at him already, right?

693
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,300
We grand juried his ass,
but that motherfucker didn't blink.

694
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,000
You wanna hit the head?
Get yourself right, Detective?

695
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,400
No, I'm good.

696
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,800
The point is, we have a pattern here.

697
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,200
What they're doing eliminates
almost all of the paper trail.

698
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,000
As long as they can get
a truck past the outbound lanes...

699
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,500
and there's a dozen ways to do that,
the only thing they leave behind...

700
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,400
is a little telltale in the computer.

701
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,000
A box comes off the ship,
flashes for a few moments and blip...

702
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,600
then it's gone.

703
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,800
Our target
is supposed to be Sobotka, right?

704
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,600
I mean, on paper anyway.

705
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,600
What you're telling me is
that it's better than a fair bet...

706
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,300
that he actually is
a target in Bunk's murders.

707
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,600
Maybe we can fold our investigation
into yours, Lieutenant.

708
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,200
And put my ass in the air with
14 open homicides that might never clear?

709
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,000
- The bosses wouldn't blame you for that.
- I wouldn't shine either.

710
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,400
I'm using what we do with this detail
to get a major case squad going.

711
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,900
I come up out of here with all those
open files, it doesn't smell as sweet.

712
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,600
- So what's the next move on this?
- We clone the computer...

713
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,500
and start watching
what's happening on the docks in real time.

714
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,700
Shit.

715
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,600
Yo, D.

716
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,300
Just wine, huh?

717
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,500
I'm not drinking much anymore.

718
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,500
No Jameson's?

719
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,500
Maybe a quick fuck with the waitress, then.

720
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,900
Okay, I deserve that one, too...

721
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,200
even though I'm not doing
much of that anymore either.

722
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,700
- Anything else?
- I'm sorry.

723
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,000
I don't know where it still comes from.
It's been a year.

724
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,300
- You deserve to be angry.
- What's the point, though?

725
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,800
How's work?

726
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,900
What, so we talk about
everything in my life...

727
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,500
that pisses you off?

728
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,500
- Drinking, women, the work?
- Just trying to make conversation.

729
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,600
- I retired.
- Excuse me?

730
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,600
It's boats, not bodies.

731
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,900
On a good day,
I catch crabs and count seagulls.

732
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,100
- That's not you.
- It wasn't me.

733
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,600
It wasn't me not to drink,
or dog around either.

734
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,300
A lot of things weren't me.

735
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,300
I want another chance.

736
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,300
How about a fuck for the road instead?

737
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,600
- How you doing?
- Okay.

738
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,200
You unload this,
you gotta ditch trucks and trailers both.

739
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,300
Make it look like it was a hijack, all right?

740
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,100
Niko.

741
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,600
If you want, I will pay you straight...

742
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,800
or Eton can pay in heroin.

743
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,700
Wholesale.

744
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,300
Turn it around,
you can make $60,000 or $70,000.

745
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,000
Nicky, he's offering, like,
three, four times the value.

746
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,100
I'm out on this.

747
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,300
Nick, even if we walk it up to White Mike...

748
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,500
we can make $30,000 or $35,000.

749
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,500
Nicky, come on, man.

750
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,500
Half in cash, half in dope.

751
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,000
Nicky, I can turn that package around,
no problem.

752
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
- No, Zig, I got it.
- Nicky, you don't know --

753
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,000
You hear me? I said I fucking got this one.

754
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,100
Stay at home and watch cartoons.

755
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,100
Let me handle this shit
for the both of us, all right?

756
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,600
You fucking walking home or what?

757
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,200
Hey, girl.

758
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,500
- What do we do with the day?
- Me?

759
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,300
- I gotta pick up the boys from the sitter.
- Okay, great.

760
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,400
They're gonna be coming back here.
Michael has piano this afternoon.

761
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,700
No problem, we'll do something after that.

762
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,700
Maybe we go by my place,
pick up some things.

763
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,200
I don't want the boys to know
that you were here.

764
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,500
It's gonna get them hoping.

765
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,200
So you need to leave.

766
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,900
Look at this sorry shit.

767
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,000
Motherfuckers not appreciate
nothing that comes to them free.

768
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,900
I'll take it in the back.
Maybe they got some duct tape to fix it.

769
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,700
- D, right?
- Yeah.

770
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,100
You can't be in here now, man.

771
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,800
Yo, man, y'all get any final calls
this week, yo?

772
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,800
- Yeah, we got some.
- I didn't see any out there.

773
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,000
All right, give me a minute.

774
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,500
Let me finish up right here real quick,
and I'll go and get one for you.

775
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,900
- Hey, y'all.
- What's up?

776
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,900
I know you got my motherfucking cigs, yo.

777
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,000
- You trying to curb me, yo?
- Come on.

778
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,700
What's in there?
