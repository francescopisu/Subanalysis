1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
WAYE news time, 8:05.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,700
It's gonna be partly cloudy, breezy
and warm today with highs around 80.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,900
Right now in Baltimore, sunny skies.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,700
And here's one of my morning favorites.

5
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,300
Yo, Ott. Santo Rey's late?

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,200
Squall last night off of Hampton Roads.

7
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
76-72 KGA.

8
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,100
KGA, go ahead, 76-72.

9
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,500
Notify Homicide and the OCME.
We got a floater at Patapsco Terminal.

10
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,100
Copy that.

11
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Nothing at Vondopoulos's house?

12
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,600
He's not going back.

13
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,300
He's dumped his Benz and our GPS device
in the downtown garage.

14
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,100
He's off the cellphones.

15
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,300
And there's no text messaging
in Greek either.

16
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,300
The raids, the follow,
one or both sent him underground.

17
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,800
This guy, Stephen Rados? What's he?

18
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,600
He rented the hotel room
for the meet with Vondopoulos.

19
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,200
But checked out right after.

20
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,400
Fitzhugh's running him
through every database.

21
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,000
So far, nothing but a driver's license in D.C.

22
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,500
Lester. Homicide for you, line 2.

23
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,500
Maybe Sobotka knows him.

24
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,700
When Sobotka comes in today, maybe
he gives us a line on every last Greek.

25
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,200
Freamon here.

26
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,400
Thirteen or so coming across the fax
from VICAP.

27
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,800
All of them John Does.

28
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,000
And that's just headless and handless
in the mid-Atlantic region.

29
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,700
If you wanna go nationwide,
you'll be up over four dozen.

30
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,200
- Fuck me.
- What can I tell you, kiddo?

31
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,200
We are policing a culture in moral decline.
So, you want to come get these?

32
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,700
Or should I have a uniform
run them over to Southeast?

33
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,200
- Run them over to Southeast.
- Okay.

34
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,100
- Have a seat.
- I can't.

35
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,300
Gotta get back out there,
take care of business.

36
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
Just wanted to make sure
they were treating you right.

37
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,700
Making the most of it.
I'm catching up on my reading at least.

38
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,400
I just want to let you know
that we got your back.

39
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,000
You know, whoever did this, we'll find them.

40
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,100
We got you, you understand?

41
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,100
I appreciate the offer,
but that won't be necessary.

42
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,700
Inform Mr. Barksdale that any obligation...

43
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,400
he feels he might have
with regards to this incident...

44
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,700
it's absolved, along with our agreement.

45
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,800
All I'm saying is --

46
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
I understand perfectly well
what you're saying.

47
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,700
What I am saying to you is:
I will take care of them myself.

48
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,800
Them?

49
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,400
Who came at you?

50
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Thank you for your concern.

51
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,400
Easy, Nick. Easy.

52
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,600
I'm gonna kill them.
Fucking Greek bastards.

53
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,800
Get out of my fucking way!

54
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,000
Get off of me! Fuck all of you!

55
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,600
He was there for all of you,
and now you're nowhere for him.

56
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,800
What the fuck you gonna do?

57
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,900
Get a gun? Go play gangster?

58
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,800
Like your fucking cousin?

59
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,400
Let's go.

60
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,700
What was she firing, yo?

61
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Dirty Bomb, with a red-top chaser.

62
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,100
Damn, yo. The bomb is the bomb.

63
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,000
Opportunity knocking. Keep a lookout.

64
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,300
He just boosted the whole fucking truck.

65
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,200
Good looking out, Johnny.

66
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,100
At least I remembered to call.

67
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Stabbed repeatedly.

68
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,300
Torso, abdomen,
and they cut his throat to be sure.

69
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,200
Single-edge blade. He fought, too.

70
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,600
Defense wounds on both hands.

71
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,500
Ligature on both legs.

72
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,300
Weighed him down with something,
but it slipped off in the drink.

73
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
One, two, three.

74
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,900
Fuck it.
This Sobotka kid knows there's a warrant.

75
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,900
He either turns himself in or not.
Who gives a fuck?

76
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,900
Either we get to him now and roll him,
or he comes into the district with a lawyer.

77
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
He comes in with a lawyer, he's less likely
to go for something in the box.

78
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,800
You sound like McNulty now.

79
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,400
We stay with these guys on their cases,
we ain't never gonna get no respect.

80
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
You know this.

81
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,100
I figure when the detail's over,
I go back to straight narcotics.

82
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,400
Try to get over to Dawson's shift,
find a new rabbi.

83
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,600
What about you?

84
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,200
Don't know.

85
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,900
I mean, you gotta admit,
Daniels has been okay for us.

86
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,400
I mean, he's there for his troops.

87
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,100
- You gotta be shitting me.
- I just came from the crime scene.

88
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,700
He was coming in as a cooperator.

89
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,000
Offering up the drug-and-prostitution ring
he'd been smuggling for.

90
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,600
The guy lays down with gangsters,
gets up with his throat cut.

91
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,100
Almost feel sorry for the son of a bitch.

92
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,600
You were right about Sobotka.

93
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,000
Case had enough legs on it
that I've got Burrell committed...

94
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,300
to keeping my crew together
as a major case squad working out of CID.

95
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,600
If you are gonna charge him...

96
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
I'm gonna charge his narrow ass.

97
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,600
You're gonna do your son-in-law?

98
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,100
You don't think I didn't tell her
not to marry that brain-dead son of a bitch?

99
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,200
I'll tell you the truth, Major.
Everyone who saw the punch wrote on it.

100
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,000
And they've all got Prez
throwing the punch, no question.

101
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,400
But they've also got you addressing
a subordinate officer as a...

102
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,700
What was it? A shitbird?

103
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
Fuck you.

104
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,100
This is the Baltimore Police Department,
not the Roland Park Ladies' Tea.

105
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,900
I'm just saying, the other detectives...

106
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,700
the FBI agents,
they gotta write it the way it happened.

107
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,900
I mean, I could probably get my own people
to cheat it for you, but the FBI...

108
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,400
You know how tight-assed they are.

109
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,600
Roland Pryzbylewski rides
the Southeastern desk...

110
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,900
on midnight shift for two months.

111
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,000
During which time he writes
a personal letter of apology...

112
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,500
to everyone seen that punch throwed.

113
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,500
In which he makes it absolutely clear
that it was a penny-cheap sucker punch...

114
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,500
that would've got his ass kicked in
by a real police...

115
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,400
except for the fact that I have
my daughter's feelings to consider.

116
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,700
And then he can come up here
and say the same to my face...

117
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,800
and after that, if he wants
to piss his career away in your unit...

118
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,100
I could give a hairy-ass fuck.

119
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,100
Lieutenant.

120
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,500
Rod, that shit goes into a supplemental.

121
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,500
- You don't put witnesses on a face sheet.
- Officer.

122
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,200
You got something for Freamon?
Homicide sent it over.

123
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,800
Officer, my son wants
to turn himself in on a warrant.

124
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,800
Everybody talks, nobody listens.

125
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,500
Mike, that asshole calls back,
I'm in the shitter.

126
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,100
- Now what can I do for you, gents?
- You got a warrant on me for drugs.

127
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,500
- I'm turning myself in.
- A Southeastern warrant?

128
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,800
He's surrendering.
He's gonna cooperate in any way he can.

129
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,400
- What name am I looking for?
- Sobotka. Nicholas Sobotka.

130
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,300
Morphine? From a city ambo?

131
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,000
You should be ashamed
to be calling me on this one.

132
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,400
- The body came up.
- I saw, on the television.

133
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,700
We weighted him down
pretty goddamn good...

134
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,300
but the water just coughed him back up.

135
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
Bad luck, that's all.

136
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,500
Sergei would've done better, I admit.

137
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,600
Niko, the nephew. By now he knows.

138
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Our people wait for him,
but so do the police.

139
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,400
I am thinking...

140
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,300
there's nothing to be done at this point.

141
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
What he says, he says.

142
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,100
He knows my name.
But my name is not my name.

143
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,300
And you?

144
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
To them, you're only "The Greek."

145
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,000
And, of course, I'm not even Greek.

146
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,200
So we go.

147
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,100
But there's a little business to do first.

148
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,900
There's a shipment on the docks this week.

149
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,700
- One hundred and fifty kilograms.
- And no one to pick it up.

150
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,600
Not just Sergei, I miss Frank, too.

151
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,800
We can't disappear the can.
But maybe we send someone.

152
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,400
Bring it off the docks, legitimate.

153
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,200
Everywhere we go these days,
we seem to be walking into police.

154
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,300
This is telling us something.

155
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,100
You're going to leave 15 million tholaria
to rot on the pier?

156
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,300
Lambs go to slaughter.
A man, he learns when to walk away.

157
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,700
No, we go.

158
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,500
Call the others in.

159
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,400
Let them know there is no longer any point.

160
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,600
We don't wait?

161
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,400
Our friends are still there, no?

162
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,600
- Still here.
- Then go.

163
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Sobotka was a cooperator?

164
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,000
We had preliminary discussions
with him yesterday.

165
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,800
He agreed to post today
with a lawyer, but instead...

166
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,600
So what's left of the case?

167
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,400
We've pulled in everyone caught up
in the wiretaps, save for a couple bodies.

168
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,400
We left the man we think is the number two
for the operation...

169
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,700
on the street,
hoping he'd lead us to number one.

170
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,700
We have people on him?

171
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,300
He's out of pocket at the moment.

172
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Last seen leaving a downtown hotel,
but we expect he'll resurface.

173
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,200
And the union people?

174
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,900
With Sobotka dead, the case right now
is limited to a subordinate or two.

175
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,600
But the important thing for us is the union.

176
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,900
Either they jettison
their current leadership...

177
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,400
or we have enough
to get that local decertified.

178
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,400
Leaving only me and my 14 bodies.

179
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,300
When do we get to that bit of business?

180
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,600
Lt. Daniels? Line 2. Det. Freamon
insisted I put him through.

181
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,400
In all likelihood, Frank Sobotka
was going to speak to that.

182
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,100
Now, we're a step back, sorry to say.

183
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,100
- Sobotka came in.
- The nephew?

184
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,800
Yeah, he flipped.

185
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,000
Come on, Bubs. You gotta do better
if you wanna walk on this.

186
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
- How about some murders?
- How about them?

187
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,000
They're not killing people
in West Baltimore these days?

188
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,200
Been quiet.

189
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,800
Except for that mess
with that young boy who got hit...

190
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,400
with the stray through the window,
ain't been nothing.

191
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,000
- How about that?
- I ain't got nothing on that one.

192
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,100
It's just two crews beefing over a corner.

193
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,800
You know what, Bubs? You going to jail.

194
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
How you gonna talk about going to jail?

195
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,800
You hearing this, Johnny?

196
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,300
Like we ain't got history in this room.
Like we ain't friends or nothing.

197
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
When you was up in that hospital,
all I did was worry.

198
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
"What about Kima? What's up with my girl?"

199
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm just happy to see you're up in the mix...

200
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,000
and you talking about jail and shit.

201
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,200
That's too cold, girl, damn.

202
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,500
Remember that Eastsider
got shot in the high-rises, right?

203
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,000
You remember that shit, right?

204
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,600
I mean, you were right there, Bubbles.

205
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,800
That wasn't shit.
Boy got hit with a rat shot, that all.

206
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,300
- Who you talking about?
- Boy named Cheese.

207
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,700
Him and the other Eastsiders
moved into the Terrace...

208
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,500
took over a couple towers
from the Stringer Bell's boys.

209
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,500
Then some crazy-ass bow-tie nigger
came in and chased his ass home.

210
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,000
And what happened?

211
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,400
Mr. Bow Tie, he ran them off.

212
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,100
He told them Eastsider fools,
"Them towers belong to Avon."

213
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
But then he ain't come back no more.

214
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,600
Now them Eastsiders
are back up in there steady slinging.

215
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
I mean, it ain't like a war or nothing.

216
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
It's like Stringer Bell and them are sharing.

217
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,600
Sharing?

218
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,100
You guys are on all of it?

219
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,300
You have a public defender
sitting next to you, Mr. Sobotka.

220
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,000
If there's anything about this deal
you don't understand --

221
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,900
They killed my uncle.

222
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,400
I don't need to talk to no one
but you people.

223
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,600
How do you know they did it?

224
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,700
I told...

225
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,400
Spiros calls me
after everybody's getting arrested, right?

226
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Tells me he wants us
to keep our mouths shut...

227
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,700
but Uncle Frank, he says he ain't gonna.

228
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,600
Says he's gonna go talk to the police.

229
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,400
Spiros says that if we keep quiet...

230
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,500
they can help my cousin, Zig, you know?

231
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,200
And now Spiros is saying that...

232
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,300
I don't know, the kid,
the one that didn't die...

233
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,300
the one that got shot...

234
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,200
he's gonna say that the gun, it wasn't Zig's.

235
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,800
That Glekas pulled the gun,
and it wasn't really Zig's fault.

236
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,500
So your uncle went to meet them
and talk about that?

237
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,400
Under the Key Bridge.

238
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I seen his car was still there this morning.

239
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,300
I seen that, I fucking knew.

240
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,900
If they killed your uncle to shut him up,
they probably --

241
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,700
Wanna kill me, too?

242
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,500
Shit!

243
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,900
I was gonna go down with him
to the bridge.

244
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,300
I was gonna go down there with him.

245
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,600
He wouldn't...

246
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,200
You were involved in the smuggling?

247
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,600
We didn't know about the girls.

248
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,700
Them girls that got found?

249
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,000
- We didn't know there were girls in there.
- You thought it was drugs?

250
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,500
Drugs, stolen shit, whatever.

251
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,000
We got paid by the can
to creep shit off the docks. That's all.

252
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,200
That and selling the drugs
that you got from The Greek, too, right?

253
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,900
That's your cousin's signed statement.

254
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
He put himself in,
talked about buying the gun.

255
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,700
The bill of sale
from the pawn shop is in there, too.

256
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,900
It wouldn't have mattered if the
second victim had backed up on his story.

257
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Your cousin was locked in.

258
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,200
Your uncle was sitting yesterday
right where you're sitting now...

259
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,300
ready to give us everything, if we made
the drug charges go away for you.

260
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,300
And maybe got your cousin
to a better lock-up than Eager Street.

261
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,600
As you can see,
we're willing to honor that deal...

262
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,400
even if it didn't happen for your uncle.

263
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Spiros was the main guy.

264
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,500
He told me and Frank
which cans to disappear...

265
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,600
and then when it came to me and the drugs,
he was the one that hooked that up, too.

266
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,700
The Israeli, he was their drug guy.
I went through him for all my re-ups...

267
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,700
until they passed me off
to White Mike McArdle. You know Mike?

268
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Guess you do.

269
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,500
Double G was in charge of stolen shit.

270
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,700
Anything we could lift from the docks
went straight to his store...

271
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,900
but he's dead,
so why am I wasting your time, right?

272
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,100
Her, I don't know.

273
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,400
My uncle, you know about him.

274
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,700
I don't know
why you got Horse's picture up there.

275
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,700
Horse don't know shit. I'll testify to that.

276
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,600
What about the Russian?

277
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,300
He drove for them.

278
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,000
Anything that had to come off the docks,
he was their guy.

279
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,800
But I also got the feeling
that if somebody had to get hurt...

280
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,800
he was probably going to be around
for that part of it, too.

281
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,600
Why did you think that?

282
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,300
Sergei, he just carried it like that.

283
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And also, after them girls died in the can...

284
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,000
they told me that whoever fucked that up...

285
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,800
they had already got to in Philly.

286
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,300
They said that
whoever did that to them girls was dead.

287
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,500
And how did they say it?

288
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,700
They just said, I don't know...

289
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,600
that the guy that you all was looking for...

290
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,400
he was a dead end.

291
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,700
- A dead end?
- Yeah.

292
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,600
In Philly, they said.

293
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,100
Who's the suit?

294
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,300
You sure?

295
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,900
We know that someone
is above your man Spiros.

296
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,600
Someone he was in communication with.

297
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,600
Yeah, The Greek.

298
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,700
Sure, I know who you mean.
I mean, I don't have a name or nothing.

299
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,500
The man in the suit...

300
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,700
the man with Vondopoulos
in the photograph.

301
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,600
That's not The Greek?

302
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,700
That's The Greek right there.

303
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,300
That the guy?

304
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,000
He picked out an Eastsider, all right.

305
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,400
Cheese runs with Proposition Joe's mob.

306
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,200
Had a few corners off of Ashland,
last I heard.

307
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,000
- What's the verdict?
- He did good for us.

308
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,000
- So I'm out the stat?
- I owe you one, Sanny.

309
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,000
- Both of them?
- Yeah, that one's his valet.

310
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,200
Can I use your bathroom?

311
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Fuck, no. Get out of here.

312
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,300
Bubs, one last question.
How's product in the Towers?

313
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
It was shit, now it's right.

314
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,900
Found this guy.
Federal court computer down in D.C.

315
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,200
But not in a bad way.

316
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,000
He's a K Street lawyer down there.

317
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,200
So the suit was only a suit?

318
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,200
On the other hand, my friend,
this is from overseas.

319
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,000
A can on the Adriatica, which docks
the day after tomorrow at Patapsco.

320
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,300
Fake manifest out of Le Havre.

321
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,100
You people got reach.

322
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,300
That's about $300,000 in man-hours
we're holding here.

323
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,900
What's the plan for him?

324
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,200
You gotta call the US Attorney
about witness protection.

325
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,700
We're rounding up his girl and kid.

326
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,300
It's best we keep this as quiet as we can.
We already lost one cooperator.

327
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,100
It's for you.

328
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Daniels.

329
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,100
Lieutenant, Fitzhugh's calling for WITSEC,
and we're pulling in the girlfriend and kid.

330
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,000
Okay, thanks.

331
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
FBI.

332
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,200
This is Special Agent Terrence Fitzhugh,
Baltimore field office.

333
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,700
- May I speak with Agent Koutris, please?
- Who?

334
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,300
Agent Koutris.

335
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,400
He's no longer
with the San Diego field office.

336
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,900
Where's he at?

337
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,700
You could try headquarters in Washington.
Counterterrorism.

338
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,900
Counterterrorism? For how long?

339
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,500
I'd have to check, but I'm sure
he's been gone from here more than a year.

340
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,000
Either he comes home
in the next five minutes, or I eat my gun.

341
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,300
I'm just saying, this is not the way...

342
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,700
me and you learned how to do it
in West Baltimore.

343
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Not by a fucking long shot!

344
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Either your son surrenders within the hour...

345
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,500
or all the police will come
crashing through this door twice a day...

346
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,700
for as long as it takes you people
to get the message. You hear me?

347
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,800
We will take this door once in the morning
and once at night, and toss your house...

348
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,100
until there isn't any furniture
with more than three legs left on it.

349
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,300
Officer, my son turned himself in
to the police last night.

350
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,500
At Southeastern.
A detective was there at the time.

351
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,600
- A detective?
- Motherfucker. Come on.

352
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,200
Don't use the phone.

353
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,500
There'll be an agent posted outside.
If you go anywhere, go with him.

354
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,100
What a dump.

355
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,100
You wanted us to get a place, right?

356
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,500
If they got to him in Philly...

357
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,200
then they probably dumped
the body in that area, right?

358
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,200
No use in dragging a headless torso around
further than you need.

359
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,500
Good God.

360
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,400
I bet you there's a police detective
somewhere else...

361
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,800
looking at a table full of heads right now.

362
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,900
In that stuff that we took off the ship,
did we keep any photos?

363
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,700
Couple of pictures of one guy
that left his gear, yeah.

364
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,300
They're at ECU.

365
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,400
You two should get on the road.
Get up there before the offices close.

366
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,100
Where y'all been at?

367
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,300
I'm saying, though, Butchie,
something just ain't feel right.

368
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,700
The man didn't even know
what I was saying.

369
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,500
So I just eased off.

370
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,300
- You think brother played me?
- No.

371
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,700
Y'all can't read lying eyes
after all these years...

372
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,300
then I'd be talking to a dead man.

373
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You saying Stringer told you...

374
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,600
the brother had something to do
with your boy Brandon?

375
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
Yeah.

376
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,400
Near as I know, Brother Mouzone
spends most of his time up north.

377
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,300
New York and Philly.

378
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,900
If Avon contracted him to get at you...

379
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,200
the brother wouldn't have stop coming
until you two were bumped.

380
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,000
It's my fault.

381
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,900
I should've said no to Prop Joe
from the get-go.

382
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,300
Avon's father was plain evil,
and the son ain't no better.

383
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Neither is Stringer,
now that we making a list.

384
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,800
I'm going hard after Stringer.

385
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,100
No point in trying
to talk you back down, I suppose.

386
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,500
You been my bank for how long
and gonna ask me something like that?

387
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,500
How you gonna get at him?

388
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
I don't even know, Butch.

389
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,200
Take some time and think on it.

390
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,200
One thing for sure, though,
the man got to be got, you feel me?

391
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,900
What you see, Butch?

392
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,700
Too much, boy.

393
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,900
Too damn much.

394
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,000
A lot happened overnight.

395
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,400
Not to us.

396
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,900
- Look, this isn't personal --
- Fucking-A, right.

397
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
We're not even people in this unit.
We're your goddamn pack mules.

398
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,300
"Sit on this house,
transport this mope, wait for that one."

399
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
That's part of the job.

400
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,200
The job had a little more rip-and-run to it,
the way I remember it.

401
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,700
These cases are more than that.

402
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,700
We're putting people in jail
with phone taps and typewriters.

403
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,300
So you're saying we ain't up to it.

404
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,800
I saw on the postings that Major Colvin
needs a sergeant in the Western.

405
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,300
Flex squad.
And the last time I checked, I had stripes.

406
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,900
Eastside, Westside.

407
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,500
Cats and dogs, sleeping together.

408
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Shit. I'm late for something.

409
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,800
You say you want everybody
that came on the port that day?

410
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,600
No, we're looking for anything
out of the ordinary. Probably at night.

411
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,300
Oh, unusual. You should've said so.

412
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,700
- What you asked for before --
- That's what we...

413
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,100
You're right, sir, absolutely right.
Just see if there's anything like that.

414
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,100
Nope, all I got is usual.

415
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
All right.
Any way you could give us the name...

416
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,900
of the security officer
that was on this pier that night?

417
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
What was that date again?

418
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,000
February 5.

419
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,500
You had the Atlantic Light on that pier
from 6:00 p.m.

420
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,700
That was Walt. Walt Stokes.

421
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,500
Is he working tonight?

422
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,500
It's Tuesday. Walt's off on Tuesdays.

423
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
What do you want Walt for?

424
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,600
See if he can make any of these.

425
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,300
Wouldn't do much good.

426
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,700
Afraid Walt's not as up to speed
as the rest of us.

427
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,700
Seeing as you've come
all this way, though...

428
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,100
you might want to have a look-see
at the videotapes.

429
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,500
$300 for a stroller?

430
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,700
I know, I know.
Cost more than your first car, right?

431
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
A hooptie, no doubt?

432
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,100
We're so gonna need one of these.

433
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,300
Look at this, Kima.

434
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,600
Blue's Clues juice box holder.

435
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,000
If the kid can't hold on to a little old box
without no help, we got problems.

436
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay, listen.

437
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,100
This baby is gonna come out of my belly
and need both of us, forever.

438
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,500
You understand?

439
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,600
I mean, it may not be real for you yet.

440
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,000
But, goddamn it, it's real for me.

441
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,900
Nick.

442
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,600
What's gonna happen, Nicky?

443
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,700
That can on the fifth wheel there.

444
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,200
By the plan, it's a hot box,
but there's no one on a pick-up.

445
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,400
- Where's it from?
- Le Havre, France.

446
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,300
Fuck it, then. Dump her.

447
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,400
Lester, the drug talk coming
from Proposition Joe's people...

448
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,300
before the warehouse phone came down.

449
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,300
Those were for steady re-ups, right?

450
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,900
We weren't up on that wire long,
but, yeah, three weeks in a row.

451
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,800
- How much?
- Five or six La-Z-Boys at a clip, to start.

452
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,700
Last call to Eton's cellphone,
the re-up went to 12.

453
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,800
He doubles his re-up to 12 kilos?

454
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,300
That's her right there.

455
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,000
They ain't doing the dirt, though.

456
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,900
Team leader,
keep an eye on that can till we post.

457
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
Copy.

458
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,000
Sorry to hear about my boy Sergei.

459
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,000
Eton, too.

460
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
You lost some good people.

461
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,000
There'll be some new faces soon.

462
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,600
A week or so. They'll find you.

463
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,500
Just as they'll find the others
that work with us.

464
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,700
A week?

465
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,900
I ain't got enough of your good shit
to last much past that.

466
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,100
You got anything to lay off
before you leave?

467
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
The last shipment is lost.

468
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,500
Lost? How you mean?

469
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,100
The police may be sitting on it.

470
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,700
You ain't sure?

471
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,500
There's more where that came from.

472
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,900
Always, there is more.

473
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,600
All right, then.

474
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,700
I'm gonna let your new people find me.

475
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,100
Have a safe trip.

476
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,000
Where you say you off to again?

477
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,000
There's 12 in this, 15 in that.

478
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,300
And if the rest of them
holds this same pattern...

479
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,100
Maybe 200 kilos of raw left on the pier.

480
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,100
The Greeks are definitely in the wind.

481
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,100
And we are in the dark.

482
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,900
You want us to take it down
to the customs shed, or what?

483
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,900
No, you're gonna seal it up and sit on it.

484
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,500
If we're lucky, someone will come
calling in a day or so.

485
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
You that lucky?

486
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,200
If they didn't get onto us when they did,
this might've been a hell of a case.

487
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,600
It's on you.

488
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,300
Ambushed? In his own goddamn room?

489
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,400
Yeah, he gonna be all right, but he --

490
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,500
I don't give a fuck
about how he gonna be, man.

491
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,200
You put on out-of-town talent
at a high price...

492
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,700
you expect them
to get the motherfucking job done.

493
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,200
He said that thing between us is...

494
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,700
How did he put it? Absolved.

495
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,100
Absolved? What the fuck do that mean?

496
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,000
Mouzone booked out,
we worse off than when he came.

497
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,600
If word gets out on the street
that we weak like this...

498
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,700
how the fuck we supposed
to maintain our shit?

499
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,400
I know, but we gotta hit right back,
make a statement.

500
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,400
But Mouzone not saying who did this.

501
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,600
- You asked him who it was?
- Yeah, I asked him.

502
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,300
- Why?
- Why what?

503
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,400
How you gonna ask a soldier like Mouzone
a question like that?

504
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,000
Either he gonna say,
or he gonna go and work it out.

505
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Either way,
you ain't got to be asking him shit.

506
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,700
Man, every market-based business
runs in cycles...

507
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,000
and we going
through a down-cycle right now.

508
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,200
String, this ain't about
your motherfucking business class either.

509
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,500
It ain't that part of it. It's that other thing.

510
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,800
The street is the street. Always.

511
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,600
Man, we gonna get through
this bullshit anyway.

512
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,500
No doubt.
You just need to hold tight till I get uptown.

513
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,500
And that day gonna come, but until then...

514
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,500
we gotta do what we can do,
when we can do it.

515
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,700
Yeah, you need to go to Prop Joe.

516
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,400
I ain't gonna argue with you.

517
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
You run it as you see fit.

518
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,100
At least until I get home, you do.

519
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,500
No doubt.

520
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,000
Us, man.

521
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Us.

522
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,900
- Tape is fucked up.
- It's multiplexed.

523
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,200
It's a way to save money.

524
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
Instead of one camera, one VCR...

525
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,500
it's 10 cameras playing on one VCR tape.

526
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,500
- Can you make sense of it?
- Not a problem, with this software.

527
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,100
- We just de-plex it.
- De-plex?

528
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,400
Let me show you the highlight reel.

529
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
- Is he flashing a badge?
- Looks like it.

530
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,100
That's something you don't see too often...

531
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,900
John Law in a Mercedes-Benz.

532
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,800
That could be our boy.

533
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,900
Head still on.

534
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,900
Tell me we got cameras inside.

535
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,200
Jesus, my pants are wet.

536
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,500
Yeah. C'mon, baby.

537
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,300
Yeah.

538
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,900
Re-up gonna be about a week or so late.

539
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,600
My people are having to readjust
to some shit.

540
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,700
A week?

541
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,900
No later than that, they say.

542
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,800
How it go with Avon today?

543
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,700
It's all good.

544
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,600
Our old friend.

545
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,000
What's the news?

546
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,200
Port cops are sitting on a can
that came off the Adriatica.

547
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,600
Word around the customs shed,
it's full of dope.

548
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,200
I mean, about Frank.

549
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,000
- What's the district council saying?
- Gentlemen.

550
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,200
Mr. Pakusa, in light
of your pending indictment...

551
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,300
I'd think you'd stay as far away
from this hall as possible.

552
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,200
Ain't y'all got some place to go?

553
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,900
Just came to make it clear...

554
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,900
that if there's no cleaning up in here...

555
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,600
this local will be decertified.

556
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,100
Instead of your union
running out of this office...

557
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,700
it'll be a federal magistrate
down the courthouse deciding things.

558
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,300
Take the opportunity to elect new officers...

559
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,700
or the US Attorney will padlock the door.

560
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,200
And you'll be outside, looking in.

561
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,700
One man, one vote.

562
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,100
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

563
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,200
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

564
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,800
You don't think that had anything to do...

565
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,300
with this mope?

566
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,000
You gotta do better than that, Lester.

567
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,400
This poor guy ain't got a face.

568
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,500
Did I mention the DNA matches?

569
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,100
This has nothing to do with me.

570
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,800
Is that the security guard?

571
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,500
Walt Stokes. A good man.

572
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
Keeps meticulous records.

573
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,700
Bunk, they tell me
you can enhance each frame...

574
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,500
to get a clear look.

575
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,300
Yeah? Show it to me.

576
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,700
I'll be damned. Maryland tags.

577
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,500
Juliet-Lima-Yankee...

578
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,900
5-4-5.

579
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,000
That comes back to a BWI rental.

580
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,100
I wonder who rented it.

581
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,600
This is aggravated murder and kidnapping.

582
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,400
In this state, it's a death penalty case.

583
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,400
I didn't kill him.

584
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,800
I was there, but I didn't kill him.

585
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,400
Vondas did.

586
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,300
He cut his throat.

587
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,600
The shepherd was supposed
to watch over the women.

588
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,400
Instead, he used them to make money.

589
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,900
One of the women, she fought.
She was killed.

590
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,000
And this idiot kills the rest
to make no witnesses.

591
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,600
He had to die.

592
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,700
You want a coffee? Soda?

593
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,600
Vodka.

594
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,400
Coffee.

595
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,100
They're down. All 14 of them.

596
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,800
Abated by the untimely death
of a known suspect.

597
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,700
Plus another clearance
on a John Doe case, just for laughs.

598
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,100
You wanna tell Rawls?

599
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,000
Let him stew a while longer.

600
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,800
One thing, though,
we should do right away.

601
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,900
Who's the man above Vondas?

602
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,500
The Greek.

603
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,700
What's his name?

604
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,000
You want a chance at anything
less than death row...

605
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,600
you're gonna tell me right now...

606
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,400
whatever it is you know
about where those bastards might be.

607
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,200
A hotel at the harbor.

608
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,900
This one?

609
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,000
Another.

610
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,500
I can show you.

611
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,900
Go.

612
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,500
Clear!

613
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,200
Business or pleasure for you?

614
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,200
Business. Always business.

615
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,700
- What did you forget?
- Nothing important.

616
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,000
You come to the bar without me?

617
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,500
Kiss my black cat's sister's ass.

618
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,800
- What happened?
- Case hit the wall.

619
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,100
How so?

620
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,800
The Sobotka nephew breaks for
the smuggling and the drugs.

621
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,100
The Russian breaks for the murder
that fucking killed my girls.

622
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,700
We were late on Vondopoulos
and The Greek.

623
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,900
- How late?
- They skipped.

624
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,700
We got interstate flight warrants out,
but from what the Sobotka kid says...

625
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,100
these guys collect passports.

626
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,000
We ain't even got a name
for The Greek yet, right?

627
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,600
What're we doing
with the drug end of the case?

628
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,700
I guess we could offer up Dixon
and Prop Joe to Narcotics.

629
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,200
See if they want
to follow through on their end.

630
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,500
I don't know.

631
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,700
I wouldn't be so quick
to throw Joe back into the pond.

632
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,500
A major case squad could have some fun
with that mess, don't you think?

633
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,200
Lieutenant.

634
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,500
I never told you this.

635
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,300
In fact, if you tell anyone
I ever told you this...

636
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,700
I'll finish my career
in fucking Montana or some shit.

637
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,600
Excuse me, sorry.

638
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,600
The leak wasn't your people.

639
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,500
When I called around
looking for info on your targets...

640
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,100
I used the FedCom software, you know?

641
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,700
I thought I was talking
to some fuck in San Diego.

642
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,000
The 9/11 boys in D.C.

643
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,100
I'm guessing Vondopoulos
or The Greek was an asset to them.

644
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,900
Hooked up like, I don't know,
who knows what?

645
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,700
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

646
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,100
World just keeps turning, right?

647
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,400
You guys move on to something new.
No one looks back.

648
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,400
It's on me this time.

649
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,400
Anyone?

650
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,000
Where are you going?

651
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,000
Work.

652
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,600
Frank, you cocksucker.

653
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,500
- I can take it from here.
- You sure?

654
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,200
No one fucks with us on our turf.

655
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,000
Where the fuck else am I gonna go?
How's it looking?

656
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,600
One ROIRO at North Point.
Graybeards grabbed that.

657
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,200
Nothing else today, really.

658
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,100
Seniority sucks.

659
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,400
If you ain't senior.

660
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,200
All right, man.

661
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,800
This is a great day for Baltimore.
