1
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,000
Fucking-A.

2
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,900
Yeah, shit is good.

3
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Here. Next time we re-up, though...

4
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,700
tell Moe man we need about 700,
800 more of them dimes, all right?

5
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
I ain't even seen shit like this
since I don't know when.

6
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,800
- Same with the jumbos?
- Yeah, better get more of those, too.

7
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,800
What the fuck is up now?
String, what's up, man?

8
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,800
What up? Can't call it.

9
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,400
- How's our package?
- How's it look? Shit is good.

10
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
See these Eastside motherfuckers
over here?

11
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,600
I want you to extend
to these motherfuckers...

12
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,300
all the hospitality that
West Baltimore is famous for.

13
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,000
- You heard?
- You want us to fuck them up?

14
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,300
No, dawg.

15
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,600
We're giving them 221, 734, and Saratoga.

16
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,600
We keep the rest. If anybody start any shit...

17
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,400
they'll have to answer to me,
all right? Directly.

18
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,800
You heard me, right?

19
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,900
All right.

20
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,300
What are these off-brand niggers gonna do
with a project tower?

21
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,700
Fall back, young'un.

22
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,600
We're gonna show y'all motherfuckers
how to grind out here, all right?

23
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,300
Hey, String.

24
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I heard you, man, I did.

25
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,300
But this shit right here,
it don't make no sense.

26
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,900
You like the new product we selling?

27
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,500
It make sense now?

28
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,000
- Where are we at with our Boss Man?
- We should be up on his phone soon.

29
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,000
- The PC is there, no question.
- We get up on his cellphone, he's done.

30
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,400
We'll ID him, no problem.

31
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know. They came down on that
warehouse phone when we spooked them.

32
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,500
Sobotka's cellphone, too.
We might be going up on a dead line.

33
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,700
This is the other way to go.

34
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,900
Compared to the wiretap,
it's the longer way around.

35
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
But still, if he's changing up
on his cellphone...

36
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
Over the last week or so...

37
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,300
we've not only confirmed the identities
of some of the key players...

38
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,000
we've also got GPS trackers
on all their cars.

39
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,700
First of all...

40
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,100
Eton Ben-Eleazer.
He's the drug Lieutenant in the warehouse.

41
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
- E-ton.
- Whatever.

42
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,200
Our madam, Miss Ilona Petrovna.

43
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,400
George Glekas, who runs
the appliance store over in Highlandtown...

44
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,500
and the probable fence for the organization.
We followed some of them in real time.

45
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,100
With this little toy here,
there's something else we can do.

46
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,500
That's seven days
of where our targets have been, sped up.

47
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,500
And lookit. Two locations only...

48
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,200
where three or four cars stopped
at the same time for more than five minutes.

49
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,700
One "X" is a dive of a diner
down on South Clinton.

50
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,200
The other is on the western shore
of Fort Howard down past Edgemere.

51
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,900
We get up on these locations,
maybe we get a photo of the Boss Man.

52
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,800
- Or a tag number.
- It's totally cool.

53
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,400
- Where did you even get this stuff?
- DEA for the trackers.

54
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,300
McNulty pulled the software
from his pals at the FBI field office.

55
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
We can pull Herc and Carver
off the warehouse and give them the diner.

56
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,000
McNulty, Bunk, you guys take Fort Howard.

57
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,100
What the fuck, Frank?

58
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,200
You might as well
start posting them things, right?

59
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,500
I mean, shit, if you're gonna run,
you might as well come out and say so.

60
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,300
It ain't personal, Ott.

61
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,300
I want to finish what I started
with the dredging issue.

62
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,300
And you don't think I'm good enough
to handle it.

63
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
It ain't about that, kiddo.

64
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,300
Ott, listen to me!

65
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,000
What the fuck do you want me to do?
Tell him where the money comes from?

66
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,200
I.B.S.?

67
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,800
Not to brag, but union racketeering
is one thing the Bureau does well.

68
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,700
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.
This case needs closure, boys.

69
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,100
And in my heart of hearts...

70
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,900
I know you're the kind of bastards
to put Sobotka where he needs to be.

71
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,400
One other thing
you Federals can help me with.

72
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,100
And if you don't mind,
a little discretion is called for.

73
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,200
That, right there,
is the district surveillance van...

74
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,200
which was fully equipped
when it disappeared.

75
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,400
A surveillance van?

76
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Sobotka stole it.
Now it's I-don't-know-where.

77
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,100
The last picture was from Seattle...

78
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,700
but I got prints...

79
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,100
from two other places, see?

80
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,000
You reported the van stolen, right?

81
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,700
It was my feeling that the theft
of a vehicle from a departmental lot...

82
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,400
would reflect poorly on the department.

83
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,400
The thing is, I know you boys
have got enough reach...

84
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,200
to maybe get the van back
without no big dustup.

85
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,900
As a favor for me
having brought you the whole case.

86
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,700
Motherfucking Eastside
need to get their asses...

87
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,900
back across town where they belong.

88
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,700
Yo, man, we run them off,
we run off the good dope so...

89
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
I'm just saying
they all the time hustling around...

90
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,700
cutting prices and doing shit. It ain't right.

91
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,700
Walk, nigger.

92
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,200
Yo, what's up, soldier?

93
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,200
- Looking maybe to do something here.
- With him? This motherfucker?

94
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,100
- Looking maybe to do something here.
- With him? This motherfucker?

95
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,900
I saw him over on Ashland last week
selling burns.

96
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,200
- Fuck y'all, nigger.
- Look, what did he say?

97
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,500
$25, two dimes and a coke kicker.

98
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll give you two dimes for $15,
plus the ice on top for free. What?

99
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,500
That'll work.

100
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Take it in the lobby. I'll be right behind you.

101
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,000
That's what's up, see?

102
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,700
The game now is that we gotta sell
more of this good shit than they do.

103
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,100
What? Get the fuck out of here!

104
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,300
You mean to tell me
there's a Westside nigger...

105
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,800
who knows how to sell shit
without sticking a pistol in a fiend's face?

106
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Yeah, dawg. And you better get used to it...

107
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,200
'cause y'all ain't selling shit
until we bone-ass dry.

108
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
- Believe that.
- All right, nigger. Whatever, man.

109
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,700
All right, cottage-cheese,
chest-ass motherfucker.

110
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,700
- Where do you want it?
- There's good.

111
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,200
Easy.

112
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,200
- We could help you set it up.
- You have a surveillance to cover?

113
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,700
- I got that feeling again.
- Like they don't think we're potty trained.

114
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,700
- Can I help you?
- FBI. Lt. Daniels?

115
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,700
He's in his office.

116
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,200
Without that billboard in my face,
I wouldn't have known.

117
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,000
How could you have known?

118
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,400
- There was the wingtips.
- And the beady eyes. Definite giveaway.

119
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,400
- Tight asses.
- Definitely.

120
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,200
Lt. Daniels? Agents Settles and Mason.

121
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,800
Maj. Valchek said you'd be expecting us.

122
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,600
You listening to this fool?

123
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,900
Saying that the Eastside
is wilder than Westside...

124
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
'cause of some shit
about Eastside folks drinking port wine...

125
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,400
while the Westside do sherry?

126
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Port make a man do crazy shit,
I'm telling you.

127
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,800
- Butchie, talk to this fool.
- For me, leastways...

128
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,300
the difference between East and West
goes back to one man:

129
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,600
- Frank Matthews.
- Pee Wee Matthews?

130
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,700
Yeah, the brother went up New York
and got in bed with them Italians.

131
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,100
The only one from this town
got a piece of that French Connection.

132
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
What the hell Pee Wee
got to do with anything?

133
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,500
'Cause Frank was Westside. How do you
like that? The dope flowed West.

134
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,700
When you got a steady supply,
you run shit like a business.

135
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,400
Somebody gets hurt, there's a reason.
Not like this foolishness we got today.

136
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,800
Excuse me.

137
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,200
What say, Omar?

138
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Ain't no thing.

139
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,900
You know I got something for you, right?
Wouldn't come around unless I did.

140
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,400
What up, Butch?
How you holding up, baby?

141
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,100
Except for fretting on you, I'm good.

142
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,800
It's for my people.

143
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,600
A little something for a rainy day.

144
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,700
You built up a right nice-size nest
these past couple of years.

145
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,700
Might be time you maybe think
about backing off some?

146
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,300
Back off to what?

147
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,900
Later, Butch.

148
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,500
Stay, boy.

149
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,100
Damn, Zig, I ain't got it cut yet.

150
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,600
And turn that shit down, for Christ's sake.

151
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,800
Nicely done.

152
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,000
Like I always say,
it pays to go with a union card every time.

153
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,900
- Turn the fucking radio down, Zig.
- Will you get in the goddamn car already?

154
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,100
For Christ's sake,
we ain't got all night. Jesus!

155
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,800
You could drive a tank through there,
it wouldn't take a scratch.

156
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,300
Where the fuck you going with this?

157
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Greece. Athens, Greece.

158
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,300
The hole is so they don't think
it's an inside job.

159
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,900
So they don't look at the union.

160
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,800
Welcome aboard, chief.

161
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,900
Is that you?

162
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,700
I thought you were gonna go shopping.

163
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,500
- Me?
- Yeah.

164
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,300
We round-the-clock with surveillance.

165
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,600
When do we get to the part
where you do all kind of shit for me?

166
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,900
When do we get to that part?

167
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,900
So you past the point
of lifting a grocery bag or two?

168
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,800
You try being me like this.

169
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,200
Something wrong?

170
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,000
The baby's kicking. Wanna feel?

171
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,500
- Almost $4,000.
- I know it is.

172
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,600
The Greek guy, the one with the warehouse,
pays me in cash.

173
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,300
Keeps it off the books,
so he don't have to pay taxes and benefits.

174
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,200
- And you saved all that?
- He gave me a bump, too.

175
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,700
I'm pulling down $700 a week.

176
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
You don't believe me?

177
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
Christ.

178
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,700
I was saving that up to give to you
for the new apartment.

179
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
You know what I'm saying, dawg?

180
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,000
But I don't understand how these hoes
be acting sometimes and shit.

181
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,900
If I tell a bitch, I'm like,
"Bitch, either you suck dick or you don't."

182
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,400
- Gentlemen.
- What's up, my brother?

183
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,900
Are you slinging bean pies up in here?
You know what I mean?

184
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
You with the nation, homey?
'Cause either you're a Muslim...

185
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,500
or your momma need to stop
laying your clothes out in the morning.

186
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,700
I'm here to represent the interests
of a Mr. Barksdale.

187
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,300
- Are you familiar with Mr. Barksdale?
- That name ring out, but so do mine.

188
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,000
And you are?

189
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,100
Cheese, man.

190
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,100
Mr. Cheese. I see.

191
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,600
- And who do you work for, Mr. Cheese?
- Who do I work for?

192
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,100
Am I correct in assuming that
you are not employed by Mr. Barksdale?

193
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,300
Hell, yeah.

194
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
If that is the case,
then I have to insist that you leave.

195
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,500
- This nigger serious?
- Let me be emphatic.

196
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,000
You need to take your black ass
across Charles Street to where it belong.

197
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,900
- What?
- Hold on now.

198
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,000
He don't know what this is. It ain't
what he think, you know what I'm saying?

199
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,400
First of all, we got permission
to grind in these here towers.

200
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,100
Second of all, I don't give a fuck...

201
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Get off me, get off!

202
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,400
Pellets in plastic. Rat shot.

203
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,700
What you need to be concerned about
is what's seated in the chamber now:

204
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,400
a copper-jacketed, hollow point...

205
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,800
120-grain hot street load
of my own creation.

206
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,000
So you need to think for just a moment
and ask yourself:

207
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,300
What do I have to do
before this man raise up his gun again?

208
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,000
Let's go.

209
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Good day to you, sir.

210
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,900
I'm in agreement
with the agents' assessment.

211
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,300
As far as I can see...

212
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,100
this case is an ideal candidate
for RICO prosecution.

213
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,600
My agency agrees RICO is the way to go,
so we'll be in your courthouse, not mine.

214
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,400
But I want one thing on record.

215
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,100
As of 9/11,
the Bureau has one priority in this case:

216
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,000
it's waterfront corruption.

217
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,700
It's a new world
and the ports are vulnerable.

218
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,300
This case is bigger than the union.

219
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,900
We're agreeing to take on
the whole case, Lieutenant.

220
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But the union is why
we're in the room with you.

221
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,600
If you're okay with that,
we can work the case together.

222
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,500
We'll copy all the Bureau's 302s
to the Lieutenant and Miss Pearlman.

223
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Your paperwork should CC Squad 6
and my office, as well.

224
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,200
I'll start pumping your casework
into our system.

225
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,800
See what leads that might generate.

226
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,100
Oughtn't you be laid up resting?

227
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,000
A gunshot ain't nothing to trifle with.

228
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,100
Shoulder do hurt.

229
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,200
But this here work just fine.

230
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,100
Tell Stack to polish it up good
and put $7.50 on it.

231
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,100
Shame to let a good toaster get away
over a frayed cord.

232
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,900
First off, ain't nobody running
up in them projects.

233
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,400
Them Westside boys are hurting over this
more than even you.

234
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,100
Trust me,
soon as our good shit run out, they fucked.

235
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,200
Second, a whole passel of hard-ass hitters...

236
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,000
took a go at Brother Mouzone,
and ain't lived to say shit about it.

237
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,000
We go at the boy,
no telling what might get stirred up.

238
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,800
If Stringer takes a shot,
he crosses Avon on it.

239
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,300
Put a bounty on him.

240
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,000
Let some bushwhacking fiend
back-shoot his ass.

241
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,000
I pin money on him,
and first thing he come at me?

242
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Shit. Might as well just shoot myself now
and get it over.

243
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,400
There is one boy
who might could just pull this off.

244
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,000
Only, he won't take contract money.

245
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,500
Aim for center mass.
Make sure the man goes down.

246
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,000
No problem.

247
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,800
I got the three on the left.

248
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,800
Fuck you, assholes.

249
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,700
- How you doing?
- How you doing, buddy?

250
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,000
The Samsung S221. You got that?

251
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,500
I don't see it.

252
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,600
Doing the old inventory, are we?

253
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,700
I hope there ain't been no thieving going on.

254
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,600
Not like the problem we got
down at the docks.

255
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,600
- You get the cars off?
- Sailed two hours ago on the Caspia.

256
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,600
Listed as scrap aluminum.
I got the bill of lading right here.

257
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,100
Not here.

258
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,900
In my office.

259
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,700
Forgive me, but how am I to know...

260
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,400
you did not ship them empty?

261
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,600
I just don't know. Let me see.

262
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Maybe if I had a 4.0 Megapix,
three time optical, fully digitalized camera...

263
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,800
I could've taken some quality photos
of them Benzes in those cans.

264
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,500
But oops. I forgot my camera got busted.

265
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,500
Or you know what I could do?

266
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,400
I could get old Boris
to skulk around them docks...

267
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,800
keep the old commie red eye
on them containers.

268
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,100
Make sure the dock boys
are playing me straight.

269
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,800
- They are what I order?
- Yes.

270
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,800
I got you the S series
in the colors that you wanted.

271
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,000
I even got one parked outside.
You wanna see?

272
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Outside? Now?

273
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm just taking her out for a spin, chief.
I'll put her back tonight.

274
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,800
Wait one.

275
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,300
Them cars list out
at better than $60,000 each.

276
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,000
20% was last week. Today, the quote is 10%.

277
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,600
Still, it's good money for a few hours' work.

278
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,400
No!

279
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,300
No fucking way!
We had a deal, motherfucker. A deal.

280
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,700
You listen to me.

281
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,500
It was my fucking ass out there
on the line. Mine.

282
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,000
This piddling shit
is the best that you come up with?

283
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,600
You don't play me like that. You don't.

284
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,500
Fuck you, you thieving, Greek cunt.

285
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,800
Malaka!

286
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,500
You don't know that one, chief.
But you know "malaka, " yes?

287
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,900
Now you know malaka with dress.

288
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,000
Please.

289
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,300
Malaka.

290
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,900
Can you hear me?

291
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,600
If you can talk, please stay on the line.

292
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,900
Get in the boat first,
then put the preserver on.

293
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,200
- It's easier that way.
- Yeah?

294
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,500
Y'all trying to drown my ass for sure.

295
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,600
- Come on.
- Don't push me, man.

296
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,800
Rod.

297
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
Got it.

298
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,200
Here. Hold on to that.

299
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,000
I know this one.

300
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,300
Stringer Bell will come at me with this.

301
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,200
Says he's got something with Omar
he need to make straight.

302
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,300
Didn't say what that might be?

303
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,900
Wouldn't tell me.
And to be truthful, I didn't want to know.

304
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,200
No. It don't feel right.

305
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,200
You know them Barksdale people
ain't to be trusted.

306
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,800
No denying all you say is true.
But Stringer talking parley.

307
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,200
So your boy needs to think
long and hard on this.

308
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,800
'Cause if Omar is living his day-to-day
in the street...

309
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,900
there ain't no telling what their next step
might be if there ain't no sit-down.

310
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
- "Parley"?
- That's all he says he's looking for.

311
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,800
I'll talk to him.

312
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,000
But if it feels funny to him
the way it does to me...

313
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,700
I got a better chance
of putting a leash to the wind, you know?

314
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,300
If you think it might help,
I can go protection.

315
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,900
- They're the one got hurt the last time.
- Then there was a reason to meet.

316
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,000
- This time feel different.
- I hear you.

317
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Maybe Stringer's still trying
to settle that beef...

318
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,900
behind the fact
that he got to live in this city, too...

319
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,800
Omar being Omar.

320
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,300
If it ain't putting you out none...

321
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,300
I'd feel a powerful lot better
if my nephew took over protection.

322
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,600
Hayward.

323
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,700
Typed and ready for your John Hancock.

324
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,000
- Thanks.
- Sure.

325
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,000
You just have to initial each page
and then sign at the end.

326
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,100
I'm just checking.
This is the official record, right, chief?

327
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,200
It's what's gonna play in court.

328
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,700
Can I change something?

329
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah.

330
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,900
Just put your initials next to your changes.
It's no problem.

331
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,500
Yeah, it's only one.

332
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,000
- You know, you typed "said" here, see?
- "Said"?

333
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,900
He wasn't saying, "Please don't shoot me."

334
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,500
It was more begging.

335
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,600
You know? Double G, he's begging me.

336
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,300
But that's not gonna mess you up,
though, right?

337
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,800
No, it's more descriptive like that.
It's good. Thanks.

338
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,100
Quiet. No one in or out of there.

339
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,900
It's kind of nice out here.
Moonlight on the water.

340
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,600
Waves lapping gently against the boat.

341
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,300
I'm working my regular eight.
I can handle it, you know?

342
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,900
But a detail like this...

343
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,900
That's what I'm asking.

344
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,600
If something comes up on the job,
how would you handle it?

345
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,700
I mean, at home with the kids.

346
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,900
Until now, not much came up.

347
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,400
But now, say something comes up.

348
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I mean, say we do a raid or something.
What would you do?

349
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,600
I guess I'd try to get the sitter to stay.

350
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,300
Maybe call my folks, like I did tonight.

351
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,100
You know how it is with kids.
You gotta be there.

352
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,400
But you wouldn't miss it?

353
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,100
I mean, with everybody rolling out
and you having to head home?

354
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,400
If it keeps going like this,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

355
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,800
- Thanks.
- It's no problem.

356
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,900
You wanna make a phone call to someone?

357
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,300
If you get over to Madison,
it might be some time before you can.

358
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,900
Ain't a chance I get a bail, right?

359
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,600
How about family?

360
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,300
All right, to bring you up to speed,
we've got agents in Le Havre...

361
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,300
shagging leads from the manifest
of the Talco ship due here in a few days.

362
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,500
To see if we can't pinpoint the origin
for the illegal containers.

363
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,300
That's a lot of cans.

364
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,900
A hundred and ten, actually.

365
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,200
How many agents you need to track back
to where all those cans came from?

366
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,000
As many as it takes.

367
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,100
We may be assholes, but on the upside,
there's an awful lot of us.

368
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,100
Let me get this into the computer
for the boys overseas.

369
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,300
Anything from that shithole of a diner?

370
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,000
Herc and Carver had nothing overnight.

371
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,300
The feds took over this morning
and it's still quiet.

372
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,500
I'm going back on the water.

373
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,300
One meet and we're on this guy.

374
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,400
The Talco line's in Wednesday.
I'll send Nick for a number.

375
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,600
- The Greeks again?
- Who else?

376
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,100
They sure do stir up the shit,
them Greeks do.

377
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,500
- Uncle Frank.
- Nicky boy, just in time.

378
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,500
- Uncle Frank.
- What? What happened?

379
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,200
- What the fuck is it this time?
- He shot...

380
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,200
They're saying he shot two of the Greeks.

381
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,900
- Last night, they're saying.
- Shot?

382
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,000
- He shot?
- Fucking Christ!

383
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,100
He's locked up.
He's fucking charged with murder.

384
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,400
- The Greeks?
- Double G.

385
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,200
And one of the kids that works
down the store on the avenue with him.

386
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,500
They're saying he walked in there.

387
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,900
- He went in.
- Why was he there?

388
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,000
- Where the fuck were you?
- Uncle Frank, I didn't know.

389
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,600
What didn't you know?

390
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,000
- What is Ziggy doing near the Greeks?
- I don't know.

391
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,800
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!

392
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,100
You're his father.

393
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,900
1,125 kilograms.

394
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,700
Not that drug enforcement's my cup of tea...

395
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,300
but I'm told
it was the largest crack seizure on record.

396
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,500
I just wish I had good news for you.

397
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,900
You told me this was a local effort.

398
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,500
It's sprawled. Now the Bureau's involved.
We're looking hard at the port unions.

399
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,200
My hands are tied.

400
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,900
They're on you with wiretaps.

401
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,700
Several phones, several addresses.

402
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,900
Stefanos.

403
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,600
Have the boy go to Eton.

404
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,000
Tell him to come right away
to the other place.

405
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,300
- You're not calling?
- No phones. No more phones.

406
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,400
Adieu, my friend.

407
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,500
They forgot your fries.

408
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,000
No, they forgot your fries.

409
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,400
- My fries are right in here.
- Those are my fries.

410
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Bitch, everything I say, you hear backwards.
The fries are mine, boy.

411
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,900
Go ahead.

412
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Eat the fries, you fat fuck.
See if I fucking care.

413
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,900
What? You think I'm fat?

414
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,700
There's our boy.

415
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,100
- Lester, Eton's on the move.
- We got it.

416
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,400
- No need for an eyeball follow, right?
- No need.

417
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,100
A fine fucking kettle of fish.

418
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,900
I heard it,
but I had to come see it for myself.

419
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,800
- And sure enough...
- Major?

420
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,900
You know,
I put my faith in you fucking feds.

421
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,500
You let me down.

422
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,100
- Major, we can talk in my office.
- Lieutenant.

423
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,200
It's Lieutenant, right?

424
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,000
I gave you a simple assignment:

425
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,200
that fellow, the one in the corner.

426
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,100
And to make it happen, I gave you all this.

427
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,800
Good digs, people...

428
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,400
everything you needed.

429
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,800
And what did you give me?

430
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,500
Right up the fucking ass, Lieutenant.

431
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,100
- Major, you're going to get --
- Roland, get your shit.

432
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,500
You want to do it your way, fine.

433
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,600
But you ain't gonna use my people
to fuck me.

434
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,600
- Get your gear. I'm pulling you.
- I got... There's work...

435
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,500
- You said --
- Get your narrow ass back to the district...

436
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,400
before I slap you with insubordination.

437
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,700
Move, shitbird!

438
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,600
Jesus!

439
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,200
Detective, my office.

440
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,200
Base to 11-34.
Target number two is coming at your 20.

441
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,600
Copy that. We're on it good.

442
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,600
We're on the Boss.

443
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,800
My God.

444
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,700
- He shoots both?
- He kills George, right there in the store.

445
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,300
- Leaves the boy to bleed.
- For what?

446
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,500
An argument over a few cars?

447
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,000
- That little Polack?
- He's crazy, that one.

448
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,900
The police have him now.

449
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,200
The police still there?

450
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,600
Go to the store.

451
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,900
Whatever the police did not take,
papers, pictures, everything...

452
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,700
you clean it up.

453
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,300
The warehouse, too.
Everything gets clean now.

454
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,500
Everything.

455
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And the phones are dead.

456
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,700
Did you see that?
They just threw the phones.

457
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,300
11-34 to Surveillance.

458
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,200
- Standing by.
- We got our man.

459
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,000
Target number one
is a white male, 40s, short...

460
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,900
wearing a tan shirt and a gray tam.

461
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,600
Copy your description.

462
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,600
11-34 to Surveillance,
both targets are on the move.

463
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,300
We can't make the vehicle from here,
but you sure can.

464
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
Copy.

465
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,100
What was he doing
with that thing in his hand?

466
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,900
Same thing you always do.

467
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,100
Probably sending a text message.
My kids are crazy over that.

468
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,400
That's our guy, right?

469
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,100
What's his face Sobotka
from the drug corner?

470
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
I need to get with Vondas.

471
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,800
Who's that?

472
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,300
Spiros. Where is he?

473
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,300
I don't know no Spiros.

474
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,400
- No shit.
- He just up and clocked him?

475
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,800
- Daniels had everybody write what they saw.
- Even us suits.

476
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,000
That was smart. Daniels is sharp.

477
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,800
- Where's Prez now?
- Daniels took him home.

478
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,000
- I don't think he'll come back to this detail.
- You never know.

479
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,600
He might have one of those psychological
bullshit things in his jacket...

480
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,000
gives him immunity or something.

481
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,900
Valchek gave him immunity,
and he just put Valchek on his ass.

482
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,600
- Nothing since the Fort Howard meet.
- They're definitely dumping phones.

483
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,900
When you use a cellphone and
press "send, " where does the call go to?

484
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,700
- Why are you asking?
- The Boss Man at Fort Howard.

485
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,100
He tosses the cellphone we're up on, right?

486
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,000
Then he pulls out another thingamajig,
and he types a message.

487
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,600
Text messaging.

488
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,900
It starts at one of those towers
they got up all over the place, right?

489
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,700
And ends up in a computer
at a wireless provider.

490
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,100
If you knew when the call was made,
could you trace the call back to that tower?

491
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,800
'Cause if you could,
mightn't you get a phone number?

492
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,400
You get that,
then you got the billing details, right?

493
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,600
Fool, do you have any idea
how many people use cellphones?

494
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,200
There must be thousands,
hundreds of thousands at any time.

495
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,600
What you need is another variable.

496
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,900
Another bit of data that's gonna help you
isolate your call from all the others.

497
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,200
What if you knew where the call was made?
I mean, exactly where it was made.

498
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,800
We were out in the middle of nowhere.
Does that help narrow it down?

499
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,200
The Fort Howard sea wall. It ain't exactly
Charles and Baltimore Streets.

500
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,500
You've got another problem.
Which wireless company?

501
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,700
There must be Verizon, MCI, AT&T, Sprint...

502
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,000
Shit, tin cans and a string.
You got dozens of them.

503
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,800
Lamar?

504
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,100
- Where's my Harper's?
- Say what?

505
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,800
Harper's. The new issue.

506
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,000
You didn't say that one.
You said The New Republic and Atlantic...

507
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,200
- And a new something else.
- I did not forget to tell you Harper's.

508
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,800
Every week I tell you the same shit,
and every week you forget half of what I say.

509
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,500
Tomorrow, first thing, you go
to the newsstand and you get Harper's.

510
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,100
And The Nation, too,
which you also managed to forget.

511
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,300
You know what the most dangerous thing
in America is, right?

512
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,500
A nigger with a library card.

513
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,500
All damn day, he just sit there reading.

514
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,600
And damned if them Eastside bitches
don't stay away.

515
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,500
- That's real muscle, right there.
- True that.

516
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,200
What are we gonna do
when we start running out of good product?

517
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,600
That's what we need to ask ourselves.

518
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,200
Yo, Bodie,
if Stringer want the Eastside up in here...

519
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,500
then why Barksdale got a man
running them off?

520
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,700
This is getting us nowhere.
We got nothing under Pyramid Inc...

521
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,400
or any of the targets
at any other cellular company.

522
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,000
It's on McNulty then.

523
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,900
11-35, you got the 20?

524
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,900
- I'm on the spot right now.
- Go.

525
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,000
10-4. Latitude first:
North, 39 degrees. 11.727.

526
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,600
Longitude: West, 76 degrees. 26.628.

527
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,000
Now, this was a neat trick.
No one ever did it before.

528
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,200
Identified a cellphone using time and GPS.

529
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,100
We got everything on the phone
that was text messaging...

530
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,100
from those coordinates at 04:45 p.m. today.

531
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,100
Just a subpoena?

532
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,900
With this, you can get account information
and a phone number.

533
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,600
With a search warrant...

534
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,300
you can get two months of text messages.

535
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,000
You got two months of text messages
in this file?

536
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,200
I do, if you've got a warrant.

537
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,500
Tell you what, friend.

538
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,800
We're gonna go back and
start typing that warrant tomorrow morning.

539
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,300
But right now,
we wouldn't mind taking a peek...

540
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,800
at what my man's been up to
in the last 24 hours.

541
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,700
Exigent circumstances.

542
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,600
Thanks, brother.

543
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,900
Fuck me.

544
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,100
Nothing's easy.

545
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,500
- What's up?
- They've dumped their phones.

546
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,400
We're trying to get onto
the Boss Man's text messaging.

547
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,300
They sent that Greek mess over as email.

548
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,000
After he inputs,
the computer will translate it.

549
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,100
Got it.

550
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,600
Shit.

551
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,400
Hey, Prissy.

552
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,000
Thought you'd be here.

553
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,900
Fucking Ziggy.

554
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,900
When didn't he do dumb shit?

555
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,200
Remember when he forged
that Age of Majority card?

556
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,600
We all pooled our money.

557
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,500
You drove us over Brooklyn Park
to the cut-rate.

558
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,700
My mom's puke-yellow Chevy.

559
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
We told him specifically:

560
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,400
two bottles of Pikesville Rye and...

561
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,100
Southern Comfort for me.

562
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,000
What did fucknuts get?

563
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,900
Fucking Boone's Farm.

564
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,400
He said that's what the college kids drank.

565
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,900
But we did it up. Right here.

566
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,900
He stood up there, a bottle in each hand...

567
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,100
screaming loud enough to wake the nuns.

568
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,300
What the fuck did he say?

569
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,900
"College kids ain't shit!"

570
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,300
Goddamn, Zig.

571
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,100
- Yeah?
- Beadie, it's Kima.

572
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,500
We're gonna take the Boss out.

573
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,600
- Raids? Tonight?
- You got somewhere to drop the kids off?

574
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,200
No, no problem.
I can take them over to my parents'.

575
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
All right, we'll see you soon.

576
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,900
Kima, thanks for the call. Bye.

577
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,500
The judge wants to know how much longer.

578
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,800
We're close.

579
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,700
Dump this row. Dump the computer.
Dump this.
