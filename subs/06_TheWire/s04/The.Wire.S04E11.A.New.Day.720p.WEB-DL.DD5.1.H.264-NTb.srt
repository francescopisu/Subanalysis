1
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:14,514
Yeah, can I get
the mixed vegetables and white rice?

2
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,225
- OK, mixed vegetables, white rice.
- Damn, Du'.

3
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,895
You actin' like this some fancy-ass spot.
It ain't nothing but a Chink joint.

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,940
- I'm-a order.
- Then do it. I said I got it.

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,239
Look at this nigger flashin' his shit
like some big-time gangster.

6
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,617
- Yeah, he a righteous hustler.
- I'm just treating y'all, that's all.

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,204
- I like to keep it real with the little people.
- Man, fuck you, man.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,624
- I was talking about you.
- I was talking about you.

9
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,964
- May I help you?
- Can I order the yakame with turkey grease?

10
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,050
Yakame, noodles...

11
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,261
- This nigger ordered turkey grease.
- What's wrong, yo?

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,221
I mean, my mom, she get it all the time.

13
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,516
Yo, you is really one of them at-risk children,
you know that, Dukie?

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,644
- Yo, man, leave him alone, son.
- Yeah, I got it. How much?

15
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,229
- $4.00.
- Why is it so funny?

16
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,398
- They just goofin' on you.
- What's wrong with me ordering yakame?

17
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,774
Nothing wrong with you ordering yakame.

18
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,235
It's just the turkey grease
that makes the drunks

19
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,572
throw up all that liquor they was drinking,
go back to swilling that shit.

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,870
- This shit is good.
- Why don't you buy your own food?

21
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,330
This is all you getting.
Don't ask for no more of that.

22
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,999
Tastes good as hell.

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,169
Yo, y'all heard about
what happened to Little Kevin?

24
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,588
- What?
- He be dead.

25
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,299
- He up in them vacants.
- Why?

26
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,842
Fucked up somewhere, I suppose.

27
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,262
Uh-oh.

28
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,097
What the fuck you little hoppers
doing on my avenue?

29
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,349
- Eating.
- Shit you are.

30
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,185
Probably setting up to snatch a purse.

31
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,813
Get the fuck back on the reservation
where your black asses belong.

32
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,690
How you feeling, little man?

33
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,026
Need a hand with that food?

34
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,320
I said get.

35
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,080
- Yo, y'all hear that shit?
- "My avenue."

36
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,540
It's just as much ours as it is his.

37
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,543
Walker be evil, yo.
He be thieving and smackin' folk down.

38
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,172
Yo, we should get him back
on the payback tip for all the dirt he do.

39
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,466
You want to throw down with police?

40
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,302
I don't mean go at him direct,
but, you know, hurt him.

41
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,388
Like, slash his tires or some shit.

42
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,474
We could stick condoms on his car.

43
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,645
- That'd send a message.
- Yeah, but what kind?

44
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,563
We should slap bumper stickers
on his windshield.

45
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,067
- I mean, they is hard to get off.
- Hold on, wait, wait.

46
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,070
Do Officer Walker go to that club on Stockton,

47
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,697
- the one where the Western police party?
- I seen his car there.

48
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,701
I got this one.

49
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,757
When you walk through the garden

50
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,759
Watch your back

51
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,470
Well, I beg your pardon

52
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:02,348
Walk the straight and narrow track

53
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,434
If you walk with Jesus

54
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,270
He'll save your soul

55
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,733
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

56
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,403
He's got fire and the fury

57
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,197
At his command

58
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,700
Well, you don't got to worry

59
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,369
Hold on to Jesus' hand

60
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,038
We'll be safe from Satan

61
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,791
When the thunder rolls

62
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,961
But you gotta keep the devil

63
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,880
Down in the hole

64
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,262
Oh yeah, mm

65
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,685
We'll be safe from Satan

66
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,190
Gotta keep the devil

67
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,651
Down in the hole

68
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,156
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

69
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,909
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

70
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,494
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

71
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,289
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

72
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,666
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

73
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,419
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

74
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,305
And as much as I empathize,

75
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,475
I can only tell you that there is a process
for complaints like this one.

76
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,727
Don't sell us on process, Mr. Mayor.

77
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,813
We've had years of this kind of treatment
from city police.

78
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,358
You need to understand
we view this as an affront to the cloth.

79
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,236
We've asked for a civilian review board
for decades now.

80
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,699
Absent that, how can we trust
any investigation of any complaint?

81
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:48,371
Forgive me, gentlemen, but last I checked,
the department had a black commissioner

82
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,039
and a black IID director.

83
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,958
The problem is systemic.

84
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:56,212
And as to Commissioner Burrell, we
understand that his authority is now limited.

85
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,548
Mr. Mayor, when it comes to matters like this,

86
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,843
do you expect us to have faith
in Deputy Rawls?

87
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,763
I expect you'll be good enough
not to prejudge the department's response

88
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,016
before the investigation even begins,
as I won't prejudge it.

89
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,686
I can only tell you that I take this incident
very seriously,

90
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,063
and that I will pursue all of the facts.

91
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,070
Well, Mr. Mayor, you said you would
have an open door,

92
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,698
and so far I credit you
for keeping that promise.

93
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,408
And my door will always be open to you.

94
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,411
Thank you.

95
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,794
If they couldn't get civilian review
out of a Royce administration,

96
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,338
- how can they think they'll get it from me?
- They're testing you

97
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,757
to see how vulnerable you feel
on the racial stuff.

98
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,720
- On Burrell, too, for what it's worth.
- Well, civilian review is a nonstarter.

99
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,807
You go now there now, you'll be bending over
for four years for the ministers.

100
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,393
So what?
I throw them a bone and fire some idiot cop?

101
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,979
By pressing that, the average beat cop's
gonna hate my guts,

102
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,481
and I can't change anything
without rank-and-file support.

103
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,943
You don't fire him, you're going to piss off
most of the black political infrastructure.

104
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,321
Yummy. My first bowl of shit.

105
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,540
Circle that right there.

106
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,542
And you press that right there.

107
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,382
It's work time.

108
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,427
You guys got work to do?
You write down that data?

109
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,720
- Yeah.
- All right.

110
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,100
- Charlene, what don't you understand?
- None of it.

111
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,020
OK. Let's see if we can find
a way you can get it, OK?

112
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,189
- What's the diameter?
- Huh?

113
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,315
It's seven.

114
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,651
- Good. OK, what's half of that?
- You can't take half of it.

115
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,322
OK, let's say you have $10
and you gave half of it to Jasmine.

116
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,449
Why I do that?

117
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,409
Well, just pretend, OK?

118
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,330
- You give her half, how much does she have?
- Duh! Five.

119
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:58,834
Good. Now let's say this time you have $7,
you give her half, how much does she have?

120
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,130
- $3.50.
- Good, so...

121
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,010
Yo, Mr. Prez, check this out.

122
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,688
Why we no pick him up at his casa,
follow him from there?

123
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,440
Why? So we can lose him here again?

124
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,859
Papa, nothin' say he got to come back
through this way, you know?

125
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,529
- What if he take another road...?
- All right.

126
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,322
We pick him up from his casa tomorrow.

127
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,369
Poutin'.

128
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,788
- Don't pout.
- Omar, I'm tired of this, bro.

129
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,708
Lo siento, baby. Lo siento.

130
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,881
Hey, now...

131
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,051
..there she blow.

132
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,357
All right, then.

133
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:08,154
So we agree staring down
a stick-up boy on a corner takes courage,

134
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,240
and we agree it takes courage to go overnight
to Cheltenham or Hickey.

135
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,952
This is a good list, but are there
any examples we can make

136
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,579
outside of being on a corner?

137
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,999
I need a volunteer.

138
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,712
- Not me.
- What about you, Albert?

139
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,796
No.

140
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,757
You volunteer and you don't know what for,
you ain't got brains.

141
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,428
All right, then, I need a volunteer
to stand on this box

142
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,432
blindfolded, fall off, and let us
catch him before he hits the ground.

143
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,100
Oh, shit!

144
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,687
- Albert?
- That's fucking stupid.

145
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,192
- What about you, Namond?
- Wait, wait, let me get this right.

146
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:50,237
So you want me to stand up on that box,
put a blindfold on, fall,

147
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,199
and expect these weak-ass clowns
to catch me? Please.

148
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,326
Hell, no.

149
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,791
Hey, yo, y'all drop me,
and we gonna have more than words.

150
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,379
- A'ight.
- All right, everybody gather round.

151
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,802
Oh, shit.

152
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,224
You ready? On three.

153
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,602
One, two, three.

154
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,811
Let him drop.

155
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,605
Whoa!

156
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,941
Shit! Oh, that shit was right.

157
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,985
All right, who wants to go next? Albert?

158
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,323
I ain't doing no stupid shit like that!
Fuck you, and fuck all y'all bitches.

159
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,041
- We don't like your ass anyway.
- Settle down, settle down.

160
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,798
Yo, today's specials
are those little Hershey bars, three for a dime.

161
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,552
And I got all your other favorites, too.
Yo, Deante, I got your liquorice...

162
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,137
red and black both.

163
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,847
Snitchin' Randy.

164
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,577
- Well, I'll be blessed, yo. Lookit.
- This is good? We put him here?

165
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,538
That tall man with Prop Joe?

166
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,543
Yo, for real, on this caper
the more we learn, the less we know.

167
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,170
- We can go?
- No, we stay.

168
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,630
Papa, I need to go.

169
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,842
- I say we stay, Renaldo. What's wrong, yo?
- No no, I mean "go."

170
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,427
Me voy a cagar encima, bro.

171
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,970
We been in the car too many hours.

172
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,473
Whether you squat in an alley
or sittin' on a porcelain throne,

173
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,810
don't really change the moment, now do it?

174
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,230
Rough day?

175
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,611
- Doesn't help to hold it in.
- What the fuck you know?

176
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,325
If you tell me, maybe we can help.

177
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,912
Ain't nothing.

178
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,083
Come on, Albert, you been
doing real good in this class.

179
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,753
Real good till today.

180
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,759
Just give it a try.

181
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,560
I went home yesterday.
My mom's on the couch.

182
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,480
She dead.

183
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,233
Me-maw said best I come to school, but...

184
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,363
Oh...

185
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,282
Yeah, you wanted to be with your mom.

186
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,287
Of course you did.

187
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,874
Some of you know me from narcotics work,

188
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,251
some from earlier
if you worked the Western district,

189
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,170
and some of you I'm meeting for the first time.

190
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:57,800
But the only point I'd really like to make here
today is that this is a transitional time

191
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,094
for this department
and for the city as a whole.

192
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,429
We have a new mayor
and a new state's attorney,

193
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,932
and they both feel like
they have a mandate for change.

194
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,813
The point is that given
the mayor's position on crime

195
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,607
and given the outcome of the election,
we can expect certain enhancements.

196
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,733
Oh, really?

197
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,028
Certain improvements may be
forthcoming in the near future.

198
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,115
So we're looking for feedback here,
some input as to what we need

199
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,409
more of or less of to better work murders.

200
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,328
- Better witness protection.
- More proactive investigation.

201
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,789
- Pay raise.
- Yeah!

202
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,334
- Better lab work. More techs on duty.
- More overtime.

203
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,128
More Scotch!

204
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,213
More time for case prep. Seriously.

205
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,881
More women. Loose women.

206
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,008
Pay hike, double-digits.

207
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,178
Mo' better, mo' better, mo' better.

208
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,514
That's what we want.

209
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,599
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

210
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,435
Sounds like a new day, don't it?

211
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,855
Department's finally gonna get what it needs.
State's attorney's office, too.

212
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,357
A new day.

213
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,359
They make a nice couple, anyway.

214
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,528
Looking forward
to working with you, Colonel.

215
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,241
That's signed by a now-inaugurated mayor

216
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,703
ordering his police commanders
to avoid mass arrests.

217
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,373
Community-based policing and high-end
enforcements are to be emphasized.

218
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,792
- I take it Burrell got a copy.
- In person.

219
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,213
I don't see it.
Why not just fire the fucking asshole?

220
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,175
- The mayor is weighing his options.
- What the fuck does that mean?

221
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:25,053
To fire Burrell, we're going to need more
political capital than we have right now.

222
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:30,017
Speaking of which, it brings us to another
little piece of business.

223
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,769
- The thing with the minister.
- It's a delicate situation.

224
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,230
The ministers are pressing
for a civilian review,

225
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,274
which the rank and file don't want to hear,

226
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,902
but it speaks directly
to the situation with Burrell.

227
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,488
If we expend capital defending this incident...

228
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,907
I get it. You want the cop fired.

229
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,867
No, we're not saying that at all.

230
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,329
The mayor doesn't want to interfere with
the everyday workings of the department.

231
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,624
But it's a balancing act.

232
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,462
Our response has to be smart and
even-handed, in a racial sense, especially.

233
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,673
- If I'm hearing you, it's about perception.
- Exactly.

234
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,094
IID has a black commander,
but he's beholden to Burrell.

235
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,222
He'll stir shit with this if he can.

236
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,102
The sergeant in question is assigned to CID.

237
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,355
His new commander is Daniels.

238
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,149
He's smart, he's black, and politically neutral.

239
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,945
- That work for you?
- Works for us.

240
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,832
Who that? I said, who's that?

241
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,927
You home or you just visiting?

242
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,971
Home if I can.

243
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,308
All right. Get by the fire if you want.

244
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,106
I got a couple of dogs left. You hungry?

245
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,991
Shit weren't working out with Jo-Jo and them.

246
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,326
Said I owed him some cheddar
on some shit some other boy did.

247
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,996
- I don't want to make no noise on that.
- They pressin' you.

248
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,667
You know...

249
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,087
Get with me, and we pay 'em right back, OK?

250
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,381
No, all that shit you been sayin' to me
goin' through my head.

251
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,966
Forget about all that.

252
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,844
If I wouldn't have pushed you off,
you would have never ended on that corner.

253
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,804
But everything I do I be fucking up.

254
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,140
Whole time it feel like
it wasn't me on that corner.

255
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,349
I just wanted to get away.

256
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,897
Well, you're here now, ain't you? Right?

257
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,067
This is you, right here, right now, OK?

258
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,781
- You're burning a hole in that shirt, man.
- Fuck... You fucked me all up

259
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,491
when I saw you walking through the door,
Sherrod.

260
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,577
Oh, shit.

261
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,204
- What you think, huh?
- You know, I get half price for this.

262
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,208
All right, but take your hat off, man.
Don't burn them pimp steaks, huh?

263
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,555
Took long enough.

264
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,561
Yo, Dukie, you sure about this?

265
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:24,608
I mean, I'm with y'all. Y'all my boys like that.

266
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,693
Y'all there for me, I'm there for y'all.

267
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,905
I'm really starting to think
this is some fucked-up shit.

268
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,949
I mean, Officer Walker's
a shady motherfucker,

269
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,910
but he's police.

270
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,873
- We do it Michael's way, we send a message.
- You ain't got to do what I got to do.

271
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,086
We drew straws, Na'.

272
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,110
Let's go.

273
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,706
- This is everything?
- Sergeant Hauk's statement, the ministers',

274
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,791
statements of the other officers, it's all there.

275
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,794
No independent witnesses, huh?
It's a lot of smoke,

276
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,339
- but I'm not feeling much in the way of fire.
- It was a strong case for discourtesy.

277
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,050
True. But no indication
of racial or religious overtones.

278
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,469
And the brutality allegation is a stretch.

279
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,348
I've gone over GOC-7.

280
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,434
I'm up to speed with the matrix,

281
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,770
but since the buck stops with me on this one,
walk me through my options.

282
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,315
Minor offenses,
you can issue a summary judgment,

283
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,696
a period of extra duty without pay,
guidance and counseling, the like.

284
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:57,117
Or if Sergeant Hauk fights your decision,
or if there's a more substantive charge,

285
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,535
it goes downstairs to a trial board.

286
00:17:58,703 --> 00:17:59,828
And possible termination?

287
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,586
Let me ask you...

288
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,921
if the minister's connected,

289
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,007
and if all eyes are on this one,

290
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,718
what does command want to see happen?

291
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,094
What does City Hall want to see happen?

292
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,390
City Hall just wants someone
to do the right thing, whatever that is.

293
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,852
You're sitting here, Deputy,
telling me to just do the right thing?

294
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,562
Doesn't happen often, I know.

295
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,715
Hey! What are you doing? Come here!

296
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,012
You motherfucker, I'll get your little ass!

297
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,932
Hey, hey, hey!

298
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,683
Come on, show me hands, bitch.

299
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,478
Back the fuck up, little hopper, I'm police.

300
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,981
I know, you the police who like to fuck
with a nigger. Turn around.

301
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,733
Hey, hey, yo!

302
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,111
You ain't gonna hear the next one.

303
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,949
Get on your knees, cross them legs,
knit them hands, come on.

304
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,079
Hold on.

305
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,708
Yo, what the fuck you doing?
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

306
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,836
Hey, give up that ring, man.

307
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,256
Come on.

308
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,384
Yeah.

309
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,765
Agh!

310
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,519
Payback.

311
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,230
That's right. Run, motherfuckers!

312
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,733
Shit!

313
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,084
I'm telling you, right there,
this horse is a winner. Look at it, OK?

314
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,627
How you doing?

315
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,962
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

316
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,630
Mr. Mayor.

317
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,049
On my way downtown today
I saw an abandoned car.

318
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,718
- Tow it right away.
- Where is...

319
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,053
Mr. Mayor, the location?

320
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,141
Oh, fucking Christ. Call Transpo!
Get the fucking trucks moving!

321
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,900
- Mr. Mayor.
- I got a constituent call.

322
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,402
She said the playground near her house
was a hazard.

323
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,155
- Rusted metal.
- We'll get right on it. The location?

324
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,574
Sir, I need a location.

325
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,369
Mr. Mayor, I understand your concern,
but you've got to understand,

326
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,413
we have more than 9, 100 hydrants.

327
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,998
And one of them's leaking.

328
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,668
Sensitivity counseling,

329
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,505
two weeks' extra duty,
no punishment past that.

330
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,341
They sliced it into the rough.

331
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,969
Does Daniels know the bind
this puts his boy Carcetti in?

332
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,056
Well, Wilson briefed Rawls,
Rawls briefed Daniels.

333
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,852
It's Carcetti doing Pontius Pilate,
putting it on Daniels,

334
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,022
who was a safe choice
as far as the rank and file goes.

335
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,900
But that won't be enough
for the ministers, not by a long shot.

336
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,117
Am I the only one that knows
how to play this game?

337
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,707
Let's go, get that hydrant sealed.

338
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,560
Man, give me a hand with that.

339
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,788
Three of them with shotguns
got me coming outside the club.

340
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,373
I made 'em for Bloods.

341
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,668
The paint's supposed to be
some kind of declaration of war.

342
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,879
- Sounds like we get to stomp some ass.
- The Western District way.

343
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,011
Yellow paint a declaration of war?

344
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,638
That's a new one.

345
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,564
So what I heard was that these wild-ass boys,

346
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,775
I ain't saying no names...but they past crazy.

347
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,943
They robbed him.

348
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,863
They threw paint on his ass, yellow paint.

349
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,198
Shit, I ain't lying.

350
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,450
Well, I don't know about that,

351
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,952
but you showed me something,
getting on that box like that.

352
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,120
That wasn't nothing.

353
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,788
No, don't sell yourself short.

354
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,499
Ms. Duquette, Mr. Parenti,
we all thought it took courage,

355
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,668
especially considering
how y'all do each other.

356
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,211
You think?

357
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,588
Yeah.

358
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,425
No, look, you're showing
a lot of progress in class.

359
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,970
You know that, don't you? You know,
you're doing the work. You're not acting out.

360
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,767
It's getting to the point where
you can go back to regular class, no problem.

361
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,478
- Back to genpop?
- Mm-hm.

362
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,481
- You want me to go?
- Well, if you're ready.

363
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,528
- I ain't going back there.
- Why not?

364
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,823
Shit they teach there be deadly.

365
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,868
But I know you know that, Bunny.

366
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,289
All right, all right! All right, all right!

367
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,374
We can squeeze a little money
from here and there

368
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,251
but nothing on the scale
for what you're asking.

369
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,631
Maybe free up some operating money
by shifting some of these PAYGO projects

370
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,174
into the capital program.

371
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,510
I can steal a little
from the budget stabilization fund,

372
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:54,265
but we still got to absorb 120 grant positions
in the police department, mostly officers.

373
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,392
Christ, don't let those go unfunded.

374
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,937
A lot of balls in the air,
and I still haven't seen the schools' budget.

375
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,649
- What about the revenue surplus?
- As I said, that's one-time money.

376
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,193
If I'm going to give the police a 5% raise,
that's forever.

377
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,905
If I'm going to ask the police department to
get up and fight I got to throw some money.

378
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,032
You're telling me how I can't do it,
not how I can.

379
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,202
There's the rainy day fund,
but you really shouldn't draw that down.

380
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,247
The bond rating houses want
at least 5% of the budget in reserve.

381
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,624
Feels like a rainy day to me.

382
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,501
Cloudy like a motherfucker.

383
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,255
Yo, yo, wait up, yo.

384
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,518
- Fuck is up with y'all?
- Ain't you Mike?

385
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,145
We wanna have a word with your boy here.

386
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,982
- Ain't nothing stopping you. Talk.
- You know what we mean.

387
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,861
- Yo, the little bitch was talking to the police.
- That's a lie. I ain't been doin' no snitching.

388
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,239
- The fuck you ain't.
- He look like he about to pee on hisself now.

389
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,409
You ain't gonna stand by
no rat motherfucker, is you?

390
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,545
Naw, I ain't standing with no rat.

391
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,561
These here be them 18-hour junks.
Go to bed, wake up, still be hot.

392
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,147
Man, I feel this one from three hours ago.

393
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,275
See what I'm saying? Two for one.

394
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,069
Each pack come with two pads.
Buy five, I give you six.

395
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,446
Gimme six then.

396
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,281
Five. Keep toasty.

397
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,617
Obliged, sir, obliged.

398
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,869
Take this side, I'll take this side.

399
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,540
Bubbles Depot.
Bubbles Depot got what you need.

400
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,792
Back on the scene. Come see me.

401
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,128
Oh, looky, looky... Hey, Sherrod!

402
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,589
Whoo-ooh.

403
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,009
What up? Car must've hit it or some shit.

404
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,305
- How much you think?
- Aluminum?

405
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,474
Aluminum about 30-40 cent a pound.

406
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,477
We've got a Benjamin here easy, baby.

407
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,898
Yeah.

408
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,317
- Teamwork payin' off today, ain't it?
- Yeah.

409
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,818
Go get the heavy side. Let me try it.

410
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,991
Get out of the way!

411
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,952
That's enough!

412
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:24,082
Get out of here! That's enough! Break it up!

413
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,168
Hey, Randy, you bitch.
We ain't even done with your snitchin' ass.

414
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,170
Come on, man.

415
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,173
Guess them books are good for something.

416
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,346
Somebody call the nurse.

417
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,807
Yo, why they bank me?

418
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,394
- I ain't no snitch.
- Randy, Randy, it's OK.

419
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,528
Thanks a lot.

420
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,535
Health Department shut
Chicken George again?

421
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,288
I had to duck in here for cover.
Your boys are off the hook today.

422
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,302
Not a good day to be
cross-eyed in West Baltimore.

423
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,762
What, y'all behind on your
quotas or some shit?

424
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,389
What the fuck?

425
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,267
Seems one of my side got jumped last night.

426
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:27,687
- Yeah, Walker. I heard about that shit.
- Threw paint on him.

427
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,402
Walker's an asshole.

428
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,406
Hey, you play in dirt, you get dirty.

429
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,743
7-Adam-14, do you copy?

430
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,078
Go ahead, KGA.

431
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,040
Report of a burglary, 19 North Monroe.

432
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,167
Copy.

433
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,463
We should do this again.

434
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,216
- Don't go making any furtive moves.
- No doubt.

435
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,052
Don't break a pencil point.

436
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,145
Mr. P, I swear I only told the police
what everybody know.

437
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,111
- Does that make me a snitch, Michael?
- Shouldn't oughta told nobody nothing.

438
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,240
But that don't make you a snitch,
not if you ain't put nobody in.

439
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,952
- Jesus. I should have stopped this.
- It ain't your fault, Mr. P.

440
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,997
All this come up because of what
Tiffany said happened in the bathroom.

441
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,166
What did you tell them, Randy?
What do they know?

442
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,544
I just told them about Lex going up
to the playground behind Fulton,

443
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:37,006
and how everybody said he got killed
and put in one of them boarded-up houses.

444
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,216
That's all you told them?

445
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,386
I mean, they wanted me
to say that I was there, but...

446
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,847
I just told them that Little Kevin told me.

447
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,808
- Little Kevin?
- He killed, too.

448
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,685
I mean, Marlo got him, too.
That's what everybody saying, anyway.

449
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,313
Marlo Stanfield?

450
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,651
I heard Kevin got locked up just last week,

451
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,403
now he's supposed to be up
in a house somewhere.

452
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,238
They put him in a vacant, too, huh?

453
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,951
OK, Randy, for now

454
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,869
I want to say Michael's right.

455
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:12,166
If anyone tries to talk to you again,
say nothing to anyone, understand?

456
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,876
Will that make it better?

457
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,216
So in sum, gentlemen, the gods have spoken.

458
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,136
No longer do we live and die by stats.

459
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,638
From this day forward
we are about quality arrests...

460
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,849
felonies, serious misdemeanors,

461
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,560
the back-to-basics police work
of our sainted fathers.

462
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,772
Still, the truth is it would be easier
to turn an oil tanker around in a puddle.

463
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,692
Our people were raised on stats.

464
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:41,195
If you can't bend patrol
to the mission, Eugene,

465
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,823
I'll damn sure find someone who can.

466
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,993
Gentlemen.

467
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,664
Sir.

468
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,713
Along the line of what you propose,
I'd like to reconstitute the Major Crimes Unit,

469
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,548
bring it under the umbrella of Homicide.

470
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,593
And let me guess,
you'd like to shake up the personnel.

471
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,052
Where appropriate.

472
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,056
Go for it, Colonel.

473
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:16,939
What?

474
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:21,194
Smart move, accepting any ideas
whatsoever come from the anointed fella.

475
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,238
Daniels. The next commissioner.

476
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,826
Any cocksucker that manages to go from
lieutenant to full bird

477
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,703
in a little more than a year

478
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,121
is getting groomed.

479
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,332
Wait.

480
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,375
You didn't for a minute think that...

481
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,047
Jesus, Bill, it's Baltimore.

482
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,508
You ain't one of the natives, are ya?

483
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,483
You see where they went?

484
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,278
El gordo and tall man,
they go in a big room, first floor.

485
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,073
- Sign outside say "New Day Coop."
- Coop?

486
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,954
- What's a coop?
- "New Day Coop." That's what it say.

487
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,290
Hey, yo, was there like a bar
between the two O's?

488
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,667
Sí.

489
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,293
Yeah, that's co-op.

490
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,712
Prop Joe in a co-op?

491
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,798
Joe go in with the man we robbed.

492
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,969
Remember, he fell down on his knees,
wept like a little baby.

493
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,555
Yeah, Fat Face Ricky. Anybody else?

494
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,390
Sí.

495
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,268
Eight or nine others I never see before,

496
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,436
but all the same to me, you know?

497
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,148
Prop Joe done sat down to the table.

498
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,611
Oh, do tell.

499
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,114
The worm done came full circle.

500
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,664
If that is what I think it is,
our little clutch of chickens

501
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,916
might be putting all their eggs
up in one basket.

502
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,418
Is good?

503
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,170
Muy bueno, babe.

504
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,760
I know one thing... I wouldn't walk around
with it on my neck for Walker to find.

505
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,178
He ain't gonna find it.

506
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,055
You crazy even taking a chance.

507
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,267
If he catch you with it, he gonna break more
than them fingers.

508
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,189
Man, what up with you?
It's like lately you gone all...

509
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,026
like taking off the mask, yo.

510
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,529
- What up with that? If Walker got a look...
- He didn't.

511
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,949
What about the thing with you and Randy?

512
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:35,661
Everybody is sayin' you threw down with him.
Busted up the boy Dimples, and them.

513
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,122
- Yo, you wouldn't have stood tall?
- That's not what I'm saying.

514
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,499
It's not that you do shit, it's how you do it.

515
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,711
Yo, look, I'm not trying to stand around

516
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,464
and let no chump-ass niggers
think I'm shook.

517
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,716
I ain't.

518
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,812
- And?
- And I want you to sign up.

519
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:11,280
Colonel, there's the matter of...

520
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,741
You find yourself incompatible
with a certain lieutenant?

521
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,079
Detective Freamon,
you have carte blanche in picking your squad.

522
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,540
In fact, you can pick your supervisor
for all I care.

523
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,344
Motherfucker, as far as I'm concerned,
you are the Major Crimes Unit.

524
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,139
It's morning in Baltimore, Lester.

525
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,433
Wake up and smell the coffee.

526
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,690
Reinforcements?

527
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,358
Carver.

528
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,777
Damn, boy, what brings you
back to the plantation?

529
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,821
I trusted you. Trusted Daniels.

530
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,614
My fucking mistake, huh?

531
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,242
- Hold up. What's wrong?
- The kid you were supposed to protect,

532
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,660
you put his name on the street.

533
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,746
They were beating him in front of the school
today, stomping on him for snitching.

534
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,748
- Jesus. He all right?
- It's always the same.

535
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,125
I should have fucking seen this coming.

536
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,712
I swear to you, I don't know what happened. I
hooked the kid into Bunk Moreland and Herc.

537
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,296
I can't believe...

538
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,924
- Where's the kid now?
- Home.

539
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,969
Let me go give this to the night commander.

540
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,013
- We'll park a plain-clothes unit on the house.
- You think that makes it better?

541
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,849
We'll be discreet, set up down
the block or some shit.

542
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,977
Come on inside. I swear to you
I'm gonna find out what happened.

543
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,393
- Ed Bowers.
- Pleasure to meet you.

544
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,478
You surprised us all.

545
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,480
- Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
- Thanks.

546
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,315
- I'd like to introduce you to Dorothy.
- Hi.

547
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,733
You heard about Ed Nully?

548
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,944
I've heard great things about
what you're doing, so keep it up.

549
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,113
- I'm delighted you made it, Mr. Mayor.
- Well, it's for a good cause, right?

550
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,825
I am getting the evil eye, however.
I gotta keep him circulating.

551
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,284
- OK. This way.
- Here we go.

552
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,994
- See you later.
- Take care.

553
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,392
The Washington crowd is driving
the local real estate market now,

554
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,854
and if the harbor promenade
could extend to the south branch...

555
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,313
- We're looking at that.
- Should be.

556
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,274
Everything from here
to Hanover Street is money.

557
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,151
- Mr. Mayor, play a little poker?
- I'm not very lucky.

558
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:37,653
Luck can change.

559
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,322
- Mr. Mayor, I'd like you to meet Ray Chandler.
- Pleasure to meet you.

560
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,231
Boy, either you gonna do it, or I'm gonna.

561
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,777
There's a reason the police
keep jumping out on you, Na'.

562
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,326
So, was it the Bunk's cologne, huh?

563
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,661
Oh...pussy.

564
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,164
I'm gonna miss you, too, bitch.

565
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,459
Lester do love listening to other people's
phone calls, don't you?

566
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,960
A bit of a pervert that way.

567
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:38,631
You could use a wiretap case or two,
broaden your horizons.

568
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:42,718
Oh, no, no. The Bunk is strictly
a suit-and-tie motherfucker.

569
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,347
At all hazards, a man
must keep up appearances.

570
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:49,808
Dignity, I say.
Dignity above all, Governor. Hear, hear!

571
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,437
- Bunk, you got a minute?
- What's up?

572
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:56,398
- The Wagstaff kid I sent your way.
- Wagstaff? He one of mine?

573
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,067
Yeah, you were looking for the boy Lex,

574
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:01,111
shot someone outside a nightclub
a couple or three months back.

575
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:04,740
This kid knew about Lex getting killed.
Herc brought him to you.

576
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,034
Herc?

577
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,913
This kid is a witness, and Herc
was supposed to bring him to me?

578
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,540
- That was the plan.
- I'm gonna skin that motherfucker.

579
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,338
Jesus, Herc. The fuck did you do?

580
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,549
Something happen to that boy?

581
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,763
- Well, young man, your wish has come true.
- So I can finally get out of here?

582
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,975
Yes, Monnel, paperwork was slow
coming in from North Avenue,

583
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,894
but you five are at the age
where we feel it's to your advantage

584
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,980
to join your peers in the ninth grade.

585
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,523
Yo, we in high school!

586
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,900
- When we bump?
- The end of this marking period.

587
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,236
Congratulations. You're excused.

588
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,491
Mr. Johnson,
you have a visitor in the front office.

589
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,285
Mr. Johnson, please come
down to the front office.

590
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,248
- Bad news?
- Plenty more to go around.

591
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,709
They pulled the pin on your program.

592
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,175
As I've been saying this week at every roll call
in every damn district,

593
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,469
if I could scrape together any more, I would.

594
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,431
But for starters,
it's a 5% salary year, and that's a given.

595
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,765
I know it's not half what you deserve,

596
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,852
but if the revenue estimates stay good,
I promise you'll be seeing more.

597
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,816
Mr. Mayor, my wife thanks you,

598
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,068
my children thank you, my dog thanks you.

599
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,447
Santy, how you able
to tell your wife from your mutt?

600
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,907
His wife, she's the one that's got the fleas.

601
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,327
Shit, Bobby, with your old lady,
fleas would be an improvement.

602
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,621
At ease. We got the mayor here, gentlemen.

603
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,790
When they sit in one place too long
they get a little feisty.

604
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,960
I'm not going to pretend
to know how to do your job.

605
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,880
I don't. But what I can tell you
is that during the past few weeks

606
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,049
I have spoken with many of your peers,

607
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,634
with your union reps,
with the representatives of the FOP,

608
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,803
and the biggest single complaint I'm hearing

609
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,139
concerns the department's
obsession with stats.

610
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,640
The fucking numbers game.

611
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,018
Well, under my watch
the numbers game is over.

612
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,729
You will no longer be under
the gun to meet monthly quotas

613
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,315
of ineffective, meaningless arrests
and citations.

614
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,983
Thank you.

615
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,570
Excuse me, Your Worship.
You're not the first person

616
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,363
who's stood at the podium making promises.

617
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,574
Jimmy, I'm sure the mayor
has some pressing business.

618
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,993
No, I'm just saying, the
first community activist who pitches a bitch

619
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,870
about the corner activity
in her neighborhood,

620
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,997
aren't we gonna go right back
to rounding up bodies?

621
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,750
Well, we need to educate our citizens
to the new approach.

622
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,335
They're not the only ones
who need educating.

623
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,754
We got bosses that wouldn't know
police work if it bit 'em in the ass.

624
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:28,133
They been juking stats for years, and they'll
do it again once the neighborhoods complain.

625
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,719
- It's all they know.
- Well, if the old dogs can't get the job done,

626
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,096
I'll find new ones who can.

627
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,644
Look, for years I sat on the back bench of
the council and watched our city deteriorate.

628
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,438
It was business as usual
with the same old ideas

629
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,065
producing the same old results.

630
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,567
Well, I'm here now, as you are,
and I'm asking you

631
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,861
to put aside your reservations
and give it a go.

632
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,659
All told.

633
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,539
- You did good.
- You got 'em pumped. They love you.

634
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:02,543
Of course, the wrong decision
on Sergeant Hauk, and who knows?

635
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,507
Carv said the kid had something on it.
I talked to him.

636
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,302
He had nothing, just a bunch of hearsay
and some shit about zombies.

637
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,014
The boy was to come to me. You know
the goddamn GO... it's Homicide's call.

638
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,142
You don't go putting your paws
in my murder, you simple fuck.

639
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,311
- Hey! You're talking to a sergeant.
- Oh, fuck your fucking stripes!

640
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,813
Take it easy, Bunk.

641
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,815
Now, Herc is trying to help us here.

642
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,525
Man, he messed in my murder, he pays.

643
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,861
Give him a chance.
We can work something out.

644
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,238
That's easy for you to say.
You ain't the primary on this.

645
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,574
Motherfucker...

646
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:41,290
- What got into him?
- He's emotional.

647
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,333
He's been working this case for a long time.

648
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:48,839
So the thing right now is for you to remember
everything you did on this case...

649
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,091
from the beginning.

650
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,563
He's out there, hat in hand...

651
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,148
literally.

652
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,941
Well, he can wait till hell freezes over.

653
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:13,322
A wise man does not burn his bridges
until he first knows he can part the waters.

654
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,491
- Old Ashanti saying.
- Norman, you grew up in Catonsville.

655
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:21,997
Show the motherfucker in.

656
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:36,094
Mr. Mayor, I don't want to take time
out of your busy schedule.

657
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,348
Look, if this is about me countermanding
your orders for more arrests...

658
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,976
No, sir. You should proceed
as you feel the situation warrants.

659
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,147
Overall, policing strategies
may not be my strongest suit.

660
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,441
I'm here about what I do know.

661
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:53,987
A recommendation from Sergeant Hauk's
commander will cross your desk tomorrow.

662
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:58,533
Colonel Daniels, with Rawls concurring,
recommends sensitivity training.

663
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,789
It may be a fair decision,
it may even be the right decision.

664
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:09,002
But we both know it won't fly with the
ministers, not even with Daniels behind it.

665
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,177
600 pages of rules,

666
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,512
regulations,

667
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,138
directives, orders.

668
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:29,731
You fire a white police for a bad car stop on
a black minister, you'll lose the rank and file.

669
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,358
It's not cause enough.

670
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:35,362
But if a commander can't find the grounds
for firing a saint in here...

671
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:40,617
The man has worked Narcotics for six years,

672
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,995
and in Narcotics...

673
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,913
there are no virgins.

674
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,041
And herein lies your expertize?

675
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,714
I've always been comfortable
delegating strategic elements.

676
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,716
It's what the Deputy Ops is for.

677
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:59,386
Me, I know what a mayor needs.

678
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,224
It was a Chevy Tahoe.

679
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,729
License Mike-460-654.

680
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,690
And I searched it good,
figuring I'd find some iron, but...

681
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,066
How'd they react?

682
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,277
Chris and Snoop? They didn't do shit.

683
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,945
Was there anything in the car?

684
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:21,783
Registration and crap in the glove box,
empty chicken boxes, trash.

685
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,494
They had one of those plastic milk crates...

686
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,955
in the back with some tools in it.

687
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,042
- What kind of tools?
- I don't know, carpenter tools.

688
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,086
- Did you check the crate for weapons?
- Nail gun.

689
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,089
- Nail gun?
- Yeah, one of them bitches that shoots nails.

690
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,593
- They rig it to shoot rounds maybe?
- Nah, I shot it. A nail came out.

691
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:46,058
- Lester, seriously, is any of this helping?
- You're doing good.

692
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,021
Tell me about jacking Marlo
at the train station.

693
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,118
- I'm short four, right?
- Yeah, I remember your ass.

694
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,537
Here's my four. You like that?

695
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,997
- OK!
- I'm gonna beat your ass.

696
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,916
OK, no more! Stop, stop. Take the money.

697
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,626
Take the money. Stop.

698
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:16,963
Make me work this hard again,
I'm gonna skin one of y'all!

699
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,340
OK.

700
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,716
Just go, man.

701
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,888
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

702
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,393
You know who got the fattest asses
and the best pussy?

703
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,019
- Who that?
- Midgets, nigger.

704
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,021
They're all that, you know what I'm saying?

705
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,567
The fuck happened to our boy on the door?

706
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,152
Siesta, Papa.

707
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,322
You fix this, Joe?

708
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,122
- What's the problem?
- Ran out of time.

709
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,083
Now, Joe, you've been so busy being devious,

710
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,252
you done messed around
and got yourself caught up in a web.

711
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,504
Omar, I don't know what
you been hearing, now...

712
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,131
Joe, ain't no time for no lies now.

713
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:03,176
Now see, I need you to be straight, just like
you did on that New Day Co-op sit down.

714
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:07,806
Oh, yeah, I know about that. I know you
the one got Marlo up in this mess too.

715
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,308
Hey, Omar, take a deep breath.

716
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:13,353
A proposition might fall kindly on your ear.

717
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,858
- Well, tickle my fancy, fat man.
- Money, drugs... your call.

718
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:21,736
- Come on, Joe, you can do better than that.
- Hey, we coming at this all wrong.

719
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,865
See, you the one with the high card.
You should speak your mind.

720
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,161
You going to serve up Marlo.

721
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,913
You gonna take out Marlo Stanfield?

722
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,418
No no, but I got a real powerful urge
to take everything he own,

723
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,713
and I'm quite confident
you the man can make that happen.

724
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,006
That might take some doing.

725
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,091
Naw, naw, see, we got to have it simple.

726
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,885
See, Omar like it simple.

727
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,304
So how we gonna do this, yo?

728
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:49,931
Huh?

729
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:53,810
My sister's boy. He do the drop.

730
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,813
We call you and give up the spot.

731
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,067
- That simple enough?
- That's what it is.

732
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,905
See now, Joe, I need you
to resist your natural inclination

733
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,699
to do anything twisted up
in this here play, you feel me?

734
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:10,368
I even catch a whiff of you
doing something foul, Joe,

735
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:14,873
I mean, I might got to go tell Marlo
you the one put me up on that card game.

736
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,543
We understood?

737
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,088
Now go ahead and write my ticket
so I can tip on out.

738
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,800
Come on now.

739
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:37,562
Gentlemen.

740
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,616
I'll see to Tremaine.

741
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,369
- You can't be serious.
- Was you listening?

742
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,747
Omar to one side holding a spade,

743
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,375
and maybe Marlo to the other with a shovel.

744
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,378
And just at this moment,

745
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:04,130
I managed to crawl out my own damn grave.

746
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,884
No way do I crawl back in.

747
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,305
What the fuck was you doing out here, man?

748
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,598
You trust him?

749
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,476
- I trust his fear.
- Now we go?

750
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,312
Not till I teach Prop Joe
a thing or two about devious.

751
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,149
We on him now.

752
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,906
Sorry, guys, that's all I got to say.
Talk to the mom.

753
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,617
I hear you, but we just came
from his foster mother's house,

754
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,328
and she said it was you
that told him not to talk.

755
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,498
- She said you told her to get a lawyer.
- That's right.

756
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,419
All right, look, something got messed up.

757
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:46,006
We know that, but whatever else happened,
we got a murder here.

758
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,675
Even if it's off the record, it would help us
just to talk to the boy.

759
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:52,345
If you understand what happened here,
you know I'm not gonna do that.

760
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:57,934
If you go at it like that, then you end up
siding with the motherfuckers doing the dirt.

761
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,854
No, I'm siding with my kids.

762
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,568
You're right. You're right.

763
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,822
For you, the kids come first.

764
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,783
We'll find another road.

765
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,082
Well, glad this is working out for you.

766
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,545
Oh, man, you two...

767
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,089
makin' me all weepy and shit.

768
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,135
- Be safe, guys.
- All right.

769
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,179
Hey, Roland, man,

770
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:38,808
you know, I hate coming all this way
and not getting a little something...

771
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,187
you know, for old times' sake?

772
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:51,738
The playground behind
Fulton and Monroe, unit block.

773
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,492
He told this fella Lex to meet a girl there.

774
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,039
That's all he did.

775
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,263
What's up, shorty? Can you give me three?

776
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:25,480
Bitch, get the fuck across the street
and plant your ass on a stoop.

777
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:27,273
Kenard!

778
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,985
Yo, how you think I'd look
with no tail on my head?

779
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,030
- Do I look like a faggy?
- Yo, Na'.

780
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,666
Yo, Mrs. Lee, you looking for Michael?

781
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,794
Namond, I don't want to be no trouble to you,

782
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,715
but I got this friend who been ailing,
you know, and she gave me $6.

783
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,300
So I was hoping you could, you know...

784
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,015
Yeah, we cover her. Go see my man.

785
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:06,062
- The fuck you do that for?
- It's Michael's moms, yo.

786
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:09,107
- Shit, she a fucking dope fiend.
- Namond said I could.

787
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,151
- Na'?
- Naw, it's cool.

788
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,986
Gimme a Yellow Bird.

789
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,155
All right, but you ain't got to be all up on me.

790
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,032
I know, I know! I'm late, you know?

791
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:21,745
Sometimes it's just too much
damn fun being in charge.

792
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,464
- Where you been, boss?
- Announcing my presence with authority.

793
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,591
Sorry I'm late. Please sit down. Sit.

794
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,679
- Sir, we scarfed up 52 vehicles.
- Good. But you missed my car.

795
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:45,894
We have new equipment at school 45,
school 52, and school 58 installed.

796
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:49,189
Well, I got no calls on those,
but keep at it. You'll get there, I'm sure.

797
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,859
Mr. Mayor, all hydrants are fully capped
as of today,

798
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,737
and Solid Waste has pulled 32 tons of trash
from the alleys,

799
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:58,782
- and, sir, that's a single-day record.
- That's what I want to hear.

800
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:01,451
Thank you, gentlemen,
and keep up the good work.

801
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,749
Finance, of course, doesn't deal with
the dirt-under-the-nails tangibles,

802
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,543
unless you consider the money
itself to be dirty.

803
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,380
- So what's on your agenda today?
- The school audit.

804
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:15,548
Well, how bad could that be?

805
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,176
The system is running a $54 million deficit.

806
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,388
54 million?

807
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,723
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

808
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,560
Jesus Christ. Did Royce know this?

809
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,438
How the fuck do we deal with that?

810
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,566
Frankly, I'm not sure just yet.

811
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:43,576
Our attendance is excellent,
and as to suspensions, we don't have any.

812
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,955
We intervene immediately, and
we show success in stabilizing behavior.

813
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,708
And good we're doing for classes these kids
were wrecking before the program.

814
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:54,754
In January, we could expand to four classes,
cover the whole eighth grade.

815
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,757
Any complaints about the tracking,
anything from the parents?

816
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,885
Not a one. This isn't a group where we see
a lot of parental intervention.

817
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,264
- What about test scores?
- I can't speak to the program itself,

818
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,307
but it has to help the rest of the eighth grade.

819
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,184
Next week will tell.

820
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:16,192
Right now the system
is under a lot of scrutiny.

821
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:20,071
We have certain fiscal issues
that are of great concern

822
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,447
to the new administration,

823
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:25,952
and what you're proposing here
is a radical shift in curricula.

824
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,914
- Meaning?
- If City Hall were to sign off on this,

825
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,124
we could go forward,

826
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:36,087
but now is not the time to rock any boats.

827
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,142
Hear that? That's my joint right there.

828
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,733
So you all got your work up to date, right?

829
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,568
Yeah, yeah.

830
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,945
I heard you took care
of your puppy's problems.

831
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,449
Oh, he most definitely made
that go away, you hear me?

832
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,784
It's all good.

833
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,578
You know, some of
the young 'uns been saying

834
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,080
your pup stood tall with a snitchin' boy.

835
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,209
- Michael?
- Yeah, that's what they saying.

836
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:18,713
Yeah.

837
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,933
Lester, you really starting to scare me, man.

838
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,139
- Need a crowbar.
- For what?

839
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,225
This is a tomb.

840
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,436
Lex is in there.

841
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,308
Fuck me.
