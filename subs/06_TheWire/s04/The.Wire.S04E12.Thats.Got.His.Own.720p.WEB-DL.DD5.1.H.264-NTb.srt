1
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,291
Oh, man!

2
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,361
Fuck.

3
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,879
Fuck.

4
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,901
- What's next?
- One to the head. I keep it quick.

5
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,570
Not yet, motherfucker.

6
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,157
You shoot live rounds like paint,

7
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,660
boy, you'll be the shit, you hear?

8
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,830
These really do look like Glocks.

9
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,416
They make them look that way.
Yo, why you shoot low?

10
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,879
All right, if you're close, aim for the head.

11
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:55,258
If not, think vest. That's the way you said it.

12
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,844
A'ight. Boy's learning.

13
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,939
When you walk through the garden

14
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,149
Watch your back

15
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,194
Well I beg your pardon

16
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,780
Walk the straight and narrow track

17
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,033
If you walk with Jesus

18
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,535
He'll save your soul

19
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,165
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

20
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,710
He's got fire and the fury

21
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,462
At his command

22
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,507
Well, you don't got to worry

23
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,968
Hold on to Jesus' hand

24
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,721
We'll be safe from Satan

25
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,390
When the thunder rolls

26
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,560
But you gotta keep the devil

27
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,312
Down in the hole

28
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,402
Oh yeah, mm

29
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,909
We'll be safe from Satan

30
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,998
Gotta keep the devil

31
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,167
Down in the hole

32
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,504
- Keep him in the hole
- In the hole

33
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,382
- Down in the hole
- Down in the hole

34
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,968
- Keep him in the hole
- Keep him in the...

35
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,638
- Down in the hole
- Down in the hole

36
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,265
- Keep him in the hole
- Keep him in the...

37
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,184
- Down in the hole
- Down in the hole

38
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,182
- You going inside this one?
- I'll do the whole block.

39
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,894
It's bad enough you popped the top off
one house and gave us a body.

40
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,313
What the fuck do you think you're doing now?

41
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,565
- An experiment.
- An experiment?

42
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,276
Fuck me.

43
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,988
I'm dealing with Madam Curie here.

44
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,074
This nail here comes from a nail gun,

45
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,910
and from the house with a dead man inside.

46
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,539
Every other house has screws that HCD uses.

47
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:35,251
We find these in the plywood
anywhere in this city,

48
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,836
and there's a body inside.

49
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,548
Gosh, that's good work.

50
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,134
No, I'm very impressed.

51
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,513
Do you see a tool belt on me?

52
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,308
Do I look like those fucking jerkoffs
in the Home fuckin' Depot?

53
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,811
There's three weeks left in the year,

54
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,480
and our unit clearance rate is under 50%.

55
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:02,987
We do not go looking for bodies,
especially moldering fucking John Does.

56
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,197
We do not put red up
on the board voluntarily.

57
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:09,994
Jay, the bodies are in the houses,
Marlo Stanfield's bodies.

58
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,038
Then they belong to him.

59
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,291
Now I realize you're no longer
in my squad, Mr. Major Crimes,

60
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,543
but you're still part of CID, right?

61
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,920
And look, I'm still a sergeant, right?

62
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,673
And I'm giving you an order on this, Lester.

63
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,259
Until I feel chain-of-command down on this

64
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:30,056
and until you hear otherwise,
you will not, I repeat not,

65
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,809
pull down any more...fucking wood!

66
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,822
Let it go, man.

67
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,243
I expect a shortfall when I look at
the school budget. It's a natural.

68
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,413
But how in Christ's name
do you lose $54 million?

69
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,790
One million at a time.

70
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,418
It didn't happen this morning.
This was on Royce's watch.

71
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:03,464
You didn't get a whiff of this
during council review?

72
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,092
You can't blame the council or Royce.

73
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,719
The responsibility is with the school board.

74
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,763
But the council has oversight.

75
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,556
Don't even pretend to put this shit on me.

76
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:17,186
Only the city share shows up on our
budget review. We never see state money.

77
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,439
Tell your pretty new chief of staff
that what happens on North Avenue

78
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,191
is on the school system.

79
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,945
- That's a simplistic view.
- How would you complicate it?

80
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,156
I'll argue this is a bookkeeping issue.

81
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,617
We've been rolling the debt over since '99.

82
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,121
You rolled it and rolled it
until it ran out of cash.

83
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,831
That's not bookkeeping, that's stupidity.

84
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,667
Are we talking about waste?

85
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,544
Fraud? Embezzlement?

86
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,756
Although the system
has some poor accounting practices,

87
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,009
in the end we'll find that most of the money

88
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,178
was properly spent on programing.

89
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,556
OK. We get it.

90
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,600
No one's responsible, not the school board,

91
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,813
not North Avenue, not Royce,
not the city council, no one at this table.

92
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,274
Fine. So what's our next move?

93
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,403
Bump the property tax rate?

94
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,072
Scale back our budget.

95
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,867
No pay hikes, hiring freezes,
reduce services,

96
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,578
tell everyone, schools,
police, fire, public works,

97
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,746
they have to hold the line.

98
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:22,835
How? I just ran
a "Clean up the streets" campaign.

99
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,714
I just got done promising the world
to every cop in the city.

100
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,591
Annapolis.

101
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,676
You go beg his Republican ass.

102
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,568
The Cheese stands alone.

103
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,445
This the drop?

104
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,616
I hope not, 'cause they ain't called yet.

105
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,661
Make me feel bad toward old Prop Joe.

106
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,626
Go around where we can see y'all.

107
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,669
Vámonos, Renaldo.

108
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,647
Nice hookup. Private.

109
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:32,488
Damn, y'all some Semper Fi motherfuckers?

110
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,865
Where Cheese go to enlist?

111
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,378
That's 25 back to Joe
from what we was short,

112
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,256
and another 150 to up our order to six.

113
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,007
Whoa, we had you down for four.

114
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,426
I don't know if we got extras coming.

115
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,180
- Short someone else then.
- I'll see what Joe says.

116
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,685
Yeah.

117
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,233
When we set with the re-up,
we'll hit you on that.

118
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,277
The shit will be where you told us.

119
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,196
- Yo, we ain't using these no more.
- Us neither.

120
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,156
We ring you from a 958 exchange,

121
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,284
East Side, don't need to answer.

122
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,370
Just toss it, go to the meet.

123
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,789
See you when I see you.

124
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,711
Money on the table, her-oine to follow.

125
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,423
- Stay here on Marlo?
- Nah, we gonna stay with Cheese.

126
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,734
Detective, would you get the door for me?

127
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,338
Sometimes life just
gives you a moment, huh?

128
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,007
He was gonna do me,
and instead he gets done?

129
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,761
I'm dipped in shit here.
I'm the luckiest motherfucker you know.

130
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,056
Gentlemen, the target is still Mr. Stanfield,

131
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,268
and we're no closer to him
than when I left here two months ago.

132
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,146
Now they might not let me go after murders,

133
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,441
but they cannot stop me
from chasing the drugs.

134
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,445
Leander, I want you
to see if they're still on cellphones.

135
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,405
How are you with the paper trail?

136
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,327
- OK.
- I want you pulling paper

137
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,413
on all the purchases
on the West Side over 100,000.

138
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,251
Then get down to MVA and check luxury cars
in his name, all right?

139
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,545
This boy has been in the game for a while.

140
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,589
He might try to launder money.

141
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,718
Herc, I want you on the paperwork
re-requisitioning the wiretap equipment

142
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,137
that Marimow shipped to ISD.

143
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,974
We're gonna need all of that
to get back up, OK?

144
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:10,646
If anyone needs me,
I'm down at Missing Persons, all right?

145
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,564
Let's go.

146
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,276
- Lester?
- Yes?

147
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,778
All this is cool...

148
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,615
..but can we do it
so that the direction comes from me?

149
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,617
I mean, I am the sergeant here.

150
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,048
Donut, you think this look right?

151
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,176
Why you knock 'em down?

152
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,303
So the police won't scope me so easy.

153
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,014
But now all they gotta do is be like,
"Yeah, go over there

154
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,267
"and grab that little nigger with the braids."

155
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,688
Damn, you later than a motherfucker.

156
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,690
Been sittin' here watching money walk away.

157
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,859
You about to have the day off.

158
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,494
- Package was stolen, Na'.
- What?

159
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,706
- Out of your basement?
- They kicked my motherfucking door in.

160
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,545
How the police know
where you even be keeping your stash at?

161
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,131
Some snitch-ass bitch, that's how.

162
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,216
I'm-a find his ass too.

163
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,888
All right, man, I'm out.

164
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,480
I never understood
why you stopped eating pig.

165
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:38,066
I ain't been in a Polack Johnny's since 1974,

166
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,027
and if you knew what was good for you...

167
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,695
I know what's good.

168
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,866
I remember when you did.
I never saw you going all Muslim on me.

169
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,370
I believe that other faiths
have the pig figured better than us AMEs.

170
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:54,124
If you checking out, I might feel the need
to say a few words.

171
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:58,337
I ain't got nothing to do with that.
I love my PJs but they do repeat on me.

172
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:03,592
You got to go with the original sauce,
not the kraut and chili like you do.

173
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,054
My pain ain't about no sauerkraut.

174
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:14,853
They wants to clip any program
that ain't tied to the statewide tests.

175
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,898
Thing is, we're just starting
to make a little headway.

176
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,358
You take it upstairs?

177
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,944
Me and the professor took it
to the superintendent.

178
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,363
- And?
- You read the papers?

179
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,534
They got $50 million in the hole,

180
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,953
and they're scared to take any problems
to the new mayor.

181
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,873
- Is your thing a problem?
- A cover-your-ass person might say

182
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,709
we're just dragging in students
who can't hack regular classes,

183
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,837
getting 'em work to dose you up
on those statewide tests.

184
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,467
If City Hall say it's OK, we keep it,
if not, we on the street.

185
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,887
Odell Watkins.

186
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,515
I was hoping you'd say that name.

187
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,519
Yeah, he got Carcetti's ear.

188
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,313
If we sell him, maybe we sell the Hall.

189
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,413
- Stalk the nigger that stole your shit.
- Yeah.

190
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,291
Soon as he nod out, bust him in the head
with a brick or some shit.

191
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,294
Nah. That ain't me.

192
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,839
You can always give him a hotshot.
Y'all recall Junior Bunk?

193
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,259
Cutting his shit with, what d'you call it?
Stole it from the funeral home.

194
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,262
- You thinking formaldehyde.
- That's the shit.

195
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,766
Niggers got a taste for that shit,
university started a "Junior Bunk" ward.

196
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,270
My cousin laid his ignorant ass up there
three times.

197
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,897
- Ain't no guaranteein' that.
- Use some rat poison.

198
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,567
No, that stuff don't cook up right.

199
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,944
What you need to use is that sodium cyanide.

200
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,323
That shit looks and cooks
just like the real thing.

201
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:53,327
- Where I find that?
- Try Minter's over there by the tracks,

202
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,120
or a metal shop where they do plating.

203
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,289
- How much I need?
- It ain't gonna take much.

204
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,584
A vial of that shit'd kill every horse here.

205
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,295
- That's all there is to it?
- It ain't no thing to kill a nigger

206
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,298
who's already about the business
of killing himself.

207
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,635
And the police, they ain't gonna pay no mind.

208
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,887
You the one got to live with it.

209
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,314
More young males
than I'd have thought.

210
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,903
I don't suppose they all went off
in search of adventure.

211
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,405
You get a chance to do
any street work on these files?

212
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,910
Shit, no. They cut Missing Persons
to one detective five years ago.

213
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,204
I barely keep up with the paperwork.

214
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,832
Feel free.

215
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:45,295
Just make copies and return
the originals for the files.

216
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,423
For the files... Right.

217
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,136
Damn, son.

218
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,930
Kenard said the police took it?

219
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,140
He said they kicked his door in.

220
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,728
And they ain't locked no one up?

221
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,939
Yo, you see that door?

222
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,568
Were the hinges broke?

223
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,780
I mean, if he said they put the boot to it...

224
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,200
them hinges gotta be hanging free.

225
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,077
I sweated him, yo.

226
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,579
He wasn't trying to scheme me.

227
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:25,168
That little motherfucker
took that shit for himself. Bet it.

228
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,630
And now you gotta step to him,

229
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,425
put something real behind them words.

230
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,220
Where your Spanish boy at?

231
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,014
He's with Cheese while I round up soldiers.

232
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,058
You got soldiers right here.

233
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,644
Your 2255 must have pleased some judge.

234
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,563
Enough to get me home, didn't it?

235
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,321
I know they soldiers
but I'm thinking about being more subtle.

236
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,073
They don't see me coming.

237
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,368
It ain't like you to work with strangers.

238
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:02,372
I'm celebrating diversity. I'm thinking
now the time to start doing that.

239
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,458
Oh-ho!

240
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,128
- What up, shorty?
- What's up, baby?

241
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,671
Mmm.

242
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,174
- You looking good.
- I'm maintaining.

243
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,884
- That's right.
- You all right?

244
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,218
Yeah.

245
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,014
Long time, long time.

246
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,142
I got your word.
Some real money to be made, huh?

247
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,019
You remember how to do this?

248
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,605
I reckon it'll come back to me.

249
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,609
See that's what
I'm talking about, Butch. Subtle.

250
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,992
Glasses first, so they don't spot.

251
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,827
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,212
- Hello.
- Mr. Prezbo.

253
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,339
- Come in, please.
- That's OK.

254
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:57,219
I just wanted to stop by on my way home
and drop off Randy's work for next week.

255
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,847
Hopefully this thing will be over soon.

256
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,850
Maybe so, but we're looking at the possibility

257
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,228
of moving him to Booker T. Washington.

258
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,104
I hope that isn't necessary.

259
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,233
I hope so too. Thanks for bringing this.

260
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,068
I'll try to keep him up to speed.

261
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,821
- Hang in there, kiddo.
- Thanks.

262
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,479
Long conference call.

263
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,566
About an hour so far by my watch.

264
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,735
Got me out here riding the wood.

265
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,823
The governor's phone call
has gone longer than anticipated.

266
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,952
- Can I get you anything? Coffee?
- Look, I have other appointments.

267
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,787
It shouldn't be much longer.

268
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,336
Check out Fisher's column in Metro.

269
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,256
He says, the governor thinks, quote,

270
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,885
"This latest fiscal emergency
calls into question

271
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,305
"the Baltimore school system's
ability to manage itself

272
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,725
"as well as the local oversight of the system,"

273
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,893
unquote.

274
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,479
Motherfucker.

275
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,189
He's playing to the DC suburbs.

276
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,067
He sees you coming for him
two years from now.

277
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,111
He ain't no fool.

278
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,243
- There's all your electronic requisitions.
- Mm-hm.

279
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,664
What one's that, a cop?

280
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,833
Nah, security guard.

281
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,044
I don't think he's one of Marlo's, though.

282
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,672
Lieutenant.

283
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,508
Will someone explain
what the fuck the brass is doing?

284
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,346
First I get bounced to
telephone reporting, then I get a call...

285
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,015
- How's that beach house?
- Almost done. I just...

286
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:11,519
That's great, just great.
Welcome. Welcome back.

287
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,488
Who the fuck is that?

288
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:27,160
That, Sergeant Hauk,
is one of the most effective supervisors

289
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,870
in our police department.

290
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,711
Sorry. It's just taking a little longer
than we expected.

291
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,297
It shouldn't be much longer, though.

292
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,801
I understand what you're saying.

293
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,388
Some of them are ready for high school
but not Duquan.

294
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,641
- I've...
- Adopted him?

295
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,434
I've noticed Duquan this semester.

296
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,813
He's more nourished, wears fresher clothes.

297
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,065
Sometimes he even smells like soap.

298
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,194
You and your wife,
you don't have children, do you?

299
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,655
- Not yet, no.
- Well, have some.

300
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:08,076
They're yours for life.
The kids in this school aren't yours.

301
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,787
You do your piece with them,
and you let them go.

302
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,041
Because there'll be plenty more
coming up behind Duquan,

303
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,128
and they're gonna need your help too.

304
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,591
You've got your third period
in five minutes, right?

305
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,184
Settle down.
We need to concentrate on these tests.

306
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,394
Fuck this.

307
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,023
"If Jane's father gives Jane
one week's worth of allowance..."

308
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,026
Shit, I ain't got no allowance where I stay at.

309
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,029
- No father, neither.
- How many sides a sexagon got?

310
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,196
Why I care about that?

311
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,490
You take the test so you can move on.

312
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,743
I ain't moving nowhere
but out this motherfucker.

313
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:55,665
All right. Let's settle down.
Let's start with question number one.

314
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,500
Settle down!

315
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,798
All right, listen up.

316
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,761
Here's the problem.
Two couples go into a restaurant...

317
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,638
When they say "couples"
do they mean they married?

318
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,808
- Why they got to be married?
- Mr. Prezbo, why you get married?

319
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:18,730
Well, to build a life together, for one.
You know, family.

320
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,067
- Also to have intimacy.
- What do that mean?

321
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:26,821
- Mean, like, getting some.
- No. It's not just that.

322
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,743
Intimacy can be a quiet conversation.

323
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,580
Or it can be fun, you know?
Like when you tickle your partner.

324
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,248
Yo, tickle my nuts.

325
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:45,632
All right, no more of that.

326
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,426
- Come on, let's get to the test material.
- Oh!

327
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,678
The statewide exam is next week.

328
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,348
Then we'll get back to regular lessons.

329
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,933
Can we talk about intimacy?

330
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,770
If you like, and if I don't get too embarrassed.

331
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,775
All right...so, the grand total on the check

332
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,695
is $67.40, but if they want to leave a tip...

333
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,200
Look at your sample test, please.

334
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,619
Ms. Duquette, it feel like y'all schemed us.

335
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,788
This class is the same
as the ones down the hall.

336
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,414
'Cause the test's coming up.

337
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,793
Let's look at the sample math test.
In sample "A"...

338
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,337
Kid's right. This is bullshit.

339
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:29,259
- The test doesn't speak to their world.
- Don't speak too loud to mine, either.

340
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,845
An estimate, Detective.

341
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:36,349
We start opening those houses, we might
turn over a couple of dozen bodies,

342
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,352
- but that's just me guessing.
- All homicides?

343
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,813
The boy took over half the West Side.

344
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,232
We never saw the violence.

345
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,401
This right here is the reason why.

346
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,612
You're asking us to call out
half of Public Works,

347
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,115
pull the plywood off thousands
of vacant houses

348
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,701
all so we can raise
the city's murder rate by ten percent?

349
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,036
What else are we doing on Stanfield?

350
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,915
I'm trying to get back up on
his people's cellphones as fast as I can.

351
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,251
And I started to look for his money.

352
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,754
But if I'm right about this,
they have to be worked.

353
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,175
Is there any evidence to link
these missing persons reports

354
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,010
to the Stanfield organization?

355
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,428
I'm starting on that.

356
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,098
The one body that we
pulled out of the Fulton Avenue house is Lex.

357
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,559
His case is a direct tie.

358
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,187
And there are two other names on the reports

359
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,939
that show up
in our wiretaps from earlier this year.

360
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,942
So, yes, there are links, Counselor.

361
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,446
By any chance, did Landsman
run this up the chain to you guys?

362
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,864
No.

363
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,867
Your call.

364
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,246
My office won't care until they see case files.

365
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:52,342
I'll run it upstairs and we'll see what comes.

366
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,266
- I get it.
- He's still tied up,

367
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,561
but it really should only be
a little while longer.

368
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,064
Tell the governor
I have to go back to Baltimore.

369
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,900
I have a little bit of business today.

370
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:14,489
I'm the mayor of a major city.
How much shit do I have to eat from this guy?

371
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,493
- Wouldn't you play the politics too?
- It's not like the state had no role.

372
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,120
The state money for those schools
had no oversight.

373
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,915
But I'm not telling
The Washington fucking Post

374
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:28,044
how he might be forced to bail me out
because... what was the quote again?

375
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,007
Because "Those are my children
in Baltimore too."

376
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,469
He's gonna bleed me for that money.

377
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:41,641
Mayor Carcetti? The governor's office
says he's ready to see you now.

378
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,519
54 million's a big number.

379
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:51,025
We won't go until we get some...

380
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,315
Did I do something wrong?

381
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,734
I ain't acted up or nothing.

382
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,322
You're ready for this.

383
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,657
You can do the work.

384
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,367
I know you can.

385
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:46,205
And if you need to come back here

386
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,084
and use the showers or give me laundry,

387
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,588
use the computer, you can do that any time.

388
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,342
Anyway, let me show you.

389
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,094
This here the way to the hard drive.

390
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:05,350
This isn't necessary, Duquan.

391
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,019
Just in case I'm busy, Mr. P.

392
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,772
So you know how to work it.

393
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,678
Hey, boy. What's up?

394
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,683
Big day for you. See here?
I got the inventory divided between us.

395
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,187
You gonna go up one way
toward North Avenue...

396
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,147
and I'm gonna stay down by the highway.

397
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,274
You gonna let me handle the money?

398
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,570
- You ready, ain't you?
- Yeah, I'm good.

399
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,782
All right. Let's get on it.

400
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,786
- I'll see you back here tonight.
- A'ight.

401
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,416
You see that foul motherfucker,
you let him have his money, OK?

402
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,543
- I don't need you messin' with him.
- A'ight.

403
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,586
All right.

404
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,172
Make sure that count's right!

405
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,261
Yo, I need to talk to the little motherfucker.

406
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,722
Maybe you can do that with me,
see it don't get out of hand.

407
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,307
Hey! Yo, Mike!

408
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,853
Yo, what up, Duke?

409
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,607
I heard Randy foster ma
gonna take him out of Tilghman too.

410
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,734
Send him somewhere else.

411
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,236
That's messed up, man.

412
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,781
All right, holler, man.

413
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,036
How many?

414
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,291
Detective Freamon believes there could
be additional bodies in the vacants,

415
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,793
- maybe a dozen or more.
- He believes?

416
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,630
Lester Freamon is not in the habit
of selling wolf tickets.

417
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,466
I for one would not bet against him.

418
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,052
And what do you suggest
I do with this information?

419
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,848
My feeling is that City Hall
should be brought into the loop.

420
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:14,312
We pull the bodies now and the stats
go to Royce's last year in office.

421
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,982
It gives Carcetti an advantage
with next year's crime rate.

422
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,777
- You mean...
- Tell the mayor to do it now

423
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,072
not next year, when it's on his watch
and he has to eat the stats.

424
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:33,915
Colonel, I see you've thought
this through, politically, I mean.

425
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,084
- I'm learning as I go.
- I bet you fuckin' are.

426
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,339
Colonel, keep this conversation close.

427
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,257
That's a direct order.

428
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:48,179
You seen them girls at Douglass, man?

429
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,350
Yo, you right, Duke.
Ain't gonna be like middle school no more.

430
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,435
You know, I'm just thinking, yo.

431
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,941
Dag, man, not again.

432
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,322
Where your people at now?

433
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,874
Need any of your stuff from the pile?

434
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,626
It ain't no thing.

435
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:26,259
Yo, man, listen. Me and Bug
got our own spot now,

436
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,094
so you could come crib with us if you want.

437
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:41,566
What you mean,
Kenard took the stash?

438
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,568
And he still walking around?

439
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,571
I'm gonna talk to him,
make sure this never happen again.

440
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,947
Look at me, boy.

441
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:52,618
Kenard got to feel some pain
for what he did. He got to.

442
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,121
- I don't...
- You don't what, motherfucker?

443
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,541
This how you pay me back
for all the love I show?

444
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,295
Shit, I been kept you in Nikes
since you were in diapers.

445
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,463
- I'm trying.
- You trying, huh?

446
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,091
That's what you gonna tell your father
the next time you see him?

447
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,718
That you tryin'?

448
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,513
- Or you gonna tell him what you've done?
- What he done got him locked up...

449
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,561
That's right.
Wee-Bey walked in Jessup a man,

450
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,271
and he gonna walk out one.

451
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,858
But you out here, wearing his name,
acting a bitch!

452
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,278
Look at you, crying now.

453
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,201
Fuck you think you going?

454
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,580
Get your ass back here.
I ain't done talking to you.

455
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:47,965
I'm police, right?
Murder police, and I got bodies.

456
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,009
I'm just supposed to let them lie?

457
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,887
"We don't throw red up
on that board voluntarily."

458
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:56,974
That John-Goodman-off-his-diet-looking
motherfucker was clear on that.

459
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,853
- So go over Landsman's head.
- Jimmy, that's you.

460
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:05,399
Send an anonymous fax.
But Lester here don't fancy boats.

461
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,402
And I get sick just filling the bathtub.

462
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,363
- It's just wrong.
- Yeah.

463
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,699
Just like J-Lo with that little
itty-bitty Spanish dude.

464
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,702
Genius. He hid his mausoleum
in the neighborhood.

465
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,288
How little Pedro gonna fill that big thing?

466
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:23,292
Man, that girl got a prime cut of ass, boy.

467
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,336
- A good heart.
- A good inverted heart.

468
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,463
This nail's like their signature.

469
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,881
Find it in any door in the West Side,

470
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,133
and right as rain, you're gonna find a body.

471
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:35,304
Yes, sir. I'm proud to be
chasing Mr. Marlo Stanfield.

472
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:40,059
You act like you on the trail
of Pol Pot or some shit.

473
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,729
- Who?
- Motherfucker, I got $10 says

474
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,606
we can leave here right now,

475
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,777
go to any boarded-up house
with a nail like that in the door,

476
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,029
and we will find a body.

477
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,699
- Make it 20.
- There you go.

478
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,159
First let's have another little taste. Jimmy?

479
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,453
- No, I'm good.
- Come on, man.

480
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,206
Take that skirt off and have a drink.

481
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,958
Drink that.

482
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,752
Man, don't play like that.

483
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,713
Oh.

484
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,882
Icicles, get 'em before they melt!

485
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,801
Icicles!

486
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,895
Icicles, come get 'em!

487
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:33,154
- Yo, Kenard, why you lie to me?
- Fuck you talkin' about?

488
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:37,199
You said the police kicked your door in.
I seen the door. They ain't kicked shit in.

489
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,201
- How you gonna lie?
- Go on, man.

490
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,496
- Where the package at, man?
- Package up my ass.

491
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,206
- I'm about to...
- About to?

492
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,877
Go on, walk, gump-ass motherfucker.

493
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:55,176
Look at that little dude
getting his ass beat!

494
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,599
Y'all was talking too goddamn much.
Go ahead, Na'.

495
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,977
Get your pack off this bitch so we can go.

496
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,605
I don't want it.

497
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,525
I don't want it.

498
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,160
I'll take that 20 now, Bunk.

499
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,788
I can't see shit in here.

500
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:30,294
Man. I might pull out my wallet, reach in,
and pull out a 25 by mistake.

501
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,922
I need me some Braille bills, something.

502
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,103
Hm.

503
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:52,107
- You want to call the Crime Lab?
- No, man.

504
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,820
I'm like Stevie, too high.
You know I can't do no scene.

505
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,656
There's not gonna be one
on account of there is no body,

506
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,783
not until the bosses say there is.

507
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,159
And when that happens,

508
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:06,163
- you gonna miss all the fun, junior.
- Daniels is gonna keep this alive.

509
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,875
The white shirts will fuck it up somehow,
you know it, Lester.

510
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,505
Maybe not, this time. Daniels is CID.
It's a new day downtown.

511
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,090
I got it.

512
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,677
Ooh. World is on its hole
when Jimmy McNulty

513
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,846
is the most qualified to drive.

514
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,350
Yeah, up is down,
black is white... left is right.

515
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,289
What we got here, huh?

516
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,575
- Quiet overnight.
- Cool.

517
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,869
Relief will be here after roll call.

518
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,470
It's Sergeant Carver.

519
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,684
How you doing, dawg?

520
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,149
Quiet overnight.
You going to school this morning?

521
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:02,363
We're gonna wait a little longer,
but I'm not comfortable leaving him here.

522
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:06,784
Blow over in a week or so, you'll see.
Till then we still have a car on the house,

523
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,370
and you have my cell number
if anything comes up.

524
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,790
We're gonna look out for you on this.

525
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,292
- Have you had breakfast?
- No, but...

526
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,294
You have time for a plate, I'm sure.

527
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:20,214
Sure.

528
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:30,140
Yo, I just dreamt something
gave me an idea today.

529
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,103
That's right.

530
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:41,318
You remember when we turned
that knocked down light pole at the scales?

531
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,278
Pulled $80?

532
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,074
I been thinking we can get to toppling

533
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,119
a couple of those bad boys ourselves,

534
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,580
get all Paul Bunyan and shit, you know?

535
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:58,502
I mean, we'll be all discreet and all.

536
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:03,132
Not take the hacksaw to no more than
a couple on some quiet streets,

537
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:06,927
leave more than enough
for some people to have light and all.

538
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:13,434
Ah. Thing is, I got this other thing
I still need to take care of today.

539
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,981
Come on, Sherrod. Wake up.

540
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,818
It's late.

541
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,708
No, no, no! What you do? What you do?

542
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,460
What you do?

543
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,212
Oh, Man, come on, Sherrod.

544
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,467
Come on, man. Come on.

545
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,093
Come on.

546
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,389
You weren't supposed to do this, man!

547
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,024
Oh, Man!

548
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,860
- No phones?
- Not a one.

549
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,280
The players that were using them before,
Chris, Monk, Ray-Ray,

550
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,449
they were out there on those corners.

551
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,409
I would have seen if someone
went to a burner.

552
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,411
God damn it!

553
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:17,623
If we'd just stayed up
on the wire two months ago,

554
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,500
we wouldn't be going through this sh...

555
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:26,298
- Can I help you?
- Which one of you is Sergeant Hauk?

556
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:30,052
- I am.
- I'm Shea. This is Thomas. IID.

557
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,305
Do you remember pulling
a surveillance camera from ISD,

558
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:37,351
serial number AW466J9.

559
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,686
You remember that?

560
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:43,398
We also need to go over
your paperwork on some informants,

561
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:47,694
so if you don't mind
coming back downtown with us, you and...

562
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:54,409
Detective Sydnor, and the third guy,
what's his name? Dozerman.

563
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,749
You don't need Sydnor or Doze.
Paperwork's all mine,

564
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:05,045
on the camera, on the informants, me alone.

565
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:15,013
Bodies? How many?

566
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,641
We won't know
until we take down those doors.

567
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,144
One drug organization did this?

568
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,813
That's the theory, but nothing's certain.

569
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:27,276
But if we're going to do this,
you probably want us to do it now,

570
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,819
before the new year,

571
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,989
while the bump in the murder rate
is still attributable to Mayor Royce.

572
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,867
Thoughtful, Deputy, very thoughtful.

573
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,161
I don't want any more stat games.

574
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,829
Get your people into those houses

575
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,416
because if there are bodies in there
they need to come out.

576
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:47,880
But do it now. I don't want to be finding
more bodies come January.

577
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,008
Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor, sir.

578
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:37,137
We can take the state money,
and instead of being fucked up and broke,

579
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:40,140
our schools go back
to being merely fucked up.

580
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,310
No teacher layoffs, no program cuts,
no school closures.

581
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,563
But the governor's price is more state control

582
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,149
and changes in teachers' union contracts

583
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,860
allowing them to remove
tenured faculty for cause.

584
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:52,945
Ouch.

585
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:57,366
If we don't, we're shorting our kids.
If we do we're giving up local control,

586
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,952
which is gonna lose us
a lot of middle-class black votes.

587
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:04,414
And the problem you might have
in two years running in the DC suburbs,

588
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:08,335
explaining how you needed their money
to bail out your schools.

589
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,547
- He sees you coming, Tommy.
- That's not important now.

590
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,883
Take the money. We need it.

591
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,099
Don't look at me.

592
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,227
If you take it, you're selling
out the teachers, and that's my base.

593
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,729
If you don't, you're selling out the kids.

594
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:30,190
Either way, I'll rip you,
and half the council will too.

595
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,111
Just glad I'm not the mayor.

596
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,203
- You called?
- Word down the chain. Open 'em up.

597
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,375
And this case is gonna need more manpower.

598
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,379
No doubt. In fact,
I might have lost Herc to an IID file.

599
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:57,592
Really? I went light on him.
I didn't think it would get to a trial board.

600
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,970
This feels like a bigger jacket.

601
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,807
Pick any two you want from CID now.

602
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,310
If you get back up on the wire,
we'll detail more.

603
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,061
Beautiful.

604
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,569
I don't know what you're talking about
but she was hot.

605
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,405
I'm going back on Friday after work.

606
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,368
Hold on.

607
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:26,163
What the fuck are you staring at?

608
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,415
How are you liking Homicide?

609
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,168
Loving it. Why?

610
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,048
Anyway.

611
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:38,091
It's on the way, boss.

612
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,734
It's Joe and his message
but we already know what it is.

613
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,322
Making $40, motherfuckers!

614
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,616
All right, girl. Keep close.

615
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,451
Get a job!

616
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,120
'Naldo, call your amigos and tell them it's on.

617
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,636
That's right.

618
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,473
Yep. That's it. One, come on.

619
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,350
Let me see that footwork.

620
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,981
That's it. One. One. One. That's right.

621
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,323
Yo, what's going on, Mike?

622
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,995
I feel like I could just pancake a young 'un,
you know what I mean?

623
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,587
What about you, Duke? Want some gump?

624
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,631
No, I'm-a work this rope.

625
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,716
You working it. Like a gump.

626
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,572
They pull around back,
we're gonna come at 'em from both ways.

627
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,707
Call your friends, tell 'em where we at.

628
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,129
Yo, let me get that rope.

629
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,964
Man, I said you's a gump,

630
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:44,134
fucking dogshit and smelling-ass nigger.

631
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,218
Hey!

632
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:52,559
Man, fuck this.

633
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,605
Yeah! Go along! Get!

634
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,065
Nobody want you in here, no way!

635
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,915
That be it.

636
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:59,709
Hey, Daddy. Kiss the butt of this lyricist.

637
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,753
Blow on my mike and make a wish.

638
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:05,590
Get up! Hm-hm-hm-hm.
Everybody, get up. Hm-hm-hm.

639
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:10,303
Get up! Let me get a ten, Daddy.
Let me get a ten. I need a ten.

640
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,972
Get the fuck out of here now.

641
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:15,141
- I'll suck your dick for 15.
- Trick-ass bitch, I said get.

642
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,227
Don't you want to see my stuff?

643
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,397
Ain't nobody want to see that stink box.
Get your ass gone.

644
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,481
Let me get a ten, player.

645
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:24,609
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck y'all think you doing?

646
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:26,528
- We painters.
- Sí, we paint.

647
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,990
- Move the van!
- You gonna like what I got, soldier.

648
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,038
See? We paint. We paint.

649
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,082
OK.

650
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,672
Which one of y'all
gonna open the truck for me?

651
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,050
Ah!

652
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,848
Fucking amateurs.

653
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:00,186
Drink it slow, son.

654
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,109
What am I gonna do?

655
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,777
I'll run you home.

656
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,323
I...I can't go home.

657
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,202
She... She expect me to be my father, but...

658
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,290
I ain't him.

659
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,126
I mean, the way he is and shit...

660
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,422
it just ain't in me.

661
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,966
What's between you and Michael?

662
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,926
Mike ain't Mike no more.

663
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:37,432
He went hard on this boy last night,
fucked his shit up.

664
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,604
I can't go home.

665
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,523
I can't.

666
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,734
Give us a minute.

667
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,576
Mad at myself, man.

668
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,996
I shouldn't have shut Michael out like I did.

669
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,166
Namond did push it.

670
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,210
He ain't pushing nothing now.

671
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,506
Reckon I'll go mend the fence.

672
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,762
This ain't no motel.

673
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,977
Deacon, how'd you get by my people?

674
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,897
You can't turn away church folk, ain't done.

675
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:29,818
You only come by for a favor, so what is it?

676
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:33,029
You know a fella named Bunny Colvin?

677
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:38,368
Yeah, that rogue police commander,
tried to legalize drugs.

678
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,204
- What's he done now?
- He can tell you best.

679
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,207
- You did not bring...
- It's something positive.

680
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,919
- Has to do with kids.
- Positive, huh?

681
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,629
Bunny.

682
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,882
Delegate Watkins.

683
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:56,636
- What's this all about?
- It's another bright idea.

684
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,895
- You Michael Lee's mother?
- He got papers on him?

685
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,898
I ain't police. I'm just looking for him.

686
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,233
You ain't alone.

687
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,318
He booked on out of here, got his own spot,

688
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,070
took his little brother with him.

689
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,698
- You know where he stay at?
- He ain't tell me.

690
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,242
You find the boy, you let him know
I need some help.

691
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,912
I popped him and Bug out my ass,
and now they forgot where they came from.

692
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,168
What my ma say when you called?

693
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,004
- She was mad, right?
- Not really.

694
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,641
His mother...

695
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:49,063
Lovely lady. What she say?

696
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:54,736
"Put that bitch in baby booking
where he belong, let him learn something."

697
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:59,365
She hung up before I could tell her
we didn't have a charge.

698
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,583
- Baltimore City 911.
- They beating a cop on Pennsie and Gold.

699
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,627
- Police officer?
- They're beating him..

700
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,254
- Pennsylvania and Gold?
- They firing shots now.

701
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:24,057
Signal 13, report of shots fired,
Pennsylvania and Gold.

702
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,017
Signal 13...

703
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,254
They cleaned the motherfucker out, Joe,

704
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,840
put it in the van
the Mexican niggers rolled in.

705
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,009
- I ain't hearing about no resistance.
- Man, wasn't no time for that.

706
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,512
Omar had one of them
commando squads, man.

707
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:07,100
He had this one ho pulling guns out
her pussy. The shit was unseemly, man.

708
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,519
I got to hand it to Mr. Little,

709
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,814
- I ain't see this one coming.
- They took the shipment, Joe.

710
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:16,401
Not no package. The motherfucking
shipment. What we gonna tell the co-op?

711
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,361
Where you think my mind at now?

712
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,155
A lot of gangsters out a lot of shit, man.

713
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,950
I say we mob up and go find this faggot, see?

714
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,036
That's what's really 'hood.
That's how you deal with shit.

715
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:31,583
A lotta gangsters in that room
need to take us at our word first.

716
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:36,045
Yeah, first thing they gonna wonder about...

717
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,131
is us.

718
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,556
You need to see my man. I'll hook you up.

719
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,143
- Who is this motherfucker?
- Let me get a word with you, Mike.

720
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,814
Listen, you got to understand

721
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:59,277
I can't be having no physical confrontation
like the one back there.

722
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,905
That kind of thing
got to stay outside my gym.

723
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:07,160
- Yeah. Go ahead, Montel.
- I was wrong, the way I handled it.

724
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,412
Step off, nigger.

725
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,415
Mike...

726
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,501
Don't touch me, man.

727
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,588
Look, man, this here ain't you.

728
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,841
- Man don't want you touching on him.
- Mike.

729
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,095
I told you, step the fuck off.

730
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,432
Young man, if I was talking to you,
you'd know I was.

731
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:35,063
Shit!

732
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:37,190
He'll listen next time.

733
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,734
Go ahead, man. Do him.

734
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:42,904
Nah, man.

735
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,876
I'll hang here for the ambo, all right?

736
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,552
Go with your people.

737
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,223
Go ahead, son.

738
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,227
Dr. Johnson, please call Neuro ICU.

739
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,813
Dr. Johnson, please call Neuro ICU.

740
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,078
I'm sorry, son.

741
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,047
I'm gonna talk to Social Services.

742
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,716
We'll get you some help.

743
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:34,807

744
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,397

On-call, please return to Neuro ICU.

You gonna help, huh?

You gonna look out for me?

You gonna look out for me, Sergeant Carver?

749
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,467
Do you mean it?

750
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:12,261
You gonna look out for me?

751
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,015
You promise? You got my back, huh?
