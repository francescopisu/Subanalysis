1
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,513
You been nipping
at me all night, son.

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,600
Thing I got to figure is,
is you ready to bite the whole ass?

3
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,644
Ain't me with
a mountain by my elbow.

4
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,521
You doing all right.

5
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,816
You like the Town Car?

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,945
You young 'uns, you all into them Lexus

7
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:33,616
and hum-fucking VSU fucking U-ray

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,161
or some shit, I don't know.
See, but me?

9
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,080
I like me a Town Car.

10
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,834
Man look quiet and correct in one of them.

11
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:44,752
So, I tell you what -

12
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,962
you win this,

13
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,924
you be sure to pick one up
for yourself, son.

14
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,395
Bye-bye.

15
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,899
Showtime.

16
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,825
Shit, nigger, turn.

17
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,537
Man got clubs.

18
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,041
One day soon I'm walking out
with a Rolls, hear?

19
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,085
Way you been going to school up here, son,

20
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,423
I suspect you're gonna walk out of here
with Morgan Freeman to drive it for you too.

21
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,349
See y'all next time.

22
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,865
- I'm up the grocery on Monroe.
- All right.

23
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,719
Water, $1.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,573
What the fuck?

25
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,744
You think I dream of coming to work
up in this shit on a Sunday morning?

26
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,622
Tell all my friends
what a good job I got?

27
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,583
I'm working to support a family, man.

28
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,503
Pretend I ain't talking to you.

29
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,130
Pretend like I ain't even on this earth.

30
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,215
I know what you are.

31
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,593
And I ain't stepping to,
but I am a man.

32
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,930
And you just clip that shit and act like
you don't even know I'm there.

33
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,431
I don't.

34
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,019
I'm here.

35
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,774
Look, I told you
I wasn't stepping to you.

36
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,526
I ain't disrespecting you, son.

37
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,071
You want it to be one way.

38
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,699
What?

39
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,909
- You want it to be one way.
- I don't know...

40
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,870
- You want it to be one way.
- Man, stop.

41
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,289
Stop saying that.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,128
But it's the other way.

43
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,489
When you walk through the garden

44
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,617
Watch your back

45
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,161
Well, I beg your pardon

46
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,997
Walk the straight and narrow track

47
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,167
If you walk with Jesus

48
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,586
He'll save your soul

49
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:18,633
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

50
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,093
He's got fire and the fury

51
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,971
At his command

52
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,682
Well, you don't got to worry

53
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,101
Hold on to Jesus' hand

54
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,938
We'll be safe from Satan

55
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,732
When the thunder rolls

56
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,735
But you gotta keep the devil

57
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,695
Down in the hole

58
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,702
Oh, yeah, mm

59
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,167
We'll be safe from Satan

60
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,215
Gotta keep the devil

61
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,801
Down in the hole

62
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,138
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

63
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,683
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

64
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,435
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

65
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,980
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

66
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,691
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

67
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,693
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

68
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,173
I'm saying, man, the way she was all,
"aah" on Chiquan, like...

69
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,802
"Laugh now, stanky bitch!
Laugh now, huh? How you like this?

70
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,471
- "How you like I cut your titties off?"
- Get the fuck away from me.

71
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,349
"How you like I carve your pussy
to your chin?"

72
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,184
- What?
- He said leave him be, so leave him be.

73
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,604
- I'm just saying.
- That's all you ever do, just say.

74
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,566
- Dude, shit was fucked up.
- So it was fucked up.

75
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,196
Her father killed, like, three police.

76
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,032
- What?
- Nah, it's true.

77
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,576
Her father killed three police
and her mama boil cats.

78
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,536
- Nigger, please, man.
- It's what I heard.

79
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,747
She boil cats and serve 'em and shit.

80
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,332
Serve 'em to who,
boiled-cat-eating motherfuckers?

81
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,044
- Who want him some boiled cats?
- Heard that's how she live.

82
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,545
Nigger, you been boiled.

83
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,839
Laetitia live up in one of them
group homes off Edmondson.

84
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,969
In them places, you don't need to eat cats
to make you crazy.

85
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,891
Hey, Coach!

86
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,068
If the boy not coming, you might as
well let me and Michael go in the ring.

87
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,071
- Ain't none of y'all seen Spider today?
- I ain't seen him.

88
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,491
Now, how in the hell he gonna fight next week
if he don't show up to train?

89
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,243
I tell you what -

90
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,245
until the boy shows up for his lesson,

91
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,915
you can lace 'em up
and step on the mat one time.

92
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,001
No, no, no, no, no.

93
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,504
Not him. Me.

94
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,590
- Oh!
- Mm-hm.

95
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,302
I'm gonna show you as gently as I can
how much you don't know, all right?

96
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,097
Yeah, nigger, that's yo ass.
You about to get yo ass whipped.

97
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,315
Your Sabbath best?

98
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,527
You hang around, you can see me
preach on some young 'uns,

99
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,446
solemn left and sanctified right.

100
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,783
Why you down here on a Sunday, Deacon?

101
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,369
You need to see Ms. Donnelly
at Tilghman Middle.

102
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,956
She's got some custodial work,
you might call it. Union wage.

103
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,542
- Custodial?
- See Ms. Donnelly tomorrow.

104
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,627
She can explain it better than I can.

105
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,382
Tell me something -
how is it you got so much wisdom

106
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,259
about who should be where?

107
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,220
A good church man
is always up in everybody's shit.

108
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,514
That's how we do.

109
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,809
Yo, Coach, you ready?

110
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,236
- Who's winning?
- No one wins.

111
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,613
One side just loses more slowly.

112
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,160
Why don't we get out of the house?

113
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,079
Take a walk. It's a nice day.

114
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,250
I got this talk I got to give to my first period

115
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,460
about what happened.

116
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,920
An hour.

117
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,591
I gotta...

118
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,595
I gotta say something
to those kids. I mean...

119
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,471
OK.

120
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,518
See? Somebody's winning.

121
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,774
I didn't expect you till tomorrow.

122
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,402
I heard my new squad
had the weekend shift.

123
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:53,240
And besides, I figured if I got my shit
out of Major Crimes on the Sunday,

124
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,327
I wouldn't have to run into
that cocksucker Marimow.

125
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,830
Marimow does not
cast off talent lightly.

126
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,249
He heaves it away with great force.

127
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,168
Freamon got here Friday.

128
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,545
Yeah, Lester's quick like that.

129
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,632
There's the colonel's office.

130
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,343
This is my humble abode. The board.

131
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,012
And over here, this is your desk.

132
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,310
- It's clean.
- You'll fix that.

133
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,188
A clean desk is
the sign of a sick mind.

134
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,232
Homicide.

135
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,733
Damn.

136
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,736
I don't know where your chair went.
Make that your first case.

137
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,655
And put that down, will you?
You live here now.

138
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,827
Ooh, look. Actual police work.

139
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,003
- Any of these?
- He the one, right there.

140
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,673
Just put it to Fruit's head.

141
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,218
The next thing Fruit on the ground flopping
and his girl all screaming

142
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,805
and this pink shit coming out
the side of his head.

143
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,392
The Bunk, working weekends.

144
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,394
The man's dedicated.

145
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,981
I'm gonna partner you
with Crutchfield to get started.

146
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,275
You won't catch anything
for the first few months.

147
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,777
Give you time to learn the basics.

148
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,238
Our H files by year.

149
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,282
Witness dump.

150
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,201
Our cut necktie mausoleum.

151
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,537
The coffee.

152
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,541
And the mailboxes,
arranged by shift and squad.

153
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,669
Lester.

154
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,005
I believe you two refugees
know each other well.

155
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,340
Still getting your head around it?

156
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,552
- A bit, yeah.
- You'll do fine. Just fine.

157
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,222
As tender as this moment may be,
Detective, you've got mail.

158
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,770
You got Lyon on your ass already?

159
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,857
Another switch-up
on the methane probes.

160
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,986
I'd call that number. Get on top of that shit
before you catch a case.

161
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,321
Chair or no chair.

162
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,921
What the hell is a methane probe?

163
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,345
- Hello, Kathleen O'Shea.
- Yes, hello?

164
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,429
Mm-hm.

165
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,016
I need to speak with Mr. Lyon
about the protocols.

166
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,768
I beg your pardon?

167
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,770
Mr. Lyon, please.

168
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,980
You sound a little old for this, hon.

169
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:34,526
Excuse me? Who is this?
This is Detective Greggs with the...

170
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,945
This is the Baltimore City Zoo.

171
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,698
Fine, and this is Detective Greggs...

172
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,242
And you're calling for a Mr. Lion.

173
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,122
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,957
I misdialed.

175
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,796
Methane probe.

176
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,474
Scarred-up faggot. I need to hunt him down,

177
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,518
'cause there ain't no protection
against that shit.

178
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,313
Can't plan against that nigger. It's like...

179
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,107
- You know what he's like.
- What he like?

180
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,819
He like one of them terrorist motherfuckers.
Blowing up shit just to.

181
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,655
Don't care who get hurt,
what kind of sense it makes.

182
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,532
- He got a point.
- Heh.

183
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,283
And the government, right?

184
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:27,246
If they have one of them terrorist attacks,
they cut Delta or whoever some slack.

185
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,706
The insurance companies, the banks,

186
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,252
the whole NASDAQ and shit get some time
to pay back what they owe,

187
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,504
because the government know
ain't nothing they could do.

188
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,258
Yeah, I know you see it.
You see the big picture.

189
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,760
Problem with niggers today,
they always see the narrow view.

190
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,054
- That's nice.
- What?

191
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,224
You like that?

192
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,687
I had it for a long time now.
It's got some sentimental values.

193
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,939
- Just a thing.
- What's the real value?

194
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,402
- Huh?
- Real value? I ain't much for sentiment.

195
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,780
Oh, you know.
It's been a while since I checked.

196
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,033
I mean, the fluctuation
in the global economy and all.

197
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,994
- I'll find out for you.
- You don't have to.

198
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,954
I'll find out for you.

199
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,959
Finger's swelled over the years.

200
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,128
- Need some help?
- Yeah, man, you need help?

201
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,297
Nah, I got it, I got it.

202
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,632
- Maybe use some spit.
- I don't want the man's spit.

203
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,217
I got it now.

204
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:31,101
Omar ain't no terrorist.
He just another nigger with a gun.

205
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,479
And you ain't no Delta Airlines, neither.

206
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,397
You just a nigger got your shit took.

207
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,024
So, bring me what you owe

208
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,277
and talk that global
economy mess somewhere else.

209
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,279
Feel me?

210
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,406
Yeah.

211
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,246
I got another game.

212
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,916
How much you down already?

213
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,877
Learning their ways requires patience.

214
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,963
Money too.
How much you need this time out?

215
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,757
A hundred and a half ought to do.

216
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,842
A hundred and a half?

217
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,095
I take that chicken-nose fool
one day soon.

218
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,556
Take Super Stick too.

219
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,267
Take 'em all.

220
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,980
Else, maybe I get bored,
send you to take 'em.

221
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,861
And my point, Colonel Foerster,
is that your man Norris,

222
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,405
he's fucking the dog on this,
way I hear it.

223
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,324
Sir, this is a top-priority case,

224
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,743
and there's a possibility
of a murdered witness.

225
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,205
We don't even know yet
if that was the motive for the murder.

226
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,250
- This is my point.
- Norris is a pro, sir.

227
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,420
His clearance rate this year
says otherwise, Colonel.

228
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,260
Sir, Norris is good police.

229
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,887
Look, Ray, we need someone
who can work it hard,

230
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,807
work it round the clock,
work it till it falls.

231
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,269
And I understand we just pumped
some fresh blood into Homicide -

232
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,896
female, took one in the line
a few years back.

233
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,481
She's never worked Homicide.

234
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,275
Fresh eyes, then.

235
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,901
But with all due respect, sir,

236
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:07,990
if I could guarantee that no more information
would reach the press before election day,

237
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,951
would it be possible to keep
veteran investigators working it, sir?

238
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,203
I resent the implication.

239
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,252
My apologies, sir.

240
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,758
You killing my time coming up here.
If you ain't noticed, it's costing us money.

241
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,388
How am I gonna trust you if you keep telling
lies, saying one thing and doing another?

242
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,473
I just missed Friday, that's all.

243
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,644
Look, think on it like this - school is work.
They're the same thing right now.

244
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,105
You skipping out on school
is like not showing up for work.

245
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,609
And I done heard, made up,
and tested every excuse invented.

246
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,403
So, unless you dead or dying,
there ain't none you can use.

247
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,531
- I told you I'm-a go.
- Yeah, OK, I know.

248
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,368
For school or out the business,
you are gonna go. Come on.

249
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,289
Falling behind isn't the way
to start a school year,

250
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,207
particularly after a three-year hiatus.

251
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,543
We haven't seen you since you enrolled.

252
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,379
Is there a reason you haven't joined us?

253
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,845
Look, I know you reaching out for Sherrod.

254
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,431
I want to apologize for the boy.

255
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,808
He's been helping me get a business going.

256
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,562
But he need to be here though.
Ain't no bout a-doubt it.

257
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,981
- It's up to him.
- That's what I've been trying to say.

258
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,901
- That's it right there.
- What about it, young man?

259
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,028
I'm good.

260
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,238
OK.

261
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,742
One thing though been
bothering me, ma'am -

262
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,745
if Sherrod already missed
the last three years,

263
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,039
should he maybe be back
in fifth or sixth grade,

264
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,875
instead of up with his age?
So he can follow the work.

265
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,585
Social promotion.

266
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,087
Excuse me?

267
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,631
We don't have the resources
to repeat grade levels,

268
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,676
and we feel to place the older children
in the younger classes

269
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,721
is unfair to teachers who are
responsible for maintaining order.

270
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,599
Your nephew has been socially promoted.

271
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,935
He's an eighth-grader headed to high school.

272
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,691
Sorry, but Ms. Johnson's
here about Qadriyyah.

273
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,693
Excuse me for a moment.

274
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,407
- Bill, this is nuts.
- I told him that.

275
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,951
If this gets out,
who do you think it's gonna land on?

276
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,954
I got two years to make 40
and a pension bump.

277
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,875
Look, I don't agree with the call either,
but it's his call, not yours, not mine.

278
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,921
He's the one over at City Hall every day
getting his ass chewed.

279
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,227
I don't care about nothing you say.

280
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,856
If you start shit, you can't complain
how somebody finish that shit.

281
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,735
Man, she was on her from the beginning
with the mirror and everything, man.

282
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,445
I wouldn't have waited.

283
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,243
Mr. Pryzbylewski, this is Sherrod.

284
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,328
- And he's all yours.
- OK.

285
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,123
Take a seat, Sherrod.

286
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,131
OK, listen up.

287
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,925
I'd like to...

288
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,845
Everybody...
Everybody, I'd like to talk...

289
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:18,805
Listen up!

290
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,393
Now, we all know something...

291
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,354
unpleasant happened here Friday,

292
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,525
and I know some of you are still trying
to get your heads around...

293
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,694
Ain't my head got a big old gash.

294
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,406
And I'd like to discuss...

295
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,159
- Yo, is it true that you police?
- What?

296
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,621
Miss Carmandy up in the office say,
"Mr. Prezbo, he police."

297
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,956
- You police, man?
- You ever shoot somebody?

298
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,958
- We should talk...
- He ain't shot no one.

299
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,710
Look at him. Yo...

300
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,921
you ever bust a man
named Ashanti Graham?

301
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,131
Sometimes when something bad happens...

302
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,674
- That your dad?
- Nah, my brother.

303
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,053
- Why can't you tell us if you shot somebody?
- What kind of gun you carry?

304
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:04,851
I used to be police. Now I'm a teacher.
Being a police isn't just about carrying a gun.

305
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,978
Yeah, right.

306
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,648
- It's about working with the community.
- The community?

307
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,818
Y'all ain't been in my community in
a long time except to whale on people.

308
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,238
- Yo, Mr. P, you ever been shot?
- I mean, like, bah.

309
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,244
Namond, that's enough.

310
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,454
Get up.

311
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,249
Get up.
Get back in your seats.

312
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,834
Thank you, very entertaining.

313
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,044
Sit down. Get in your seats!

314
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,839
Sit down, sit down.
Kwaneese, sit down.

315
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,298
Sit down, now.

316
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,801
Yo, Mr. P, you ever
choke somebody dead like...

317
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,138
Yo, you ever get videoed?

318
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,277
Mr. P, Ashanti Graham.

319
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,780
You gots to know him.
He was a player for real.

320
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,972
He work Sunday to Thursday,
7:00 early to 5:00 late.

321
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,600
So, it ain't no moonlighting thing, then.

322
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,560
Nah, he ain't no real police.

323
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,062
He full time on this
Mickey Mouse shit here.

324
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,815
What he do again?

325
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,358
Talked back.

326
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,655
- Go over Hilltop now?
- Yeah, we got that too.

327
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,374
See ya.

328
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,216
- Decision time, son.
- Yo, what's your play?

329
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,605
I told Little Kevin
to shoot y'all both in the head twice.

330
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,024
But seeing as he done walked away...

331
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,525
Oh, you funny.

332
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,195
Yeah, I guess I'm on your package.

333
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,950
- Where the boy at - Michael?
- He ain't no regular.

334
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,202
He's just working off a debt.

335
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,455
- Why? Why you care?
- Never mind you why.

336
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,457
"Why" ain't in your repertoire, nigger.

337
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,043
Yo!

338
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,773
60-40 split on that.
Do not be messing with Marlo's money.

339
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,662
Randy Wagstaff,
you aren't a sixth-grader, are you?

340
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,664
Oh, hey, Ms. Reese.

341
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,501
If you were a sixth-grader, it would mean
you and the rest of the knuckleheads

342
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,170
would still be in my first-period English class.

343
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,131
And that would mean it was two years ago.

344
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,009
And that would mean time stands still
at Tilghman Middle,

345
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,177
and that would be a catastrophe.

346
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,722
- I just forgot and wore my old shirt today.
- Mm-hm.

347
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,599
If this isn't your lunch,
then where is your hall pass?

348
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,774
Why not just write it in crayon?

349
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,443
Come on.

350
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:47,532
- Deacon says you're a good man.
- Good enough to swing a mop, I guess.

351
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,535
- A mop? More like a vacuum cleaner.
- What?

352
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,705
I get a few fellas like you
to help me out every September.

353
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,083
You go out on the street,
you find these kids, you drag 'em in.

354
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,711
A truant officer.

355
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,214
The system hasn't been funded
for truant officers in 20 years.

356
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,342
Where the hell you think you are,
Montgomery County?

357
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,847
Nah, I keep a couple custodial positions
unfilled every year just for this.

358
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,392
Those kids? You haul 'em in,
you cross 'em off the list.

359
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,895
Each kid, one time, clear the list.

360
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,482
Come October,
you start on the list again.

361
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,235
Job's yours if you want it.
Pays 12 an hour.

362
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,488
Excuse me, hon. Sit.

363
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,045
Why'd you leave class?

364
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,631
I got hungry, couldn't concentrate.

365
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,717
Maybe, Randy, you had another
reason for running the halls, hm?

366
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,678
- Tagging walls, maybe?
- Uh-uh. You know I don't.

367
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,972
I don't know anything.
I know it's the second week,

368
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,183
and I got walls covered with tags.

369
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,852
Does that make you feel good,
walking past that?

370
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:58,937
I don't know.

371
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,688
Maybe 'cause you're the one
doing the marking.

372
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:03,024
- I'm not.
- Then who is?

373
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,284
- Miss Thompson?
- Yes, ma'am?

374
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,954
Could you get me the number
for Randy Wagstaff's foster mom?

375
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,747
What you want to call Miss Anna for?

376
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:21,626
You're skipping class, running the halls.
She's got a right to know.

377
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,753
- Is this her work number?
- Yes, ma'am.

378
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,548
Hold on. Wait.

379
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,469
The new girl, Greggs...

380
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,847
Sir, if I may, respectfully...

381
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,473
Norris has a full plate, OK?

382
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,642
The Braddock case goes to Greggs.

383
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,686
- His plate is fine.
- No, it's not.

384
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,730
His plate's a pile of shit, OK?
Listen to me.

385
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,775
Burrell wants this case stalled
until everybody votes.

386
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,360
And Rawls?

387
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,947
How the fuck I know what Rawls wants?
He never said shit.

388
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,992
Let me tell you something,
he knows this is fucked up.

389
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:58,413
I have this correct? We are pulling a veteran
off a pending case and giving it to a rook

390
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,374
so as not to make timely progress
on said case?

391
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,002
The Braddock case to Greggs.

392
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,757
- A pilot program?
- For one of your middle schools, yes.

393
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,136
- A $200,000 grant is attached.
- Free money.

394
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,765
- I'm just trying to help, Mrs. Conway.
- Help how?

395
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,687
You say that your target group
is repeat violent offenders.

396
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,316
Are you suggesting
that the system's lost control of the school?

397
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,234
No, that's not what I'm suggesting at all.

398
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,945
The system's fine.
The system's great.

399
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,156
I mean, this isn't about the system.

400
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,200
We're just gonna try to find a way

401
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:39,370
to get to some of the troubled kids
who won't be in the system too much longer.

402
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,667
Well, look, just make sure there's no fuss.

403
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,378
Nothing that gets anyone upset, you know?

404
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:52,008
There's an election, and we don't want
to put our schools in the middle of that mess.

405
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,468
No, indeed.

406
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,293
Humping a radio car like a young sprite.

407
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,461
I'm a little bit proud to know you.

408
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,963
Just a little bit?

409
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,299
It ain't like there aren't better things to do.

410
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,301
- Like what?
- See, I told you, Lester,

411
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,303
the worm has turned for my boy.

412
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:22,390
- I heard they torpedoed your wiretap.
- Yeah, they sent us a new lieutenant.

413
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,059
- Marimow from E&T.
- The Unit Killer.

414
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,978
Lester and Kima bailed to Homicide,

415
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,772
and Sydnor's looking to jump
at the first opening.

416
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:33,234
- So, Major Crimes is dead, huh?
- Yeah, Lester killed it good.

417
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,736
Went looking for the money.

418
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,863
Guys like you, you never learn.

419
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,574
- Guys like me?
- Yeah, 13 years...

420
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,034
- Four months.
- Four months.

421
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,913
- You guys call for backup or what?
- Yeah.

422
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:50,168
We got arrest papers on a murder
for one Curtis Anderson, aka Lex.

423
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:54,797
He's been on the wing for a couple of weeks,
so I don't expect him at his mama's, but...

424
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,508
- What's the address?
- 643 Harlem.

425
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,595
How about you taking the door with me
for old time's sake, Jim?

426
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,389
- I'll take the back, gents.
- The back?

427
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,059
Damn, junior, the worm has turned for you.

428
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,145
You know what they say about the man
who volunteers to take the back?

429
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,521
He buys.

430
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,775
B&O Tavern, tonight at nine, son.

431
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,069
- I throw myself out after one.
- Shit.

432
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,737
You don't believe me, ask Bunk.

433
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,114
True.

434
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,419
- The bedroom's clear.
- Yeah, basement too.

435
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,671
- Clear.
- Yeah.

436
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,391
Clear.

437
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,894
Nine tonight, McNulty,

438
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,646
B&O Tavern.

439
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,487
He's not here. I told you.

440
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,911
Is he coming home again?

441
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,043
Ma'am, is your son alive?

442
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,673
Because if he's not,

443
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,925
we can end this right now.

444
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,803
Otherwise, we've got a witness.

445
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,763
That gives us a murder warrant.

446
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,057
That warrant says
that we can come through your door

447
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,226
as many times as necessary.

448
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,273
I don't know where my son is.

449
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,068
It's like them birds of yours.

450
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,320
They go out, and they fly around the city.

451
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,989
They free to do as they do.

452
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,616
End of the day, they come back here,

453
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,452
get water, get fed,

454
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,038
'cause they know you got this place
set up regular as the rain.

455
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:55,084
No surprises, 'cause at the end of the day,
a man don't want no surprises.

456
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,671
You know, birds neither.
Same as what I'm offering.

457
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:03,885
You part of a co-op, a whole lot of surprises
you never worry about again.

458
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,845
You just do as you do,

459
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:10,099
knowing the product
will always be there and be the finest quality,

460
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,727
knowing that if one of yours
takes a pinch,

461
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,937
he got a lawyer and a bondsman

462
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,482
waiting for him
before he even step out the wagon.

463
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,985
- I know how to hire lawyers.
- Ain't just about the lawyers.

464
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,947
It's having a connection so that you know
before the bust even go down.

465
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,283
What I got to give up
to get that good dope?

466
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,577
Muscle. You got muscle.

467
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,706
You stand with us, we run these
New York boys right out of East Baltimore.

468
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,791
Fuck I care about East Baltimore?

469
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,713
The point of the co-op
is we stand together.

470
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,257
We share information,

471
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,384
and no one fucks with any of us.

472
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,969
No one fucks with me now.

473
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,932
That don't mean there couldn't be
some unforeseen cir...

474
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,520
No one fucks with me now.

475
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,825
African colors. Subtle.

476
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,829
Tony Gray is pulling 24% now.

477
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,916
You need new colors
and a new message, Clarence.

478
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,126
You need to rally the base.

479
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:23,631
You want me to start wearing dashikis?
Go all Marion Barry and shit?

480
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,802
I'll tell you what I would like - another 75
in cash for walk-around money.

481
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,887
75, huh?

482
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,475
Call another game.

483
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:39,105
It's a waste of time,
and right now time is everything.

484
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,816
They're gonna spit in your eye
and endorse Royce.

485
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,485
They only waited this long
out of respect to Tony Gray.

486
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,445
Otherwise, they give it to Royce months ago.

487
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,780
That's not the point.

488
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,366
You go there uninvited,
and you're gonna piss them off.

489
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,994
Am I? Or do I piss them off even more

490
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:56,706
by pretending that they don't exist,
that I don't need them?

491
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,958
I've door-to-doored every neighborhood,

492
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,920
saying I'm ready to be mayor to all of it,
not just my base, but all of it.

493
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,505
What does it say
I don't go see these guys?

494
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,590
He's right.

495
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,176
They endorse Royce, fine.
The hell else they gonna do?

496
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:13,556
But what they say and don't say from
the pulpit that Sunday before the primary,

497
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,349
we still got a dog in that fight.

498
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,435
I do this right, they'll respect it.

499
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,354
And if they don't,
at least they get to see

500
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,398
a begging-ass
white man on his knees.

501
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,735
Always a feel-good
moment for the folks.

502
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,575
And as to my attendance
at council meetings,

503
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,910
those who know the job understand

504
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:39,081
there is more to being a councilperson
than just the meetings.

505
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,666
Yes. Charles?

506
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,920
Yeah, they're putting a halfway house
at the end of my block. Addicts and such.

507
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,506
Not if I have anything to say about it.

508
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:50,426
- Where you living at, sir?
- 800 block North Carrollton.

509
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,803
I'm gonna take a look into that.

510
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,724
Is there anyone with a question
for any of the other candidates?

511
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,352
Anyone with an issue, a concern?

512
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,104
I would say that with regard

513
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,732
to the gentleman's concern
about the halfway house,

514
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,817
that while I share your concern,

515
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,404
it's also true that the city has thousands
of drug addicts in recovery,

516
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,324
and those halfway houses and shelters
have to go someplace.

517
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,660
Though not in white neighborhoods.

518
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,625
Ma'am, could I see that Royce flyer?

519
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,920
That is a fair point as well.
But these are people -

520
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,924
our brothers and sisters,
our children, our friends.

521
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,009
They are trying to change their lives,

522
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:35,012
and so it's up to us
to be responsible for them.

523
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,351
- Feel good to miss a hand, huh?
- What's the point?

524
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,853
Eventually, we all got to ante up.

525
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,313
Yeah, we do.

526
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,609
But I can't believe he had the balls enough
to call two games in one month.

527
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,695
He's loading up
on walk-around money.

528
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,030
He wants cash on the street
come election day.

529
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,657
Carcetti got to him.

530
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,035
Called it a war chest.
Maybe we got us a war this time.

531
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,875
I wish he wasn't so fucking ugly with it.

532
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,294
That two pair he bet on,
right into Roger's trip nines.

533
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,130
I folded on a flush.

534
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,882
Full boat, four hands ago.

535
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,677
It's immoral, what it is.

536
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,641
So, what's the game, gents?

537
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,309
Clarence's deal.

538
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,937
Texas Hold 'Em.

539
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:28,315
I begin to understand
the popularity of this game.

540
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,485
No limit.

541
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,487
Oh, peachy.

542
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,325
I was beginning to think you'd lost it.

543
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:44,582
That living room shrine of hers
would have shamed Elvis and Tupac both.

544
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,836
Her son's deader than both of 'em.
She's just too scared to say so.

545
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,256
That shit wasn't there the first time
I talked to her. I'd have seen it.

546
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,134
Mm-hm. You being a detective and all.

547
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,385
- Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

548
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,636
Mm-hm.

549
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,474
Hey, look, she got a friend.

550
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,394
She too young for you, boy.

551
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,812
Young?

552
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,816
They get younger, William.
Skinnier too. We don't.

553
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,277
Younger, skinnier -
where's Jimmy?

554
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,863
That's just the nature of things.
Age is age,

555
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,324
fat is fat, and nature is nature.

556
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,618
- Pitiful.
- And pitiless.

557
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,369
Nature don't care.

558
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,371
Nature just is.

559
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,875
Now my boy Marlo,
I thought he was skewing that.

560
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,543
Screwing what?

561
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,505
- The boy's a young lion.
- "Hello, is Mr. Lyon home?"

562
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,132
And a lion has to have his kill.

563
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,968
"Methane probe for Mr. Lyon."

564
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,888
So then where are my bodies?

565
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:45,100
Here I am over here on the one hand
without a body in six months,

566
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,646
and here you are looking for a suspect
who's most likely dead,

567
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,274
and most likely for
dropping one of Marlo's.

568
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,444
Then again, if he's dead...

569
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,280
where's that body?

570
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,491
You know what the plural of pussy is?

571
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,868
Puss-i.
Jimmy taught me that.

572
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,080
Where's he putting the bodies, Bunk?
In the sewers?

573
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,832
Rogue funeral home, maybe?

574
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,042
They teach that fancy-ass Latin
at them Catholic schools.

575
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,002
- You remember the Eddy Crane case?
- Mm-hm.

576
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,673
Word was they put him
in an acid vat down near Curtis Bay.

577
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,550
They're coming up on us now.

578
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,636
Now, for a West Side boy
like Marlo Stanfield,

579
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,722
that would be the traditional
dumping grounds.

580
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,141
Right? Right?

581
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29,770
What? Oh, man.

582
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,773
Jimmy!

583
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,110
Jimmy!

584
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,281
Trying to get some of that puss-i.

585
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,160
What the hell you still sitting here for?

586
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,955
Fucking Huxtables and shit, right?

587
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,501
There they go right there.

588
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,337
He's still with school.

589
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:59,258
Shit. Just so they can
spring out that shit pile every day.

590
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,552
Make a good run at that boy,

591
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,971
he'll be on a corner,
no problem, man.

592
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,307
Yeah, we gonna see.

593
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,311
You hung over?

594
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,647
Just saying you look like shit.

595
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,775
You know what you need
at a crime scene?

596
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,194
- Rubber gloves.
- Soft eyes.

597
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,615
Like I'm supposed to cry and shit?

598
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,784
You got soft eyes,
you can see the whole thing.

599
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,578
You got hard eyes,

600
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,915
you're staring at the same tree,
missing the forest.

601
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,499
Oh, Zen shit.

602
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,045
Soft eyes, grasshopper.

603
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,517
Lividity puts the time of death at 7:48,

604
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,394
- give or take.
- Noted.

605
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,104
You're gonna want a chemstat.

606
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,606
- You think?
- Couldn't hurt.

607
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,817
- A CBC too? Splatter distance?
- Yeah, definitely.

608
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,612
You know, where the hell
did my Q-tips go?

609
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,281
- Don't sweat it. I got mine right here.
- Good.

610
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:06,533
You want to take a look? Won't bite.

611
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,998
Hey, don't forget the stippling.

612
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,250
I'm a rookie?

613
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,420
- There's something in his hand.
- Yeah?

614
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,589
Give her some tweezers.

615
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,645
"Tater killed me."

616
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,355
Oh!

617
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,942
Is it typed? 'Cause that would hold up
a lot better in court.

618
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,121
Phone number in the other hand.

619
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,291
A standard confidentiality agreement.

620
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,170
And this one?

621
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:04,425
Oh, that one indemnifies us
should you or any of your staff be injured.

622
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,026
Who wants to get some learning today?

623
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:26,405
- I roll up front with you?
- You got dibs in the back, little man, let's go.

624
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:29,116
- Come on.
- Don't worry about him.

625
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:32,536
- We'll catch him later.
- Yeah, little man's so excited

626
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,789
about what's on that blackboard,
he gonna race us.

627
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:45,716
What's the line on us so far?
In the teacher's lounge, I mean.

628
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,177
They're saying you're this year's band-aid.

629
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,555
- Is that how you feel?
- I was hoping for more than that.

630
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,390
This year's splint?

631
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,434
Hey, Miss Sampson.

632
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,102
Yo, he police.

633
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,068
I mean, the school system seems benign.

634
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:08,322
And I get the sense North Avenue
might give us some latitude, if not support.

635
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,283
- You think so?
- You sound doubtful.

636
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,413
You can tell the days by their faces.

637
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,457
The best day is Wednesday.

638
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,086
That's the farthest they get from home,
from whatever's going on in the streets.

639
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,962
You see smiles then.

640
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:26,381
Monday is angry.

641
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,802
Tuesdays, they're caught between
Monday and Wednesday,

642
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,179
so it could go either way.

643
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,808
Thursdays...

644
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,685
they're feeling that weekend coming.

645
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,729
Friday, it's bad again.

646
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,190
This is where I leave you.

647
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,072
Your class. Language arts, huh?

648
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,198
Yes.

649
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,576
Anyway, you should see it without me.

650
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,371
They behave differently
when I'm around.

651
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,040
No doubt.

652
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,478
What do you think this 20 stands for?

653
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,106
It's not the number of days
you've been suspended.

654
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:28,152
It's not the number of years
you'll spend in prison if you don't shape up.

655
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,946
It's 50% below average.

656
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,866
It's 30% below failure even.

657
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:38,954
But, really, it stands for the amount of interest
you're taking in your own future.

658
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,047
The next question is worth two points.

659
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,594
Who can tell me,
why was Clarence Mitchell Jr

660
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,929
- important to the civil rights movement?
- I know!

661
00:41:56,014 --> 00:42:00,017
And I can tell by Shalanta's smile,
she's gonna win for the blue team.

662
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,562
Did you see that one over there?

663
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,031
Anybody here DeShawn Price?

664
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,991
Never heard of him.

665
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,203
- What's your name?
- Herbert Brown.

666
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,163
This the roundup van, right?

667
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,457
Oh, yeah, here you go, my man.
Come on.

668
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,958
No, yo, no.

669
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,419
Yeah, see, Howard Brown.

670
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:30,422
That's my brother. He over
on McHenry Street if you want him.

671
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:34,927
I was just in school on Friday,
so I'm phat till October. Sorry.

672
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,554
- Hold up, my man.
- Nah, he's right.

673
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,432
School gets a certain amount of money

674
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,560
for each kid that shows up
one day in September

675
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,104
- and one day in October.
- One day?

676
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,566
After that, they don't lose
the government money, so we done with it.

677
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:52,152
Nah, man. School is school.

678
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,696
Yeah, well, I'm just trying to
school you, brother.

679
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,908
All right, which one of y'all still
need your September day?

680
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,704
Get it over with now,
we won't be messing with y'all later.

681
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,261
What up, Butch?

682
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,693
How do we begin?

683
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,029
You the one called the meet.

684
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:39,324
Why don't we begin by you respecting
my time and getting to it?

685
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,495
First of all, I heard you may be
under the impression

686
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,456
I was somehow involved
with the late Mr. Bell,

687
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,917
in his play against you
with Brother Mouzone.

688
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,253
I was no way involved.

689
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,215
Stringer came at me
to set up the parley with you.

690
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,426
He used me like he used y'all,

691
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,052
I feel the need to say.

692
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,888
It's said, then. Tip out on it.

693
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,183
Businessman such as myself
does not believe in bad blood

694
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,394
with a man such as yourself.

695
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:10,355
- Disturbs the sleep.
- I bet it do.

696
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,942
By way of amends, a proposition.

697
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,654
I know of a card game
on the West Side -

698
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:21,283
high rollers, lots of cash money,
boxcar-sized.

699
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,993
You trying to set me up, Joe?

700
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,913
You ever known me to be stupid?
I'm trying to make things right here with you.

701
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,540
How much we talking about?

702
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,835
If there ain't at least a few hundred K
in that room, I wish myself blind.

703
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,588
Serious, Joe.

704
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,717
I say again, have you ever known me
to be a stupid man?

705
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,762
- What are the strings?
- No strings.

706
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,431
- What's your cut, then?
- Quarter of the take.

707
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:51,563
I scope this and it don't look right,
I'm gonna come back on you now, Joe.

708
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,449
Where did everybody go?

709
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:10,624
- Which one of you is Sergeant Hauk?
- Sir.

710
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,668
- And you must be Dozerman.
- Yes, sir.

711
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:17,172
Welcome to Major Crimes.
I'm Lieutenant Marimow.

712
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,384
I see you just made sergeant

713
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:24,137
after driving the mayor around
for less than three months.

714
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,056
You must be a hell of a driver.

715
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,519
Anyone here? Greggs? Freamon?

716
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:34,231
Sydnor and Massey.
And they're on the street, making rips.

717
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,483
That's what we do here now.

718
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,403
We get on the street
and we rip and run.

719
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,988
Can you get with that, Sergeant?

720
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,907
The Western District way, sir.

721
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,208
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

722
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,061
Thanks for seeing me.

723
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,648
I understand you've heard
from Mayor Royce and Councilman Gray,

724
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,943
and I'd like to thank you
for being able to join in this process.

725
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,031
I don't expect to walk out
of this room today

726
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,535
with an endorsement from
the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance.

727
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,036
I don't.

728
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:31,955
But the point is...

729
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,000
I think I can be a better mayor
for Baltimore than the present one.

730
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,169
I voted for Clarence Royce
eight years ago.

731
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,629
I voted for him four years after that.

732
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,549
I felt there was promise in the man.

733
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,594
But now I'm disappointed.

734
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,804
I'm disappointed and I'm angry

735
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:51,600
at the crime and the waste and the damage
done to so many neighborhoods.

736
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,977
Not just in my district,
but on the West Side -

737
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,104
Pimlico, Cherry Hill,
Edmondson Village.

738
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,482
Wherever I go,
people want the same things,

739
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,567
they need the same things,

740
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,986
but they're just not getting them.

741
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,071
I'm gonna change that.

742
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:10,118
I'm not gonna ask for your vote now.
Maybe I haven't earned it yet.

743
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,245
But I am here to say
that when I am mayor,

744
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,081
my door is open to you,
regardless of who you endorse.

745
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,669
And I want you to remember
that I came here today to say these things.

746
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,425
Thank you.

747
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,387
Councilman.

748
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,182
Thank you for coming.

749
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:40,565
OK, I'm gonna need an APB
on a motherfucker named Tater.

750
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,199
Call Mr. Sweet ASAP?

751
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,495
Let me guess -
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance.

752
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:57,123
Uh-oh. She's catching on, boys.

753
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,170
Oh? What do you want?
Another methane probe?

754
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,131
Or some other
CSI bullshit that don't exist?

755
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,177
You're the primary
on the Braddock case.

756
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:12,430
The dead witness.
Norris is back in the rotation.

757
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,307
What?

758
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,356
You caught your first murder. Kudos.

759
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,783
Come on, man, damn.

760
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,952
Bam, bam!

761
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,746
Yeah. Do that to whoever be snitching.

762
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:40,250
- Who snitching?
- Don't know, but kids be snitching.

763
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,628
Rashid got suspended for tagging walls.
Y'all ain't heard?

764
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,589
Maybe he just get caught with a paint can.

765
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:49,050
Ms. Donnelly came
and pulled him out of the classroom. Bam!

766
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,721
- I'll see y'all later.
- You going past the gym?

767
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,140
All right, man. Peace, peace.

768
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,188
I ain't gonna tell you again.
Give me the remote.

769
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,027
Did y'all learn something today?

770
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,530
Y'all learn something today?

771
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,032
Yeah.

772
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,867
What y'all learn?

773
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,164
- I said give me the remote.
- Mm-mm.

774
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:20,707
Give it.

775
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,127
Math your favorite, right?
Start with it.

776
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,255
- I like math.
- Yeah, you good at it too.

777
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,384
Watched this show five damn times.

778
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,812
Hey, you good?

779
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,523
All right now.

780
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,781
So, it turns out the one girl...

781
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,492
200-something stitches
to close her up.

782
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:58,328
She's looking at a lot of rehab
and maybe more surgery.

783
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,039
The muscles in her face
don't even move right.

784
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,918
- How's the class seem?
- Like it didn't really happen.

785
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,421
They're still processing.
I know it doesn't seem so, but they are.

786
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,716
What about Laetitia?
What happens to her?

787
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,968
Nothing worse than she's already seen.

788
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,929
She'll probably go to a juvenile facility,

789
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,515
which is only a little worse
than her group home.

790
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,101
- She was in a group home?
- She grew up in the system.

791
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,228
Monday-to-Friday angry.

792
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,107
Last year, she was suspended twice,
and then expelled.

793
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,527
Chiquan wasn't positive though,
if you're looking for a silver lining.

794
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,070
Excuse me?

795
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,364
She didn't have HIV,
in case you were worrying.

796
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:44,290
Marcus. Boy, what are you trying to do?
You trying to get knocked out?

797
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,334
Drop your head, son.

798
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:48,503
Left up! Get that left up!

799
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,672
Pick your hand up. Damn!

800
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,425
Man, that boy listen to anyone?

801
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,680
All right, all right. Time, time.

802
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,099
Not bad, y'all. Not bad, Justin.

803
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,144
Marcus, you got to concentrate, man. Think.

804
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,895
All right?

805
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,482
Listen, I got tickets to the fights tonight,

806
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:10,900
Pikesville Armory.

807
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,027
Now, I was gonna
take Justin and Spider,

808
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:16,614
but Spider ain't been hanging out,
and, Marcus, I know you got your mother.

809
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,491
So, Michael,

810
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,369
you want to see the fights?

811
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,123
- You going?
- Yeah, I'm in.

812
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,295
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

813
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,672
Come on, get this headgear off.

814
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,600
What the fuck is that?

815
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,101
Souvenir.

816
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:46,978
What?

817
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:52,901
Trouble with doing it this way,
disappearing 'em and shit -

818
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,611
nobody knows.

819
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,326
I remember when I was a kid,

820
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,246
if you had a map of the world,

821
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:09,542
the playground over at Baker and Moreland
would be at the center of it.

822
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,170
And as I got older,

823
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,964
the playground just
kept on getting bigger,

824
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,217
went beyond the neighborhood.

825
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,805
Everything changes, you know?

826
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:25,517
One minute the ice-cream truck
be the only thing you want to hear.

827
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,861
Next thing, them touts
calling out the heroin

828
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,780
be the only thing you can hear.

829
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,250
What's that?

830
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,837
Workbook I need to use with this.

831
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,179
So you read from the small one
and answer questions in the big one?

832
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,223
Yeah, ain't no thing.

833
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,111
Yeah, I see that.

834
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,791
I see that.

835
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,151
All right, you see how
he keeping his hands up?

836
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,988
Look at his feet. Look at their feet.
See how they keep their feet moving?

837
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,576
See what I'm saying?

838
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,496
See how he stay in close?
That's how you take away his power.

839
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,833
- Yo, dude is cut.
- Yeah, man.

840
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,460
That's discipline.

841
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,338
You take care of your body,
your body take care of you.

842
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:24,093
Yo, I bet his woman is fine, man.

843
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,054
Yeah, I bet she is too.

844
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:33,061
Flush to the queen.

845
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,190
Full house.

846
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,570
All right, everybody,
let me see them hands, yo.

847
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:43,821
Hands.

848
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,323
Big man, back up.

849
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:50,787
I don't know about cards, but I think
these four-fives beat a full house.

850
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,122
Hey, yo, banker, cash me out, yo.

851
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,876
Boy, you want a head on that body,
you best hop to.

852
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,297
That's my money.

853
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,135
Man, money ain't got no owners,
only spenders.

854
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,722
I tell you something else -
I like that ring too.

855
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,146
Boy, you got me confused
with a man repeats himself.

856
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:30,368
This ain't over.

857
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:33,246
That's how you carrying it, Shorty, huh?

858
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,665
'Cause I can find your peoples

859
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,042
a whole lot easier
than they can find me.

860
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,755
Wear it in health.

861
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,175
No doubt.

862
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,018
Phew!

863
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:03,317
You see what I'm talking about, Justin?
That's the real deal.

864
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,903
You keep training, I'm telling you,
boy, you can get there.

865
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:10,283
See, the last fight was the best.
The Puerto Rican boy had a good left.

866
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,285
Yeah, shit was tight.

867
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,203
This it, right here on the right.

868
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,164
All right.

869
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,625
- All right now.
- I'll see you tomorrow, Coach.

870
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,307
All right, now, so you live over on...

871
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,225
Hey, my boy, what you doing?

872
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,561
- I'm gonna take you home.
- No, thank you.

873
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,564
Michael, come on now, serious.

874
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,941
Nah. No, thank you. I'm good from here.
