1
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,811
He was supposed to have
a breakfast date, right?

2
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,938
I mean, they told me that last night.

3
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,565
- Breakfast? Is that on the sched?
- It isn't,

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,569
but the lieutenant told me that he'd be doing
breakfast with someone down at the harbor.

5
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,989
I mean, if he ain't, I could go get this
gassed up at the Fallsway.

6
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,701
I hate this detail, man.

7
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,787
It's soft duty. Lotsa perks.

8
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,124
All this standin' around and wait.

9
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,375
You know?

10
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,713
Hoskins says I do the one year,
I'll make sergeant on the next list.

11
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,049
They told me, career-wise,
you can't do better than drive the mayor.

12
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:54,095
Shit, if you could make rank the right way,
I'll still be working Western drugs.

13
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,151
All right, fuck this, I'm gonna go look
for the lieutenant.

14
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,446
Anyone comes looking,
I'm back up on the second floor.

15
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:19,871
Sir?

16
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,583
I understood that the Mayor
might be going to breakfast at the harbor?

17
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,084
With Kweisi.

18
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,503
But that's up in the air, I thought.

19
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,965
Would you happen to know
where Lieutenant Hoskins is?

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,157
Sir?

21
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,166
Lieutenant?

22
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,461
Uh...

23
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,165
When you walk through the garden

24
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,167
Watch your back

25
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,837
Well I beg your pardon

26
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,548
Walk the straight and narrow track

27
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,134
If you walk with Jesus

28
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,594
He'll save your soul

29
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:04,225
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

30
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,769
He's got fire and the fury

31
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,522
At his command

32
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,275
Well, you don't got to worry

33
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,819
Hold on to Jesus' hand

34
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,530
We'll be safe from Satan

35
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,199
When the thunder rolls

36
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:23,536
But you gotta keep the devil

37
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,663
Down in the hole

38
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,503
Oh yeah, mm

39
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,051
We'll be safe from Satan

40
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,599
Gotta keep the devil

41
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,310
Down in the hole

42
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,564
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

43
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,442
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

44
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,777
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

45
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,697
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

46
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,325
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

47
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,368
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

48
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,761
You don't look happy, Detective.

49
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,846
We're about to raise some hell.

50
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,476
Maybe too much hell.

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,854
A state senator, two councilmen,

52
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,274
the City Development Agency,
all those developers...

53
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,068
Princes of the city.

54
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,528
Lester, tell me the thought
hasn't crossed your mind

55
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,864
that some kinda shit
could blow back on us, man.

56
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,910
Do you know what Theodore Roosevelt
said about hunting grizzly bears?

57
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,372
The thrill is in overcoming your own fear.

58
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,582
What was the thrill for the bear?

59
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,672
I should've run every one of these subpoenas
by my front office.

60
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:01,884
- That's not procedure.
- Fuck procedure, Lester.

61
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,680
My boss is running two points behind
in the polls with the mayor's support.

62
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:09,392
How is he gonna do if he pisses off Royce
and starts dropping off incumbent tickets?

63
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,978
Why do you care?

64
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,189
If Demper thinks I fucked him and he wins,

65
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,901
I will be at Central Booking
covering bail reviews.

66
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,987
If he loses to Bond,
a new front office comes in

67
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,072
and maybe they bounce the white girl back

68
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,366
and give the Narcotics Division
to one of their own.

69
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,034
It's Baltimore, Lester.

70
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,412
We're missing a couple of subpoenas.

71
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,664
We are?

72
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,502
Clay Davis and Andy Krawczyk.

73
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,337
I'm holding those till October.

74
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,048
- Oh, the hell you are.
- Lester...

75
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:45,428
we drop subpoenas on either of those guys
three weeks before the primary,

76
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,929
and all hell breaks loose.

77
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,723
- That's what I'm sayin'!
- Clay Davis

78
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,726
is Royce's deputy campaign chairman,

79
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,562
and the number-two man
at the City Legislative Caucus.

80
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,689
And Krawczyk is his number-one fundraiser!

81
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,609
You're giving me résumés and job titles.
I'm just following the money.

82
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,030
And we will follow it after the polls close.

83
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,240
We can drop a second batch of subpoenas.

84
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,118
There is no reason to do this now and risk...

85
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,912
A year ago, if we had gone
after these records,

86
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,291
City Hall would've stomped on this unit
and the subpoenas.

87
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,378
And a month from now,
after Royce is re-elected,

88
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,672
they'll do us the same way.

89
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,966
But right now,

90
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,968
with the primary coming,

91
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:30,931
they gotta worry about how they look,
how they behave.

92
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,851
Right now, they gotta worry about scandal.

93
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,484
You told me you wanted to do this a year ago,
but fresh cases got in the way.

94
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,823
You told me that.

95
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,247
Very clever, Lester.

96
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,166
You got it all figured, huh?

97
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,001
Me?

98
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,004
I'm just the police.

99
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,469
I saw the teachers' union
finally endorsed Royce.

100
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,471
You knew they were gonna.

101
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,395
What time's your first appearance?

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,358
Today? I meet up with you guys
at the SoWeBo forum.

103
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,693
And tonight, it's me and the kids
next to Tommy

104
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,029
at the Roland Park fundraiser.

105
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,539
Better speed things along.

106
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,041
A kick in the ass sometimes helps.

107
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,421
- B-5?
- No, Daddy, D-5.

108
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,299
You sure you didn't say B-5?

109
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,927
D-5. What did I hit?

110
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,637
Submarine.

111
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,015
Um...

112
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,893
E-6.

113
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,478
Miss.

114
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,401
- Just gimme ten minutes.
- You seen your schedule?

115
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,735
You ain't got ten minutes.

116
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,239
Norman, I got this pretty girl's
aircraft carrier boxed in.

117
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,825
- D-4.
- Ow!

118
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,328
- Hit.
- Tommy, for Christ's sakes.

119
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,455
Is there any way that I can win?

120
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,791
With the numbers what they are,
is there any way?

121
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,503
So if it's just a matter of playing out
the string, then that's what I'm gonna do.

122
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:29,091
That game's pretty much over, Norman.
But this game, this game right here,

123
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,052
this one could still go either way.

124
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,432
- H-11, sweetheart.
- Miss. D-3.

125
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,936
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire

126
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,314
I went down, down, down

127
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,691
And the flames went higher

128
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,068
And it burns, burns, burns

129
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,779
The ring of fire

130
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,907
The ring of fire

131
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,345
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire

132
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,555
I went down, down, down

133
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,641
And the flames went higher

134
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,560
And it burns, burns, burns

135
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:26,315
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

136
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,652
So I guess y'all getting what y'all need?

137
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,987
- Brianna keepin' y'all close?
- She come up with it.

138
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,823
Money comin' through
every month like she say.

139
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,409
All right, 'cause I'm standin' tall up in here.

140
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,663
They don't need to worry about me
an' I ain't need to worry about them.

141
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,332
- You a soldier, Bey.
- You know it.

142
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,002
Everything all right with my fishes?

143
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,630
You'd tell me if it wasn't, right?

144
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,383
The fish be fine. I mean, they fish, right?

145
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,343
How I know how they feelin' about shit?

146
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,387
- De'londa...
- They fine, Bey.

147
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,598
- Ask Namond.
- Cleaned the tank an' all, like you say.

148
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,183
Cleaned the filter too.

149
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,019
All right, all right. Check you out, though.

150
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,063
Getting some fuzz up there, huh?

151
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,774
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, whatever.

152
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,027
I know when I was a kid,
I couldn't wait till I started shaving.

153
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,407
One of the old heads on the corner say,
"Hey, little man, you wanna grow a 'stache?

154
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,201
"Next time you take a piss,
take some of that piss,

155
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,454
- "get it on your fingertips, do like this, here."
- Ugh.

156
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,291
- You do it?
- You damn right I did it.

157
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,750
Shit.

158
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,920
- What's going on with you, though, son?
- Ain't nothing.

159
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,214
- School about to start.
- Mm.

160
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,801
So what about Bodie and his boys?
They treatin' you right?

161
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,428
Yeah, he cool.

162
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,097
Boy, don't lie to your father.

163
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,142
He don't even show up for work
half the damn time.

164
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,728
- Bodie told me.
- I missed a few days. That's all, Dad.

165
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,689
And what money you do make,
you waste on nonsense.

166
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,109
And if you think I'm-a give you a dime
for your school clothes,

167
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,986
you better think again.

168
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,072
- What Bodie got you doin'?
- I'm a runner most days.

169
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,782
Everybody got to start somewhere.

170
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,826
You better listen to your father.

171
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,120
He ain't tell you 'bout that hair, though, huh?

172
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,333
Yeah, he said I gotta get it cut.
I like it this way.

173
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,502
Even the white police from three blocks away
gonna be able to spot you

174
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,171
from every other nigger out there.

175
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,215
They gonna say, "Look at the boy
over there with the pretty-ass ponytail.

176
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,011
"Get him." You think I'm bullshitting.

177
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,430
Either you real out there, or you ain't, Na'.

178
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,350
You see what I'm sayin'?

179
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,436
Hey!

180
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,647
Let me get some.

181
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,734
- Let me get some!
- Hey, you. Over here!

182
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,737
- $100!
- Thanks, mister!

183
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,281
- Thank you, Mr. Marlo!
- Thank you!

184
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,790
That's my money, yo!

185
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,672
Your name gonna ring out, man.

186
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,598
Manuel, tú empiezas enfrente.
Yo hago la parte de atrás.

187
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,519
- A Connie le gusta por atrás.
- No tanto como a ti, maricón.

188
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,524
Boy, you talk that shit better than me

189
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,901
and I been dealin' with
these Mexicans for years now.

190
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,904
I don't think they would call
what I'm speakin' Spanish, man.

191
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,073
Just a dirty word or two here or there.

192
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,283
Yeah, well. Once you can talk to these cats,

193
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,702
the only thing you need then is a truck, man.

194
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,914
Could be runnin' your own crew,
pickin' up fresh clients.

195
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,292
I mean, if we put in together,
we could be coverin' twice the ground,

196
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,794
makin' twice as much.

197
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,381
Nah, man, I got other obligations.

198
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,632
Oh, right.

199
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,343
You set to be the new Angelo Dundee.

200
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,928
I near forgot.

201
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:47,516
- Chinga a ti, pendejo.
- Chinga a la tuya, hijo de puta.

202
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,398
I thought you already went up to Mondawmin
to get your school shit, man.

203
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,942
Yeah, but not all of it. And my boy,

204
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,611
he need to pay for his own shit
and his little brother too.

205
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,364
The fuck this look like,
a Social Services office?

206
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,617
- Want a check, go the fuck up Rosemont.
- Come on, man, I'll work for it.

207
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,205
Na', I took you on out of respect
for your father, all right,

208
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,000
but I can't go hirin'
the whole damn neighborhood.

209
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,462
You can have my job
until you get enough for you an' Bug.

210
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,840
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, work for y'all, work for me, yo.

211
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,301
Po-po. Step the fuck off.

212
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,520
Looking for your man Lex.

213
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:37,357
I see his broom, but I don't see him.
Where's your number two been at?

214
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,152
- I ain't seen him.
- Since when?

215
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,571
I thought we were on better terms.

216
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,532
Or do you want me rolling past
lookin' for Lex every 15 minutes?

217
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,701
He come past, I'll call you.

218
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,078
I will.

219
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,553
If he come past.

220
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,265
I don't know.

221
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,309
They're spinning their wheels.

222
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,813
You know, poor Tony Gray,
pulling 20% of the black vote.

223
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,274
It's embarrassing.

224
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,860
Who knows what the fuck
Carcetti's trying to prove?

225
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:26,949
But I tell you, at the end of this thing, he's
gonna regret getting on the wrong side of me.

226
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,409
All right, now.

227
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,203
I got what you need, boy.

228
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,580
Clean tees, any sizes.

229
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:38,585
Lookin' for socks, briefs,
you lookin' for some dice, Zippo, cards,

230
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,671
come on over to the Rollin' Emporium.

231
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,840
You ain't gotta walk to Rite Aid.
Shit, Rite Aid comin' to y'all.

232
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,927
- What can I get you, baby?
- Fresh dice an' a pack of Trojans.

233
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,304
- All righty.
- You got Philly blunts too?

234
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,140
Bubbles got it all, dawg.
I'm the one-stop shop.

235
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,393
- How much is that?
- Six an' a bit.

236
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,020
- Thank you. Thank you kindly.
- A'ight.

237
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,315
Yes, sir, I see what you're lookin' at.
Two a deck, name brand.

238
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,569
- You can't beat that price.
- Yeah, let me get two decks, man,

239
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,737
and a white tee, double-X.

240
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,322
And give me the rest
of them paint cans too, man.

241
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,242
There you go. That's it?

242
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,996
- Yeah, what's that?
- How much the man owe, Sherrod?

243
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,007
- 13.
- Whoa, whoa. He asked for all the cans.

244
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,801
Three cans is 12, plus the other stuff.

245
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,596
It's 19. 19, sir.

246
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,433
You still gettin' off with a deal,
you didn't even have to move your feet.

247
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,686
My bad. 19, like he said.

248
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:42,190
Thank you very much.
He's an intern, I'm working with him.

249
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,652
But, ma'am, what I'm asking is

250
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,238
when was the last time you saw Lex?

251
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,199
Oh. Excuse me. Curtis.

252
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,535
Mm?

253
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,706
- Two days ago?
- I don't know where he at.

254
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,416
Three days?

255
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,171
- You mind I look around?
- I'd rather you leave my house be.

256
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,424
Well, Ms. Anderson...

257
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,307
your son is in trouble,
and I can tell you're upset.

258
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,560
But the best thing that you can do for him,
the best thing that he can do for himself,

259
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,562
is talk to me.

260
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,231
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

261
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,985
We know he's selling drugs.
And I'm gonna tell you...

262
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,363
I don't know nothin' about that.

263
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,908
But I'm telling you that I don't care
he's selling drugs.

264
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,827
I'm not even gonna bother with that.

265
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,668
I'm here because of a homicide,

266
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,836
and the way it looks right now,

267
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,757
your boy is running from the police
behind that killing.

268
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,550
I don't know where he at.

269
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,552
Ma'am...

270
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:13,490
Councilman, my people got only
cost-of-living bumps for four years.

271
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,993
Morale is at rock bottom.

272
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,539
All things being equal, you'd be our guy.
We like what we hear.

273
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,500
The polls say it's going to be Royce.

274
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,544
We endorse you now, we're out in the cold.

275
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:30,048
Bobby, this might be the chance to get in
on the ground floor of something better.

276
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,885
That may be true, Major. But for now, we're
gonna play the cards that we were dealt.

277
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,555
Councilman, if you were me...

278
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:41,268
I'd cover my ass and endorse Royce,
along with the teachers and the firefighters.

279
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,854
But I'd also tell my membership
not to get carried away.

280
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,399
I mean, it's one thing
for the police union to call out for Royce,

281
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,735
it's another thing entirely for off-duty cops

282
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,655
to be manning the mayor's phone banks
and polling stations.

283
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,617
I don't think any of my officers
will be too aggressive for anybody.

284
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,161
That much I can give you.

285
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:08,420
Best you could do, Tommy. Royce has got
all those fucks runnin' scared.

286
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,257
Yeah...

287
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,925
best I could do.

288
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,512
Call it a night, Tommy. You got a debate
to prepare for tomorrow.

289
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,181
Yeah.

290
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,599
Debate.

291
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,144
- Nothing matters more at this point.
- Let the truth set you free, Norman.

292
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,438
Nothing matters at all.

293
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,778
Thanks.

294
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,953
Go left.

295
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,122
Back.

296
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,292
Come on, boy, come on now.

297
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,252
Man, you better not be getting tired,

298
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,296
'cause you gonna get put to the test

299
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
- on Saturday night.
- I'm ready.

300
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,593
- Hey, Miss Johnson.
- Hey, Justin. Hello, Dennis.

301
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,679
- You're Spider's mother, right?
- Right, Sharon. Sharon Johnson.

302
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,474
- Your boy left here a while ago.
- I ain't looking for him.

303
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,353
He at his grandmother's.
I wanted to ask you something.

304
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,440
You know, my son is crazy about you.

305
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:14,653
All he talks about is boxing, bein' at the gym,
and what his coach been teachin' him.

306
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,614
Well, Spider's a good kid.
He really studies the sport.

307
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,992
Dennis, I am so grateful
for your interest in Spider,

308
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,537
I want to cook you dinner.
How about tonight?

309
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,414
Well, that is really nice, Sharon.

310
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,043
But the thing is, I got four of my boys
fighting this weekend,

311
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,088
and I got to train 'em really hard
these next few evenings.

312
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,924
You in here every night of the week.
What you do for fun?

313
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,302
Look here, you got to eat, right?

314
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,680
And you can look at me and know

315
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,267
I throw down in the kitchen...
among other places.

316
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,186
Yeah, I tell you what,

317
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,231
you fix me a plate and bring it over here,
I would love that.

318
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,941
That I can do.

319
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,196
He said what?

320
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,823
"Me?

321
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,576
"I'm just the police."

322
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,371
Like butter wouldn't melt in his mouth.

323
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,875
And the thing that I resent most,
that he's not just playing the system,

324
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,877
he's playing me.

325
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,629
Like I'm part of the problem.

326
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,758
You were gonna hold back the paper
for Davis and Krawczyk, right?

327
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,595
Only until the primary was over.

328
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,431
And now you feel guilty about it.

329
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,938
Did he do that thing where he stares at you
over the top of his reading glasses?

330
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,108
You know, with that look that says,

331
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,320
"I'm the father you never had,

332
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,948
"and I don't want to be disappointed
in you ever again."

333
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,118
It's not funny, Cedric!

334
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,205
Those subpoenas went out today!

335
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,750
The front office is gonna go batshit!

336
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,835
But you did it anyway.

337
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,591
I'm sorry, but shit, I'm just glad to see

338
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,010
Lester doing it to somebody other than me.

339
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,778
You holdin' us back, Sherrod.

340
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,656
I made a mistake, man. Why you trippin'?

341
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,618
If I can cut you loose
to handle the money,

342
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,788
we can cover twice the ground,
selling twice the merchandise.

343
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,666
More, what you call it, market share.

344
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,211
Instead I gotta keep your ass close.

345
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,463
You shoulda been promoted
to your own cart by now.

346
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,799
You keep on hittin' your dome
on the glass ceiling.

347
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,969
- Glass what?
- You gotta step up the math skills

348
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,596
if you wanna advance here in this enterprise.

349
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,015
Remember last spring when you tried
to take me to Harlem Park?

350
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,185
They couldn't find my records, Bubs.
They didn't want shit to do with me.

351
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,563
- They put you in a classroom, right?
- The teacher didn't look at me once.

352
00:21:55,648 --> 00:22:00,527
So you rolled out. An' who got hurt
behind that, huh? The teacher or you?

353
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,571
What's four times five plus six times seven?

354
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,701
See? See?

355
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,004
Fuck that shit, son.
I can't wait until school starts.

356
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,339
- You joking, right?
- Nah, seriously, son.

357
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,632
I can't wait to see all them girls,

358
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,385
see which ones got phat
over the summer, you know?

359
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,095
- Guess who I saw last week?
- Who?

360
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,014
Kwaneese Davis.

361
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,599
- Shit, you mean Cute-Ass Kwaneese?
- Uh-huh.

362
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,228
- She phat?
- Got titties too. Mm.

363
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,480
I'm definitely tappin' that pussy,
now, y'all watch.

364
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,775
I'm-a be all up in Kwaneese this year
like this, bangin' that...

365
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,069
Just like you tried to do last year, right?

366
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,321
Fuck you, nigger, I only halfway tried.

367
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,866
So, Michael, who you gettin' with this year?

368
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,534
Stankin' ass... What's her name?

369
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,037
- Tina.
- Tina. Tina Jenkins.

370
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,165
- Don't talk bad about Tina, man.
- I'm not sayin' nothin' bad.

371
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,752
I'm sayin' she be sucking dudes' dicks
in the boys' bathroom and shit.

372
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,211
I heard you, man.

373
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,756
She suck dick even better
than you do, Namond.

374
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,716
Ohhh!

375
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,217
What up?

376
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,554
- What up? What up, see?
- Jab him, man. Jab him.

377
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,141
Chill, chill, chill! Don't rip this shit.

378
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,393
I just bought this throwback.

379
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:20,190
Yo, Michael, son, if I ain't had this shit on,
I'd have fucked you up. Word up.

380
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,484
You little niggers ain't up to no good, is you?

381
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,360
Yo, what up, Monk?

382
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,821
Look here, first day
of school coming up, right?

383
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,281
Yeah, next week.

384
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,576
So y'all need, like, school clothes and shit?

385
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
Here.

386
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,246
Yo, what's this for?

387
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,583
What, you ain't hear me? For new clothes,
whatever else you need to get.

388
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,712
- Thanks, man!
- Damn, 200?

389
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,298
- Yo, thanks, Monk.
- Oh, you need to thank my man Marlo.

390
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,969
He ain't wanna see you little motherfuckers
going raggedy on the first day.

391
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,429
That Marlo?

392
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,974
- Naw, man, no thanks.
- You ain't gotta do nothing for it.

393
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,935
No, thank you, man.

394
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:03,024
Hey, yo, Mr. Monk?
I'll take his if he don't want it.

395
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,610
- I'll hold his for you...
- Yo, don't press, man.

396
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,362
Don't press.

397
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:14,869
Fuck is wrong with you, boy?
You too good for my money?

398
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:20,208
Or is you such a bitch-ass punk you worried
about where my money come from?

399
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,967
Yeah.

400
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,350
Ain't no thing, shorty. We cool.

401
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:55,076
You can't tell nobody.
Swear to me you won't spread this around.

402
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,661
And he saw you?

403
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,788
Yeah, he saw me.

404
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,749
Carv, I'm fucked in the ass
with a pineapple on this.

405
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,505
- What the hell'd you say?
- "Mr. Mayor,

406
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,383
"that's a strong dick you got,
and I see you know how to use it."

407
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,845
I didn't say shit! And I didn't wait for him
to say anything, either.

408
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,555
Shit, I'm never gonna make rank now.

409
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,100
I'll end up riding the boat
or some shit like McNulty.

410
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,276
This is way beyond my pay grade.

411
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,195
We need to get with someone
who knows politics.

412
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,613
Who do we know like that?

413
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,869
On crime, he knows you're coming,
so he'll set some traps

414
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,246
and lean on stats that say crime is down.

415
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,583
He'll also try to inoculate himself
by making it about you.

416
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,794
Like you're playing the race card
if you talk about drugs or violent crime.

417
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,006
He's hoping you'll back down.
But you come on twice as hard.

418
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,342
"Clarence Royce has not made this city safe."

419
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,306
Hey, Jen, what's up?

420
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,100
- You got a second?
- No, I got time, what is it?

421
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,436
- You forgot the check.
- Oh, no, you're kidding me.

422
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,313
You've got to pay it right away.

423
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,232
No, no, I got the number here, yeah.

424
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,276
No, I'll straighten it out straightaway. Yeah.

425
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,029
Shit.

426
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:17,075
I forgot to mail the check
to the fuckin' archdiocese.

427
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,119
My kid's gonna get tossed outta St. Albans
if I don't get my shit together.

428
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,664
Tommy. Focus.

429
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,252
He comes at me with race
and some bullshit crime stats.

430
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,755
I ignore the race thing and counter
by noting that homicides are up 15%

431
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,258
even though other violent crime stats
are down 12%.

432
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,761
I point out this does not make sense
unless Royce is cooking the crime stats,

433
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,555
making robberies, rapes
and assaults disappear.

434
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,308
I suggest the mayor is not telling
the truth about crime.

435
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,812
I conclude by declaring that it is
for all of Baltimore, every neighborhood,

436
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,983
that I'm making public safety
the cornerstone of my campaign.

437
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,027
Tomorrow night...

438
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,196
I will kick his ass.

439
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:58,866
But the next morning,
I still wake up white in a city that ain't.

440
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,208
Sister Theresa? Hey, how you doing?

441
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,877
Yeah, Tommy Carcetti.

442
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,922
Yo, Randy, man, you crack me up, son.

443
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:16,342
Running behind him talking about,
"I'll take his, Mr. Monk. Give his to me."

444
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,303
Listen, man, I could've used that extra.

445
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,931
I already spent all the clothes money
Miss Anna gave me on stuff to sell at school.

446
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,017
Yo, and plus Marlo wanted us to have it.

447
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,227
He want to show us
who callin' the shots out here.

448
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,147
- Michael, why you ain't take it?
- That ain't me.

449
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,941
- Say what?
- That owin' niggers for shit, man.

450
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,277
- That ain't me.
- I'll take any motherfuckin' money

451
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,571
- if he givin' it away now.
- Why?

452
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,157
Shit, your family
got more money than all of us.

453
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,952
Yeah, but my mom said she cuttin' me off,
she ain't buyin' me school clothes and shit.

454
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:46,247
You already took my job with Bodie, so...

455
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,960
- Gentlemen.
- Oh, my God.

456
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,628
- Shit!
- Oh.

457
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,422
Whoa.

458
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,508
Donut, you crazy, man.

459
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,470
Yo, Donut. You think you could steal us
one of them camper trucks?

460
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,556
You steal us a camper truck,
we can all go campin' in the woods.

461
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,932
I be scared in the woods.

462
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,477
I don't mean far like that.
I mean like Howard County.

463
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:11,522
Nah, nah, nah, man. The Ku Klux Klan
live in Howard County. I know that for a fact.

464
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:15,068
Nigger, my aunt live in Howard County.
Ain't no Ku Klux Klan there.

465
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,153
Nigger, you simple, I swear.

466
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,198
Hey, yo, Donut, drive me away
from these ignorant bitches, man.

467
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:23,076
You can't tell these niggers nothin'.
Move, motherfucker.

468
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,875
Can you see over the steering wheel?

469
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,252
You think he'll talk to me?

470
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:37,298
Use my name if you have to.
I had one of his sectors for eight months.

471
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,307
What's wrong with that picture?

472
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:50,186
Nigger, if there was a black one
in the parking lot, I would've took one.

473
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,773
Yo, knockos, knockos!

474
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,405
760 to K-G-A. I got a bail-out
at Calhoun and Mosher,

475
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:04,409
six to eight juveniles beating feet north
in the alleys around Calhoun.

476
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,452
10-4. K-G-A to all units...

477
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,788
I love this. Just like old times.

478
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:17,505
I don't need to chase these fucking
knuckleheads. I know half of 'em.

479
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,590
Shit, I know where they hang.

480
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,926
Besides, you're a little overdressed.

481
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,430
Let's just call this in
and go see the man about your thing.

482
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,455
Yo, yo, man, I ain't do nothin'!

483
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,040
- I ain't do nothin'!
- Then why you runnin'?

484
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,543
- 'Cause you chasin' me.
- Yeah, right. What's your name?

485
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,171
- I ain't do nothin'.
- What's your goddamn name?

486
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,797
- Randy.
- Randy what?

487
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,716
- Wagstaff.
- I know you ain't lying.

488
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,344
Wouldn't nobody make that shit up.
Put your hands against this fucking wall.

489
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,597
What do you know about hoppers
bailing from a stolen car?

490
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,307
Nothin'.

491
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,561
Little motherfucker. You slingin'.

492
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,313
- No. I swear to God.
- Hell you ain't.

493
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,315
How else you got 200 in your pocket?

494
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,317
My foster mother gave me that
to buy school clothes.

495
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,403
- Your foster mother gave you 200 cash?
- Yeah.

496
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,657
Tell her to come down to the Western,
and I'll give it back to her.

497
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,077
Beat feet, motherfucker,
before I lock your little ass up.

498
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,126
Don't be fucking lookin' at me. Move.

499
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,510
This right here is fire.

500
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:50,765
That said, I'm ready to serve 'em myself
and keep your names off the returns.

501
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,894
I've got my 20.
You two got to live in this department.

502
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,815
Fuck 'em where they live.

503
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,906
Let's go.

504
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,997
The price of steel being what it is,

505
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,708
that's gonna kill us if we can't
pass along the overage.

506
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,545
Mr. Krawczyk? Baltimore City Police.

507
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,256
- What's this?
- A subpoena for records.

508
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:28,135
You need these right now?
Because I'm kinda up to my ass in stuff today.

509
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,389
Honor it in a timely fashion.
I think that's the legal standard.

510
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,892
- No problem, Detective...
- Shakima Greggs.

511
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,478
You're with the city?

512
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,648
- Which unit?
- Major Crimes.

513
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,657
Senator.

514
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,665
- What the hell is this?
- Subpoena for records.

515
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,500
Sphinx Club?

516
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,796
- Man of the year.
- What kinda bullshit is this?

517
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,339
You people must be out your damn mind.

518
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,676
You were in the Sphinx Club?
My uncle used to tend bar over there.

519
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,846
- Marvin Thompson? Short guy...
- What is your name, Officer?

520
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,849
Detective Sydnor, sir.

521
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,062
Major Crimes?

522
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:23,065
Shit.

523
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,443
Enjoy your day, sir.

524
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,071
Son, we're gonna see about this.

525
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,292
That's it.

526
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,504
Yankin' that bitch.

527
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,384
Son, that's too much knuckle.

528
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,563
Why the fuck you keep callin' me?
But what I say, though?

529
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,482
He got the message, fool.

530
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:08,611
- Yo, Monk. Who that, man?
- Andre. Old Face Andre.

531
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,364
Here, let me holler at that dude.

532
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,823
Yo, check this out, man.

533
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,118
I'm gonna show you how you do this
right here, man.

534
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,953
Don't rush me on shit.

535
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,039
I'll get at you when I'm at you.

536
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:29,590
Yo, remember who you're talking to
before you say another fuckin' word.

537
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,394
Andre, man. Nigger need more maintenance
than both my babies' mamas.

538
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,983
By accident. It was accidental.

539
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,780
And the mayor doesn't say anything?

540
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,032
I think he's pretty mad.

541
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,368
I mean, Major, I only took this detail

542
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,328
to try and make sergeant on this list.

543
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:02,456
Kid, you made sergeant already.

544
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,959
Shit, if Royce gets re-elected,

545
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,129
you'll be a lieutenant in two years
and a major in four.

546
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,301
You go back down to the hall.
You act like it never happened.

547
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,554
You shut up.

548
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,347
Say nothing to no one.

549
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:23,519
- But the mayor, he's gonna...
- He's gonna watch and see how you carry it.

550
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,272
And, kid, you're a fucking rock.

551
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,400
When the mayor looks in your face,

552
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,819
he knows he can trust you with this.

553
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,740
And I'll bet in a couple of weeks,

554
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,159
he comes asking, real friendly-like,

555
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:42,163
"What are you looking
to do with the department? With your career?"

556
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,582
He's interested in you.

557
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:48,252
But he doesn't mention no blow job,
and neither do you.

558
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:53,007
Uh-uh. It just lays there like a bad pierogi
on the plate,

559
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,509
both of you pretending it ain't there.

560
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,639
What if he screws me over?
Bounces me to a midnight shift?

561
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,975
He does that, you will talk.

562
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:15,070
What I wouldn't give
to be in your shoes right now.

563
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:19,575
Kid, careers have been launched
on a hell of a lot less.

564
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,496
Just shut up and play dumb.

565
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,708
I can do that. No problem.

566
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,961
Thanks, Major.

567
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,506
Thanks for taking the time to meet me on this.

568
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,550
I mean, it's a weight off
my mind talking to you.

569
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,969
- It really is.
- Don't mention it.

570
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,640
Maybe you get a chance
to do me a turn one day

571
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,642
after you make rank, huh?

572
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,727
- All right.
- Yeah.

573
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,897
Oh, boy.

574
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,861
It's all good, Carv.

575
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:05,496
If some federal motherfucker comes through
the door, I say, "Hey, it's all in the game."

576
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,373
But a city police?

577
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,708
Baltimore City? Hell, no.

578
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:13,671
Can't be happenin', 'cause I know I have
raised too much goddamn money

579
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,339
for the mayor and his ticket.

580
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,802
Hell, no! Ain't no soul in the world
that fuckin' ungrateful!

581
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,764
- Calm down, Clay.
- Money laundering?

582
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,684
They gonna come talk to me
about money laundering?

583
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,310
In West Baltimore?

584
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:32,857
Shit. Where do y'all think I'm gonna raise cash
for the whole damn ticket?

585
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,276
From laundromats and shit?

586
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,654
From some tiny-ass Korean groceries?

587
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,449
You think I have time to ask a man
why he givin' me money?

588
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,493
Or where he gets his money from?

589
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:47,037
I'll take any motherfucker's money
if he givin' it away.

590
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,582
- I don't wanna know.
- I know you don't wanna know.

591
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,877
But I'm scratchin' an' clawin'
to get it done for you, Clarence.

592
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,546
For you and me and the rest of the team.

593
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,674
And who comes through my door
but a Baltimore City police

594
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,844
- lookin' to get up into my shit about it.
- Clay, we didn't know about that.

595
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,431
I'm sorry, I gots to leave up out of here
before I lose my damn mind.

596
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,891
Nobody knew about that.

597
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,977
You want to run a campaign with my money
pillowed under your ass,

598
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,480
you need your people
to back the fuck up, Clarence.

599
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,195
Krawczyk's on line one.

600
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,365
I'll jump on Burrell and Demper both.

601
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,952
- Find out what the hell's going on.
- Wait a minute. Erm...

602
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,331
That new driver, the bald-headed, white kid.

603
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,416
Where did he come in from?

604
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,710
- Hoskins brought him in, I think.
- Hoskins?

605
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,505
He doesn't have a better rabbi
in the department than that?

606
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,798
Why, you want to lose him?

607
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,384
Let me think about it.

608
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,108
Yeah, man, Officer Walker be shady like that.

609
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,944
Police be stealin', yo.

610
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,821
Yo, what I really wanna get
is a bubble Caprice.

611
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,573
I seen a nice one too.

612
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:08,118
'94 Caprice on 22s. Shit was tight.

613
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,329
You be careful.
They almost caught you today.

614
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,749
- Nigger, they ain't almost caught shit.
- Quiet, y'all.

615
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,378
- Y'all know who I am, right?
- Carver. You a knockos.

616
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,380
Today I'm auto theft.

617
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,716
Fair warning.

618
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:26,762
If I see any of y'all little hoppers
even smile at a motor vehicle again,

619
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,722
it ain't gonna be no juvenile hearing.

620
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,142
It's gonna be my people settlin' up with y'all
in the alleys. Understand?

621
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,144
- You can't do that, yo.
- Try me, Namond.

622
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,896
Yeah, that's right. I know your name.

623
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,234
I know where you live
and I know where y'all hang.

624
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,628
Damn, yo! Nice ride.

625
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,213
Damn.

626
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,799
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hm?

627
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:07,594
- You have any luck finding your shooter?
- Naw. He's runnin'.

628
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:12,141
But at least I know who my shooter is, right?
I just got to find the boy.

629
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,309
- Family won't go for nothin'?
- Nah.

630
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:18,439
Mother wouldn't say shit.
But it wasn't the usual way a mama lies.

631
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,941
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

632
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,278
It was a weird vibe, man. I can't explain it.

633
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,281
It was like she was off
somewhere else in her head.

634
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,535
Line four. Communication.

635
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,329
- Who's up?
- I'm up. I'll take it.

636
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:35,831
No, wait.

637
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,125
If it's yours, you lucky bitch,

638
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,961
then it's a domestic in a house with four wits.

639
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,046
You want the call?

640
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,924
But if I pick up that phone,
do I make it unlucky? Or is it still your call?

641
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,469
Look, you want the call, pick it up.

642
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,138
If you don't, don't.

643
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,142
Homicide. Norris.

644
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,810
Right.

645
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,353
Uh-huh.

646
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,938
I got it.

647
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,860
1400 Lanvale, in the street,
found by the post officer,

648
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,696
no suspects, no witnesses.

649
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,910
Ah, man.

650
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,415
Better to be lucky than to be good.

651
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,337
You wanna work the heavy bag?

652
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,256
Go ahead. Four rounds.

653
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,856
- Hey.
- Hey.

654
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,776
I'm Gail. I made this for you
and the other men

655
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,362
to let you know you're appreciated.

656
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,489
- That's real nice.
- Peach cobbler.

657
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,408
I'm sorry, I forgot whose mother you are.

658
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,453
I don't have any boys.
I just appreciate what you been doing,

659
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,664
you and the other coaches,
volunteering and all.

660
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,624
Well, thank you, that's real nice.

661
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,544
I got three girls. Y'all don't
teach girls, though, do you?

662
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:07,422
- No, I'm real old-fashioned about that.
- I agree wit' you.

663
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:10,092
Men should be men
and women should be women.

664
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,885
That's what I think.

665
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,102
Single wound, upper back, no casings,

666
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,187
no witnesses, and nothing on the canvas.

667
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,481
- Dead when you got here?
- Actually not.

668
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,984
He was conscious and coughin' blood
when I pulled up.

669
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,069
- You ask who shot him?
- Yeah, I asked who shot him.

670
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,113
He said it was a guy with a gun.

671
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:40,831
Yo, why the fuck
you keep calling me?

672
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,666
He got the message, fool.

673
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,336
- Yo, Monk. Who that, man?
- Andre. Old Face Andre.

674
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:51,925
- Yo, Monk. Who that, man?
- Andre. Old Face Andre.

675
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:55,095
Let me key that.

676
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,682
- Yo, Monk. Who that, man?
- Andre. Old Face Andre.

677
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,605
Yo, check this out, man.

678
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,400
Don't rush me on shit.

679
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,612
- I'll get at you when I'm at you.
- I'm just saying...

680
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,159
- Old Face Andre.
- Tryin' to re-up with Monk Metcalf.

681
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,369
Yeah, Monk took the call on his cellphone.

682
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,288
But that second voice ranked him.

683
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,000
- Ranked everybody, by the sound of it.
- Marlo Stanfield. On the phone.

684
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,086
The way he shut that call down,
I'd say, yeah, that was him.

685
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,631
But what was all that in the background?
Fireworks?

686
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,467
No, it was regular intervals.
Semi-auto from the sound.

687
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,843
Target practice, maybe.

688
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,512
Either that or a firing squad.

689
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:41,391
There are no bodies on this guy in months,

690
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:44,436
but we get him on the phone
and it sounds like a war zone.

691
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,813
Well, at least he gets on a phone
now and then.

692
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,524
- That's something.
- Sounds arrogant, doesn't he?

693
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,944
Like he's the little king of everything.

694
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,280
Ah, youth.

695
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,629
Yo, Bubs.

696
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,467
Thought you asleep.

697
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,345
If you want...

698
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,640
I could go to school some.

699
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,688
I ain't been for a while,
so I don't even know if I can.

700
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,192
But if you want me to go...

701
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,278
ain't no thing.

702
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:24,286
His Honor was mad?

703
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,413
I can't begin to describe it.

704
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,249
- What's he want from us?
- To block the subpoenas,

705
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:32,169
but he knows we can't
once those things go out.

706
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,504
What I could promise him

707
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,716
is no more surprises out of our shop.

708
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,885
Is this that cocksucker McNulty?

709
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:43,430
Not this time. He's been gone
from that unit a year.

710
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,892
My best guess would be Lester Freamon.

711
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,353
- Freamon?
- Lester's got a hell of a game.

712
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,271
Well, we need to sit on the motherfucker.

713
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,524
All that unit needs, Commissioner,
is proper supervision.

714
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,489
Hey, the State of Maryland just lost another
cooperating witness,

715
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,699
and I just found a lot of fucking overtime.

716
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:06,995
This case went from a who-gives-a-fuck
drug murder to straight-up red ball.

717
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,627
Fuck, I should've picked up that phone.

718
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,550
Hey, Sarge. My boy's a witness.
Drug case pending in part 18.

719
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,886
You know for sure he's killed for that reason?

720
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,054
Don't know shit.

721
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,890
But from the look of the court computer,
this guy's the state's whole case.

722
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,975
Don't put it in the 24
that the guy was a witness.

723
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:32,813
Trust me, we do not wanna
kick shit in an election year.

724
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,523
Work the case, take the OT,

725
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,275
but bury the witness angle
till we know for sure.

726
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,071
And close the door.

727
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,587
Yeah.

728
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,297
It's Landsman. Homicide.

729
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,383
Is the major in this morning?

730
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,885
Next order of business, class rules.

731
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,931
It helps if the team is constant on these.
Less wiggle room for the children.

732
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,101
- Mrs. Scott?
- Same as last year, double space.

733
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,562
Language Arts.
We grade a lot of papers.

734
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:16,440
It doesn't make them write any better,
but it saves my eyesight.

735
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:17,983
Demonstrate it for them.

736
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:21,111
Some of them think double space
means more space between words.

737
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,698
- I'd have thought by eighth grade...
- Rule of thumb here, Mr. Pryzbylewski,

738
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,866
never assume.

739
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,453
Explain what you want them to do,
have them do it, then explain again.

740
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,746
With time and patience, they'll get it.

741
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,791
- Mrs. Shapiro?
- It's easier to keep track of lab work

742
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,793
if we all use the same heading.

743
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,296
Upper right-hand corner,
above the first blue line,

744
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,966
name, date, and class number, in that order?

745
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,635
Mr. Pryzbylewski, do you have
anything you want addressed?

746
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,138
Can we have them not chew gum?

747
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,140
They won't do it in Ms. Sampson's class,

748
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,642
but in four years,
I have not been able to stop them.

749
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,645
You can try, but first year,
it's best to stick with basics.

750
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,940
In team rules, we can only go
with what we can all enforce.

751
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,568
Also, keep your windows closed.

752
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,653
Makes them drowsy, and drowsy's good.

753
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,740
There's a lot to learn. But for now,

754
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,993
build in lots of activities in your lesson plan,
you can't have enough.

755
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,079
You keep them busy,
you keep them off-guard.

756
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,752
You need soft eyes.

757
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,171
Excuse me?

758
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:28,053
Yeah, but that doesn't prevent you
from giving more under your wife's name,

759
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:31,515
your children, if they got
separate accounts, yeah.

760
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,685
Sorry, Richie,
can you hold a moment?

761
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,897
Your buddy from the FOP.
And he says it's important.

762
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,024
Hey, Stan.

763
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,693
I'm a little busy losing an election here.

764
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,862
You remember about six months ago,

765
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:49,199
you told me to keep an eye
for any witnesses gettin' clipped?

766
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,951
You remember that?

767
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,038
Who's better than me, Tommy?

768
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,709
Hey, Richie, can I call you back?

769
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,127
Thanks.

770
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,593
Anything else you want me to do,
Miss Donnelly?

771
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,220
Uh...

772
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,682
- You live near Duquan Weems, correct?
- Dukie?

773
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:18,019
- I want you to take this to his house.
- Them clothes won't stay clean long.

774
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:21,565
Make sure you deliver them just to Duquan,
not any of the adults in the house,

775
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,775
- just Duquan.
- Want me to do it tonight?

776
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,236
That would be great.
And, Crystal, thanks for today.

777
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,072
You're welcome, Miss Donnelly.

778
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,615
- Can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am.

779
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,909
This young man has to be
registered for school.

780
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:35,579
- Does he attend here?
- He should.

781
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,623
What I mean is, what grade
were you in last year, dear?

782
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,544
He kinda lost his way some time ago.

783
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,087
He's livin' with me now.

784
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,215
- And you are his...
- Uncle. I'm his uncle.

785
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,759
Come into my office.

786
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,352
Thank you. Excuse me.

787
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,025
To your right. To your right.

788
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:07,110
One, two, one, two.

789
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,570
One, two, yeah.

790
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,705
Yo, look at coach workin' it, yo.

791
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,792
All right!

792
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:26,171
All right, man, break.
That's what I like to see, baby.

793
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,131
You gotta use that left a little more.

794
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,801
- Yo, man, you finished?
- Got another two minutes.

795
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,304
Fuck that, I got a fight coming up.
You can come back later.

796
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,015
- Man said he got one more round.
- Step aside, young'un.

797
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,809
Naw, man, bag is mine
for four rounds and I only did three.

798
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,145
- Fuck that.
- Yo.

799
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,938
What the fuck you tryin' to prove, huh?

800
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,441
Come on, man, come on.
What's going on, boy?

801
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,652
I got a fight Saturday,
an' the boy won't get off the bag.

802
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:52,739
What the fuck he on the bag for anyway?
He don't even fight. He don't even spar.

803
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,700
- Spar with your ass any day.
- Come on, then.

804
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:59,329
Y'all be cool, you hear me?
I ain't putting up with this foolishness.

805
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,831
Come here, Michael.

806
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,584
- I can work the bag now, right?
- Not yet. Just wait.

807
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,920
- You said four rounds.
- Yeah, I know what I said.

808
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,340
You finish up your rounds,
and then Justin gets on.

809
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,384
I don't want hear no more street talk.

810
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,052
We boxin' up in here, we ain't fightin'.

811
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,346
He wanna get in the ring with me,

812
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,724
- we can go.
- Look here, let me tell you something.

813
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:22,018
You can come here, work out,
use the equipment.

814
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:25,188
But nobody gets in that ring
unless they're being trained.

815
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,273
You wanna be trained?

816
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,193
I've been watching you hit that bag.

817
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,364
You got a natural right hand,
the way you throw it, the way you land it.

818
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,991
Now, if I was to train you,
we'd have to start with floor work.

819
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:41,705
'Cause see, if you don't know how to move,
you ain't got no business being in that ring.

820
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,456
So what you think?

821
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,458
I'd train you myself, personally.

822
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:52,048
Nah, really, I just wanna keep doing
what I been doing.

823
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:53,508
All right.

824
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,392
Let's see that right. Uh-huh.

825
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,116
Is Dukie here?

826
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,994
What's that? That's for Duquan, right?

827
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,704
I take it to him.

828
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,123
Gimme.

829
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,459
Hey, Crystal.

830
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,544
Miss Donnelly said to give you these.

831
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,337
OK. I'll be right down.

832
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,175
What?

833
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,261
And for either of my opponents to suggest

834
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:42,932
that downtown development comes
at the expense of our city's neighborhoods,

835
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:47,061
well, that's just unfair and divisive.

836
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:50,190
For them to suggest
that my administration

837
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:53,276
has not been responsive, well...

838
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,779
Economic development
cannot be a Band-Aid.

839
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,491
It is a long-term process
that requires commitment

840
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,452
to retraining our workforce
and, as I said before,

841
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,413
this can only be successful
in a city where people feel safe.

842
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:09,125
So before we can begin to think
about luring new industries to Baltimore,

843
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,628
we need to think about
how we can make these neighborhoods

844
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,963
and this city safe once again.

845
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:18,384
Mr. Carcetti may think
it's in his interests to exploit people's fears.

846
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,888
He's been doing it throughout this campaign.

847
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,141
I'm offended by it, personally. But the fact is,

848
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:28,728
that violent crime is down city-wide,

849
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:32,690
and our police department
is working hard to keep it that way,

850
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,735
and will continue to do so
under my administration.

851
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,780
Councilman Carcetti,
you have two minutes to respond.

852
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,784
Does anyone in this room really believe
that crime is down in Baltimore?

853
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,160
You calling me a liar, Tommy?

854
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:46,454
Gentleman, please. No personal interactions.

855
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:49,332
- Councilman Carcetti.
- Can the mayor honestly tell

856
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,835
the people of Rosemont,
of Belair Edison,

857
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:56,089
of Highlandtown or Cherry Hill
there's less drug-dealing, less violence?

858
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,550
Any statistics coming
from the police department

859
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:02,178
cannot be trusted, because under this mayor,
the police are more concerned

860
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:05,431
with protecting Clarence Royce politically
than fighting crime.

861
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,434
There's no leadership
and morale has never been lower.

862
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,727
I'll change that.

863
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:12,105
It's business as usual down at City Hall

864
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,607
and as a result, our response to crime

865
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,151
has been characterized time and time again

866
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,612
by wanton indifference.

867
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,072
..32 yards!

868
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,450
What do I mean by business as usual?

869
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,703
What do I mean by wanton indifference?

870
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:31,124
Well, last night
in West Baltimore, on Lanvale Street,

871
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,751
another citizen was shot and killed.

872
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:37,547
This victim was a key witness
in a drug case that had yet to come to court.

873
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,717
Courageously, this man had agreed to testify

874
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,510
in two weeks' time in that case.

875
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:46,764
The police should have been protecting him.
They were not, and he was murdered.

876
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,517
- Oh, shit.
- Why? Because this mayor...

877
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:53,521
- You're prime-time, Eddie.
- ..would not spend the money to protect him.

878
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:55,440
Now I have no doubt
that in a moment or two

879
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,443
Clarence Royce will accuse me
of exploiting this man's death

880
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:03,197
for my own political purpose,
but the truth is, a year ago

881
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:06,326
I wrote the mayor a letter.
I have copies for anyone who wants one.

882
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,413
I begged him to spend the money
and make witness protection a priority.

883
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,581
He ignored me.

884
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:15,418
I even teamed up with our legislative leaders,
Delegate Watkins and others,

885
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,588
to get matching funds
for witness protection approved in Annapolis.

886
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,798
And incredibly those matching funds

887
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,717
were never claimed by this administration.

888
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,094
Now to mention this now may be exploitive,

889
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,555
I don't know, I only know it's true,

890
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,558
and on such truths I ask the voters of our city

891
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:32,977
to consider a change.

892
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:41,277
Folks, please, hold your applause
until after the round of questions is over.

893
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:42,487
Mayor Royce?

894
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,989
No more surprises, huh?

895
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,577
I am unaware of the specifics
of the incident

896
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,663
to which Councilman Carcetti is referring,

897
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:55,249
so I can't answer that directly,

898
00:54:55,334 --> 00:55:01,172
however, I can say
that this city places the highest priority

899
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,258
on protecting those citizens
who come forward to testify,

900
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:07,178
and we will continue to do so.

901
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:11,182
Mr. Carcetti states that he wrote a letter

902
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,268
expressing his concerns,
and I'm sure that he did.

903
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,063
I mean, it's easy enough to write letters

904
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,732
when all you have to do is write letters.

905
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,111
But when you are required

906
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,738
to run a city

907
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,574
on limited resources,

908
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,910
and balance priorities,

909
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,830
well, then...well, then you understand

910
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:38,084
that writing letters
will not solve the problem, oh, no.

911
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,879
Shit, girl.

912
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,674
You know I'm-a roll wit' you.

913
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,177
I need some kinda break.

914
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,264
Mm-hm.

915
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,823
Oh, shit.

916
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:26,299
Ain't nothin' worse than them bitches
with fucked-up nails at the blackjack table.

917
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:28,926
You know.

918
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,971
Hold on.

919
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,267
You think my son ain't gonna go up
to that school lookin' like himself?

920
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,484
I don't believe we can get a handle on crime

921
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,611
until we get a handle on the schools.

922
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,780
Because we need to be
thinking about these kids

923
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,823
before the corners take them.

924
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,201
And this means a renewed focus
on our schools...

925
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,001
Oh!
