1
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,594
Come on!

2
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:16,427
On this Sunday before the primary

3
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,224
when we will go to the polls
to exercise our blessed franchise,

4
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,228
our lesson comes from Exodus, chapter 18.

5
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:32,109
"And it came to pass on the morrow
that Moses sat to judge the people:

6
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,615
"and the people stood by him
from the morning unto the evening.

7
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,118
"And Moses judged the people.

8
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,706
"And he shouldered
this tremendous burden all alone.

9
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,126
"And one day, his father-in-law said to him,

10
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,588
"'Moses, why do you carry

11
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,300
"'this awesome responsibility by yourself?

12
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:02,306
"'You need other wise men to help you rule
justly over the people.'

13
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,936
"So Moses hearkened to the voice
of his father-in-law,

14
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,107
"and chose able men to rule over the people."

15
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,610
- Can I preach it like I feel it?
- Yes!

16
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,446
Hey, hey, hey.

17
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:24,453
This Tuesday, when we choose
the men and women who will lead our city,

18
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:29,083
we would do well to keep
those standards in mind.

19
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,631
Men of truth, who fear God
and hate covetousness.

20
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,509
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

21
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,525
God bless you.
Good to see you.

22
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,319
- How you doing?
- Just fine.

23
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:00,072
- How's Mama? Tell her I said hello.
- Fellowship committee at 2:00?

24
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,616
- If I'm late...
- We'll wait.

25
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,286
All right. Thank you for coming,
young man, young lady.

26
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,623
- Reverend.
- Councilman. Mrs. Carcetti. How are you?

27
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,334
- Thank you so much.
- Interesting sermon.

28
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,629
- Polls show you have a chance.
- We're within the margin of error.

29
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,131
Margin of error. Interesting phrase.

30
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,259
And I see you've got
Delegate Watkins working the crowd.

31
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,721
- I hope he's not going to be the only one.
- I'll tell you what,

32
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:28,517
I will keep an open mind until I walk
into that booth on Tuesday and if you win...

33
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,854
You're holding me to a high standard.
Moses? I mean, Jesus...

34
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,105
Tommy.

35
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,400
- I'm sorry. I can't believe I said that.
- Moses will do for now.

36
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,362
We'll save Jesus for your second term.

37
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,365
Have a good one.
Thank you so much for coming.

38
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,210
When you walk through the garden

39
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,045
Watch your back

40
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,714
Well I beg your pardon

41
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,592
Walk the straight and narrow track

42
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,887
If you walk with Jesus

43
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,347
He'll save your soul

44
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,936
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

45
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,147
He's got fire and the fury

46
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,233
At his command

47
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,194
Well, you don't got to worry

48
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,530
Hold on to Jesus' hand

49
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,533
We'll be safe from Satan

50
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,202
When the thunder rolls

51
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,205
But you gotta keep the devil

52
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,582
Down in the hole

53
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,548
Oh yeah, mm

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,096
We'll be safe from Satan

55
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,601
Gotta keep the devil

56
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,979
Down in the hole

57
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,608
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

58
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,361
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

59
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,739
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

60
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,575
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

61
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,202
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

62
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,288
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

63
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,570
- Signs o' life?
- Not even a lookout.

64
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,656
- Maybe they went to church.
- Our Lady of the Re-up.

65
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,909
He'll show up sooner or later.

66
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,745
- Call me.
- All right.

67
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,544
Vote for Carcetti.

68
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,422
Vote for Carcetti on Tuesday.

69
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,716
Tommy Carcetti running for mayor.

70
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,429
Hello, Councilman. I've been following
your campaign. I'm a teacher.

71
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,431
- Excellent.
- High-school biology.

72
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,308
- In the city?
- Baltimore County.

73
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,479
I think your position on school-board reform
is very encouraging.

74
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,607
- So you'd vote for me?
- If I lived in the city, I would.

75
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,818
- Good luck on Tuesday.
- Thank you.

76
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,904
Carcetti for mayor!

77
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,782
- They're all fucking county people.
- We're almost done here.

78
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,035
- Thomas, look at this.
- What's that?

79
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,412
Check it out.

80
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:40,417
- Did you ever represent a Bobby Harrison?
- The slumlord? Fuck, no.

81
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,836
I don't remember ever meeting this guy.

82
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,382
"Carcetti got the most serious charges
dismissed and the others reduced.

83
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,218
"The slumlord walked free
with a slap on the wrist

84
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,513
"while hundreds of tenants
suffer substandard conditions."

85
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,098
Last-minute smear. They're scared.

86
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,474
- Royce.
- Who else?

87
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:59,770
65% of the city rents.
Bobby Harrison's name is dirt in this town.

88
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,856
Two days before the election
and they smear me?

89
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,899
Courthouse steps.
When the fuck was this taken?

90
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,318
- It's a fake. They Photoshopped it.
- Can we prove that?

91
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,820
- We can try.
- Try, shit.

92
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,947
- I'm gonna lose behind this.
- Easy, Tommy.

93
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,491
We always figured
they'd pull some last-minute shit.

94
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,161
- At least now we know what it is.
- Fuck.

95
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,248
I want you to remember,
you're representing your dad.

96
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,834
Yeah, I know.
What she wanna see us for, anyway?

97
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,587
Maybe she got somethin'
special in mind for you, boy.

98
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,131
- Hm, cool.
- She's a Barksdale.

99
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:32,261
She know talent when she sees it.
Besides, they owe this family a lot.

100
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,473
- Your daddy, he stood tall for them.
- I know, I know. He a soldier.

101
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,893
- Like father, like son.
- No doubt.

102
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,774
- What time you got?
- Half three.

103
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,152
Motherfucker late.

104
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,529
Yo!

105
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,200
It's for you, Marlo.

106
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,953
Yeah, speak.

107
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,372
You on it.

108
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,334
As long as she hit her mark, we straight.

109
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,380
What time I gotta pick up
that skinny girl?

110
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,717
A'ight.

111
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,724
- So what time they say?
- Tomorrow night.

112
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,977
She be on the 8:45 from New York.

113
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,604
Yeah.

114
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,732
- We can take care of that.
- No. I'll do it.

115
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:31,237
- Don't want nothin' to go wrong.
- You sure about that?

116
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:35,074
It's a'ight.
You can hang back on this.

117
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,455
- Yeah, I think I got this one, too.
- Marlo Stanfield.

118
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,333
He ain't so much.

119
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,961
Using cell phones and shit.

120
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,755
What's he sayin' now?

121
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,844
"What time I gotta pick up the skinny girl?

122
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,809
"I do it.

123
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,106
"Don't want nothing to go wrong."

124
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,025
Maybe he's picking up a girlfriend?

125
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:14,238
"Skinny girl from New York"?
It's code. Cocaine.

126
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,492
Damn. For Marlo himself
to get near a package...

127
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,744
He's a mope. I told ya.

128
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,455
- So what do we do about it?
- Work up some counter lit.

129
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,791
That's why we have
a printer on retainer.

130
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,503
Best if we run down the original photograph.
If we prove this one's a fake...

131
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,673
I didn't work at Sun Papers for 22 damn years
not to know somebody.

132
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,633
I'll call Paul McCardle at the photo library.

133
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,636
- And if we still can't find it?
- We put out a fake photo of our own.

134
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,639
Show Royce in a motel
with a dead girl and a live boy.

135
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,600
We can't sling mud back.
Not this late.

136
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,019
Relax. I'm kidding.

137
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,896
You get back on your schedule.
Hit all your stops.

138
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,108
Go to that donors' dinner
tonight and make nice.

139
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,735
We'll take care of this.

140
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,990
You can't do this to us.
Bey took the weight for all y'all.

141
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,950
You've been amply compensated.

142
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,328
- But time moves on.
- Not for Bey, it don't.

143
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,247
What I meant to say is there's
no more money coming in.

144
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,623
No more business.

145
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,084
Avon is gone. So are his people.

146
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,502
Shit.

147
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,172
You seem to still be doin'
all right for yourself.

148
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,092
There's nothing more I can do for you.

149
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,845
Bey know everything.
You forget that?

150
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,473
And what's he gonna do?
Who's he gonna tell?

151
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,475
And what do I care if he does?

152
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,977
Bey never heard me say
a damn thing about business.

153
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,312
What about your brother?

154
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,899
Avon could be gone longer
if Bey gets to speakin' his mind.

155
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,817
I couldn't care less about Avon.

156
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,992
The thing is, I wanted
you both to hear it from me

157
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,787
so there ain't no lies from here on in.

158
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,956
She even paid enough over the last two years

159
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,542
that you should have enough
money going forward, son.

160
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,170
Your father has not been
disrespected here.

161
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,506
You both got what was coming.

162
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,925
But ain't nothing lasts forever.

163
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,223
Jailhouse snitch?

164
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,350
Called last overnight. Worden talked to him.

165
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,976
Says for a deal, he can give us the case.

166
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,938
- No shit.
- Gonna write up a writ,

167
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,940
send it over to the State's Attorney's office,

168
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,317
get them to sign off on it first thing tomorrow.

169
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,819
What's the rush?

170
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,905
We jump on this. We cause a major shit stink
before the election.

171
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,990
If this guy really knows why the witness...

172
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,909
- Braddock.
- ..was killed...

173
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,661
Might be bad for the mayor.

174
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,997
- If it's not bad for the white boy, Carcetti.
- You care, either way?

175
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,834
Fuck no. I don't give a shit either way.
I don't even vote.

176
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,044
But it'll be fun to fuck
with them downtown suits.

177
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,671
Maybe get you on the 11:00 news.

178
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,674
Get a little payback
for all that shit they put you through.

179
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,847
With only two days left
before the primary,

180
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:49,518
campaign officials traded charges today
over a controversial flier distributed

181
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,895
in some African-American neighborhoods.

182
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,273
What seemed to be a secure lead
for the incumbent mayor

183
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,525
has evaporated in recent days.

184
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,111
The latest Sun-WQMD poll

185
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,991
shows the two men in a virtual dead heat
with Councilman Tony Gray trailing.

186
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,329
Four per cent of the likely voters
are still undecided, and with the prime...

187
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,585
I can't wait for it to be over.

188
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,086
Yeah, me either.

189
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,673
Can that flier hurt you?

190
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,387
You know, we found
the original photo in The Sun's files.

191
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,142
They grafted my puss onto some perp-walk
shot on the courthouse steps.

192
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:35,355
- I'm standing where a sheriff's deputy was.
- My God. What a nasty business.

193
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,568
Royce swears he had nothing to do with it.
Claims it must've been somebody freelancing.

194
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,864
Well, Norman and Terri say not to worry.
It's all in the game.

195
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,912
You know, when I was 15 points behind,
I was resigned, you know?

196
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,958
A landslide, I could live with that.
What else did anyone expect anyway?

197
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,921
White guy running for mayor in Baltimore?
But this?

198
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,593
Jen, if I lose this here by two points,
it's gonna kill me.

199
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,387
It's gonna just fucking kill me.

200
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,606
- You gonna have to step up now, Na'.
- A'ight.

201
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,566
Be the man of the family.

202
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,111
You older than your daddy was
when he went out on the corner.

203
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,198
That's what I been sayin'.
Damn. He quit school.

204
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,618
- You ain't quittin' school. Not yet.
- Ma.

205
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:34,831
But you are goin' out on your own.
You gonna ask Bodie for a package.

206
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,253
- What if he say no?
- I ain't take no for an answer.

207
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,340
- Just did.
- What you mean?

208
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,969
- From Brianna.
- Hand me the damn phone.

209
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,391
What she say about you already
gettin' paid enough?

210
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,477
She a lyin' bitch, Namond.
You see?

211
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,397
There's a lot about this world
you just don't know.

212
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,237
What it come down
to is she know you ain't gonna snitch.

213
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,073
- No matter what shit she pull.
- She got that right.

214
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,785
She takin' advantage of you, Bey.
She takin' advantage of you.

215
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,122
Sound like she got it all figured.

216
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,334
Bitch got it figured out, all right.
She cuttin' us loose without notice. Nothin'.

217
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,837
Like comin' home,
findin' our shit in the street.

218
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,382
She don't give a fuck
about you, Avon, none of it.

219
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,678
She had the nerve to talk to me on this,
like she gonna set things straight

220
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,805
so I don't tell no lies.

221
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,945
Jen, I'm sorry. He said he'd be up.

222
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,489
He's already gone to the office.

223
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,867
Well, what's he doing there?

224
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,536
He couldn't sleep.
He's been there for hours.

225
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,913
Aw, shit. See ya.

226
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:06,882
We still have a shortage of officers willing
to work secondary at the polling stations,

227
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,552
so we're asking for anyone interested
to contact Tactical this afternoon.

228
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,807
Next order of business: fresh warrants,
beginning with murder and weapons charges

229
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,726
on one Omar Little.

230
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,771
- Anyone know this mutt?
- Oh, yeah!

231
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,108
- Who'd he kill?
- Some lady in a store.

232
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,444
- Reads like a taxpayer.
- A taxpayer?

233
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,821
He's charged with felony homicide,

234
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,740
to wit: murder in the commission
of a robbery.

235
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,117
About time someone got
some paper on that motherfucker.

236
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,954
Anyhow, we got no fixed address,
no known abode.

237
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,792
If apprehended, contact Detectives Holley
and Crutchfield in Homicide.

238
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,335
You wanna find Omar Little?

239
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,838
Look for a corner boy running away
from a corner with shit in his pants.

240
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,594
You ever know Omar to do a citizen?

241
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,264
Anyway, pass these around.

242
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,150
Jesus, Tommy.

243
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,986
I went over the latest data,
rearranged the schedule.

244
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,697
A little bit of knowledge...

245
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,365
A bunch of middle class black precincts

246
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,534
are strong on Tony
but have a high undecided.

247
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,953
- We can pick up votes...
- Those people hate the mayor.

248
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,456
- You're gonna get those votes, or Gray will.
- We go door to door today.

249
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,335
- As long as they don't go to Royce.
- I need black votes if I'm gonna be mayor.

250
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,795
I need some kind of mandate
from that community.

251
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,964
If I sneak in with a bare plurality...

252
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,467
- We might just win.
- What do you think kept me up all night?

253
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,345
With all due respect
to your early-morning analysis,

254
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,140
we got three back-to-back drive-time

255
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,809
radio interviews I wore out
my kneepads to get.

256
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,562
The people running your campaign
are professionals, Tommy.

257
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,648
Don't try this shit at home.

258
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,360
You know, there might just be a job for you
in a Carcetti administration.

259
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,406
- Press secretary, chief of staff.
- Oh, get in the fucking car.

260
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,870
Duquan?

261
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,498
- Mr. Prez.
- Can you come with me, please?

262
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,001
What'd I do?

263
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,847
Get here early.
I'll let you in, and you can shower.

264
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,519
My dirty clothes?

265
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,483
Put 'em in this bag,
leave 'em in the locker.

266
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,152
I'll bring 'em home and wash 'em.

267
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,865
Go ahead and get cleaned up.
You'll be late for class.

268
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,301
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Monnel.

269
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,555
- Skanky ho.
- Damn, she good, though.

270
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,265
Yeah. You right about that.

271
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,060
Hey, yo, Tiff, baby.
I got 50 Cent too.

272
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,436
Fuck y'all.

273
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,647
Damn. All three at once?
You know she could.

274
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,649
I know you could.

275
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,572
- Sir.
- At ease.

276
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,119
I hate it when the bosses creep
below the eighth floor.

277
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,581
Yeah, I need a moment
just to unclench my asshole.

278
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,255
- Sir?
- The Braddock investigation.

279
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,924
It's coming. Norris and Greggs
are wringing it out.

280
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,094
I know. Commissioner Burrell
had a visit first thing this morning

281
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,223
from State's Attorney Demper himself,
asking why one day before the primary

282
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,142
our detectives were trying
to writ out a jailhouse snitch.

283
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,519
The tip came when it did.

284
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,063
I didn't push it,
and I didn't hold it back either.

285
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,065
Let the chips fall where they may.

286
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,275
Exactly, sir.

287
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,194
Sergeant? Fuck your falling chips.

288
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,446
If Braddock was killed
because he was a witness

289
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,824
and we break the case one day before
the primary,

290
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,450
Royce hates us forever.

291
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,703
And Royce might win the election.

292
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:08,456
If Braddock was killed
for any other reason and we break it today,

293
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,335
then Carcetti hates our guts...
and Carcetti could win.

294
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,837
I see your point.

295
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:20,635
Tactical tells me we're still about 20 bodies
short for manning the polling places.

296
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:26,016
I want you to detail two detectives
to uniformed election duty immediately.

297
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,769
- Let me guess: Norris and Greggs.
- Sounds good.

298
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,648
They're to report to Tactical at 1300 today
for election orientation.

299
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,905
They can pick up their writ
and talk to their snitch on Wednesday.

300
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,574
American democracy.

301
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,535
Let's show those Third World fucks
how it's done.

302
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:47,746
Yes, sir.

303
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,836
I have what I think is
some very good news for all of you.

304
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,716
We're going to be implementing
the University of Maryland pilot program.

305
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,635
Only three of my knuckleheads?

306
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,803
A total of ten children from the eighth grade

307
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,848
in this first class - eight boys and two girls.

308
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,351
- If things go well...
- It's a start.

309
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,102
- When?
- This morning.

310
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,980
Hallelujah. Not a moment too soon.

311
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,735
- How was I?
- Good on Steiner.

312
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,697
Better on the A.M. talk shows.
You handled that call about the fliers well.

313
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,074
Fucking Royce.

314
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,868
If I lose because of this bullshit...

315
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,787
You lose, we can blame it
on ten different things.

316
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,288
Same thing if you win.

317
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,749
Guess who I just got off the phone with?

318
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,835
State Senator Davis.
He wants a meet.

319
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,504
Clay Davis?

320
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,881
Why would I wanna get
into bed with that motherfucker?

321
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,257
He didn't come out and say it,

322
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,052
but it sounds like he's ready
to follow Watkins and jump ship.

323
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,553
What's he want in return?

324
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,139
Same thing he always wants.

325
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,059
At least 20K to his favorite
campaign committee is my guess.

326
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,395
Maybe even 30,
cos you know Clay ain't cheap.

327
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:56,481
Well, I'm not promising him
anything policy-wise.

328
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,067
You think Clay Davis
gives a fuck about policy?

329
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,152
This is strictly for services rendered.

330
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,278
He might be conning us,

331
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,572
taking the money, then sitting on his hands.

332
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,118
Maybe. But then all we have to lose is money.

333
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,705
Could be the extra little push
we need on the West Side.

334
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,417
- Set it up.
- I already did.

335
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,087
- Invert the denominator...
- What invert mean?

336
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,965
The numerator
and the denominator switch places.

337
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,259
- Turn upside down.
- Why you do that?

338
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,303
Because it works. That's the formula.

339
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,431
Excuse me, Mr. Pryzbylewski.

340
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,768
Namond Brice, Darnell Tyson
and Zenobia Dawson.

341
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,937
Grab your things and come with us.

342
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,482
- Oooh!
- Quiet, quiet.

343
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,443
Calm down, please.

344
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,528
- We in trouble?
- Just come with me.

345
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,657
- Shit. It's the story of my life.
- They ain't coming back.

346
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,952
- Yo, Mr. Prezbo, they gettin' arrested?
- No...

347
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,538
I bet the police are out there waiting for them.

348
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,708
Na', can I have your Xbox?
You ain't gonna need it where you are.

349
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,792
What'd they do?

350
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,046
Markeith, Kwame and Latonya.

351
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,756
Bring your things and come with us.

352
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,216
Ooooh!

353
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,677
Again?

354
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,409
You know I can't publicly endorse you.
Not at this late hour.

355
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,369
Then what are we talking about?

356
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,331
I lay back and not do
what I usually do on election day.

357
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:40,001
I see you all get a push in the Seventh
and Ninth Districts, say,

358
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,670
and maybe that piece
of the 11th west of Freemont.

359
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,756
I split some of my tickets for y'all.

360
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,258
I split my walkaround money.

361
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,011
You know, the usual to-and-fro.

362
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,775
- Politics is a good thing, partner.
- That's a minority opinion.

363
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,027
Let's order.

364
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,364
I'm hungry enough to eat
the horse you rode in on.

365
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:14,369
If you don't mind,
we're a little busy for a sit-down lunch.

366
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:18,414
Oh, no doubt. Just leave enough for the tab.

367
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,447
- No, she crazy.
- She says you were there.

368
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,908
I wasn't. It wasn't even rape.
She wanted to.

369
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,744
- How do you know? You weren't there.
- I saw her go in with them.

370
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:57,912
Go in with who?

371
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,540
This is no time to play, young man.

372
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,584
You are in very serious trouble.

373
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,503
Who did you see her go
in the boys' bathroom with?

374
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,589
Paul and Monnel.

375
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,091
Paul and Monnel?
And what were you doing?

376
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,843
- Lookout.
- So you were involved?

377
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,303
I didn't see what happened.

378
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,470
You were standing guard.

379
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,347
Listen. Monnel gave me $5

380
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,892
and told me to stand by the door
and holler if someone came.

381
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,269
This ain't fair. I ain't even do nothing.

382
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,564
You stood lookout while two boys
raped an eighth-grade girl.

383
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,025
- But she wanted to.
- That's not what Tiffanie says.

384
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,111
There'll be an investigation.
You'll be suspended.

385
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:34,073
You could very well be expelled,
maybe even face criminal charges.

386
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,368
Please don't.
Please don't call my foster mother.

387
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,330
- I'll tell you everything I know.
- I know all about it already.

388
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,956
I know some other stuff,

389
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,167
like who been thieving
from the teachers' lounge,

390
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,627
or tagging gym lockers, or even...

391
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,631
Miss Jeffreys, please.
This is Mrs. Donnelly from Tilghman Middle.

392
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:53,051
Listen... I know... Remember,
the boy who cut Mr. Philmont's tires?

393
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,761
I know who did that.

394
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,639
I know about a murder.

395
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,226
I do.

396
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,524
We've identified certain students

397
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:13,988
we feel will benefit from the special
curriculum and the smaller class size.

398
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:18,368
We've chosen ten students from the eighth
grade to participate in this program.

399
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,620
You get chose, you got to go?

400
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,498
- That's right.
- What if you don't wanna?

401
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,041
It's mandatory.

402
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:29,254
We feel that this program
will benefit everyone.

403
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,590
You'll get the attention you need.

404
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,717
Why we out? Everybody else shit.

405
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,889
- My bad. I ain't mean to curse.
- Yeah, but you're right, though.

406
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,725
This class get tore up, it's only on y'all.

407
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,521
- So we get put outta class.
- This is a classroom, too.

408
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,942
And every one of you
has proven time and again

409
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,861
that you're not ready for a regular classroom.

410
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,325
But this is a new program
that if you work it

411
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,453
is going to make you ready.

412
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:08,084
Ready for gen pop. This is prison, yo.
And we in solitary and shit.

413
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,086
- Word.
- Solitary.

414
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,381
That's good, son.

415
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,009
This is solitary.

416
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,595
This is the hole up in here.

417
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,353
He's a good kid. He really is.

418
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,065
And once you make that call,
his name's gonna be in the system.

419
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,152
What can I do?
He says he knows about a murder.

420
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,738
I have to notify police on this.

421
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,073
At least let me call someone I trust.

422
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,775
That's him right there.

423
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,569
Stand by. You don't wanna be in?

424
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,489
No. If you take it,
he'll think it's a straight interdiction,

425
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,741
and I get to surprise him at the bail review.

426
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,661
Good evening.
Can I have your attention?

427
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:29,374
Now boarding at gate letter D, track 4,

428
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,462
the southbound
8:45 Acela Express from New York,

429
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,341
making station stops at BWI Rail Station

430
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,635
and Union Station, Washington.

431
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,680
Sister, help you with your bag?

432
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,266
- No, thank you.
- Don't be afraid.

433
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:51,479
- Why should I be afraid? Who are you?
- Just walk you to the door.

434
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,607
- My husband is waiting outside.
- Like to meet him.

435
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,484
I'll wait with you,
make sure you're safe.

436
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,653
That really won't be necessary.

437
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,948
- Amtrak police, sir.
- Could you step over here please?

438
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,158
- What is this?
- Give me the bag.

439
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,493
What is going on?

440
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,497
I don't know this man.
Where are you taking me?

441
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,045
- What did he say about it?
- Nothing much.

442
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,339
Drugs?

443
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,968
I didn't question him too close.

444
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,848
A murder. I should take it downtown.

445
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,933
Who knows what he really knows?

446
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,645
I just... I don't want to see him
get chewed up by the system.

447
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,566
Let me try to keep this close,

448
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,360
give it to someone
with a little bit of discretion.

449
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,320
Appreciate it.

450
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,614
- Carver.
- Carver?

451
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,492
Ellis has come a long way.
I think he'd be right for this.

452
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,329
Why do you care?

453
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,165
And what's this kid to you?

454
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,875
I don't know.

455
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,295
He's one of my students.

456
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,216
Sergeant.

457
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,721
- Clean. Both of 'em.
- Say what?

458
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,432
Nothing in that bag but ladies clothes.

459
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,434
Nothing dirty on either one of 'em.

460
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,063
Unless you got another idea,
we gotta cut 'em loose.

461
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,738
From what he says, he was just a go-between.

462
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,239
He delivered a message.

463
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,534
He told the victim to be
at a certain place at a certain time.

464
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,244
Then how does he know?

465
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,371
He says everyone knows
what happened to Lex.

466
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:36,042
- It's in the streets.
- This other thing at the school.

467
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,837
I swear I didn't do it, Miss Anna.
I didn't do it. You'll see.

468
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:43,174
School's gonna look into that,
we're gonna look into this.

469
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,011
As long as Randy cooperates,
tells the truth...

470
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,430
- But if word got out...
- Understand.

471
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,641
That's why he's gonna go to school,

472
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,434
keep his mouth shut,

473
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,979
his nose clean,
go about his business.

474
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:00,566
Child's shown such bad judgment
in both instances.

475
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:01,776
Agreed.

476
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,196
But from what I can tell,
he's not a bad kid.

477
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,322
Dennis?

478
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,575
Where you goin' at so early?

479
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,661
I'm gonna go run,
and then I got lawn work later.

480
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,621
You comin' back, right?

481
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,332
What you mean am I comin' back?

482
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,252
It's gonna be like that, huh?

483
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,463
What do you mean? Like what?

484
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,625
- Where to?
- Highlandtown. Flush out yo' base, trooper.

485
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,223
- What up, Spider?
- Hey.

486
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,309
Thank you, but I know how I'm voting.

487
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,353
I'm gonna be late for work.

488
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,231
Miss Anna, is it OK if I stand out here
while you go vote?

489
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,608
- Don't you go nowhere, boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

490
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,362
So, what up, man?
So, how much they payin' you for this?

491
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,532
They say like 40, but I gotta work
the whole day though.

492
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,616
Know what I mean?

493
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,118
Yo, Spider.

494
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,500
That was Spider, right?

495
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,960
- Yeah.
- Where he go?

496
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,881
No, thank you, man. I can't vote.

497
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,551
Conviction? Felony?

498
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,094
Move on, man.

499
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,721
A'ight, man.

500
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:20,099
You see Spider again, you tell him
he need to come past my gym.

501
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,476
He ain't been round in weeks,
and we need to talk.

502
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,644
A'ight.

503
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,982
- Where's the older kid?
- I don't know.

504
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,150
OK. You're hired.

505
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,819
Shove one of those
into every hand you can.

506
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,868
Thank you very much.

507
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,169
- Why you ain't at school?
- Ain't no school today.

508
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,921
- One them Jew holidays?
- Election.

509
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,757
So what you gonna do?

510
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,884
Dunno. Hang.

511
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,343
What'd I say about steppin' up?

512
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,347
Brianna turn off the faucet.
We gotta make some rain.

513
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,184
I'm gonna get dressed.
We go see Bodie.

514
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,612
Kid, I got something else for you.

515
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,865
Put one in every door
between the expressway and Winchester,

516
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,575
and from Freemont to Fulton.

517
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:24,121
You can do it by yourself or get some friends,
but I'm gonna come past, make sure it's done.

518
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,790
OK. One in each door. Cool.

519
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,083
This is for the day's work.

520
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,668
Wow!

521
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,421
That's your walk-around.
But don't you fail me.

522
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,466
Took forever.
What's all this, son?

523
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,969
Man said if I put these fliers in doors,
I can get paid.

524
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,138
I'll come right home after.

525
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,306
You right you will.

526
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,642
You ain't in these streets no more.

527
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,228
No, ma'am.

528
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,980
Sounds like she mean it.

529
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,110
- 11:00 News, huh?
- Shut up.

530
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:59,281
I'm on this shit detail
because you wanted to stir the pot.

531
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,493
Tomorrow,
if we bust open the Braddock case,

532
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,203
nobody's gonna give a fuck.

533
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,830
Life is timing.

534
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,165
No shit, fucknuts.

535
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,587
How you doing?

536
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,798
- He's a cute one.
- Thanks.

537
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,675
Hope you're voting today.

538
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,636
- I am.
- Who's it gonna be? Give me a hint. Come on.

539
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,305
- Don't keep me in suspense.
- You don't have to worry.

540
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,682
Appreciate it.

541
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,107
Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.
Nice to meet ya.

542
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,945
- How much longer?
- Wrap this up. We got a lot more places.

543
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,533
Tommy Carcetti. I knew your dad.
First District Democratic Club.

544
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,160
- No kidding.
- Just wanted to say you got my vote.

545
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,538
- Thank you.
- They had their chance.

546
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,000
- Look what shape the city's in.
- I hope to turn things around.

547
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:54,378
- Thanks for your support.
- You expect politicians to steal...

548
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,339
- I don't, actually.
- It's part of the game. I understand.

549
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:02,595
But we took one dollar outta every three,
not two outta three, like these moolies.

550
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,806
I mean, leave something
for the city, for Christ sake.

551
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,934
Am I right? Best of luck, Councilman.

552
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,273
- Moolies?
- Sorry.

553
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,736
Election fliers?

554
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,196
Yeah, just run up,
stick 'em in mailboxes,

555
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,615
screen doors, whatever.

556
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,992
- What about the vacants?
- We ain't got to do them.

557
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,036
Some blocks ain't nothing but.

558
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,996
That's what I'm saying.
This be easy money.

559
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
Don't wanna do it?

560
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,582
- I do it.
- Me too.

561
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,417
This shit'd be easier if we had a car.

562
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,170
Dang, Donut. I'm in enough trouble
with Miss Anna as is.

563
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,005
So, what up, Mike? You in?

564
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,633
All right, then. I'll holler at you later, boy.

565
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,933
Look, Namond's been...
what's the word?

566
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:52,269
Inconsistent. Sometimes he do good,
then other times, he just...

567
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,772
We talked about that.
He gonna do better.

568
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,358
Ain't you?

569
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,485
Election day special, two for two!

570
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,570
- I don't know.
- I do.

571
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,449
You gonna give this boy his own package
or there gonna be some drama.

572
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,702
You want me to talk to Wee-Bey?
Maybe you wanna talk to him.

573
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,788
I give you his number. He got a cell phone.

574
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,958
That's not necessary.
I got all the respect in the world for Bey.

575
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,793
Then show some for his family.

576
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,427
Make me proud, hear?

577
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,690
Damn, boy.

578
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,025
Your mama's what niggers call a dragon lady.

579
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,986
She don't blink.

580
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,196
Yeah, gimme some insight, though.

581
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:45,823
To what?

582
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,908
Why you is what you is.

583
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,351
Yo. What up? Where y'all goin'?

584
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,730
- Hungry, man. I need to eat.
- Come on. Let's finish this.

585
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,482
- Nah, yo. This shit is boring.
- Fuck it.

586
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,652
I ain't gonna pay y'all
if you don't finish the job, so...

587
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,446
You already got the money?

588
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,656
If the motherfucker paid you already,

589
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,450
why the hell are we still here?

590
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,701
Cos this is the job.

591
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,537
Shit, the man ain't got
nobody to blame but hisself.

592
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,456
It's his fault for payin' up front.

593
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,501
Yo, you need to split that money up
or something cos time is a-wastin'.

594
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,216
Can't even finish a day's work.

595
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,179
Get me something at least.

596
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,097
- Lake trout.
- Soda too?

597
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,391
- Yeah. Strawberry.
- A'ight. I got ya.

598
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,334
- One, two.
- Yes.

599
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,128
One, two.

600
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,425
Hey. Where the crew at?

601
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,970
Randy got 'em all some job
handin' out election fliers or whatever.

602
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,098
You ain't wanna do that?

603
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,184
Hell, no. It's bullshit, man.

604
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,603
- I got a job too.
- Word?

605
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,814
With Bodie. I'm movin' the package.

606
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,858
You wanna go in on it with me?

607
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,738
You sure? We could work together.

608
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,365
Nah, man, that's your thing.

609
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:56,453
- Go do what you do.
- Yeah, a'ight. I'm gonna holler at you.

610
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,217
She a cute one, ain't she?

611
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,347
Yeah, boy. You know I love the women.

612
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,564
Hey, you seen Spider around any?

613
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:29,236
He ain't been round the gym in like a month.
I leave messages, he don't call.

614
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,323
I don't understand.
He was one of my best welterweights.

615
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,117
Why would he just quit like that?

616
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,744
Why don't you ask his moms?

617
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,794
Well, shit. I was locked up a good while, right.

618
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,421
I mean, I ain't no angel.

619
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,591
No. You ain't that.

620
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,518
Thanks a lot, folks.

621
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,604
Good job. Keep it up.
We're almost home.

622
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,940
You're the best. The best.

623
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,276
Heavy turnout all around.

624
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,154
Big lines on the West Side
might be bad for us. I dunno...

625
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:16,617
We're out here in West Baltimore,
the heart of his political base.

626
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,953
- This is today?
- This is live, right now in Lafayette Square.

627
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:23,457
Clay Davis just said his whole organization
was out going door-to-door for Royce's ticket.

628
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,252
- So much for laying back on the mayor.
- We paid $20,000 for this shit?

629
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:30,088
He probably went to Royce
and shook him down for another 30.

630
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:33,300
Motherfucker. Clay Davis
must know something we don't.

631
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,345
He knows just enough to get paid twice.

632
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,805
Gotta blame ourselves
for payin' him up front.

633
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,515
Hey, it was worth a shot.

634
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,185
Aides to the mayor told me
they are concerned...

635
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,564
Thanks, yo.

636
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,073
I'm-a get me a cold one.

637
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,482
Grab the wall.

638
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,532
Officer Walker.

639
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,127
I ain't gonna be out here strapped.

640
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,549
You gonna take that on a humble?

641
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,470
You don't know there's rules to this game.

642
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,222
- Rules?
- Yeah.

643
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,485
Where your shotgun at, Mr. Omar?

644
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,988
Y'all ain't got no charges here.

645
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,742
- Charge is murder, motherfucker.
- Murder? Who I kill?

646
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,952
Hey, Omar.

647
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,371
- McNulty. What the hell goin' on here?
- You tell me.

648
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:29,082
We got a warrant for a robbery murder.
In a store.

649
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,046
Wagon's here.

650
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,390
- Hey, yo, McNulty, I need a phone.
- Fuck your phone.

651
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,770
If I'm going to Booking,
I need to make a call tonight, yo.

652
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:58,528
410-958-6612.

653
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,281
And let it ring.

654
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,534
Here.

655
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,537
- Hey.
- Yo, Butchie. I'm locked up, yo.

656
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,874
- What you need?
- No bail. They sayin' it's murder.

657
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,627
Murder? Well, don't worry. I got ya.

658
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,805
You some kinda Democrat?

659
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,936
Voter turnout was heavy across the city

660
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,854
with some precincts reporting lines

661
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:35,148
as soon as the polls opened
at 7:00 this morning.

662
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:39,319
Election officials, however,
reported few problems throughout the day.

663
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:43,073
Now the polls have closed,
officials at the Board of Elections downtown

664
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,118
have begun the tedious process
of tallying the vote,

665
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,787
prepared for what could be a long night.

666
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:53,041
With just over half of the city's
316 precincts reporting,

667
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:57,337
Councilman Thomas J. Carcetti
has a narrow lead of 2%.

668
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,924
Traditionally, those precincts
that report latest

669
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,009
tend to be from West Baltimore,

670
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,513
which is expected to favor
Mayor Royce in the late going.

671
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,399
- How it go?
- Good. Nothin' to it.

672
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:21,027
I'm countin' on you, Na'.

673
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,124
Exit polls done earlier
in the day in key precincts

674
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,334
show voters divided over the challenges

675
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,546
facing this city,
such as crime and education.

676
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,717
Blake Leyh: Robots In The Hood

677
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,935
..be quite an election.

678
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,854
Since this race tightened
in the last couple of weeks,

679
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,148
I've been saying that this election

680
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,025
would be won on the ground.

681
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:02,819
Whoever has the best
field operations will take it.

682
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,238
It's all about the turnout,
and this is something...

683
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,907
What about Bond?

684
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,743
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

685
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,579
Yeah.

686
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,041
All right. Talk to you in a few.

687
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,669
Bond's running really strong against Demper.

688
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,339
Looks like we might have
a new State's Attorney.

689
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,842
- What does that mean for you?
- Demper's Royce's boy.

690
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:28,303
Dare to get your hopes up, Tommy.

691
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:33,725
You know what?
Let's get outta here for a while, take a walk.

692
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,503
I'll get your ass.

693
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,818
- Pretty.
- A little ripe.

694
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:28,905
Well, can't do anything about
the way the harbor smells.

695
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:32,284
- People are gonna expect you to.
- I guess.

696
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,162
- You sound confident.
- I have a feeling.

697
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,006
Could be a great city again.

698
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,759
Pull some jobs in here.

699
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,053
People move back, fix up the houses.

700
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,682
It's ringing again.

701
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,186
Terri.

702
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,481
- You should answer it.
- I don't need an update every five minutes.

703
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,567
- We should go anyway.
- Do we have to?

704
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,528
I'm sure they're frantic.
They don't know where you are.

705
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,200
Yeah?

706
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,037
Taking a walk with my wife.

707
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,337
On our way.

708
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,179
Royce is conceding.

709
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,389
The West Side precincts came in

710
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:39,059
and we pulled two outta five votes
in some precincts.

711
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,561
We stole his base.

712
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,230
We won.

713
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,525
Are we happy about that?

714
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,571
I think so.

715
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,367
I think we are.

716
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,536
Yeah.

717
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,543
You sure?

718
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,150
Thank you. Thank you.

719
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,951
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please.

720
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,871
I want to thank you all
for your hard work and dedication.

721
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,374
Give yourselves a hand. Come on.

722
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,090
I just got off the phone
with Mayor Royce and Councilman Gray.

723
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,092
They were gracious. I asked for their help.

724
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,302
I mean, we still have a general election to win.

725
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,642
Is there a Republican candidate
for mayor in Baltimore?

726
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:03,977
I'm not sure.

727
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,063
But assuming we win, we still have...

728
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,524
a lot of work to do to turn this city around,

729
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,402
and we need everyone,
everyone who's willing to join us

730
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,155
in making a better Baltimore for our children.

731
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,703
I don't want to make a long speech,

732
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,955
believe me, you don't want to hear it,

733
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:26,374
so I'll thank each of you individually.

734
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,168
But for tonight, let's celebrate!

735
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:40,013
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

736
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,061
How you doin'? Thanks. Hey.

737
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,355
Damond.

738
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,942
- I look forward to working with you.
- Congratulations to you, too.

739
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,360
Thank you.

740
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:58,281
- I'm going home.
- No, stay. I won't be long.

741
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,201
Yeah, you will. It's your night.

742
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,995
You know what...

743
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,663
Tommy. Tommy.

744
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:08,792
- Look what washed up on the beach.
- Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

745
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,629
Just came by to wish you well.
Looking forward to working with you.

746
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:16,758
- Shouldn't you be dead to me?
- I took it easy on you, son.

747
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,802
I coulda had you for twice as much.

748
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:21,304
You got off cheap.

749
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,641
He's right.

750
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:55,964
Butchie sent us.

751
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:08,434
What you in for?

752
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,645
I'm here on a 22-55.

753
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,774
I talked back.

754
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,658
- Moolie?
- Moolie.

755
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,870
- He said that in front of you?
- He made a point of it, in fact.

756
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,372
You said I oughta shore up my base.

757
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,333
- You didn't call him on it?
- The ironies of democracy.

758
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,794
A vote's a vote.
And I never throw one back.

759
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,422
Speaking of ballots,
did you vote for me?

760
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:42,427
The sanctity of the voting booth
is a cornerstone of American democracy.

761
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,557
I gotta go. You need a ride?

762
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,226
- Yeah.
- Come here. You're the best.

763
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,644
Thanks, Norman.

764
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,772
- Yeah, you take a break.
- You got it.

765
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,733
- One day. Two days.
- Come here, you.

766
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,861
- Be good.
- I'm gonna call you.

767
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,487
I have a feeling you might.

768
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,490
We are family

769
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,118
I've got my Carcetti and me

770
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,748
Good night.

771
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:14,918
Ooh.

772
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,504
- I should go, too.
- One for the road?

773
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:20,423
Sure.

774
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:22,967
Scotch OK?

775
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,260
Sure.

776
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,310
You know, I gotta admit, it feels good.

777
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,438
You deserve it.

778
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,774
You worked hard.

779
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:39,692
I did. I do.

780
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,154
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

781
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,498
You know, when I took this job,
you promised me a win bonus.

782
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:55,416
Well, you earned it.

783
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,402
I can't do this. Not now.

784
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:25,446
Oh! Come on, Tommy.

785
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,740
You haven't changed.

786
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:29,826
Hell, from what Norman tells me,

787
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,037
you nearly fell off
the campaign trail for a blonde

788
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,581
at the Stonewall dinner two months ago.

789
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,251
He had to drag you out of the bar.

790
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:41,671
It's not that I don't want to...

791
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,425
Oh, you're feeling a bit mayoral. Right.

792
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:47,969
You're on stage now.

793
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,388
Well, Tommy...

794
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:54,684
four years is a long time
for a fellow like you.

795
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:58,312
This could be your last chance for a while.

796
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:17,290
You sure?

797
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,963
Maybe you have learned something.

798
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,603
Write me a check.
