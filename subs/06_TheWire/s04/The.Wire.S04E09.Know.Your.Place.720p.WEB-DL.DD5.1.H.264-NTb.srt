1
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:12,428
But it's a snail, you see,
and it go, it go, "Meow."

2
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,307
- It's a what, now? What?
- It meows.

3
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,351
Then it ooze all up SpongeBob's belly

4
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,478
like it's his pet and shit.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:24,774
Yo, y'all niggers watch too many cartoons,
I swear.

6
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,651
Hey!

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,112
This is what's wrong with the justice system.

8
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,155
Niggers get locked up and don't stay that way.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,492
- They make it hard to take this shit serious.
- Mm!

10
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,994
- What, you snitchin' or something?
- Shit, no, man.

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,498
They only gave me, like, four, right?
I done 15 months.

12
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,709
So with good time,
I'm like, "Man, what the fuck?"

13
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,128
- Shit.
- Yeah, man.

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,504
So...

15
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:51,050
Yeah, man, it ain't...
It ain't like it was, but it'll do.

16
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,554
So who we slinging for?

17
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,763
Marlo Stanfield.

18
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,849
- Come on, man!
- Yo, man, yeah.

19
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,351
I was getting this nice package
from Slim Charles,

20
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:04,313
but Marlo got the muscle to hold us down,
so that's where we at.

21
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,774
Shit, one boss same as the next, man.

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,029
Hey, yo, Little Kev.
I told you about the boy Poot, right?

23
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,782
Yeah. Pussy hound. You just home?

24
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,784
- How long in?
- 15 months.

25
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,412
- You got laid yet?
- Shit, I think I already been burnt.

26
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:23,082
Shit, I might need a ride to the clinic today.

27
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,711
I see ain't shit changed around this joint.

28
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,379
On the wall, gents.

29
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,509
Make this easy on all of us.
Which one of yous is Little Kevin?

30
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,430
Come on, fellas. It ain't no big deal. We just
need some face time with the motherfucker.

31
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,556
Your name Kevin?

32
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,644
- No, this is, uh...
- Poot. I'm Poot, yo.

33
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,147
Poot. Didn't you get locked up
or shot or something?

34
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,274
Society say I deserve another chance.

35
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,651
Let's see. Which one of these dickheads
is Little Kevin?

36
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,279
- I don't know no Kevin.
- Society can bite my dick.

37
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,239
Bodie, I know this kid works up here with you.

38
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,158
- What's your name?
- Do I look little to you?

39
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,912
Fuck this. Everyone under 150 lbs
or 5'6" is in the cab.

40
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,041
You, you, and you. And unless I see
birth certificates saying otherwise,

41
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,125
you're my Little Kevins.

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,045
And if that don't get it,
we're coming the fuck back.

43
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,505
All right?

44
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,927
That's fucked up, yo.

45
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,183
- You got any paper on you?
- Man, fuck if I know.

46
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,144
These police out here
knew how to flip it even just a little,

47
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,939
my shit would be in handcuffs. You know?

48
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,651
They don't know shit. Damn!

49
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:45,248
When you walk through the garden

50
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,500
Watch your back

51
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,294
Well I beg your pardon

52
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,880
Walk the straight and narrow track

53
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,467
If you walk with Jesus

54
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,927
He'll save your soul

55
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,558
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

56
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,977
He's got fire and the fury

57
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,855
At his command

58
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,607
Well, you don't got to worry

59
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,860
Hold on to Jesus' hand

60
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,863
We'll be safe from Satan

61
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,532
When the thunder rolls

62
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,869
But you gotta keep the devil

63
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,162
Down in the hole

64
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,836
Oh yeah, mm

65
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,384
We'll be safe from Satan

66
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,931
Gotta keep the devil

67
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,642
Down in the hole

68
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,897
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

69
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,774
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

70
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,277
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

71
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,196
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

72
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,657
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

73
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,659
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

74
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,636
You my ride?

75
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,933
I'm your motherfucking savior,
is what I am.

76
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,603
Told y'all Andre was lying on me, yo.

77
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,647
I didn't do it for you.

78
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,440
Fact is...

79
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,901
if I could work back on whatever cases
I already caught,

80
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,070
you might be going right back inside.

81
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,238
I know.

82
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,991
- So who did kill that delivery girl?
- I don't know.

83
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:48,412
Know it wasn't Andre.
His blood don't run that kind of cold.

84
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,539
Who he getting his package from?

85
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,085
Saying I could go back to the crib
and bear up,

86
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,003
find some things out if you want me to.

87
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,547
- You owe me, motherfucker.
- I'm saying I know I do, man.

88
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,802
And if you want to pay down any part of this
debt, you know what you gotta do for me?

89
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,971
No more bodies.

90
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,599
No more fucking bodies from you.

91
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:12,812
No more comebacks or get-evens on this.

92
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,397
No more killing.

93
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,777
You owe me your word.

94
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,784
All right, man. No bodies on me.

95
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,791
You really want to ease my mind,

96
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,670
you'll let me drive you down to Aberdeen
rail station, put you on a northbound train.

97
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,423
Naw, man. Baltimore's all I know.

98
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,426
You know what it is like, homey.

99
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,887
Man gotta live what he know, right?

100
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,810
You're absolutely right.
There are significant factors to consider,

101
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,313
but getting crime under control
is key to sparking investment here,

102
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,358
- jump-starting growth.
- If you make it safe, they will come.

103
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,944
I hate to begin our beautiful relationship
with my hand out,

104
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,364
but I'm told that two federal grants
to my office dry up this year.

105
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,869
Come the first of the year, those DOJ grants
evaporate and you're out 12 prosecutors.

106
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,165
I was hoping you'd be able to absorb that in
the general fund, maybe throw in a bit more,

107
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,709
make it competitive with the PD
and Attorney General's jobs,

108
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,711
staunch the turnover - it's killing us.

109
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,379
This would be the time to do it.

110
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,131
We're over the revenue expected

111
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,217
for this point in the fiscal year
next to the real estate market.

112
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,554
How much past? 'Cause I want to come out
with a big bump in police salaries,

113
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,682
in particular the commissioner's salary,
which needs to jump, like, 50 grand.

114
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,977
A good guess would be
a one-shot surplus of about 20 million.

115
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,396
But that's rainy-day money
for more than crime.

116
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,690
Word is that the schools are running a deficit.

117
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,860
Excuse me. Did you say a 50,000 bump
for Ervin Burrell?

118
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,780
- Not for Burrell per se.
- For the next police commissioner, then?

119
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,282
- That's what you mean?
- Looking ahead, it makes sense.

120
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,410
Firing Burrell would upset
a good-sized block of my constituency,

121
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,037
not to mention the ministers.

122
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,081
And the budget chair
might have a difficult time

123
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,249
allowing a higher salary to be approved.

124
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,377
In fact, I can guarantee
if that proposal's in the budget -

125
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,171
your first, for the record -

126
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,423
the bill won't come out of committee intact.

127
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,052
I'm just saying that in the event
Commissioner Burrell were to leave,

128
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,222
we'd want to bump that salary
to attract the best candidates,

129
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,350
in particular the best African-American
candidates across the nation.

130
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,728
With three years left in his term,
why would he leave?

131
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:22,441
Councilman, what may not have been obvious
to you on the Public Safety Subcommittee

132
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:26,278
is that the budget process
is a carefully orchestrated ballet,

133
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,615
a cooperative effort
between the branches of government.

134
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,576
Madam President,
the nuances of that cooperative effort

135
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,829
are beginning to come into focus for me.

136
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,049
Thank you, Madam President.

137
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,597
Come on in, everyone.

138
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,057
Don't wait by the door.

139
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,184
Duquan, you're here.

140
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,436
Randy, you're here.

141
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,606
No, you two switch.
Calvin, you're here in the front.

142
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,568
Quanice, you're here.
Michael, you're here.

143
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,029
Destiny, here.
Myesha, here.

144
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,406
Dashonda, here.

145
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,992
Come on, keep moving.
Don't stop at the door. Come in.

146
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,410
Let's get started.

147
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,298
Could be a problem.

148
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,049
How so?

149
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,344
Your boy been assigned
to what they call the Major Crimes Unit.

150
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,429
Meaning what?

151
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,307
They the motherfuckers that did
the last three city wiretaps -

152
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,475
one where they bugged Barksdale's office,

153
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,145
another where they hit
Kentel up in Park Heights.

154
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,063
And the last one, shit,

155
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,192
they was all up on Stringer Bell's cellphones.

156
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,445
- You ain't still using burners, is you?
- I'm dumping them every two weeks.

157
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,655
Not good enough.

158
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,449
You read that.

159
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,493
You'll see that Stringer was changing
his number every damn day

160
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:00,456
and they still pulled the motherfucker's
voice off a goddamn cellphone tower.

161
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,708
City police did that?

162
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,174
- Where'd you get this?
- Courthouse, clerk's office.

163
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:15,387
Hey, this shit's open to the public
after they finish prosecuting your ass.

164
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,640
You need to lose them cellphones, son.

165
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,186
Me, I ain't as so much as
touched a burner in a year.

166
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,837
5'9" and three eighths?

167
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:53,425
You got it. Now hold the measure
and spread your arms out to the side.

168
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,094
What you got?

169
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,097
- I want one.
- So, your cat can eat 'em?

170
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,182
So, how'd you find them?

171
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,770
I'm going to the calculators.

172
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,941
Give me that. Give it here.

173
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,442
The same.

174
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,696
Your height and your arm span - identical.

175
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,199
- Quanice?
- You about to get me in trouble.

176
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,618
So, you say you like to box, right?

177
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,121
You must have some kind of reach.

178
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,498
Everything cheap on computers
if you know where to look.

179
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:29,628
Yo, this mean the price I'm getting from
the Koreans, they still marking it up some.

180
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,631
They gotta be. I can make twice as much
using this here.

181
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,258
Uh-uh.

182
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,635
Can't.

183
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,394
All this along the lower
Patapsco-Westport area is ready for a turn.

184
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,813
The proximity to downtown
and the B-W Parkway

185
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,566
make it ideal for Washington commuters.
That's a given.

186
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,860
- Anything to speed it up?
- A harbor promenade

187
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,862
going west from both sides of the bridge.

188
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,239
The South Harbor Promenade,
brought to you by...

189
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,907
Mayor Thomas Carcetti.

190
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,534
And the citizens of Baltimore.

191
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,330
Doesn't quite have the same ring as a stadium
or an aquarium expansion, does it?

192
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,498
- It's a start.
- Further east, you've got

193
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,210
the Locust Point Marine Terminal,
which is still a working enterprise,

194
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,173
and the further you go into Brooklyn-Curtis
Bay, the more the skyline disappears.

195
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,549
We lose the Washington crowd.

196
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,218
For that part of the waterfront,
you need a different draw.

197
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,471
- Casinos?
- The urban planning default?

198
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,598
I don't want the crime
that comes with casinos.

199
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,351
- Tax base is tax base.
- This is where I get off the boat.

200
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,561
It's one thing to sell waterfront for tax base,

201
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,397
but now you're just sucking
paychecks out of my community.

202
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:34,109
It was just a thought. And, anyway,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

203
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,153
This is just the first long meeting of many.

204
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,157
So, thanks to everyone,
and we'll continue this later.

205
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,207
Madam President, a word with you?

206
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,833
Do you have a minute?

207
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,879
You and me, we got a problem already?

208
00:11:55,423 --> 00:12:00,469
Just trying to help guide
you through the process, Mr. Mayor...

209
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,887
..Elect.

210
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,224
Felt more like you were dragging me
across a minefield, Nerese.

211
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,267
- Why you so pissed off at me?
- Look.

212
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,895
Clarence shouldn't have run again
for any number of reasons.

213
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,191
I was ready to step up, and the deal was cut
long ago that he'd back me.

214
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,569
You and Tony, you guys jumped the line.

215
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,405
- It wasn't your turn.
- Whoa, whoa.

216
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,614
Whoa.

217
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,367
I'm sorry if Tony and I
ruined your party plans,

218
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,911
but I wasn't privy to whatever
you and Clarence cooked up.

219
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:30,416
That aside, I was kind of looking forward
to working closely together.

220
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,418
I think that we could make things happen.

221
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:38,090
You're only getting the one term, Tommy.
I'm not gonna stand down next time.

222
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,217
What makes you think
I'll be around that long?

223
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,762
Governor's race is in two years,
and plans can change.

224
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:48,183
You might find yourself mayor in 2008
without so much as a campaign speech.

225
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,824
Wasn't easy tracking you down.

226
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,493
The numbers I got for you
don't work no more.

227
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,164
I see you got a problem.
Looking rough, Bubs.

228
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,834
I been keeping it clean, you know,
pushing my carts and all.

229
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,172
But this one young man, every time
I cross him, I get tossed for what I got on me.

230
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,715
Cash, pills.

231
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,801
He look on me
like an ATM or some shit, I swear.

232
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,845
I'm ready to work, Kima.

233
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,680
Get this motherfucker off me,
I'll do what you need.

234
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,932
Look at me, Bubs. I ain't in Narco.

235
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,143
Yeah, I see. You look nice.

236
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,061
I'm working homicides.

237
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,522
So, if the bad boy happen to kill me,
you can help me out then, right?

238
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:43,113
If we drive around, you think you can
put eyes on this motherfucker?

239
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,532
- I can try.
- Get in.

240
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,830
So, Nerese is bucking already.

241
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,125
Feels like if the mayor's chair ain't gonna
go to Royce, it should be hers.

242
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,253
Problem is, she'll see any proposal
to raise the commissioner's salary

243
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,380
- as a move against Burrell.
- Which it is.

244
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,217
We can't raise the salary, we can't attract
strong minority candidates.

245
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,553
No strong candidates,
we can't get rid of the guy we got.

246
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,681
Fuck if I'm gonna live with Burrell
as my commissioner.

247
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,017
- What if he quits?
- Quits?

248
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,103
Maybe the man can be shamed.
If he leaves on his own account,

249
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,191
that takes us off the hook
with Nerese and the ministers, right?

250
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,861
No. We don't want your credit card number.

251
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,488
We won't even know the number.

252
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,199
We just need you to order the candy.

253
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,784
And you have cash up front?

254
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,993
He pay you back, Mr. P.

255
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,703
When he sell off, man,
he gonna pay you back.

256
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,539
Yeah.

257
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,625
Points on the package, huh? No way.

258
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,586
Come on, Mr. Prezbo.
Doesn't it teach us math?

259
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,465
Addition, subtraction,
a quarter, a quarter of a dollar,

260
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,884
a dime, a tenth, you know?

261
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,511
No cash, no card.

262
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,058
All right. Fine. Cash up front.

263
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,893
No problem.

264
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,230
And if you come in with
a wad of bills tomorrow, Randy,

265
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,065
I want to know where they came from.

266
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,442
I don't want either of you out on the corner.

267
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,652
All right.

268
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,199
Ms. Thiessen, you OK?

269
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,367
I, uh...

270
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,911
I think my car's been stolen.

271
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,461
Yeah, man. All right.

272
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,548
So what I'm saying is
that you got from Bentlow down there

273
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,217
to Rosewood right here. All right?

274
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,636
Now, I got the block from Monroe
all the way down to Pacer,

275
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,307
so I got you covered from that side, but put
lookouts in Franklintown to catch anybody

276
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,601
- coming from the other way.
- All right, I got you.

277
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,686
- Are you ready to work?
- Yeah, just get my re-up.

278
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,563
We'll go on about the shit for real.

279
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,691
- No, are you ready to work?
- Yeah. Ready to work.

280
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,946
- Donut, go talk to Little Kevin for me.
- All right. Watch the ride.

281
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:52,159
Look, man, please do not be
having your mama come talk for you.

282
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,119
Man, I ain't have her do nothing.

283
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,996
She just get on her horse and come with it.

284
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,291
Look. I done did everything
I can for you and yours, but...

285
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,545
from here on, your moms
can't do nothing to help. All right?

286
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,094
Him? From Wee-Bey?

287
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,846
Your moms?

288
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,567
No sign of the motherfucker Andre.

289
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,320
Store been padlocked a week.

290
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,572
Ain't even calling for his re-up.

291
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,118
Check the man at the jail?

292
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:39,039
Yeah. People say Omar ain't even been
on the tier for two weeks,

293
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,834
so he either staying someplace
or they got him at county lockup.

294
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,670
Or the charges been dropped.

295
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,509
If this cocksucker's sprung,
my man is backing up on his story.

296
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,761
Mean he could back up on y'all.

297
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,806
I'm on it.

298
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,936
How about the New York boys?

299
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,398
We dropped five of them.
The rest went to ground.

300
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:09,444
Drive through East Baltimore, you don't even
see a Baltimore nigger with a Yankee cap.

301
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,697
Want us to stay on that too?

302
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:16,284
I talked to the fat man,
but I think we're done there.

303
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,706
This shit with Andre? Job one.

304
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,344
We could try the avenue again.
He be behind the market sometimes.

305
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:38,515
Bubs, I ain't got all fucking day.
I'm on shift work now. I'm working murders.

306
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,728
He banked me four times this week, Kima.
I'm having dreams about this motherfucker.

307
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,647
All right. I tell you what - you want to work?

308
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,567
I'll call Sydnor or Herc
down at Major Crimes,

309
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,652
put you with someone doing drug work.

310
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,448
You work for them,
they'll help you with your problem. All right?

311
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,616
- I need this now, Kima.
- I'll tell them that.

312
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,785
- Woman...
- So show me where you're living,

313
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,121
and I'll tell them where they can find you.

314
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,332
Take the left.

315
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,093
I don't understand.

316
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,846
You told the man you not gonna kill no one.

317
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,266
I gave my word on that.

318
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,686
Fuck we doing back here then, Papa?

319
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,231
I can still put a gun in Andre's face, right?

320
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,609
That man got some explaining to do.

321
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,114
It's dead out here, yo.

322
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,824
Tip on out.

323
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,087
I don't know why he don't trust us with it, yo.

324
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,173
I mean, we trustworthy, ain't we?

325
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:58,386
Just gotta get enough for the first order.
Then we're good.

326
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,481
All right. Hard six. Come on, Trey!

327
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,236
- I'm in.
- Go away, boy.

328
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,532
- Oh, you in?
- Yeah.

329
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,742
Pass line for me, yo.

330
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,704
Oh, shit!

331
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,874
Yeah. Get that money.
Get that money, shorty.

332
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,793
Get that money.

333
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,470
I heard tell of it, but I didn't believe it.

334
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,473
All this overtime,
all for two cases as a secondary.

335
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,519
First the names are red, then they're green,
then they're black.

336
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,523
And that doesn't even include the court pay
you make if the soft case goes to trial.

337
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,358
Sweet.

338
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,820
So, what you gonna do with yours,
Detective Greggs, huh?

339
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,905
Pay down some debt.

340
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,499
- Why you leaving?
- Your luck ain't gonna change.

341
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,127
- Don't worry about it.
- Yo, thanks for walking us off.

342
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,462
I thought we was gonna get banked.

343
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,841
- You ain't gonna bank us, is you?
- Shit, boy.

344
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,551
You think I'm that ungrateful?

345
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,720
I followed you through ten shooters

346
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,139
and made more money than I have in a month.

347
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,392
Nah. I ain't gonna rob you.

348
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,812
I just need to know next time
you fade a dice game. You feel?

349
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:34,149
I mean, it's all about
the math, you know, the probabilities and all.

350
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,277
I ain't never seen you in a game before.
Where you learn your game?

351
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,737
Edward Tilghman Middle.

352
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,280
Shit.

353
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,532
All we got is Little Kevin.

354
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,659
Bodie's boy, huh?

355
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,662
What'd I tell you?
Bubs gets it the first time. Here.

356
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,585
Y'all meet up with me
in the afternoon tomorrow

357
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,671
after school lets out
and I'll give Kevin a new hat.

358
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,423
A hat trick? Cool.

359
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,427
- Yo, Herc, man?
- What's up?

360
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,304
It's not about the money this time.

361
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,973
He breaking me every day
unless I give him something.

362
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,892
I can't take it any more, man.

363
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:13,605
Once we're done with Kevin,
you go find this asshole, hit my cellphone.

364
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,857
I'll be on him five minutes later. I promise.

365
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,784
Then you add this, yo, and watch it fizzle.

366
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,244
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not so much. Not so much.

367
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,372
You gonna make it spill
everywhere, you see?

368
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,878
What are you still doing here?
Ain't nobody want you here.

369
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,923
- Your mama want me.
- Yeah. You and the pipe.

370
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,300
Shouldn't talk about your
mama like that, Michael.

371
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:46,596
- Hey, Daddy, see my volcano?
- Bug, go upstairs.

372
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,683
Bug need me too.

373
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,769
Saturday, right?

374
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,145
Bug need me.

375
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,356
My teachers say I gotta need glasses.

376
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,318
I gotta have an adult with me.
Pick 'em up. Sign for 'em.

377
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,072
Bug, go upstairs to your room.

378
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,078
Ice cold, boy. Way you be?

379
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,124
Ain't got a forgiveness to your soul.

380
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,209
- Man, fuck you.
- Watch your mouth.

381
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,714
You're big, but not big enough.

382
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,177
Now...where's that DSS card?
Your mama said that come to me.

383
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,430
Ain't nothing left on this month's check
anyway.

384
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,476
Before the first of the month, then.

385
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,833
Hey.

386
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,835
Hey.

387
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,796
Come on in.

388
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,309
I see the little man
done took over the living room.

389
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,395
- Good for him.
- You know how it goes.

390
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,606
Well, I'm just messing with you.

391
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:24,194
Place looks great.
Even the toys look like they belong.

392
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,365
- This is...
- This month and two going back.

393
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,659
I'm just trying to catch up.

394
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,454
I appreciate you not coming after me for it.

395
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,498
Knocking over liquor stores now?

396
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,250
Overtime from Homicide.

397
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:43,421
It stays like this, and I won't have a problem
coming up with my share.

398
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,341
- Kima...
- This ain't, "Please take me back,"

399
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,927
but a deal's a deal, right?

400
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,348
Hey, I'm home.

401
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,725
Hey, Elijah.

402
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,977
- Hey.
- Um...

403
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,897
Kima, this is Nancine Owens.

404
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,233
Sorry. The place is a mess.

405
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,276
You could stay for dinner,

406
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,862
but tonight we have people coming over.

407
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,782
It's a kind of a celebration, actually.

408
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,785
- Yeah?
- I passed the bar this week.

409
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,203
Congratulations.

410
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,123
Most of the gals I work with
have a problem with that.

411
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,416
- With what?
- Passing the bar.

412
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,382
- Guess I better be going.
- Thanks for coming past.

413
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,342
- Let's make a bed...
- Yeah.

414
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,177
Nice meeting you.

415
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,762
- Elijah?
- Uh?

416
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,223
- Say bye to Aunt Kima.
- Bye.

417
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,583
- Where's Dre?
- I don't know!

418
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,169
- You believe her?
- No.

419
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,465
One last time. Where's Andre?

420
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,677
He said if he told me
where he was going,

421
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,554
I'd have to tell you.

422
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,681
I don't know. I don't know.

423
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,225
You believe her now?

424
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,102
Yeah.

425
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,322
Dang. Sure is quiet this early.

426
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,283
Yo, you gonna come with me to see Mr. P?

427
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,161
No, go on up. I'll see you in homeroom.

428
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,377
Mr. P.

429
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,213
Randy.

430
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,216
- Randy, how did you...
- Six beats four or five.

431
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,345
And most times eight is better than ten.
Right? You schooled me good.

432
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,513
- You gambled?
- I didn't even pick up the dice.

433
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,557
I was all, "Pass, no pass."

434
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,268
Got to the point where some of them
was following me in there.

435
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:06,231
- You shouldn't gamble.
- I know, but the math be right, Mr. P.

436
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:11,152
But I'm gonna come back at lunch, and we can
computer up that candy, all right? Peace.

437
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,076
Resign?

438
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,578
Either that or the day-to-day
running of the department

439
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,331
falls to the Deputy Commissioner
for Operations.

440
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,169
Erv, I have made no secret
of wanting to make changes.

441
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:31,381
So Bill Rawls is now
the voice of reform, is he?

442
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,966
This isn't about Rawls.

443
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,301
I have no faith in you, given recent events.

444
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,805
I know you remember the two of us
sitting in this same booth a year ago,

445
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,349
you telling me about how you respect
the chain of command.

446
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,059
Well, respect it now.

447
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,980
Every department head serves
at the pleasure of the mayor.

448
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,983
So, if you're firing me, Mr. Mayor,

449
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:53,069
I want you to know I will go quietly.

450
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,488
You'll tender your letter of resignation?

451
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,241
No. I'm not offering to resign.

452
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,286
If you want me to go,
you're gonna have to shitcan me.

453
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,038
A small distinction, I know, but...

454
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:10,336
in the meantime, since you have
Bill Rawls doing my job for me,

455
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,338
and it's such a nice day out,

456
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:16,050
I think I'll go to Forest Park and shoot nine.

457
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,637
The check is yours, I think.

458
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:27,020
Pick a table, any table.

459
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,523
Eiffel Tower, Big Ben,
Empire State Building.

460
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,066
Your table is your team.

461
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,986
The team that puts
its model together first wins.

462
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,655
Now, you say y'all can work together
out on the corner.

463
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,158
- Let's see how you do on this.
- Wins what?

464
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,244
Big fat gold star and some shit.

465
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:47,540
Dinner downtown.
Any restaurant you can agree on.

466
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,918
Since y'all only seem willing to be interested
in stuff you know,

467
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,503
we looked for things like Baltimore.

468
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:56,674
The scale model of the
Fayette Street stash house was all sold out.

469
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,344
So, y'all just gonna have to make do.

470
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,055
Mr. Colvin, the box say
there's supposed to be instructions.

471
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,766
We took those out. Makes it
more interesting, don't you think?

472
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,477
It ain't like we follow instructions
anywhere else, right?

473
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,691
I ain't even want to
put no charges on Omar.

474
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,693
But see, they made me do that,

475
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,780
and now they're gonna be mad at me
'cause it ain't stick.

476
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,367
- Who be "they"?
- People I'm getting the package from.

477
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,660
I'm asking who.

478
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:29,248
Boy named Marlo. He's big on the West Side.
You heard of him?

479
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,792
Vaguely recall the name.

480
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,045
So, I just need to chill for a while
till they remember how to forget.

481
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,881
So, now you come over East Side
and expect me to hide you.

482
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:43,513
Why does every Baltimore nigger think that
running away means crossing downtown?

483
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,058
Shit, you ought to be in New York
or Philly or some shit.

484
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:51,104
No, see, I know that. It's just that
I don't know no one outside of B'more.

485
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,481
I was just hoping,
let's say, trade on my store,

486
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:58,361
you could maybe front me some cash,
get me out of town with people you know.

487
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,655
I mean, I'd come to the East Side to you,

488
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,157
too many West Side motherfuckers
are with Marlo.

489
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,080
You know what the problem
with these here machines?

490
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,623
They too cheap to begin with.

491
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:15,086
Some people would think for what it's worth
to fix it and make the shit work right,

492
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,548
you might as well dump them and get another.

493
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:26,180
2,000 and a free ride north
for the store and its contents.

494
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,765
Store worth way more, Joe.

495
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,268
It depends, don't it?

496
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,528
No, it goes on the other side and shit.

497
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,200
Stop fronting me. I want to do something.

498
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,244
You gonna curse at me again,
I'm gonna cut you.

499
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,164
Get that shit out my face. I don't even
want to do this shit no more.

500
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,583
That's how you always do it.

501
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,670
What are you doing? Look at the box.
Do that look like that's on the box?

502
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,507
Nigger, come on, now.
I'm trying to eat.

503
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,676
- Give me that piece, yo.
- Fuck you, yo.

504
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,096
You don't even know what you're doing.
Just sit there and shut up.

505
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,223
Come over here and make me shut up, then.

506
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:13,186
You piss me off 'cause you don't know
what you're doing. You're too stupid.

507
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,354
Hey, Z, you do the top
while I do the middle.

508
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,732
Darnell, you got the leg parts, all right?

509
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,069
Yeah, like that, like that.

510
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,430
Shit!

511
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,064
Done.

512
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,274
Aw, that's bullshit.

513
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,027
He's cheating, yo.

514
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,947
Go ahead and touch it, baby.
That shit built to last.

515
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,032
What about the extra pieces?

516
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,201
What extra pieces?

517
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,082
What's in your pocket?

518
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,042
Ain't nothing in my pocket.

519
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,380
So, who cook a good steak around here?

520
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,715
I got a T-bone right here.

521
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,012
OK.

522
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,265
One. From the day of my inauguration,

523
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:35,560
Commissioner Burrell is to undertake
no initiative without clearing it with you.

524
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:40,273
Administrative responsibilities are to reside
with the deputy office if they don't already.

525
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,108
I like that. No problem.

526
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,819
- Two. I need to elevate Stan Valchek.
- Good man, Valchek.

527
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,029
He's a hack. But he's my hack, and I owe him.

528
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,574
If I make him deputy for admin,
can he cause any real damage?

529
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,576
- I'll watch over him. No problem.
- Three.

530
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,078
I'm bumping Daniels
from Western Command to colonel,

531
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,998
giving him CID and carte blanche
to fix the investigative units.

532
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,583
- Cedric Daniels?
- Problem?

533
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,586
No, he's good police.

534
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,839
He's just got a little independent streak.

535
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:07,341
Independent from who?

536
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,762
I got no problem making Daniels.
What else do you need?

537
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,639
That's it for now.

538
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,311
Mr. Mayor, about Ervin.
If you don't mind my asking,

539
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:22,231
why keep him as a puppet commissioner
when you can just fire the guy?

540
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,194
We mind you asking.

541
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:40,333
I'm partial to them cherries.

542
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,338
Yo, Dukie.

543
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,757
You ever call Social Services on your mother?

544
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,467
What?

545
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:53,304
I just want to know what happens
if you call Social Services on somebody.

546
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,181
You want to report your mother?

547
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,184
She brung someone home and he won't leave.

548
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,144
You don't want to call Social Services.

549
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,564
They gets to looking into things,
they could put y'all in a group home,

550
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:06,275
split you and Bug up, even.

551
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,987
But I don't want us to leave.
I just want him to leave.

552
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,530
Talking about Bug's daddy, ain't you?

553
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,033
Maybe you ought to talk to a teacher
about this.

554
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,577
Mr. Prezbo is real good about stuff.

555
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,373
Mr. P did say I could go talk
to the school social worker.

556
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,167
Mr. Robinette? He an alcoholic.

557
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,087
What about that boxing guy, Mr. Cutty?

558
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,798
What's wrong with Cutty?

559
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,176
I don't know.

560
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,346
Like, he just too friendly, you know?

561
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,723
That shit creep me out, man.

562
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,059
Like, he some type of faggot or something.

563
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,229
Not Cutty, man. He be all up in the women.

564
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,815
- Yo, don't you see how he be doing?
- That don't mean shit.

565
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,025
Them faggots will be just like that too.

566
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,695
I don't know. He just too friendly, you know?

567
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,822
Everybody just too motherfucking friendly.

568
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,341
No fucking way.

569
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,219
So, his name is... What'd you call him?

570
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,639
- It's like a joke.
- Yeah. They flipped it.

571
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,518
Bunch of fucking clowns.

572
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:30,067
Last year we had MSAs in the 22 percentile.

573
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:33,738
And don't think they haven't noticed it
down at the Puzzle Palace.

574
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,783
The word is they're looking
for at least a ten-point increase

575
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,703
from all city middle schools this time around.

576
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,414
We're still six weeks away from the MSAs

577
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,499
and you want us to start
teaching the test now?

578
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:49,754
This year, the preferred term
is curriculum alignment.

579
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:54,592
There's nothing wrong with emphasizing
the skills necessary for the MSA.

580
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,803
If we can get them to write a paragraph
without a four-letter word in it,

581
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,639
it'll have to have better command of English.

582
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:04,602
Marcia, skill sets are one thing, but this
has us teaching test questions direct.

583
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,104
Questions that involve skills.
I don't see your point.

584
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,439
You don't want to see the point.

585
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,108
Were you expecting
something different than last year?

586
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,819
I don't see the math section.
These are language arts questions.

587
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,447
Our greatest failing
on standardized tests last year.

588
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,742
So, for the time being,
all teachers will devote class time

589
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,912
to teaching language arts sample questions.

590
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:29,084
Now, if you turn to page 11, please,
I have some things I want to go over with you.

591
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,669
I don't get it.

592
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:34,381
All this so we score higher on the state tests?

593
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:38,344
If we're teaching the kids the test questions,
what is it assessing in them?

594
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,513
Nothing. It assesses us.

595
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,557
The test scores go up,
they can say the schools are improving.

596
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,768
The scores stay down, they can't.

597
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,354
- Juking the stats.
- Excuse me?

598
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,440
Making robberies into larcenies,

599
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,818
making rapes disappear -

600
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:57,696
you juke the stats
and majors become colonels.

601
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,323
I've been here before.

602
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,576
Wherever you go, there you are.

603
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:12,086
Ravens got that dude Mike Anderson.
He and Jamal gonna be running...

604
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,171
Look at these runts.

605
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,424
We're gonna go when that football's
in the air on a long pass.

606
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,593
- Slow?
- Yeah.

607
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:23,222
- Big yellow right here.
- Yellows, yellows!

608
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,724
- Go long. Go, go.
- Throw it high.

609
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,268
Big yellow.

610
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,477
Go.

611
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,146
- Knocko!
- Oh, shit!

612
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,107
Po-po, yo! Po-po!

613
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,782
- Where you going?
- Put me down!

614
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,286
They're in the alleys. We get back in there,
we can hunt them up.

615
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,329
No need. I know 'em all.

616
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,665
- Let me go, motherfucker!
- What about this one?

617
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,749
He isn't even bait.

618
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:54,295
We toss him back - unless you want to
spend half the shift down at baby booking.

619
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,380
- Me?
- I ain't afraid, motherfucker!

620
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,049
I don't want to spend this shift
down at Evidence Control.

621
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,719
- Then why the fuck even do this?
- So's I can talk to them.

622
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:06,140
I like to think that until the handcuffs
actually fit, there's still talking to be done.

623
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,434
Come here, man. Let's take a walk.

624
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,977
Shut the fuck up.

625
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,940
Yo, who we listening to?

626
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,152
Miss Lady Day, Billie Holiday.

627
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:22,072
She sound good.
You know, real sad, kind of.

628
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,076
Yeah. I'm like that.
You be thinking I'm all ghetto,

629
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,495
and then I flip it and mess your mind all up.

630
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,290
The next time we do this, Mr. Colvin,

631
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,792
could you please make it on the weekend?

632
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,087
I only had, like, three hours
between school and now to get ready.

633
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,090
- You look fine, Zenobia.
- I could look better.

634
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,176
How long you think it take to do hair like this?

635
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,804
I'm ordering the biggest quarter-pounder.
Fries too.

636
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,558
Nigger, this ain't Mickey D's. You better be
thinking T-bone steak, medium rare.

637
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:52,144
- The blood all squirting out?
- Nah, ain't no blood.

638
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,397
What you think rare is?
It mean rarely cooked, hardly cooked.

639
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,609
- Rare. Get the blood out, stupid.
- See?

640
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,028
And medium rare, keep the blood in.

641
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,112
All right. Look.

642
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,491
All I want to know which is which
before I order some undone meat.

643
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,993
Hey, Mr. Colvin. How it work?

644
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,120
Look, we're just gonna
ask the waiter. All right?

645
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,498
Oh, shit. There's a waiter?

646
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,583
Just right down the block.

647
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,212
- Where she at, dawg?
- Ain't seen her.

648
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,255
She owe me. All that shit I gave her.

649
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,341
I don't know.

650
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,554
- How you not know?
- I don't know.

651
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,308
She let me find her,
I'm gonna cut her titty off. Watch.

652
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,103
- You got something to say, nigger?
- No, no.

653
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,146
Yo, where Herc at?

654
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,148
I got the asshole, OK?

655
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,609
Tell him Riggs and Calhoun.

656
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:43,195
He knows. He knows.

657
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,155
OK.

658
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,704
Get the fuck back here.
Nigger, I will fuck you up.

659
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,581
You don't know Lex?

660
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,127
I knew the Bull. I mean, I know him.

661
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,712
But he ain't been around, though.

662
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,922
You see? Right there. You just fucked up.

663
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,008
You said you knew him,
like you knew he was dead.

664
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,468
No. Now you putting words in my mouth.

665
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,178
I meant, knew him.

666
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,265
When he was around, I knew him. But he left.

667
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,100
Herc.

668
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,026
Bubbles called. He sees the guy, the asshole.
He's on Riggs and Calhoun.

669
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,029
Says he'll hold him there five minutes
for you to get across town.

670
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,407
I'm in the middle of an interview here.
What the fuck?

671
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,452
Tell him we'll fix his problem tomorrow.

672
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,203
All right?

673
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,624
Motherfucker.

674
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,334
He ain't got a phone.

675
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:43,088
You lied to me out on the street.
Why should I believe you now?

676
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,676
You was there when Lex got killed.
You were part of the fucking setup.

677
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:51,388
We know 'cause we have a witness
who puts you right in there.

678
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:52,723
Yeah, we do.

679
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,476
You know right where that body is.

680
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:00,314
You were there with Snoop,
Chris, whoever else.

681
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:07,071
Know how to make
an interrogation work?

682
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,407
- Leverage.
- We don't have leverage?

683
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:14,495
Motherfucker, you don't even got a body.
Lex is nothing but a name in there.

684
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,876
Where the fuck you think you're going?

685
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,337
You ain't going nowhere.

686
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,464
Hey, you.

687
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,009
Hello!

688
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,428
Bubbles' Depot here! Bubbles' Depot!

689
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:34,431
What you got for me tonight?
I've been missing you all day long, dawg.

690
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,517
We done with this right here.
We done with this.

691
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,310
I ain't got time for your shit.

692
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,229
My shit's all you're gonna get, all right?

693
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:43,315
You can kiss my ass,
all the fucking trouble you given me.

694
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,403
What you looking for?
It's not there. It's on me.

695
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,531
- It's on you?
- Yeah.

696
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,200
- It's on you?
- Wait, wait, wait!

697
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,372
No, no, no!

698
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,457
Get off me! Get off me!

699
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,086
Get off!

700
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,130
Wait, wait, wait! Take it! Take it!

701
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,799
- I got you now!
- No, no, no!

702
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,553
You like that? Fuck!

703
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,530
- I don't like the orange ones.
- Listen to me, fuckhead.

704
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,199
We know you were there,
we know you set him up,

705
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,243
and we know you didn't do it alone.

706
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,287
- Say what?
- You weren't alone in this.

707
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,205
We know that.

708
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,666
You mean Randy?

709
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,589
I'm asking you questions, remember?

710
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,466
If you don't give us this murder, Kevin,
somebody else will.

711
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,720
And when they do, they'll be putting you in.
You hear me?

712
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,487
- Colvin, party of four.
- I'll make sure your table's ready.

713
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,573
"Colvin, party of four," huh?

714
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,534
Hi. May I take your coat?

715
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,620
Sure.

716
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,789
- You, sir?
- Oh, no. I'm good.

717
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,167
Yeah, me too.

718
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,629
OK, your table's ready.

719
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,797
Follow me, please.

720
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,735
- Sir?
- That's your chair, right?

721
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,154
No. You sit there.

722
00:42:55,865 --> 00:43:00,535
The waitress will be here soon
to detail the specials of the day.

723
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,455
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

724
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,749
Waitress? Who was that?

725
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,627
- That's the hostess.
- You ain't gotta worry, Mr. C.

726
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,505
I ain't gonna run up your bill.
I'll get whatever's on special.

727
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,758
It ain't no Kmart Blue Light Special,
dumb-ass.

728
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,469
Special just mean
they cook something different.

729
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:22,557
Yo, what about you,
drinking without a straw, all ghetto and shit?

730
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,227
You don't drink water with a straw.

731
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,271
And put that on your lap, fool.

732
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:30,649
You see anybody else up in here
looking all Fred Flintstone and shit?

733
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:35,529
Sh. Shut it down.
Other people be looking at us.

734
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,657
Hello. My name is Pam.

735
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,493
I'd like to tell you about
our specials for the day.

736
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:46,373
We have king salmon with sweetcorn,
chanterelles and basil aïoli,

737
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:50,794
sautéed free-range chicken
served with mashed potatoes,

738
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:55,132
fresh Chesapeake Bay blue crab,
roasted garlic, shallot cream

739
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,175
and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms,

740
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,261
and wood-oven-roasted quail

741
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,389
- with grilled bread salad.
- Dang.

742
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,141
I thought y'all had steak.

743
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,893
Oh, we do,
on the second page of your menus.

744
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,689
May I get your drink orders?

745
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,238
Yeah. Uh, we'll take four cokes, please.

746
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,490
- Right away.
- Thank you.

747
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,216
Do you mind if I come tomorrow?

748
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,512
Mind?

749
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,348
I...

750
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,099
Ahem.

751
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:49,478
- You wouldn't be embarrassed?
- No, not at all.

752
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,650
I mean...

753
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,029
I'll be proud if you're there.

754
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,909
It's funny how it works out.

755
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,329
All those years I'm trying to climb the ladder,

756
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,290
kissing ass, covering ass,
doing what I'm told.

757
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,834
I finally let some of it out,
tell 'em what I really think,

758
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,922
and I'm going from lieutenant to colonel
in a little more than a year.

759
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,550
And, you, you're worried sick
about those subpoenas

760
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,552
and worried that Lester's
killing you with your boss...

761
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,639
But the subpoenas get me promoted.

762
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,185
I know.

763
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,814
You know, Marla once said to me,
"You cannot lose if you do not play."

764
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,399
But here we are, right?

765
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,120
Maybe it's changing.

766
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,788
What is?

767
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,667
The city, the way things work or don't.

768
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,546
Maybe we're turning a corner here

769
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,382
and it's not gonna be so
unbelievably fucked up any more.

770
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,511
To Carcetti.

771
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,222
And us.

772
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:16,273
Zenobia, you want to take a picture
of the restaurant, right?

773
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,650
- That's OK. It's late.
- No, no. That's fine.

774
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,069
- Come on. Give me the camera.
- I'm OK.

775
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,613
Come on, give me the camera.

776
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,532
OK.

777
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,702
Y'all want to be in the picture, right?

778
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,463
Yo, Mr. C, can we stop at McDonald's?

779
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,923
- Fuck wrong with you, boy?
- Food wasn't right.

780
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,135
- Don't like fish.
- Why'd you order it, then?

781
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,220
Yo, shut the fuck up.

782
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,898
- Turn it down, man.
- What?

783
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,483
Turn it down, Namond.

784
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,568
Turn it up? All right, you got it.

785
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,696
Seriously, can I get some fries at least?

786
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,531
Boy, you is pathetic.

787
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:10,535
Just 'cause you a girl do not mean
I won't fuck you all up. You hear me?

788
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,662
Nigger, please.

789
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:15,499
- You keep talking all of that shit.
- No, you keep talking shit.

790
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,751
- Must have forgot.
- No, I ain't forget shit.

791
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,711
- What I forget anyway?
- That I'm the man.

792
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:24,591
OK. So, what's the first thing we do

793
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,302
when we respond to a prompt?

794
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,720
Randy?

795
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,473
"According to the text..."?

796
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,684
"According to the text."

797
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:35,810
That's good.

798
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,688
And how do we end the answer?

799
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,398
Quanice?

800
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,609
Come on. I know you know this.

801
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:51,368
"The above-stated facts have
led me to conclude that..."

802
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:52,702
Right?

803
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,372
OK. So, let's try to read
the third paragraph.

804
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:59,834
I'll start it. "Pythias makes a final plea
to the tyrant Dionysius

805
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:04,756
"to return to his home one last..."
Calvin, pick it up.

806
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,385
"To return to his home one last time
before his punishment.

807
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:12,222
"He denies the request
until Damon inter..."

808
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:14,724
Intercedes.

809
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,438
"..and offers his own life
until Pythias returns."

810
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:24,651
Good. Who wants to guess
what "intercedes" means?

811
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,827
What about "plea"?

812
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,750
OK. What about the story, then?

813
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,545
How would you summarize it?

814
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,339
Duquan, give it a shot.

815
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,675
According to the text...

816
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,428
Everybody's safe in the end, right?

817
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,473
OK. Let's think this through.

818
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,350
"According to the text,

819
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:00,228
"Damon offers his own life
on behalf of Pythias

820
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,439
"so that he can return home
one last time.

821
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,233
"The above-stated facts
have led me to conclude

822
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:09,321
"that Damon values Pythias's
friendship and loyalty."

823
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,701
Any questions?

824
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,790
We want four of the raw.

825
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,209
275 large right there.

826
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,545
For four it should be three.

827
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,798
I'm charging five a head on them
New York boys. That about the going rate.

828
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,759
- Still want us on that?
- Nah.

829
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:33,762
Seems like they got the message
and went the fuck on.

830
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:38,141
True that. Delroy has all of the
Monument Street corners back.

831
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,644
All right, then. Holler at us
when the next package in.

832
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,605
Uh-uh. You remember when I told
you about the co-op meant

833
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,398
we all stand together,

834
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,318
doing for each other when we can?
You remember that?

835
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:53,823
Well, the price of four raw is 300.

836
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:58,078
And your work on them New York boys
already been factored into the price, you see?

837
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,496
On the other hand,

838
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,541
we got something that you want,
and it's coming back to you free of charge.

839
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,461
Someone you looking for.

840
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,214
Co-op mean what it sound like, dawg.

841
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:13,760
You happy to do for me,
I'm happy to do for you.

842
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,055
Congratulations, Colonel.

843
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,100
Congratulations, Deputy Commissioner.

844
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,311
Congratulations to all those
who were promoted,

845
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:24,979
their families and friends.

846
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:29,693
It's a proud day for them and a proud day
for the Baltimore Police Department.

847
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:43,081
- I am so proud of you.
- Thank you.

848
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,670
You know, Valchek we could have guessed.

849
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,214
I mean, he's Carcetti's man, but...

850
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,008
Daniels?

851
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:01,474
Long time for you to make major,
but this was quick enough.

852
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,560
Yeah, who's your new rabbi, huh?

853
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,353
Colonel.

854
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:09,983
So, they didn't know the salad fork from
whatever the other fork is for. So what?

855
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,986
I knew they'd be at a loss,
but the extent of it...

856
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,238
I'm talking about feelings -

857
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,990
why they feeling this...

858
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,076
this plummet from masters
of the universe to abject fear

859
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,078
to humiliated fury and no awareness of it.

860
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,998
Who says they're not aware?
Maybe they just didn't acknowledge.

861
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,500
My point is, where do you start with them

862
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,669
if they can't even admit their feelings

863
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:32,630
about who they are
and what they doing in this world?

864
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:35,341
They're not fools.

865
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,428
They know exactly
what we expect them to be.

866
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,722
Y'all missed some meal for real, though.

867
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,849
- Take your seats.
- It was hot, yo.

868
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,352
- "Party of four, Mr. Colvin."
- "May I take your coat, Mr. Brice?"

869
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,188
That shit was tight.

870
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,190
I'm dreaming about that chocolate cake.

871
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,025
Oh, my God.

872
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,778
Shit had, like, 56 layers, yo!

873
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,030
"..in the checkroom, Mr. Colvin..."

874
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,121
"D Money saves Pitman"?

875
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,586
It's bullshit!

876
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,799
Before, at least they were
getting something out of it.

877
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:21,054
To hell with my evaluation, Donnelly,
the state-wide test scores.

878
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,722
I came here to teach.

879
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,390
Right?

880
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,192
Yo, Coach, seen Michael?

881
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,694
- Nah.
- All right.

882
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:41,825
That wasn't you and your runts I saw
down on Bentlow yesterday slinging?

883
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,202
Right.

884
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,330
'Cause a gangster like yourself
wouldn't set up such a weak-ass shop

885
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:51,042
with no real lookouts,
ground stash in plain view.

886
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,254
This is me telling y'all as plain as I can.
You guys had your one chance.

887
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,755
I see you out there a second time,

888
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,216
everyone takes a beating
and goes to Cheltenham.

889
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,343
Fair warning you just got.

890
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,513
Cheltenham for some drug charges?
Please, man.

891
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,683
I'll write you up as a special.
Don't think I won't do it.

892
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,601
Jab, jab! Good.

893
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,522
He don't think I can jail?
Shit! I can jail.

894
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,566
- What's up?
- Namond's banging, huh?

895
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,609
Yeah. He's one of yours, right?

896
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:20,405
He hang around the gym,
mostly waiting on his boy Michael.

897
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,282
He don't box or nothing.

898
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,493
He ain't that kind, really. Not like his father.

899
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:27,412
- Who was his father?
- Dude named Wee-Bey.

900
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,789
Stone-headed.
Used to run with them Barksdales.

901
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:32,750
I know him. Shit, I locked him up
in Philadelphia.

902
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,294
Yeah?

903
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,088
Bey was my cut buddy.
We jailed down Jessup.

904
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:41,384
Anyway, Namond's from him.

905
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,012
Same blood, but not the same heart.

906
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,349
- I've done my warm-ups, Coach.
- Yeah, we ready for the ring.

907
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,393
Take care, man.

908
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,737
Why we stopping here?
I thought we was going straight out.

909
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,488
Gotta get with your escort out.

910
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,158
Prop Joe said you was my escort out.

911
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,827
Manner of speaking, that be true.

912
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,382
Come on over here, man. Come on.

913
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,055
Chris, no.

914
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,140
You know I keep it quick, Dre.

915
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,602
- Here?
- Here's good.

916
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,355
- Not in a vacant.
- What's the difference?

917
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,191
The difference is my people.
They won't know.

918
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,611
- They'll know.
- But the rats.

919
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,155
- I'll be alone with the rats.
- You're all right.

920
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,783
- I got your back.
- Come on, Chris.

921
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:50,536
Let me do it in my house
so my people can give me a home-go.

922
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,670
I'll be damned.

923
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,507
Hey, yo, that got to be Marlo, man.

924
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,300
You see?

925
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:08,346
That's the man we robbed, yo,
from the poker game.

926
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,474
Ah. Sí. Sí, sí.

927
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,852
No wonder the boy don't like me.

928
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,716
Thought maybe I could catch up with Chris.

929
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:37,477
I got a problem I can't bring to no one else.

930
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,014
He just a kid.
