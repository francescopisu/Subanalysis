1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,592
<i>TYSON".
Seeing is not believing.</i>

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,887
<i>Our senses can deceive us.</i>

3
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,932
<i>Even the stars
are not what they appear to be.</i>

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,316
<i>The cosmos, as revealed by science...</i>

5
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,695
<i>...is stranger than we ever
could have imagined.</i>

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,949
<i>Light, and time, and space, and gravity...</i>

7
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:29,955
<i>...conspire to create realities
which lie beyond human experience.</i>

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,616
<i>That's where we're headed.</i>

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,118
<i>Come with me.</i>

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,836
Back in 1802, on a night like this...

11
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,875
...the astronomer William Herschel...

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,797
...strolled a beach on the English coast
with his son John.

13
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,432
Herschel was the first person ever...

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,766
...to see into the deeper waters
of the cosmic ocean.

15
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,938
<i>There, he glimpsed the magic trick
that light does with time.</i>

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,774
Father, do you believe in ghosts?

17
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,780
WhY, Yes, my son.

18
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,941
You-- You do?

19
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,826
I would not have thought so.

20
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,330
Oh, no. Not in the human kind of ghost.

21
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,331
No. Not at all.

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,618
But look up, my boy.

23
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,663
And see a sky full of them.

24
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,835
The stars, Father?

25
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,375
I do not follow.

26
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:27,555
Every star is a sun as big, as bright,
as our own.

27
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,434
Just imagine, how far away from us
you'd have to move the sun...

28
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,347
...to make it appear as small and faint
as a star.

29
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:39,149
The light from the stars travels very fast.

30
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,525
Faster than anything.

31
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,107
But not infinitely fast.

32
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,865
It takes time for their light to reach us.

33
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,119
For the nearest ones, it takes years.

34
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,871
For others, centuries.

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,283
Some stars are so far away...

36
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,420
...it takes eons for their
light to get to Earth.

37
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,879
By the time the light
from some stars gets here...

38
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,590
...they are already dead.

39
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:11,220
For those stars, we see only their ghosts.

40
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,383
We see their light...

41
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,805
...but their bodies
perished long, long ago.

42
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,568
John, I have seen further back in time...

43
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,728
...than any man before me.

44
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,739
Millions of years into the past.

45
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,911
<i>TYSON". William Herschel
was the first person to understand...</i>

46
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,290
<i>...that a telescope is a time machine.</i>

47
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,583
<i>We cannot look out into space...</i>

48
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,666
<i>...without seeing back in time.</i>

49
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:46,755
<i>In one second,
light travels 300,000 kilometers...</i>

50
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,295
<i>...or 186,000 miles.</i>

51
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,385
<i>That's nearly the distance
from the Earth to the moon.</i>

52
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,847
<i>So the moon is about one light-second away.</i>

53
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:01,857
<i>The next time you look at the moon,
you'll be seeing one second into the past.</i>

54
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,492
<i>TYSON".
That sun?</i>

55
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,331
<i>It's not really there.</i>

56
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,670
<i>It won't be actually be above the horizon
for another two minutes.</i>

57
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,175
<i>The sunrise is an illusion.</i>

58
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,053
<i>Earth's atmosphere
bends the incoming rays of sunlight...</i>

59
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,385
<i>...like a lens or a glass of water.</i>

60
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,051
<i>So we see the image of the sun
projected above the horizon...</i>

61
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,518
<i>...before the physical
sun is actually there.</i>

62
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,607
That sun behind me is a mirage.

63
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,895
No more real than a shimmering image
that hovers in the distance...

64
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,905
...over at a desert road on a hot day.

65
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,908
Sunlight takes about eight minutes
to reach Earth.

66
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,241
So the sun is eight light-minutes away.

67
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,909
From Earth, we can only ever see the sun
as it was eight minutes ago.

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,539
And another thing,
the sun doesn't really rise at all.

69
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,925
The Earth turns and we turn with it.

70
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:39,807
It may not look like it, but right at this
moment, I'm moving faster than a jet plane.

71
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,138
So are you and everyone on Earth.

72
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,765
And while I'm at it...
...that horizon?

73
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,396
It's not really there at all.

74
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,440
There's no edge.

75
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,102
The horizon is just another illusion.

76
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,747
The distance between Earth
and the outermost planet, Neptune...

77
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,256
...varies as the planets orbit the sun.

78
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,965
But on average, the light makes that trip
in four hours.

79
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,006
So for us on Earth, the Neptune we see...

80
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,469
...is always four hours in the past.

81
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,976
Four light-hours away.

82
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,979
But the distances to the planets,
even the farthest one...

83
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,641
...are mere baby steps
on a much grander scale...

84
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,935
...of the stars and the galaxies.

85
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,242
As soon as we leave
the sun's immediate neighborhood...

86
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,998
...we need to change the unit of distance
from light-hours to light-years.

87
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,784
A light-year is the
yardstick of the cosmos.

88
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,624
A single one is nearly
10 trillion kilometers.

89
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,380
Or about 6 trillion miles.

90
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,668
It's a unit of distance just like a meter
or a mile.

91
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,053
It's the distance light travels in a year.

92
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,511
The nearest star to the sun,
Proxima Centauri...

93
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,177
...is a little more than four light-years
away from Earth.

94
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,688
How far away is four light-years?

95
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:15,694
NASA's Voyager spacecraft moves at
more than 56,000 kilometers an hour.

96
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,946
Even at that astonishing speed...

97
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,108
...it would take Voyager
more than 80,000 years...

98
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,948
...to reach the nearest star.

99
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,448
And the stars of the Pleiades cluster?

100
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,743
Four hundred light-years away.

101
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:36,207
The ship of the imagination is equipped
with a highly unusual capability.

102
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,841
One of a kind, actually.

103
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,128
It makes it possible for us
to see what was happening...

104
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,797
...when the light
from a distant star or galaxy...

105
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,763
...first set out on its
long journey to Earth.

106
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,729
When that light left the Pleiades
about 400 years ago...

107
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,441
...Galileo was taking his first look
through a telescope.

108
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,652
A few years later, he tried to measure
the speed of light.

109
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,158
But he couldn't do it.

110
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,034
He had a very clever plan.

111
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,821
But the technology of that era
just wasn't good enough...

112
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:12,164
...to measure the motion of anything
that moves as fast as light.

113
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,041
When we look at the Crab Nebula
from Earth...

114
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,083
...we're seeing much farther back in time.

115
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,880
The Crab Nebula was once a giant star,
1O times the mass of the sun.

116
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,639
Until it exploded in a supernova.

117
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,926
At its heart is a pulsar:

118
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:34,599
A collapsed star the size of a city
spinning 30 times a second.

119
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,157
This pulsar's whirling magnetic field...

120
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,659
...whips nearby electrons into a frenzy.

121
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,448
Accelerating them
to almost the speed of light.

122
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,617
They shine with a blue glow that lights up
the tendrils of gas...

123
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,627
...still unraveling from the supernova.

124
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:02,126
The Crab Nebula is about 6500 light-years
from Earth.

125
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,294
According to some beliefs...

126
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,385
...that's the age of the whole universe.

127
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,393
But if the universe
were only 6500 years old...

128
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:16,182
...how could we see the light from anything
more distant than the Crab Nebula?

129
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,770
We couldn't.

130
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,400
There wouldn't have been enough time...

131
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,779
...for the light to get to Earth
from anywhere farther away...

132
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,282
...than 6500 light-years in any direction.

133
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,034
That's just enough time...

134
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:32,664
...for light to travel through a tiny
portion of our Milky Way galaxy.

135
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,702
To believe in a universe as young
as 6 or 7000 years old...

136
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:40,168
...is to extinguish the light
from most of the galaxy.

137
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,426
Not to mention, the light from all the
hundred billion other galaxies...

138
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,461
...in the observable universe.

139
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:21,876
The center of our own galaxy
is about 30,000 light-years from Earth.

140
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,381
The light we see today...

141
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,668
...coming from the core of the Milky Way...

142
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:31,307
...left there when our ancestors
were perfecting a way to vanquish death...

143
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,135
...by making art...

144
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,557
...with the power to inspire those
who would come long after they were gone.

145
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,076
The light we see
coming from the Sombrero Galaxy...

146
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,739
...is 3O million years old.

147
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,125
Our ancestors were living in trees
when that light started out.

148
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:03,289
They weighed about 5 kilos
and had long tails.

149
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,923
But even 3O million light-years away...

150
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,928
...is still in our own cosmic backyard.

151
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,350
<i>That galaxy is part of the Coma Cluster...</i>

152
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,854
<i>...320 million light-years</i> away.

153
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:25,645
<i>What was going on back home when the light
you were seeing began its trip to Earth?</i>

154
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,485
No familiar continents, oceans or rivers.

155
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,993
Our distant ancestors
were just leaving the water for the land.

156
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:39,124
It's pretty old light.
But not nearly the oldest light we can see.

157
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,749
<i>The oldest light is very faint.</i>

158
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,256
<i>A pale ghost in the night.</i>

159
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,338
<i>See that red blob inside the circle?</i>

160
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,004
<i>That's one of the oldest galaxies
we've ever seen.</i>

161
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:57,642
<i>You're looking
at 13.4 billion-year-old starlight...</i>

162
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,475
<i>...as captured
by the Hubble Space Telescope.</i>

163
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:12,532
It's coming from the very first
generation of stars.

164
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,160
What was happening on Earth back then?

165
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,991
Absolutely nothing.

166
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,828
There was no Earth. No sun. No Milky Way.

167
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,166
They would not come to be
for billions of years.

168
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,503
When we try to look even farther
into the universe...

169
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,170
...we come to what appears to be

<i>That little girl is trying her best

175

186
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,290
It's radiation left over
from the Big Bang...

187
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,710
...the explosion that made the universe...

188

Nobody knows.

193
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,444
No evidence survives
from before that moment.

194
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,697
We've got some pretty crazy ideas
about where the universe came from.

At the very center.

198
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,618
In the observed universe,
everyone gets to feel special.

199
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,413
No matter which galaxy
you happen to live in...

200
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,502
...when you look out to the universe...

201
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,794
...you'll find yourself at the center
of the cosmic horizon.

202
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,803
But this is just an illusion.

203
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,760
In reality, there is no center.

204
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:47,305
And the cosmic horizon is no more real
than the horizon at sea.

205
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,815
It's what you get
when you have finite speed of light...

206
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,773
...in a universe that had
a beginning in time.

207
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,617
A few hundred million years
after the Big Bang...

208

...vast clouds of
hydrogen and helium

209
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,498
condensed into the first
stars and galaxies.

210
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,283
With these new sources of light...

211
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,293
...the long dark ages
of the universe ended.

212
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,922
As space continued to expand...

213
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,175
...cosmic evolution unfolded
on grander scales.

214
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,007
As the first generation of stars died...

215
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,048
...they seeded space
with heavier elements...

216
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,763
...making possible the
formation of planets...

217
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,020
...and ultimately life.

218
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,778
Matter and energy were formed
in the Big Bang.

219
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,153
But that's not all.

220
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,360
Space and time were created too.

221
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,867
And all the forces that
bind matter together.

222
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,493
Including gravity.

223
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:49,078
Isaac Newton discovered a mathematical law
that describes how gravity works.

224
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,915
With that law, he could explain
the motions of the planets.

225
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,829
More than 100 years later...

226
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:59,593
...William Herschel realized
gravity could do much more.

227
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,764
John, can you keep a secret?

228
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,018
Yes, father.

229
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,146
I've made a discovery...

230
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,433
...and have yet to tell another soul.

231
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,896
That gravity that holds us to the Earth...

232
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:23,316
...the same gravity that Newton showed
keeps the planets in their orbits...

233
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:28,535
...I've discovered that it also rules
the distant stars.

234
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,784
Father, but how can you know this?

235
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,250

Well done.

238

Can you now find star that joins
the lion's head to his body?

240

WILLIAM:
That star is really two stars.

241
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,474
So close together
that they appear to be one.

242
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,938
I've been watching them
through my telescope...

243
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,354

<i>...but the fields between them do.</i>

260
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,930
<i>He imagined
those lines of gravitational force...</i>

that had stumped Newton.</i>

264
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,859
<i>In 1865...</i>

265
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,764
<i>...James Clerk Maxwell
translated Faraday's idea</i>

266
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,529
<i>about fields of electricity
and magnetism...</i>

267
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,368
<i>...into mathematical laws.</i>

268
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,455
<i>He discovered that these fields
moved through space in waves.</i>

269
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,087
<i>When he calculated how fast they move...</i>

270
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,044
<i>...it turned out to be the speed of light.</i>

271
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,836
<i>We were beginning to discover
the threads of the cosmic tapestry.</i>

<i>As Albert Einstein worked in Berlin
on his theory of gravity...</i>

275

<i>...he kept the portraits of these three men
before him.</i>

278
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,368
<i>...he had an insight that was as
earthshaking as any idea of theirs.</i>

279
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:17,407

In the summer of 1895...

281
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,419
...Einstein's father's business in Germany
had failed...

282
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,509
...and the family had moved here
to northern Italy.

283
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:38,395
Young Einstein loved wandering these roads
and giving his mind free reign to explore.

There's something timeless
about this place.

285
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,446
Nothing here has really changed since
the time of Einstein's early daydreams.

286
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,740
One day, he began to think about light.

287
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,780
And how fast it travels.

288
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,167
In everyday life we've always measured
the speed of a moving object...

289
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,952
...with respect to something else.

290
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,339
Something that's presumably not moving.

291
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,966
Something in the cosmos

<i>Earth is turning at more than
1600 kilometers per hour...</i>

<i>...while it orbits the sun at more than
100,000 kilometers per hour.</i>

297
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:33,029
<i>And the sun is moving through the galaxy
at a half a million miles per hour.</i>

<i>The Milky Way is moving
through the universe...</i>

<i>All of nature is in motion.</i>

302
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,546
It was hard,
even for the young Einstein...

303
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:52,927
...to imagine some absolute standard to
measure all those relative motions against.

304
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,521

And in a way, even the universe.

Look at this. The very first page.

308
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,493
It describes the astonishing speed
of electricity through wires...

309
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,538
...and light through space.

310
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,674
Einstein remembered what he'd learned
as a child from this book.

311
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,006
And perhaps, for the first time,
right here...

312
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,675
...wondered what the world would look like
if you could travel at the speed of light.

00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:48,016
<i>TYSON". The more Einstein thought about it,
the more troubled he became.</i>

<i>If you imagine traveling
at the speed of light...</i>

315
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,772
<i>...paradoxes seem to pop up everywhere.</i>

316
00:21:55,397 --> 00:22:00,244

much of what had been accepted as truth...</i>

317
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,248
<i>...by even the authorities on the subject
was just plain wrong.</i>

318
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,788
When traveling at high speeds, there are
certain rules which must be obeyed.

319
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,959
Einstein called these rules
the Principles of Relativity.

320
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,091
<i>Imagine that young woman
who just blew past us on a motorbike.</i>

321
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,009
<i>Imagine she was riding her bike
through the cosmos.</i>

322
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,100
<i>Light from a moving object travels
at the same speed...</i>

323
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,232
<i>...no matter whether the object is at rest
or in motion.</i>

324
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,568
<i>Her speed is not added
to the speed of light.</i>

325
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:38,324
<i>The light from her motorbike still travels
at the speed of light.</i>

326
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:44,785
Nature commands, "Thou shalt not
add my speed to the speed of light."

327
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:49,999
Also, no material object can travel at
or faster than the speed of light.

328
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,635
Nothing in physics prevents
you from traveling

329

of light as you like.

330
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,795
Ninety-nine-point-nine percent
of the speed of light is just fine.

you'd never gain that last decimal point.

The crack of that whip is due to its tip
moving faster than the speed of sound.

336
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:24,821
It makes a shockwave, a mini sonic boom
in the Italian countryside.

337
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,539
[WHIP CRACK]

338
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,666
A thunderclap works the same way.

339
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,954
So does the sound
of a passing supersonic jet.

340
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:38,009
So why is the speed of light
any more a barrier than the speed of sound?

341
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:42,673
The answer is not just that light travels
about a million times faster than sound.

342
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:47,014
And it's not merely an engineering problem,
like building the first supersonic jet.

343
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:50,897
Instead, the light barrier
is a fundamental law of nature.

344
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,648
As basic as gravity.

345
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,855
Einstein found his absolute framework
for the world.

346
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,022
This sturdy pillar
among all the relative motions...

347
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,282
...within the motions of the cosmos.

348
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,408
Light travels just as fast...

349
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,946
...no matter how fast or slow
its source is moving.

350
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,707
The speed of light is constant,
relative to everything else.

351
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,994
Nothing can ever catch up with it.

352
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,379
The thing about the laws of nature
is that they're unbreakable.

353
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,294
The job of physicists
is to discover these commandments...

354
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,682
...the ones that do not vary
from culture to culture and time to time...

355
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,888
...and hold true throughout the cosmos.

356
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,521
<i>That's why, as Einstein showed...</i>

357
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,310
<i>...funny things happen
close to the speed of light.</i>

358
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,406
Traveling close to the speed of light...

359
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,862
...is kind of an elixir of life...

360
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:49,531
...because your biological clock slows
down, relative to those you leave behind.

361
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:54,328
This phenomena may provide us humans,
who only live for a century or so...

362
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,042
...a practical means to
travel to the stars...

363
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,584
...where the magic show of space-time
really gets crazy.

364
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,143
<i>TYSON: The 19th century astronomer
William Herschel...</i>

365
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:20,106
<i>...loved to share the wonders of
the universe with his son, John.</i>

366
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,708
I once had a friend, a very clever fellow,
an astronomer...

367
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,667
...and a parson at Leeds,
by the name of John Michell.

368
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:43,168
Poor man died when you were a babe,
God rest his soul.

369
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,300
He held that some stars are invisible.

370
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,637
They really exist,
but we shall never see them.

371
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,012
Dark stars, Michell called them.

372
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,148
With all due respect, Father...

373
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,526
...surely your friend was mistaken.

374
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:05,110
If no one can see them,
then how can we possibly know they exist?

375
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,826
Did you see the man
who left those footprints, John?

376
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,497
Why, no, Father, I did not.

377
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,374
But do you know that he exists?

378
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,357
<i>TYSON". John Michell was
one of the greatest</i>

379
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:38,644
<i>scientists you've
probably never heard of.</i>

380
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,525
<i>He lived and worked in England
in the 18th century.</i>

381
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,983
<i>If he ever sat for a portrait,
it no longer exists.</i>

382
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:48,991
<i>He was once described by an acquaintance
as a short little man...</i>

383
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,198
<i>...of black complexion, and fat.</i>

384
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:57,333
Michell imagined a star
so big, so massive...

385
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:01,462
...that nothing, not even light,
could escape its gravitational grip.

386
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,998
Can you find the dark star?

387
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,883
You can't see it with
your eyes, not directly.

388
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,922
But it may leave a kind of footprint
on the cosmic shore.

389
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,558
Michell realized that
we might detect some of these dark stars...

390
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,718
...because of their extreme gravity.

391
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,560
If one happened to be near a smaller,
luminous companion star...

392
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:25,819
...that star would appear to travel
in a tight orbit, around nothing.

393
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,942
Even though we can't see it...

394
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,234
...we know something with a lot of mass
has to be right there.

395
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,743
A dark star.

396
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,531
Or what today we call a black hole.

397
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,416
What does a black hole look like?

398
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,873
And what would it be like inside?

399
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,161
We'll get there.

400
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,253
But first, let's make a pit stop
in my hometown:

401
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,627
<i>New York City...</i>

402
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,923
<i>...where it's always seemed to me
that everything is in constant motion.</i>

403
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,634
<i>I've lived here most of my life.</i>

404
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,768
<i>There's always something new to see.</i>

405
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,726
But one thing never changes: gravity.

406
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:06,440
Gravity on Earth has been the same
for the past four and a half billion years.

407
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,276
But what if today, we could alter it?

408
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,574
Gravity is a distortion
in the shape of space-time...

409
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,111
...as Einstein has showed.

410
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,451
Space can expand or contract and warp
without limit.

411
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,961
If the Earth's size or density
were even a little different...

412
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,716
...its gravity would be too.

413
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,424
There's an infinite range of possibilities.

414
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,181
New Yorkers feel right at home
with the gravitational pull of the Earth...

415
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,842
...called 1g.

416
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:46,146
Suppose we turn off the gravity
on one of its streets.

417
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:56,527
<i>People and objects that were already
in motion are launched into flight.</i>

418
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:10,542
Now, what if I turned the gravity up
to, say, eight or nine g's?

419
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,632
Out of compassion, let's evacuate the area.

420
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,472
This is about the same g-force...

421
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,305
...that a fighter pilot
in a high-speed turn would feel.

422
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:24,688
A few minutes of this wouldn't hurt you,
but it wouldn't be comfortable.

423
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,190
<i>At 100,0009's...</i>

424
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:31,900
<i>...even fire hydrants become crushed
by their own enormous weight.</i>

425
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,939
But at millions of g's...

426
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,859
...even light bows to gravity.

427
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:41,826
The light still moves at its constant
speed, but it cannot escape.

428
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:46,542
Michell's dark star...
...our black hole.

429
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:50,457
And the nearest one
may be closer than you think.

TYSON:
<i>Not every star can become</i> a <i>black hole.</i>

431

<i>Only about one in a thousand

432
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,890
<i>The nearest one could be
within 100 light years of Earth.</i>

433
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:12,733
Black holes aren't the mythic,
cosmic vacuum cleaners of science fiction.

434
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,068
They don't go around
gobbling up unsuspecting worlds.

435
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,074
You've gotta come to them.

436
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,703
But if you do,
it might be the last thing you ever see.

[RUMBLING]

438
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:28,961
That was us
resisting a few million g's of gravity.

439
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,293
Don't forget. That thing swallows light.

440
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,754
We'll keep our distance.

441
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,055
When giant stars exhaust
their nuclear fuel...

442
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,500
...they can no longer
stay hot enough to fend

443
00:30:42,512 --> 00:30:44,810
off the inward pull
of their own gravity.

444
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,938
The most massive stars collapse
into darkness...

445
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,770
...leaving only their gravity behind.

446
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:55,608
This black hole enshrouds
the shrunken corpse of a supergiant star.

447
00:30:55,771 --> 00:31:00,117
The star itself has shriveled into
something even smaller than this darkness.

448
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,529
Only 64 kilometers wide.

449
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,208
This is the first black
hole ever discovered.

450
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,790
Cygnus x-1.

451
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:16,459
How did we on Earth ever find
something so small and dark and far away?

452
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,424
We looked at it in another kind of light.

453
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,213
X-rays.

454
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,133
In X-ray light, we lost
sight of the blue star...

455
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,054
...because its surface
is a tepid 30,000 degrees.

456
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,851
But the disc of gas around the black hole
glowed brilliantly in X-rays...

457
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,519
...at 100 million degrees.

458
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,358
As William Herschel discovered...

459
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:41,822
...many stars have close companions,
forming a binary star system.

460
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:46,159
But if one member of such a pair is
enormous, and the other is compact...

461
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:52,203
...the smaller star can drain and consume
the atmosphere of its larger sibling.

462
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:56,586
This neurotic relationship
can last for millions of years.

463
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,466
The atmosphere of the larger star...

464
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,845
...was being siphoned on to
a glowing hot accretion disc...

465
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:06,179
...that revolves around, and spirals into,
a black hole.

466
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:11,598
The overwhelming gravity was accelerating
the blue star's gas into a death spiral...

467
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,688
...crossing the space-time boundary,
never to be seen again.

468
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:20,489
The fateful boundary that separates a black
hole from the rest of the universe...

469
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,570
...is called an event horizon.

470
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,154
From our point of view...

471
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,867
...the substance in the disc slows down
as it approaches the event horizon...

472
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,702
...never quite reaching it.

473
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:33,961
But if you were riding on that spiraling
gas, and I don't advise it...

474
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,464
...you would sail past the event horizon
in a matter of seconds...

475
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,966
...into the undiscovered country...

476
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,550
...from which no traveler returns.

477
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,023
We have searched the hearts
of dozens of galaxies...

478
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:59,062
...and in every case,
we have found a super massive black hole.

479
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,606
Our own galaxy is no exception.

480
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,365
<i>The stars nearest
to the center of our galaxy...</i>

481
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:11,748
<i>...whip around at more than
40 million kilometers an hour.</i>

482
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,414
What can make them move so fast?

483
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,124
The only logical explanation...

484
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:23,378
...is that something with a mass
of 4 million suns lies at the center.

485
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,465
So where are the blazing light
of 4 million suns?

486
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,886
Since we can't see it, it must be
imprisoned inside a black hole.

487
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,737
Earth is far enough away
to be perfectly safe.

488
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,614
Other worlds might not be so lucky.

489
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:51,238
If you somehow survived the perilous
journey to cross the event horizons...

490
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,123
...you'd be able to look
back out and see...

491
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,583
...the entire future history of the
universe unfold before your eyes.

492
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,545
How?

493
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,632
Because when space-time is warped
by the extreme gravity of a black hole...

494
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:10,299
...its time is stretched to the limit.

495
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,974
But what would be in front of you?

496
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,638
Before we go there...

497
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:21,060
...I should warn you that we are entering
uncharted scientific territory.

498
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,526
For all we know, there may be
undiscovered laws of physics...

499
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,532
...that govern events
at the center of the black hole.

500
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,112
But until the next Einstein comes along...

501
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,702
...let's perform a thought experiment.

502
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:41,497
That's how John Michell first imagined
dark stars in the 18th Century...

503
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,877
...and how Einstein conceived
his theory of rela--

504
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,145
<i>JOHN:
Father, do you believe in ghosts?</i>

505
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:48,565
<i>WILLIAM: Oh, no. Not in the human
kind of ghost. No, not at all.</i>

506
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,983
<i>But look up, my boy...</i>

507
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:55,074
<i>...and see a sky full of them.</i>

508
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,165
<i>TYSON: If you could survive
the trip into a black hole...</i>

509
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,954
<i>...you might emerge in another place
and time in our own universe...</i>

510
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,293
<i>...circumventing the first commandment
of relativity:</i>

511
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,710
<i>Thou shalt not travel faster than light.</i>

512
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,260
<i>Nothing can move through space
faster than light.</i>

513
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,891
<i>But space is not near emptiness.</i>

514
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,726
<i>It has properties. It can stretch
and shrink. It can be deformed.</i>

515
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,893
<i>And when that happens,
time is deformed too.</i>

516
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:34,618
Einstein discovered that space and time
are just two aspects of the same thing.

517
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,323
Space-time.

518
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:41,868
Space-time itself can deform enough
to carry you anywhere at any speed.

519
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:46,834
Black holes may very well be
tunnels through the universe.

520
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,017
<i>On this intergalactic subway system...</i>

521
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,524
<i>...you could travel
to the farthest reaches of space-time.</i>

522
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,483
<i>Or you might arrive in some place
even more amazing.</i>

523
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:16,034
We might find ourselves
in an altogether different universe.

524
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,991
But how can a whole universe fit
inside of a black hole...

525
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,204
...which is only a small
part of our universe?

526
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,919
That's another magic trick of space-time.

527
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,456
The phenomenal gravity of a black hole...

528
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:33,877
...can warp the space
of an entire universe inside it.

529
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,851
Our local gravity may be a drag to us...

530
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,643
...but it's really feeble compared with
what goes on inside a collapsed star.

531
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,023
As far as we know...

532
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,190
...when a giant star collapses
to make a black hole...

533
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:58,531
...the extreme density and pressure
at the center mimic the Big Bang...

534
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,991
...which gave rise to our universe.

535
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:04,954
And a universe inside a black hole
might give rise to its own black holes...

536
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,869
...and those could lead to other universes.

537
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,544
Maybe that's how our cosmos came to be.

538
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,808
For all we know...

539
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,820
...if you wanna see what it's like
inside a black hole...

540
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,944
...just look around you.

541
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,658
<i>William Herschel went on to discover...</i>

542
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,792
<i>...that the sun and its planets
are moving through the Milky Way.</i>

543
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,499
<i>And whatever became of his son John?</i>

544
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,460
<i>He grew up to become a great scientist.</i>

545
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:56,092
<i>His deep space observations
built on those of his father...</i>

546
00:38:56,251 --> 00:39:00,757
<i>...to become the basis for the standard
catalog of galaxies we use today.</i>

547
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,799
<i>When William was in failing health...</i>

548
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,355
<i>...John stayed with him
through the long nights</i>

549
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:07,767
<i>at his telescope, to help
him sweep the stars.</i>

550
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:12,768
<i>And when his father died,
John wrote his epitaph:</i>

551
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:17,148
<i>"He broke through the walls of heaven."</i>

552
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,252
<i>John often reminisced
about those summer nights with his father.</i>

553
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:36,083
<i>Maybe that's why
he sought a way to preserve the past.</i>

554
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,176
<i>John Herschel was one of the founders
of a new form of time travel...</i>

555
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:45,092
<i>...a means to capture light and memories.</i>

556
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,602
<i>He actually coined a word for it:</i>

557
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,933
<i>Photography-</i>

558
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:59,239
When you think about it,
photography is a form of time travel.

559
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,651
This man is staring at us
from across the centuries...

560
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,661
...a ghost preserved by light.

561
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,323
It's not hard to imagine that
in the near future...

562
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,164
...we'll be able to capture the past
in all three dimensions.

563
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,581
We'll be able to step inside a memory.

564
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,713
It may not be possible
to travel backward in time...

565
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:27,809
...but perhaps one day,
we can bring the past to us.

566
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,684
Here's a moment from my past.

567
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,692
Like John Herschel, I'm remembering
a younger version of myself.

568
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,649
December 20th, 1975.

569
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,819
A snowy day in Ithaca, New York.

570
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:47,238
A branchpoint on the road that brought me
to this moment with you.

571
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,657
It was the day I met Carl Sagan.

572
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:55,583
Reminds me of those ghost stars in the sky.

573
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:01,714
You know, the ones that still
shine their light upon us...

574
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,470
...long after they're gone.
