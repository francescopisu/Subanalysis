00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:08,267
TYSON:
<i>Once there was</i> a <i>world...</i>

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,725
<i>...not so very different from our own.</i>

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:24,199
<i>There were occasional natural catastrophes,
massive volcanic eruptions...</i>

4
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,826
<i>...and every once in a while...</i>

5
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,705
<i>...an asteroid would come barreling
out of the blue to do some damage.</i>

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,207
<i>But for the first billion years or so...</i>

7
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:37,167
<i>...it would have seemed like a paradise.</i>

8
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,799
<i>This is what we think the planet Venus
might have looked like...</i>

9
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,802
<i>...when our solar system was young.</i>

10
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:48,508
<i>Then, things started
to go horribly wrong.</i>

11
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,425
The planet Venus, which once
may have seemed like a heaven...

12
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,264
...turned into a kind of hell.

13
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,555
The difference between the two
can be a delicate balance...

14
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,019
...far more delicate
than you might imagine.

15
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,813
Once things began to unravel,
there was no way back.

16
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,780
This is what Venus...

17
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,692
...our nearest planetary neighbor,
looks like today.

18
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,373
<i>Venus' oceans are long gone.</i>

19
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:30,796
<i>The surface is hotter than a broiling oven,
hot enough to melt lead.</i>

20
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,008
<i>Why?</i>

21
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,183
<i>You might think it's
because Venus is 30</i>

22
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,220
<i>percent closer to the sun
than the Earth is...</i>

23
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,727
<i>...but that's not the reason.</i>

24
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,355
Venus is completely covered
by clouds of sulfuric acid...

25
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,734
...that keep almost all the sunlight
from reaching the surface.

26
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,736
That ought to make Venus
much colder than the Earth.

27
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,320
So why is Venus scorching hot?

28
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,656
It's because the small amount of sunlight
that trickles in through the clouds...

29
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,289
...to reach the surface
can't get back out again.

30
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:04,045
The flow of energy is blocked
by a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide.

31
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,752
That carbon dioxide gas,
or CO2 for short...

32
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,168
...acts like a smothering blanket
to keep the heat in.

33
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,384
No one is burning coal
or driving big gas-guzzlers on Venus.

34
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:20,144
Nature can destroy an environment
without any help from intelligent life.

35
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:24,523
Venus is in the grip
of a runaway greenhouse effect.

36
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,610
<i>Why does it look like we're inside a bowl?</i>

37
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,364
<i>It's due to the intense
atmospheric pressure.</i>

38
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,618
<i>That's the wreck of Venera 13.</i>

39
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:41,499
<i>In 1982, the scientists and engineers
of what was then the Soviet Union...</i>

40
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,035
<i>...successfully landed this spacecraft
on Venus.</i>

41
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,081
<i>They managed to keep it refrigerated
for over two hours...</i>

42
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,625
<i>...so it could photograph
its surroundings...</i>

43
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,671
<i>...and transmit the images back to Earth...</i>

44
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:59,307
<i>...before the on board
electronics were fried.</i>

45
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,768
Venus and Earth started out
with about the same amount of carbon.

46
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,404
But the two worlds were propelled
along radically different paths.

47
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:16,362
And carbon was the decisive element
in both stories.

48
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:20,075
On Venus it's almost all
in the form of gas:

49
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,411
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

50
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,289
Most of the carbon on Earth
has been stored for eons...

51
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,301
...in solid vaults
of carbonate rock like this one.

52
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,305
Part of a chain that forms
the celebrated White Cliffs of Dover...

53
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,761
...right on the English Channel.

54
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,933
What titan built
this wonder of the world?

55
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:05,123
<i>A creature a thousand times smaller
than a pinhead...</i>

56
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,955
<i>...trillions of them.</i>

57
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,290
<i>One-celled algae.</i>

58
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,302
Volcanoes supply carbon dioxide
to the atmosphere...

59
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,464
...and the oceans slowly absorb it.

60
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,928
Working over the course
of millions of years...

61
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,186
...the microscopic algae harvested
the carbon dioxide...

62
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,893
...and turned it into these tiny shells.

63
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,605
They accumulated in thick deposits
of chalk or limestone...

64
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,895
...on the ocean floor.

65
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,493
Later the restless Earth
pushed up the seafloor...

66
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,656
...and carved out these massive cliffs.

67
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:52,004
Other marine creatures took in carbon
dioxide to build enormous coral reefs.

68
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:58,215
And the oceans converted dissolved CO2 into
limestone even without any help from life.

69
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,973
As a result only a trace amount was left
as a gas in Earth's atmosphere...

70
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,180
...not even three-hundredths
of 1 percent.

71
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:12,146
Think of it, fewer than three molecules
out of every 10,000.

72
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,821
<i>And yet it makes the critical difference...</i>

73
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:23,031
<i>...between a barren wasteland
and a garden of life on Earth.</i>

74
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,616
<i>With no CO2 at all
the Earth would be frozen.</i>

75
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,960
<i>And with twice as many, we're still talking
about only six molecules out of 10,000...</i>

76
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:40,048
<i>...things would get uncomfortably hot
and cause us some serious problems.</i>

77
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,384
<i>But never as hot as Venus,
not even close.</i>

78
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,972
<i>That planet lost its ocean to space
billions of years ago.</i>

79
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,138
<i>Without an ocean
it had no way to capture CO2...</i>

80
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,898
<i>...from the atmosphere
and store it as a mineral.</i>

81
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,812
<i>The CO2 from erupting volcanoes
just continued to build up.</i>

82
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,070
<i>Today, that atmosphere
is 90 times heavier than ours.</i>

83
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,827
<i>Almost all of it
is heat-trapping carbon dioxide.</i>

84
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:11,993
<i>That's why Venus is such a ferocious
inferno, so hostile to life.</i>

85
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:17,547
The Earth, in stunning contrast, is alive.

86
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,087
It breathes...

87
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,468
...but very slowly.

88
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,721
A single breath takes a whole year.

89
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,344
The forests contain most
of Earth's life...

90
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,101
...and most forests
are in the Northern Hemisphere.

91
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,103
When spring comes to the north...

92
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:36,108
...the forests inhale carbon dioxide
from the air and grow...

93
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,394
...turning the land green.

94
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,860
The amount of CO2
in the atmosphere goes down.

95
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:46,152
When fall comes and the plants
drop their leaves, they decay...

96
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,617
...exhaling the carbon dioxide
back into the atmosphere.

97
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,202
The same thing happens
in the Southern Hemisphere...

98
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,413
...at the opposite time of the year.

99
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,295
But the Southern Hemisphere
is mostly ocean.

100
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:02,460
So the forests of the north that control
the annual changes in global CO2.

101
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,006
The Earth has been breathing like this
for tens of millions of years.

102
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,550
But nobody noticed until 1958...

103
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,435
...when an oceanographer
named Charles David Keeling...

104
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,471
...devised a way
to accurately measure...

105
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,811
...the amount of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.

106
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:22,480
Keeling discovered
the Earth's exquisite respiration.

107
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,489
But he also discovered
something shocking...

108
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,825
...a rapid rise,
unprecedented in human history...

109
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:36,835
...in the overall level of CO2,
one that has continued ever since.

110
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,261
It's a striking departure
from the CO2 levels that prevailed...

111
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,468
...during the rise of agriculture
and civilization.

112
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:56,105
In fact, the Earth has seen nothing like it
for 3 million years.

113
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,023
How can we be so sure?

114
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,191
<i>The evidence is written in water.</i>

115
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:17,126
The Earth keeps a detailed diary
written in the snows of yesteryear.

116
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:21,163
Climate scientists have drilled ice cores
from the depths of glaciers...

117
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,832
...in Greenland and Antarctica.

118
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,836
The ice layers have ancient air
trapped inside them.

119
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,556
We can read the unbroken record
of Earth's atmosphere...

120
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,595
...that extends back
over the last 800,000 years.

121
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,981
In all that time, the amount
of carbon dioxide in the air...

122
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,235
...never rose above
three-hundredths of 1 percent.

123
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,647
That is until the turn
of the 20th century...

124
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,987
...and it's been going up steadily
and rapidly ever since.

125
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:55,414
It's now more than 40 percent higher
than before the Industrial Revolution.

126
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,246
By burning coal, oil and gas...

127
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,195
...our civilization is
exhaling carbon dioxide

128
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:04,006
much faster than the
Earth can absorb it.

129
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,293
So CO2 is building up in the atmosphere.

130
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,426
The planet is heating up.

131
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:14,387
Every warm object radiates a kind of light
we can't see with the naked eye...

132
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,677
...thermal infrared light.

133
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:21,440
We all glow with invisible heat
radiation, even in the dark.

134
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,068
This is what the Earth looks like
in the infrared.

135
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,531
You're seeing the planet's
own body heat.

136
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,281
<i>Incoming light from the
sun hits the surface.</i>

137
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,577
<i>The Earth absorbs much of that energy
which heats the planet up.</i>

138
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,464
<i>And makes the surface glow
in infrared light.</i>

139
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,176
<i>But the carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere absorbs</i>

140
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:50,753
<i>most of that outgoing
heat radiation...</i>

141
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,798
<i>...sending much of it
right back to the surface.</i>

142
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,341
<i>This makes the planet even warmer.</i>

143
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,851
<i>That's all there is to
the greenhouse effect.</i>

144
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,935
<i>It's basic physics,
just bookkeeping of the energy flow.</i>

145
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,316
<i>There's nothing controversial about it.</i>

146
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,649
<i>If we didn't have any carbon dioxide
in our atmosphere...</i>

147
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,065
<i>...the Earth would just be
a great big snowball.</i>

148
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,655
<i>And we wouldn't be here.</i>

149
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,702
So a little greenhouse
effect is a good thing.

150
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:24,620
But a big one could destabilize
the climate and wreck our way of life.

151
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,882
All right,
but how do we know we're the problem?

152
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,294
Maybe the Earth itself
is causing the rise in CO2.

153
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,465
Maybe it has nothing to do
with the coal and oil we burn.

154
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,885
Maybe it's those damned volcanoes.

155
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:44,682
Every few years, Mt. Etna in Sicily
blows its stack.

156
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:50,604
Each big eruption sends millions of tons
of CO2 into the atmosphere.

157
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,238
Now, combine that...

158
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,698
...with the output of all the other
volcanic activity on the planet.

159
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,078
Let's take the largest
scientific estimate...

160
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:05,961
...about 500 million tons of volcanic CO2
entering the atmosphere every year.

161
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,917
Sounds like a lot, right?

162
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,585
But that's not even 2 percent
of the 3O billion tons of CO2...

163
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,471
...that our civilization
is cranking out every year.

164
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,726
And, funny thing, the measured increase
of CO2 in the atmosphere...

165
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,354
...tallies with the known amount
we're dumping there...

166
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,359
...by burning coal, oil and gas.

167
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,396
Volcanic CO2 has a distinct signature.

168
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:36,317
It's slightly heavier than the kind
produced by burning fossil fuels.

169
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,988
We can tell the difference between the two
when we examine them at the atomic level.

170
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,751
It's clear that the increased CO2
in the air is not from volcanoes.

171
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,082
What's more, the observed warming
is as much as predicted...

172
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,044
...from the measured increase
in carbon dioxide.

173
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:56,586
It's a pretty tight case.
Our fingerprints are all over this one.

174
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,257
How much is 30 billion tons
of CO2 per year?

175
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,926
If you compressed it into solid form...

176
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:07,518
...it would occupy about the same the
volume as the White Cliffs of Dover.

177
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,777
And we're adding that much CO2 to the air
every year, relentlessly...

178
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,232
...year after year.

179
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,787
Unlucky for us, the main
waste product of our

180
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,785
civilization is not
just any substance...

181
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,207
...it happens to be the
chief climate-regulating

182
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:25,494
gas of our global thermostat...

183
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,125
...year in, year out.

184
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,338
Too bad CO2 is an invisible gas.

185
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,124
Maybe if we could see it.

186
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,798
<i>If our eyes were sensitive to CO2...</i>

187
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,134
<i>...and perhaps there are such beings
in the cosmos.</i>

188
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,801
<i>If we could see all that carbon dioxide...</i>

189
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,140
<i>...then we would overcome the denial...</i>

190
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,729
<i>...and grasp the magnitude of our impact
on the atmosphere.</i>

191
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:10,042
But the evidence that the world
is getting warmer is all around us.

192
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,330
For starters,
let's just check the thermometers.

193
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,169
Weather stations around the world...

194
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,631
...have been keeping reliable temperature
records since the 1880s.

195
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,922
And NASA has used the data
to compile a map...

196
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,262
...tracking average temperatures
around the world through time.

197
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:32,812
<i>Yellows mean warmer temperatures than the
average for any region in the 1880s.</i>

198
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,568
<i>Orange means hot.</i>

199
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,197
<i>And reds means hotter.</i>

200
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,111
<i>The world is warmer than it was
in the 19th century.</i>

201
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,208
<i>Back then, at the greatest fair
the world had ever seen...</i>

202
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,964
<i>...a forgotten genius demonstrated
the solution to this problem.</i>

203
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,124
<i>Come with me.</i>

204
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,936
<i>TYSON: Once there was a world
that was not too hot and not too cold.</i>

205
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,471
<i>It was just right.</i>

206
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,560
<i>Then there came a time
when the life it sustained...</i>

207
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,902
<i>...began to notice our lovely planet
was changing.</i>

208
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,072
<i>And it's not as if we didn't see it coming.</i>

209
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:34,787
<i>As far back as 1896 the Swedish scientist
Svante Arrhenius calculated...</i>

210
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:40,334
<i>...that doubling the amount of CO2 in the
atmosphere would melt the Arctic ice.</i>

211
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,218
<i>In the 1930's,
the American physicist E.O. Hulbert...</i>

212
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,101
<i>...at the Naval Research Laboratory
confirmed that result.</i>

213
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,513
<i>So far, it was still just theoretical.</i>

214
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,276
<i>But then the English engineer
Guy Callendar...</i>

215
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,563
<i>...assembled the evidence to show
that both the CO2...</i>

216
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,825
<i>...and the average global temperature
were actually increasing.</i>

217
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,284
Even now, man may be unwittingly changing
the world's climate...

218
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,744
...through the waste products
of his civilization.

219
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,127
<i>Due to our release through factories
and automobiles every year...</i>

220
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,789
<i>...of more than 6 billion tons
of carbon dioxide...</i>

221
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,447
...which helps air absorb
heat from the sun,

222
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,962
our atmosphere seems
to be getting warmer.

223
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,800
This is bad?

224
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,716
Well, it's been calculated
a few degrees rise...

225
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,477
...in the Earth's temperature
would melt the polar ice caps.

226
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,437
<i>TYSON".
In 1960, Carl Sagan's PhD thesis...</i>

227
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,574
<i>...included the first calculation
of the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus.</i>

228
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,612
<i>This was part of a career-long interest
in the atmospheres of the planets...</i>

229
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,075
<i>...including our own.</i>

230
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:56,334
<i>In the original Cosmos series in 1980,
Carl Sagan warned:</i>

231
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,621
SAGAN: <i>We are releasing vast quantities
of carbon dioxide...</i>

232
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,131
<i>...increasing the greenhouse effect.</i>

233
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,760
<i>It may not take much to destabilize
the Earth's climate...</i>

234
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:11,095
<i>...to convert this heaven, our only home
in the cosmos, into a kind of hell.</i>

235
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:20,434
Since Carl spoke those words we've
burdened the atmosphere of our world...

236
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,822
...with an additional 400 billion tons
of carbon dioxide.

237
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,329
And if we don't change
our ways, what will

238
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,702
the planet be like in
our children's future?

239
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,871
<i>Based on scientific projections...</i>

240
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,287
<i>...if we just keep on doing business as
usual, our kids are in for a rough ride.</i>

241
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,376
<i>Killer heat waves, record droughts...</i>

242
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,668
<i>...rising sea levels,
mass extinction of species.</i>

243
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:52,056
<i>We inherited a bountiful world made
possible by a relatively stable climate.</i>

244
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:56,515
<i>Agriculture and civilization flourished
for thousands of years.</i>

245
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:03,310
<i>And now our carelessness
and greed put all of that at risk.</i>

246
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,072
Okay, so if we scientists are so good at
making these dire long-term predictions...

247
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,280
...about the climate, how come we're
so lousy about predicting the weather?

248
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:16,243
Besides, this year we had
a colder winter in my town.

249
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,126
For all those scientists know,
we could be in for global cooling.

250
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,753
Here's the difference
between weather and climate.

251
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:28,088
Weather is what the atmosphere does in the
short term, hour to hour, day to day.

252
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,718
Weather is chaotic...

253
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,368
...which means that
even a microscopic

254
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,883
disturbance can lead to
large-scale changes.

255
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,848
That's why those 10-day weather forecasts
are useless.

256
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,354
A butterfly flaps its wings in Bali...

257
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,858
...and six weeks later
your outdoor wedding in Maine is ruined.

258
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:48,066
Climate is the long-term average
of the weather over a number of years.

259
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,950
It's shaped by global forces that alter
the energy balance in the atmosphere...

260
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,578
...such as changes in the sun,
tilt of the Earth's axis...

261
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,535
...the amount of sunlight
the Earth reflects back to space...

262
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,793
...and the concentration of
greenhouse gases in the air.

263
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:07,003
A change in any of them affects the climate
in ways that are broadly predictable.

264
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:13,718
My friend's meandering represents the
short-term fluctuations, that's weather.

265
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,883
It's almost impossible to predict
what will attract his interest next...

266
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,973
...but not hard to know what the range
of his meandering will be...

267
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,889
...because I'm holding him on a leash.

268
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,897
We can't observe climate directly.

269
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,436
All we see is the weather.

270
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,607
But the average weather
over the course of years reveals a pattern.

271
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,119
I represent that long-term trend
which is climate.

272
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,623
Keep your eye on the man, not the dog.

273
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,832
Weather is hard to predict,
like my friend here.

274
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,214
But climate is predictable.

275
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,592
Climate has changed many times
in the long history of the Earth...

276
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,345
...but always in response
to a global force.

277
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,302
The strongest force
driving climate change right now...

278
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,594
...is the increasing CO2
from the burning of fossil fuels...

279
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,138
...which is trapping
more heat from the sun.

280
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,853
All that additional energy
has to go somewhere.

281
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,608
Some of it warms the air.

282
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,769
Most of it ends up in the oceans.

283
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,656
All over the world,
the oceans are getting warmer.

284
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,446
<i>It's most obvious in the Arctic Ocean
and the lands that surround it.</i>

285
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:28,456
<i>Okay, so we're losing the summer sea ice
in a place where hardly anyone ever goes.</i>

286
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,841
<i>What do I care
if there's no ice around the North Pole?</i>

287
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:47,057
<i>Ice is the brightest natural surface on the
Earth, and open ocean water is the darkest.</i>

288
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,853
<i>Ice reflects incoming
sunlight back to space.</i>

289
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,147
<i>Water absorbs sunlight and gets warmer...</i>

290
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,111
<i>...which melts even more ice...</i>

291
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:01,575
<i>...which exposes still more ocean surface
to absorb even more sunlight.</i>

292
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,581
<i>This is what we call
a positive feedback loop.</i>

293
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,961
<i>It's one of many natural mechanisms
that magnify any warming...</i>

294
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,542
<i>...caused by CO2 alone.</i>

295
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,458
We're at Drew Point, Alaska...

296
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,721
...on the edge of the Arctic Ocean.

297
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,606
<i>TYSON". When I was born
the shoreline was a mile farther out...</i>

298
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,818
<i>...and it was breaking off at the rate
of about 20 feet per year.</i>

299
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:42,863
<i>Now it's being</i> eaten <i>away
at about 50 feet per year.</i>

300
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,283
<i>The Arctic Ocean is warming
and at an increasing rate.</i>

301
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,578
<i>So it's ice-free during more of the year.</i>

302
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,874
<i>That leaves the shore here more exposed
to erosion from storms...</i>

303
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,422
<i>...which are also getting more powerful,
another effect of climate change.</i>

304
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:05,310
The northern reaches of Alaska,
Siberia and Canada are mostly permafrost...

305
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,846
<i>...ground that has been frozen
year-round for millennia.</i>

306
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,232
<i>It contains lots of organic matter.</i>

307
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,442
<i>Old leaves and roots from plants
that grew thousands of years ago.</i>

308
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:20,325
<i>Because the Arctic regions are warming
faster than anywhere else on Earth...</i>

309
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,450
<i>...the permafrost is thawing.</i>

310
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,454
<i>And its contents are rotting.</i>

311
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,116
<i>Just like when you unplug
the freezer.</i>

312
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:36,208
<i>The thawing permafrost
is releasing carbon dioxide and methane...</i>

313
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,798
<i>...an even more potent greenhouse gas
into the atmosphere.</i>

314
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,429
<i>This is making things even warmer...</i>

315
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,808
<i>...another example
of a positive feedback mechanism.</i>

316
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,066
<i>The world's permafrost
stores enough carbon to</i>

317
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:52,190
<i>more than double the
CO2 in the atmosphere.</i>

318
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,777
At the rate we're going,
global warming could

319
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:57,229
release most of it by
the end of the century.

320
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,398
We might be tipping the climate
past a point of no return...

321
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,862
...into an unpredictable slide.

322
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,031
Okay, the air, the water
and the land are all getting warmer.

323
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,167
So global warming is really happening.

324
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,544
But maybe it's not our fault.

325
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,500
Maybe it's just nature.

326

00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,730
It was the lfugao people
of the Philippines...

487
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:47,021
...working with not much
more than their hands.

488
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:51,567
About 10,000 years ago
our ancestors all over the world...

489
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:55,237
...took advantage of another form
of climate change...

490
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:59,453
...the gentler climate of the intermission
in the Ice Age.

491
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,086
They invented agriculture.

492
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,794
They gave up the ceaseless wandering,
hunting and gathering...

493
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,426
...that had been their way of life
for a million years or so...

494
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:14,215
...to settle down and produce food.

495
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:19,854
They found a way to harvest 'IO
to 100 times more solar energy...

496
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,517
...than the environment naturally provided
for their ancestors.

497
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:28,028
People all over the world
made the difficult transition...

498
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,440
...from nomadic cultures
to agricultural ones...

499
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,701
...that used solar energy more efficiently.

500
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,784
It gave rise to civilization.

501
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,917
We stand on the shoulders of those
who did the hard work...

502
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:45,454
...that such a fundamental
transformation required.

503
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,794
Now, it's our turn.

504
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:57,011
<i>Once there was a world.</i>

505
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,680
<i>If life ever existed on Venus...</i>

506
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:09,229
<i>...it would have had no chance to avert
the hellish destiny of this world.</i>

507
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,407
<i>This runaway greenhouse effect
was unstoppable.</i>

508
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:27,622
Once there was a world...

509
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,041
...OL.II"S.

510
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,835
And that world is now.

511
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,755
There are no scientific
or technological obstacles...

512
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:41,722
...to protecting our world
and the precious life that it supports.

513
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:46,391
It all depends on what we truly value...

514
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:50,819
...and if we can summon
the will to act.

515
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,406
<i>KENNEDY".
"But why," some say, "the moon?</i>

516
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,242
<i>Why choose this as our goal?"</i>

517
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,327
<i>And they may well ask:</i>

518
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,743
<i>"Why climb the highest mountain?"</i>

519
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,412
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

520
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,377
<i>We choose to go to the moon...</i>

521
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,925
<i>We choose to go to the moon in this decade
and do the other things...</i>

522
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:07,688
<i>...not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.</i>
