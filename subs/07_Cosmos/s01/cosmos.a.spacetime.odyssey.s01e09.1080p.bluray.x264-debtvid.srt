00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,226
<i>TYSON".
Yes, this is home.</i>

2
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,436
<i>This is Earth.</i>

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,523
<i>Having trouble
finding a familiar continent?</i>

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,404
<i>The past is another planet.</i>

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,691
<i>Actually, many.</i>

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:28,738
I'm standing on the great expanse of time
that has elapsed since the big bang.

7
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:33,284
In order to think about it,
we've compressed it all into a single year.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,873
It's the early morning of December 23rd...

9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:41,008
...on this cosmic calendar of ours,
or about 350 million years ago...

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,716
...when our world
was a mere four billion years old.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,300
Earth looks so different...

12
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,215
...you might not even know the place.

13
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,850
The stars wouldn't help you.

14
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,308
Even the constellations
would have been different back then.

15
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,111
The dinosaurs were still
more than 100 million years in the future.

16
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:07,447
There were no birds, no flowers.

17
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,907
And the air was different too.

18
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,619
The atmosphere had more oxygen than at
any other time in Earth's history...

19
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,662
...before or since.

20
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,333
This allowed insects
to grow much larger than they do today.

21
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,297
[RUSTLING]

22
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,218
How? Insects don't have lungs.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,849
Life-giving oxygen
is taken in through openings...

24
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,681
...in the outside of their bodies...

25
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,517
...and transported
through a network of tubes.

26
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,522
If an insect were too large...

27
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,730
...the outer reaches of these tubes
would absorb all the oxygen...

28
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,361
...before it could ever get
to its internal organs.

29
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,940
But during the Carboniferous period...

30
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,407
...the atmosphere
had almost twice the oxygen as today.

31
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,496
Insects could then grow much bigger and
still get enough oxygen in their bodies.

32
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,877
That's why the dragonflies here
are as big as eagles...

33
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:02,540
...and the millipedes,
the size of alligators.

34
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,879
So why was there so much oxygen
backthen?

35
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:09,013
It was produced by a new kind of life.

36
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:47,520
<i>TYSON". What kind of life could've changed
the Earth's atmosphere so dramatically?</i>

37
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,119
Plants that could reach for the sky:

38
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,158
Trees.

39
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,247
In their competition for sunlight,
trees evolved a way to defy gravity.

40
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,539
Before trees, the tallest vegetation
was only about waist-high.

41
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,255
And then something wonderful happened.

42
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,850
<i>A plant molecule evolved
that was both strong and flexible...</i>

43
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,352
<i>...a material that could support
a lot of weight...</i>

44
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,013
<i>...yet bend in the wind without breaking.</i>

45
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,729
Lignin made trees possible.

46
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,859
Now life could build upward.

47
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,986
And this opened a whole new territory...

48
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:34,525
...a three-dimensional matrix
for communities far above the ground.

49
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,036
Earth became the planet of the trees.

50
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,414
But lignin had a downside.

51
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,370
It was hard to swallow.

52
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,336
When nature's demolition crew,
the fungi and bacteria...

53
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,839
...tried to eat anything
with lignin in it...

54
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,420
...they got a really bad case
of indigestion.

55
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,759
And termites wouldn't evolve
for at least another 100 million years.

56
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,800
What to do with all those dead trees?

57
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,309
It took the fungi and bacteria
millions of years...

58
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,189
...to evolve the biochemical means
to consume them.

59
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:09,727
Meanwhile, the trees just kept
springing up, dying, falling over...

60
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,988
...and getting buried by the mud
that built up over eons.

61
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,241
Eventually, there were hundreds
of billions of trees...

62
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,906
...entombed in the Earth,
buried forests all over the Earth.

63
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,246
What possible harm could come from that?

64
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,764
This cliff in Nova Scotia
is another kind of calendar.

65
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,599
It tells the story of that other world
that once flourished right here.

66
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,733
And this is the death mask
of that 300-million-year-old tree.

67
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:54,442
It was cast by minerals that replaced
the original wood, cell by cell.

68
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,606
In other words, a fossil.

69
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,778
The tree surrendered its organic molecules
to the environment long ago...

70
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,571
...its carbon and water.

71
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,580
Only its shape remains.

72
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,243
When this tree was alive,
it took in carbon dioxide and water...

73
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,290
...and used sunlight to turn them
into energy-rich organic matter.

74
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,800
The tree gave off oxygen
as a waste product.

75
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,633
That's what trees and
other plants still do.

76
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:23,057
<i>When plants die, they decay.</i>

77
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,639
<i>And this reverses the transaction.</i>

78
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,397
<i>Their organic matter combines with oxygen
and decomposes...</i>

79
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,776
...putting carbon dioxide
back into the air.

80
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,561
This balances the books...

81
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,776
...for the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere.

82
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,364
<i>But if the trees are buried
before they can decay, two things happen.</i>

83
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,496
<i>They take the carbon
and the stored solar energy with them...</i>

84
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,247
<i>...and leave the oxygen behind...</i>

85
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,204
<i>...to build up in the atmosphere.</i>

86
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,336
<i>That's what happened
around 300 million years ago.</i>

87
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,962
<i>There was an oxygen surplus.</i>

88
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,003
<i>That's how the bugs got so big.</i>

89
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,215
<i>And what became of all that buried carbon?</i>

90
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,007
<i>It lay there for eons
before dealing life on Earth...</i>

91
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:08,763
<i>...its most devastating blow of all time.</i>

92
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,525
<i>There are places on this planet
where you can walk through time...</i>

93
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,687
<i>...and read the history
written in the rocks.</i>

94
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,527
<i>This beach in Nova Scotia is one of them.</i>

95
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,532
<i>Every la yer is</i> a <i>Page-</i>

96
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,944
<i>Each one tells the story of a flood...</i>

97
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,239
<i>...one after another,
over millions of years.</i>

98
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,534
<i>The layer cake of flood deposits
was slowly buried...</i>

99
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,579
<i>...and turned into rock
by heat and pressure.</i>

100
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,873
<i>The same forces that built mountains...</i>

101
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,545
<i>...then tilted and uplifted them,
along with the entombed fossil forest.</i>

102
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,760
<i>The newer layers were always
deposited on top of the older ones.</i>

103
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,051
<i>All the pages are in the correct order...</i>

104
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,311
<i>...bearing witness to what happened here...</i>

105
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
<i>...over millions of years.</i>

106
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,317
Back that way lies the more distant past.

107
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,227
And with every step I take...

108
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,364
...I move about 1000 years
closer to the present...

109
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,901
...and away from the world
of 300 million years ago.

110
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:08,163
Fifty million years later lies that way.

111
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,629
This was the beginning of the end
of the Permian world...

112
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,089
...an event of unequalled carnage.

113
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,926
<i>The Permian is the darkest corridor
in this memorial...</i>

114
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,765
<i>...to the broken branches on the Tree
of Life: the Halls of Extinction.</i>

115
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,898
Death has never come so close
to reigning supreme on this world...

116
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,775
...in the quarter billion years since.

117
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:43,282
The eruptions, in what is now Siberia,
lasted for hundreds of thousands of years.

118
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,287
The lava flooded and buried
more than a million square miles.

119
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:53,918
This event dwarfs any volcanic eruption
in historical times.

120
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:18,437
Huge quantities of carbon dioxide
came pouring out of the volcanic fissures.

121
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,399
This greenhouse gas warmed the climate.

122
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,691
And this is where the long-buried forests
of the earlier Carboniferous period...

123
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,951
...reenter the story.

124
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,487
During the intervening 5O million years...

125
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,123
...those trees had turned
into immense deposits of coal.

126
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,786
And as it happened, one of the world's
largest accumulations of coal...

127
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,375
<i>...was buried right there in Siberia.</i>

128
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,711
<i>The heat from the lava baked the coal...</i>

129
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,424
<i>...driving methane and sulfur-rich gases
out of the ground.</i>

130
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,930
They were laden with toxic
and radioactive ash particles.

131
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,186
Coal smoke.

132
00:09:55,303 --> 00:10:00,810
This witch's brew polluted the atmosphere
and radically destabilized Earth's climate.

133
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:06,072
A sulfuric acid haze blocked incoming
sunlight and darkened the planet.

134
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,201
Global temperatures plummeted
to subfreezing.

135
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:17,580
During lulls in the eruption,
the acid haze fell back to the surface.

136
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,996
But the carbon dioxide remained
and built up in the atmosphere...

137
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,005
...to cause global warming.

138
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,340
Years of frigid cold alternating
with millennia of stifling heat...

139
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,301
...battered a dwindling population
of plants and animals.

140
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:35,845
They had no chance to adapt
to the drastic swings in climate.

141
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,437
As the global warming continued...

142
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,273
...the surface and the bottom waters
slowly mixed...

143
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,156
...raising the temperature
of the once-frigid depths of the sea floor.

144
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:53,571
Methane-rich ices that had been frozen
in the sediments began to melt.

145
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,378
Newly liberated methane gas made its way
to the surface, and into the atmosphere.

146
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,800
Methane traps heat far more efficiently
than carbon dioxide...

147
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,882
...so the climate got even hotter.

148
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:14,015
And the methane also destroyed
the ozone layer in the stratosphere.

149
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,853
The natural sunscreen
that protects life

150
00:11:16,865 --> 00:11:19,556
from deadly ultraviolet
rays was eaten away.

151
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,110
The circulatory system
of the world ocean shut down.

152
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,401
<i>These stagnant waters
became oxygen-starved...</i>

153
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,941
<i>...killing almost all the fish in the sea.</i>

154
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,361
<i>But one kind of life flourished
in this brutal environment.</i>

155
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,952
<i>Bacteria that produced
deadly hydrogen sulfide gas...</i>

156
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,287
...as a waste product.

157
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,207
That was the last straw.

158
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:49,047
The poison gas killed almost all the
remaining plants and animals on the land.

159
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,133
This was the Great Dying...

160
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:56,266
...the closest life on Earth
has ever come to annihilation.

161
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,849
Nine in ten of all species perished.

162
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,639
It took a long time for
life to bounce back.

163
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,025
For a few million years,
Earth could have been called...

164
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,982
...the Planet of the Dead.

165
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:13,574
We are descended from one of the few
species that managed to squeak by.

166
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,744
You are human and alive
at this very moment...

167
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,706
...because they managed to endure,
conveying their DNA...

168
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:28,089
...through one of the most treacherous
periods in the history of life.

169

174

It's the world's largest fossil reef.

175

All this was once a great inland sea.

176
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,126
<i>The reef flourished and grew
for millions of years...</i>

177
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,714
<i>...and was home to multitudes
of sponges, green algae...</i>

178
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,004
<i>...and animals too small to see.</i>

179

<i>When these creatures died...</i>

180

Eventually, the basin silted in
and the reef died.

184
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:34,822
This marine ghost town
was then buried a mile beneath the surface.

185
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:39,202
Later, tectonic forces lifted the
skeletal reef high above sea level...

186

over eons by wind and rain.

192

There was no such thing
as the Atlantic Ocean.

193
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,272
Those thin blue fingers at the center,
they were lakes.

194
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,152
They were the first outward signs...

195

...that the supercontinent
was splitting apart...

196
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,113
...and that life on Earth
was due for another big shake-up.

197
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,620
A million years later,
the lakes became a long bay...

198
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,623
...which would grow into
the Atlantic Ocean.

199

221

<i>...in the stacks of his university library.</i>

227
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:07,179

same species of a now-extinct fern...</i>

228

<i>...were reported to be found
on both sides of the Atlantic.</i>

230

<i>...were the discoveries of fossils
of the same dinosaurs on both continents.</i>

231
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,237
<i>In the early 20th century...</i>

232
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,319
<i>...geologists explained
how life crossed the oceans...</i>

233
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:27,033
<i>...by imagining that land bridges
had once existed between them.</i>

234
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,039
<i>It was thought that these bridges
gradually disintegrated...</i>

235
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,543
<i>...and vanished
beneath the waves long ago.</i>

236
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,500
<i>But there was one piece of evidence
that convinced Wegener...</i>

237
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,632
<i>...that the prevailing scientific view
must be wrong:</i>

238

<i>the Earth itself.</i>

239
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,429
<i>Why would a mountain range
cross the oceanic divide...</i>

240
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,761
<i>...to continue on another continent?</i>

241
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,268
<i>And why would you find
the same unique pattern...</i>

242
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,226
<i>...in the layers of rocks
in both Brazil and South Africa?</i>

243
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,768
<i>And another thing: Under what circumstances
could tropical plants have flourished...</i>

244
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,189
<i>...in the frozen wastes of the Arctic?</i>

245
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,902
<i>Wegener concluded that there was only
one logical solution to this puzzle:</i>

246
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,618
<i>There had once been a single
supercontinent on Earth.</i>

247
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,000
<i>He named it Pangaea.</i>

248

of the scientific world, right?

Not exactly.

Wegener's hypothesis of continental drift.

They preferred
their imaginary natural land bridges...

How, they asked, could a continent plow
through the solid rock of the ocean floor?

to eat what's pouring out of that vent...</i>

330
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,771
<i>...a noxious compound
called hydrogen sulfide.</i>

331
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,191
That thick black smoke
provides the chemical energy...

332
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,325
...that makes life possible here.

333
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,579
<i>Tiny crustaceans eat the bacteria...</i>

334
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,833
<i>...and the larger animals
eat the crustaceans.</i>

335
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,080
<i>One day, on some future Earth...</i>

336
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,047
...these mountains could very well end up
above the water.

337
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,588
Tectonic forces continue
to shape our planet.

338
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,850
The future is also another planet.

339
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,521
It was a volcano like this one
that created the Hawaiian islands...

340
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,182
...millions of years ago.

341
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,875
<i>TYSON". We live on the crust
of a seething cauldron.</i>

342
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,379
At the center of our planet,
there's an iron core.

343
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,886
It's nested inside of a larger,
liquid iron shell.

344
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,720
<i>Wrapped over this
is the part called the mantle.</i>

345
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,056
<i>It's rocky, but hot and viscous.</i>

346
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:34,895
Like a pot of soup cooking on a stove,
the mantle is churning.

347
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,309
What keeps it moving?

348
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,230
Two things: the heat leftover
from Earth's formation...

349
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,991
...and the decay of radioactive elements
in the core.

350
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,572
And this outer layer, the crust...

351
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,409
...where you and me
and everyone we know lives...

352
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,075
...it's only as thick as
the skin on an apple.

353
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:57,042
The mantle drags
the solid overlying crust along with it.

354
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,754
<i>The crust resists
because it's cool and rigid.</i>

355
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,886
<i>From time to time,
it reaches the breaking point.</i>

356
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:08,220
<i>When that happens, the Earth quakes.</i>

357
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,682
<i>It's not because somebody misbehaved
and is being punished.</i>

358
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:16,099
<i>It's due to random forces
that are governed by the laws of nature.</i>

359
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,360
Our sense of the stability
of the Earth is an illusion...

360
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,612
...due to the shortness of our lives.

361
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,692
<i>If we could watch our planet
on its own timescale...</i>

362
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:30,455
<i>...in which big changes
take millions of years to play out...</i>

363
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:35,459
<i>...we would see it
as the dynamic organism it really is.</i>

364
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,668
This is the world
of the late Triassic Period...

365
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,758
...about 200 million years ago.

366
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,885
<i>That little guy?</i>

367
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,301
It's one of our distant ancestors.

368
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,311
He lived in Newark, New Jersey.

369
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,442
<i>Wherever you walk on Earth...</i>

370
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,650
<i>...lost worlds lie buried
beneath your feet.</i>

371
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,906
<i>Fifty or</i> a <i>hundred million years</i> ago...

372
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:11,492
<i>...even the most seemingly ordinary places
have been the scene of epic change.</i>

373
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:16,830
<i>These Palisades are a monument to the
breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea.</i>

374
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,485
<i>The sequence of volcanic
eruptions that made these</i>

375
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,500
<i>cliffs also led to the
next mass extinction.</i>

376
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,965
<i>The one that ended the Triassic world.</i>

377
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,176
But a catastrophic extinction event
for one species...

378
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,262
...is a golden opportunity for another.

379
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:40,520
<i>The Triassic extinctions offered one group
that had been around for a while...</i>

380
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,606
<i>...the chance to take center stage.</i>

381
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:52,028
<i>The dinosaurs had a good long run
for 170 million years.</i>

382
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,865
<i>Back then, India was an island.</i>

383
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,535
<i>It crept northward at the pace
of a few inches per year...</i>

384
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,331
<i>...on its slow but inexorable rendezvous
with Asia.</i>

385
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:08,754
<i>Then, once again, the molten rock
beneath Earth's surface burst forth...</i>

386
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,139
<i>...and ﬂooded a huge area of western India.</i>

387
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:23,567
The knockout punch
literally came out of the blue.

388
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,687
Few animals larger
than a hundred pounds...

389
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,070
...survived the catastrophes
of the late Cretaceous.

390
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,983
The dust cloud brought night and cold
to the surface for months.

391
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,369
The dinosaurs froze and starved to death.

392
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,827
But there were small creatures
who took shelter in the Earth.

393
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,707
<i>And when they emerged...</i>

394
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,871
...they found that the monsters who had
hunted and terrorized them were gone.

395
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,712
The Earth was becoming
the Planet of the Mammals.

396
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,049
<i>And the Earth continued
its ceaseless changing.</i>

397
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,808
This was once a desert
where nothing could grow.

398
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,561
It was a million square miles
of sand and salt...

399
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,974
...far more hostile
than any environment on Earth today.

400
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,394
Daytime temperatures
were hot enough to bake bread.

401
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:52,948
And it was more than a mile below sea
level, so the atmospheric pressure...

402
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,280
...was about 50 percent higher
than what we're used to.

403
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,243
It would be hard to think of a more
unpromising environment on this planet.

404
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:05,332
Yet this was the basin of the Mediterranean
five and a half million years ago...

405
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,792
...before it became a sea.

406
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,504
The Earth never stops moving for long.

407
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,379
<i>The natural dam at the western end
of the deep basin gave way...</i>

408
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,513
<i>...probably due to earthquakes.</i>

409
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,176
<i>And the deluge began.</i>

410
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:26,061
The torrential waters rushed in at a rate
40,000 times greater than Niagara Falls...

411
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:32,731
...turning a vast desert into the
Mediterranean Sea in less than a year.

412
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,948
There were as yet no humans
to witness this enormous flood...

413
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,034
...nor to admire the beauty it created.

414
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,164
Meanwhile, half a world away...

415
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:47,123
<i>...a broad channel
separated North and South America...</i>

416
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:51,757
<i>...allowing ocean currents to ﬂow
from the Atlantic into the Pacific Ocean.</i>

417
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,510
<i>Tectonic forces gradually brought
these two continents together...</i>

418
00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:00,015
<i>...closing the channel
and creating the Isthmus of Panama.</i>

419
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,473
This reorganized the worldwide pattern
of ocean currents...

420
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,058
...which, in turn, affected
the global climate.

421
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:15,361
<i>In Africa, the lush green forest canopy
gave way to a sparser landscape.</i>

422
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:20,574
<i>Some species that were highly specialized
for life in the trees became extinct.</i>

423
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,990
<i>But the generalists, the ones
that could find a way to make a living...</i>

424
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,536
<i>...no matter what life threw at them,
endured and evolved.</i>

425
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,421
<i>Our ancestors had once burrowed deep
in the ground...</i>

426
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,883
<i>...to avoid predators who
stalked the surface.</i>

427
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,595
But when the dinosaurs perished,
they emerged into the daylight...

428
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:45,557
...and over the eons, made new lives
in the branches of the trees.

429
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,599
<i>They developed opposable thumbs and toes
for swinging from branch to branch...</i>

430
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:53,941
<i>...across the broad canopy of treetops,
where all their needs were fulfilled.</i>

431
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,732
They could also walk upright,
but only for short distances.

432
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:01,448
<i>With so many trees around,
they didn't have to go very far.</i>

433
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,035
<i>But then it got colder,
and the trees thinned out.</i>

434
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,245
<i>Broad grasslands sprang up...</i>

435
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,877
<i>...and our ancestors were forced
to traverse them in search of food.</i>

436
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,961
<i>You needed a totally different skill set
to make it on the savanna.</i>

437
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,967
In the old days, you could sit perched
on your tree branch...

438
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,470
...and watch the big cats
from a safe distance.

439
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:24,805
<i>Now you were playing
on the same dangerous field.</i>

440
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,980
<i>The survivors were those
who evolved the ability...</i>

441
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:35,065
<i>...to walk great distances on their
hind legs and to run when necessary.</i>

442
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,363
This changed the way they looked
at the world.

443
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,696
Hands and arms
were no longer tied up with walking.

444
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,954
They were free to gather food
and pick up sticks and bones.

445
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:50,289
These could be used as weapons and tools.
Think of it.

446
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,705
<i>A change in the topography
of</i> a <i>small piece of</i> land...

447
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,340
<i>...half a world away
reroutes ocean currents.</i>

448
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,877
<i>Africa grows colder and drier.</i>

449
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,671
<i>Most of the trees
can't withstand the new climate.</i>

450
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:06,263
<i>The primates who lived in them
have to seek other homes...</i>

451
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:10,680
...and before you know it,
they're using tools to remake the planet.

452
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,441
The Earth has shaped the course
of human destiny...

453
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,446
...but so has the invisible pull
of distant worlds.

454
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,267
TYSON:
The planets have influenced our lives...

455
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,224
...but not in the way you think.

456
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,184
The gravitational pull of Venus...

457
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,686
<i>...small but close...</i>

458
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,319
<i>...and that of Jupiter,
distant but massive...</i>

459
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:04,408
<i>...tilted the Earth's
axis this way and that...</i>

460
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,951
<i>...and ever so slightly
tweaked the shape of its orbit.</i>

461
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,900
This periodically altered
the amount of sunlight

462
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,250
falling on the edge of
the northern ice cap.

463
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,088
Sometimes
it made the summers there colder...

464
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,505
...and the glaciers advanced southward
from one year to the next...

465
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,767
<i>...grinding and scraping,
and crushing everything in their path.</i>

466
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,014
That's what we call an Ice Age.

467
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,933
At other times,
changes in Earth's axis and orbit...

468
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,942
...made the Arctic summers warmer.

469
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,857
And the melting glaciers began to retreat.

470
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,451
Imagine how resourceful
our ancestors had to be...

471
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,409
...in order to survive
these radical changes in climate.

472
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,244
<i>With each glacial period...</i>

473
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,626
<i>...the ice sheets grow
at the expense of the oceans.</i>

474
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,629
<i>The world sea level falls
by more than 400 feet...</i>

475
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:04,464
<i>...uncovering wide areas of land
along the edges of the continents.</i>

476
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:09,507
<i>Fifteen to 25,000 years ago,
there was a period when the ice receded...</i>

477
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,096
<i>...exposing a temporary land bridge.</i>

478
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:16,059
<i>The gateway to the other half
of the planet swings open.</i>

479
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:20,897
<i>Bands of wanderers crossed the land bridge
to North America and parts south.</i>

480
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:27,658
About 10,000 years ago, the manic swings of
the climate and sea levels came to a stop.

481
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,411
A new and gentler climate age began.

482
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,494
It's the one we live in now.

483
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:38,502
When the great ice sheets melted,
the sea rose to its present height...

484
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,997
<i>...and the rivers carried silt
from the highlands...</i>

485
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,542
<i>...to build great delta plains
where they met the sea.</i>

486
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:49,464
<i>On those fertile plains,
we learned a new way of life.</i>

487
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,679
<i>How to grow things,
to feed ourselves and more.</i>

488
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:59,019
<i>For most of us, this meant an end
to a million years of wandering.</i>

489
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:04,524
The way the planets tug at each other,
the way the skin of the Earth moves...

490
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:09,533
...the way those motions affect climate and
the evolution of life and intelligence...

491
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:14,367
<i>...they all combined to give us the means
to turn the mud of those river deltas...</i>

492
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,624
<i>...into the first civilizations.</i>

493
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,380
<i>There's nothing like an
interglacial period, one</i>

494
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:24,458
<i>of those balmy intermissions
in an ice age.</i>

495
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,335
<i>And the great news
is that this one is due to last...</i>

496
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,347
<i>...for another 50,000 years.</i>

497
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,392
<i>What a break for our kind.</i>

498
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,804
<i>Just one problem.</i>

499
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,224
<i>We can't seem to stop
burning up all those buried trees...</i>

500
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,190
<i>...from way back in the Carboniferous Age,
in the form of coal...</i>

501
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:51,359
<i>...and the remains of ancient plankton,
in the form of oil and gas.</i>

502
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,038
<i>If we could, we'd be
home free, climate-wise.</i>

503
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:59,621
<i>Instead, we are dumping carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere...</i>

504
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,274
<i>...at a rate the Earth
hasn't seen since the</i>

505
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:04,789
<i>great climate
catastrophes of the past.</i>

506
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,423
<i>The ones that led to mass extinctions.</i>

507
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,428
<i>We just can't seem to break
our addiction to the kinds of fuel...</i>

508
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,090
<i>...that'll bring back a climate
last seen by the dinosaurs.</i>

509
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,355
<i>A climate that will drown
our coastal cities</i>

510
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:19,477
<i>and wreak havoc on
the environment...</i>

511
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:23,140
<i>...and our ability to feed ourselves.</i>

512
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:29,772
<i>All the while, the glorious sun pours
immaculate, free energy down upon us...</i>

513
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,157
<i>...more than we will ever</i> need.

514
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,034
<i>Why can't we summon
the ingenuity and courage...</i>

515
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,163
<i>...of the generations that came before us?</i>

516
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,621
<i>The dinosaurs never saw
that asteroid coming.</i>

517
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,536
<i>What's our excuse?</i>

518
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:57,165
There's a corridor in
the Halls of Extinction

519
00:36:57,177 --> 00:37:00,641
that is, right now,
empty and unmarked.

520
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:04,773
The autobiography of the Earth
is still being written.

521
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:09,903
There's a chance
that the end of our story lies in there.

522
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,659
<i>TYSON".
Congratulations.</i>

523
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,208
<i>You're alive.</i>

524
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:29,173
<i>There's an unbroken thread that stretches
across more than three billion years...</i>

525
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:34,211
<i>...that connects us to the first life
that ever touched this world.</i>

526
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,850
<i>Think of how tough,
resourceful and lucky all</i>

527
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:40,513
<i>of our countless ancestors
must have been...</i>

528
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:46,353
<i>...to survive long enough to pass on
the message of life to the next...</i>

529
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:51,774
<i>...and the next and the next generation...</i>

530
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,282
<i>...hundreds of millions of times...</i>

531
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,954
<i>...before it came to us.</i>

532
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:09,872
<i>There were so many rivers to cross,
so many hazards along the way.</i>

533
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:13,838
<i>Predators, starvation,
disease, miscalculation...</i>

534
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,800
<i>...long winters, drought,
flood and violence.</i>

535
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,717
<i>Not to mention the occasional upheavals
that erupted from within our planet...</i>

536
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,887
<i>...and the apocalyptic bolts
that come from the blue.</i>

537
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,899
<i>No matter where we hail from
or who our parents were...</i>

538
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:33,654
<i>...we are descended from the hearty
survivors of unimaginable catastrophes.</i>

539
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:39,194
<i>Each of us is a runner in the longest and
most dangerous relay race there ever was...</i>

540
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,080
<i>...and at this moment,
we hold the baton in our hands.</i>

541
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,417
<i>The past is another planet.</i>

542
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,467
And so is the future.

543
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,504
Some 250 million years from now...

544
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,423
...many geologists think
that the lands of the Earth...

545
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,263
...will be united once again.

546
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:22,069
<i>All this beauty will have vanished
and the Earth of our moment in time...</i>

547
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,830
<i>...will take its place
among the lost worlds.</i>

548
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,869
<i>The great internal engine of plate
tectonics is indifferent to life...</i>

549
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,164
<i>...as are the small changes
in the Earth's orbit and tilt...</i>

550
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,676
<i>...and the occasional collisions
with little worlds on rogue orbits.</i>

551
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,884
<i>These processes have no notion
of what has been going on...</i>

552
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,845
<i>...over billions of years
on our planet's surface.</i>

553
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,511
<i>They do not care.</i>

554
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,430
<i>Each of us is a tiny being...</i>

555
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,521
<i>...riding on the outermost skin
of one of the smaller planets...</i>

556
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:57,404
<i>...for a few dozen trips
around the local star.</i>

557
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,075
<i>The things that live the
longest on Earth...</i>

558
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,908
<i>...endure for only about a millionth
of the age of our planet.</i>

559
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:10,667
<i>So, of course, the individual organisms
see nothing of the overall pattern.</i>

560
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,704
<i>Of changing continents...</i>

561
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,543
<i>...climate...</i>

562
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,712
. . . <i>evolution.</i>

563
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,253
<i>That we understand
even a little of our origins...</i>

564
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,640
<i>...is one of the great triumphs
of human insight and courage.</i>

565
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,302
<i>Who we are and why we are here
can only be glimpsed...</i>

566
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,143
<i>...by piecing together something
of the full picture...</i>

567
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,650
<i>...which must encompass eons of time...</i>

568
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,229
<i>...millions of species...</i>

569
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,197
<i>...and a multitude of worlds.</i>

570
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,250
In this perspective, it's not surprising
that we're a mystery to ourselves...

571
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,131
...and that despite our
manifest pretension...

572
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,214
...we are far from being masters
of our own little house.

573
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:12,938
This new corridor has no name above the
entrance to designate its epoch...

574
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,713
...and we don't yet know
which failed species

575
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:18,353
will be memorialized
within its walls.

576
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:25,568
What happens here, in countless ways, both
large and small, is being written by us.

577
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,827
Right now.
