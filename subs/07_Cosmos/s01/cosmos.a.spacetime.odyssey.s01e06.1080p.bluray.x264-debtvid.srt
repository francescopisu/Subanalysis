TYSON:
Atoms let matter do funny things.

19
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,718
To understand water, you need to know
what its atoms are doing.

20
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,385
Every molecule of water is composed
of two tiny hydrogen atoms...

21
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,895
...attached to a larger oxygen atom.

22
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,931
That's why we call it H20.

23
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,934
If it's not too hot or too cold...

24
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,105
<i>...the molecules can slide
and tumble past each other.</i>

25
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,318
<i>There's stickiness between the molecules...</i>

26
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,405
<i>...but not enough to lock them
into a rigid solid.</i>

27
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,116
That's what makes something a liquid.

28
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,871
<i>The sun warms the water.</i>

29
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,455
<i>And with more energy,
the molecules move faster.</i>

30

<i>That's all that temperature is.</i>

31
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,462
<i>Those molecules are moving fast enough...</i>

32

<i>...to break the weak bonds
that hold them to their neighbors.</i>

33

<i>More than 99.9 percent
of the matter of any atom...</i>

382
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,994
<i>...is concentrated in its nucleus.</i>

383
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,247
<i>The nucleus is surrounded
by an electron cloud...</i>

384
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:21,169
<i>...which produces an invisible field of
force and acts like a shock absorber.</i>

385
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:25,761
<i>The configuration of the electron cloud
determines the nature of an element.</i>

386

<i>In the ordinary course of things here
on Earth, the nuclei never touch.</i>

387
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,396
<i>We have a sensation of touching...</i>

388
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,216
<i>...but that's really
just our invisible force</i>

389
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:37,902
<i>fields overlapping and
repelling each other.</i>

390
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:57,751
The nucleus is very small
compared to the rest of the atom.

391
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,752
If an atom were the size
of this cathedral, its nucleus...

392
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,923
...would be the size of that mote of dust.

393
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,686
An atom is mostly empty space.

394
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,723
To understand the nature of matter...

395
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,641
...we have to go deeper still...

396
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:21,563
...to a place 100,000 times smaller
than the atom:

397
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,901
its nucleus.

398
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:30,158
<i>The simplest and most plentiful atom
in the cosmos is hydrogen.</i>

399
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,789
<i>Its nucleus is a single proton...</i>

400
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,827
<i>...which makes hydrogen
element number one.</i>

<i>What happens when you have
a nucleus with two protons?</i>

00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,592
<i>Protons repel each other.</i>

405
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,849
<i>In order to hold them together
in a nucleus...</i>

406
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,432
<i>...you need other particles
called neutrons.</i>

407
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,315
<i>Their job is to keep the proton
from getting out of line.</i>

408
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:02,354
<i>They overwhelm the protons
with their strong attractive nuclear force.</i>

409
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,523
<i>A nucleus with two protons
is element number two...</i>

410
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,817
<i>“otherwise known as helium.</i>

411
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,487
<i>A nucleus with six protons

412
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,908
<i>...which is carbon,

413
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,295
<i>The nucleus of a gold atom has 79 protons.</i>

414
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:23,208
<i>They attract 79 electrons
in clouds around it.</i>

415
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:28,300
<i>The way light interacts with those
electrons is what makes gold glitter.</i>

416
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,558
Every additional proton
in the nucleus requires

417
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,386
enough neutrons to
bind them together.

418
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,677
Up to a point.

419
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,686
There's an upper limit to the number
of neutrons you can stuff into a nucleus...

420
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,397
...before it becomes unstable.

421
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,346
I know a place where the
nuclei of different

422
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:48,157

<i>...but it's not.</i>

00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:17,394
<i>It's so hot that all its atoms
are always in their gaseous state.</i>

426
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,898
<i>The bonds that join atoms
to make solids and liquids on Earth...</i>

427
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:25,778
<i>...are not strong enough to withstand
the heat of the broiling sun.</i>

428
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:30,529
<i>Those arcing streams of incandescent gas
that dwarf the Earth...</i>

429
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,989
<i>...are guided by magnetic lines of force...</i>

430
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,406
<i>...that emanate from below
the surface of the sun.</i>

431
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,536
<i>Why is the sun so hot?</i>

432
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:43,956
<i>Because its own stupendous gravity
is squeezing its atoms together.</i>

433
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:50,344
<i>The energy of gravity is being transformed
into the energy of moving atoms.</i>

434
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,925
<i>That's what heat is.</i>

435
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,931
<i>The deeper we go into the sun...</i>

436
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,970
<i>...the greater the squeezing
and the higher the temperature.</i>

437
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,558
<i>In the heart of the sun...</i>

438
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:05,192
<i>...the atoms are moving so fast
that when they collide, they fuse.</i>

439
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,819
<i>Their nuclei touch.</i>

440
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,820
<i>The sun is a nuclear fusion reactor...</i>

441
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,235
<i>...held together by its own gravity.</i>

442
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,621
<i>It's balanced between
the inward pull of gravity...</i>

443
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,283
<i>...and the outward push of its hot gases.</i>

444
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,168
That balance has lasted
billions of years...

445
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,926
...providing stability that made possible
the evolution of life on Earth.

446
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,337
In the sun's core...

447
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,955
...the fusion of hydrogen
into helium releases

448
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:38,430
nuclear energy in the
form of photons.

449
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,971
These particles of light
slowly work their way to the surface...

450
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,139
...where they're seen as sunlight.

451
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:47,651
Helium is the ash
of the sun's nuclear furnace.

452
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,688
The sun is a medium-sized star.

453
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,155
Its core is only a lukewarm
1O million degrees.

454
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,491
Hot enough to fuse hydrogen,
but too cold to fuse helium.

455
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,199
There are many stars in the galaxy
that get much hotter...

456
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,620
...because they're more massive
and have more gravity.

457
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:11,008
<i>Such stars fuse helium into heavier
elements, like carbon and oxygen.</i>

458
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:15,342
<i>In their old age, they gently
diffuse these elements into space.</i>

459
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:22,011
Other stars, more massive yet,
live fast and die young...

460
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,305
...in cataclysmic supernova
explosions.

461
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,943
In our galaxy, such stars
go supernova about once a century.

462
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,611
<i>Those explosions are far hotter
than the core of the sun.</i>

463
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:39,449
<i>Hot enough to transform elements like
iron into all the heavier ones...</i>

<i>...and spew them into space.</i>

The Large Magellanic Cloud...

466
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,619
...is a neighboring galaxy
of our Milky Way.

467
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,208
It's visible in the skies
of the southern hemisphere.

468
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,881
When a supernova explodes...

469
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,216
...its brightness rivals that
of its entire galaxy.

470
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:12,320
But all that light is only about 1 percent
of the energy liberated in the explosion.

471
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,356
The rest of the energy is carried off
by the most common...

472
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,321
...and the most mysterious particles
in the cosmos.

473
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,202
There are trillions of them
passing through you right now.

474
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,784
And yet tracking down
even one of them...

475
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,417
...will take us to one of
the strangest places on Earth.

480
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,525
...more than a half mile
beneath Earth's surface.

481
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,860
You might ask,
"Well, who in their right mind...

482
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,243
...would bury an astronomical observatory
so far underground?"

483
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,788
Those who hunt the most elusive prey
in the cosmos:

484
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,532
the neutrino.

485
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,360
This enormous array
of light detectors

486
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:12,046
surrounding 50,000 tons
of distilled water...

487
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,378
...is a trap designed to
catch neutrinos only.

488
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,960
Other particles, such as cosmic rays...

489
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,050
...mostly protons and electrons
that rain down from space...

490
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,012
...cannot get through all that rock
above us.

491
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,802
But matter poses no obstacle
to a neutrino.

492
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,401
A neutrino could pass
through a hundred

493
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:33,314
light-years of steel
without even slowing down.

494
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,944
Neutrinos hardly interact
with matter at all.

495
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:39,323
That's why you need so much of it
to catch even one of them.

496
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,611
On those rare occasions...

497
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:44,529
...when a neutrino actually does collide
with a particle of ordinary matter...

498
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:48,415
...it produces a ghostly
ring-shaped flash of light.

499
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:54,380
We're lying in wait for a particle
that weighs next to nothing.

500
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,415
Even the miniscule electron...

501
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,835
...has more than a million times its mass.

502
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,503
There!

503
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,974
When the supernova in the Large
Magellanic Cloud blew its top in 1987...

504
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,636
...this is what it would have looked like
in here.

505
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,181
Now remember, the Large Magellanic
Cloud is in our southern hemisphere...

506
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,772
...so the neutrinos didn't come through
that half-mile of rock above us.

507
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,529
They had to pass through the thousands
of miles of rock and iron below us...

508
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,315
...to reach this detector.

509
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,653
But the coolest thing...

510
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,784
...was that those neutrinos hit Earth...

511
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,538
...three hours before
the light from the supernova did.

512
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,870
If nothing can travel faster than light...

513
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,831
...how could that possibly be?

514
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,552
<i>This is a dead star walking.</i>

515
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:47,683
<i>It may look normal, but deep within it,
something cataclysmic is happening.</i>

516
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,014
<i>This blue supergiant star...</i>

517
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:54,557
<i>...has already begun to explode inside.</i>

518
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,105
<i>Like rats deserting a sinking ship...</i>

519
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:04,366
<i>...the neutrinos produced in the heart
of the exploding star...</i>

520
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,947
<i>...race outward at near
the speed of light...</i>

521
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,865
<i>...through the overlying mass
in only a few seconds.</i>

522
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:16,003
<i>But the shock wave of the exploding gas
plods along from the center of the star...</i>

523
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,631
<i>...at one ten-thousandth
the speed of light...</i>

524
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,334
...until it finally reaches
the star's surface...

525
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:26,256
...turning it into Supernova 1987A.

526
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,462
It took hours for the
explosion to reach the

527
00:33:34,474 --> 00:33:36,436
surface of the star and
blow it wide-open...

528
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,726
...exposing the superhot core.

529
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,941
The neutrinos had
an insurmountable head start.

530
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,680
That's why the flash of
light arrived on Earth

531
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:47,280
so much later than the
shower of neutrinos.

532
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:51,364
Before anyone had ever snared
the wild neutrino...

533
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,626
...it existed in the mind
of a theoretical physicist.

534
00:33:56,117 --> 00:34:00,372
Just as Charles Darwin knew there must be
an extremely long-nosed creature...

535
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,917
...flying around somewhere
in Madagascar...

536
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:07,384
...a 20th-century physicist
named Wolfgang Pauli...

537
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,584
...was desperately
seeking a particle to

538
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:13,894
rescue one of the pillars
of modern physics.

539
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,896
The law of the conservation
of energy.

540
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,691
So why didn't I flinch?

541
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,076
Because the laws of science
differ fundamentally...

542
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,488
...from those of
other human endeavors.

543
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,373
In order for an idea
to become a scientific law...

544
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,785
...it has to be unbreakable.

545
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:42,957
That's why I was willing to bet this face
on the laws of conservation of energy.

546
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,876
Now, if you try this at home...

547
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,420
...take care not to give
the cannonball a push.

548
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,839
That's adding energy...

549
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,884
...and the ball will surely
come back and do some damage.

550
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,349
You just have to let it go, like this:

551
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,017
By lifting the ball...

552
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,022
...you give it gravitational energy...

553
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,855
...which is the potential
to fall and accelerate.

554
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,530
The Cannonball is going fastest
when it's at the bottom of its arc.

555
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,225
At that moment, it's
converted all of its

556
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:11,785
gravitational energy to
the energy of motion.

557
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,035
<i>As it swings...</i>

558
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,270
<i>...the cannonball is
constantly exchanging one</i>

559
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,370
<i>of these two kinds of
energy for the other.</i>

560
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,206
<i>But the total amount of energy
remains constant.</i>

561
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:24,248
That's an example
of the law of conservation of energy.

562
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,166
Once the cannonball is released...

563
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,712
...it can never gain more energy
than it had to begin with.

564
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,882
It has no way to fly up
and break my nose.

565
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,769
The energy accounting books
are always strictly balanced.

566
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,849
There's no such thing as cheating.

567
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,514
So in the 20th century...

568
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,230
...when physicists first calculated
the energy of atoms precisely...

569
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,898
...they were startled to discover
an apparent violation of this law.

570
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,659
They found that
in some radioactive atoms...

571
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,742
...the nucleus can spontaneously
eject an electron.

572
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,079
This transforms the atom
into a different element.

573
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,243
The physicists were mystified.

574
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,210
The energy of the escaped electron
plus that of the new element...

575
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:09,422
...adds up to less than the energy
in the original nucleus.

576
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:14,635
But the law says, "Thou shalt not
destroy or create energy."

577
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,176
So where did the missing energy go?

578
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:24,187
In 1930, Wolfgang Pauli predicted
there must be an undiscovered particle.

579
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,068
One that makes off
with the missing energy.

580
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,274
At the time...

581
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,536
...Pauli lamented that
such a phantom particle

582
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:34,660
might be so minute,
swift and evasive...

583
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,788
...as to forever defy detection.

584
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,746
But that was a rare failure
of his imagination.

585
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,287
Because science is always searching
for a way to go deeper still.

586
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,872
A generation later...

587
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,042
...Pauli's neutrinos were actually
detected for the first time...

588
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,711
...in radiation from a nuclear reactor.

589
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:57,223
And we've been finding them,
with difficulty, ever since.

590
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,054
There are scientists today...

591
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,687
...who are trying to find a way
to ride those neutrinos...

592
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,816
...all the way back
to the beginning of time.

593
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:13,692
We'll go as far as they have gone
to come up against the wall of forever.

594
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,126
<i>TYSON".
The wall of forever is nothing new.</i>

595
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:30,792
<i>Our ancestors came up against it almost
as soon as they first started imagining it.</i>

596
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,928
<i>A million dawns ago,
in the 13th century BC...</i>

597
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,965
<i>...the Egyptians built this temple
at Abu Simbel...</i>

598
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:43,683
<i>...to honor the pharaoh Ramses II,
depicted here in four colossal statues.</i>

599
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,648
<i>Reigning even above this mighty king...</i>

600
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:51,653
<i>...is the falcon-headed Ra-Harakhte,
god of the sun.</i>

601
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,286
<i>The temple was designed
so that the light from the rising sun...</i>

602
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:04,541
<i>...could only enter the sanctuary
on two days every year.</i>

603
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,536
<i>As the rays enter the temple...</i>

604
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,206
<i>...they burnish the statues of the gods
with their golden light...</i>

605
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,546
<i>...before penetrating the sanctuary.</i>

606
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,222
<i>Even then, one god remains in shadow...</i>

607
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,929
<i>...Ptah, lord of creation...</i>

608
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:26,847
<i>...as if the origin of the universe
must forever be concealed.</i>

609
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,567
<i>Feel the sun on your face.</i>

610
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:39,701
<i>The energy that warms you began its
journey some 10 million years ago...</i>

611
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,112
<i>...in the heart of the sun.</i>

612
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,115
<i>Unlike neutrinos...</i>

613
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:49,161
...the photons needed that long to work
their way out from the core to the surface.

614
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:55,752
Why? Because they were colliding billions
of times per second with the sun's atoms...

615
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,512
...every collision sending them off
in a random direction.

616
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,924
Once they finally reached the surface...

617
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,594
...they were free to dash nonstop
at the speed of light...

618
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:09,602
...in a mere eight minutes
and 2O seconds from the sun to you.

619
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,775
<i>Ten-million-year-old light on your face.</i>

620
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:22,573
What was happening
when that light left the heart of the sun?

621
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,464
The cosmic calendar
compresses the entire

622
00:39:31,476 --> 00:39:34,127
13.8-billion-year history
of the universe...

623
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,916
...into a single year.

624
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,961
Every month represents
about a billion years.

625
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,097
Every day, about 40 million years.

626
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,304
The universe is so old
that on the cosmic calendar...

627
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,936
...1O million years ago
only takes us back as far as...

628
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:55,485
...6 p.m. on the last evening
of the last day of the year.

629
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,145
And what about us?

630
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,406
Humans had yet to evolve.

631
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,907
Ten million years ago...

632
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,067
...our ancestors were anthropoid apes...

633
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,657
...swinging through the trees of Africa.

634
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,824
To us, 10 million years
seems like a long time...

635
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:14,463
...but it's only the length of an afternoon
on the timescale of the cosmos.

636
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:22,345
The sun began fusing hydrogen
4500 million years ago.

637
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,507
August 31st on the cosmic calendar.

638
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,687
<i>Our Milky Way Galaxy
is about 10,000 million years old.</i>

639
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:35,225
The first galaxies
formed a few billion years earlier.

640
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,689
And something keeps me from going
any further back in time.

641
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,361
What is this?

642
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,075
It's the nature of light and time.

643
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,036
Because light travels at a finite speed...

644
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,701
...to look across space...

645
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,541
...is to look back in time.

646
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:03,382
So the farther we see,
the older the light.

647
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,847
This is as far back in the history
of the cosmos as we can see with light.

648
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:13,730
It's a baby picture of the universe
when it was only 380,000 years old.

649
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:19,482
That's 15 minutes into January 1st
on the cosmic calendar.

650
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:24,737
If we look as far as we can see in any
direction using microwave telescopes...

651
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,572
...this is what we see...

652
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,408
...the glow left over from the Big Bang.

653
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,200
Imagine that all the matter and energy
of the observable universe...

654
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:37,837
...was concentrated into something
no larger than this.

655
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,583
That's the size of the universe...

656
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:47,427
...when it was a trillionth of a trillionth
of a trillionth of a second old.

657
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,558
All the matter and energy
of the hundred billion galaxies...

658
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:54,062
...now splayed out across
the billions of light-years...

659
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,726
...were once pent up
in something the size of a marble.

660
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,770
Can you imagine how tightly packed
that marble must have been?

661
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,940
Far too dense for any kind of light
to move through it...

662
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,485
...but no obstacle for the likes
of neutrinos.

663
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,825
The Big Bang must have produced
stupendous numbers of neutrinos...

664
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:15,788
...which flew unhindered through
that inconceivable crush of matter.

665
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,999
The very thing that makes them
almost impossible to detect...

666
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,364
...is what allows neutrinos
to sail through the

667
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:25,590
curtain that conceals
the beginning of time.

668
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:26,844
Where are they now?

669
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:30,678
They're here, they're there,
everywhere throughout the universe.

670
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,470
Neutrinos from creation
are within you.

671
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:39,148
From a marble to the cosmos.

672
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:55,540
<i>This is the road that Thales and Democritus
put us on some 2500 years ago.</i>

673
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,746
<i>A road of endless searching.</i>

674
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,163
<i>A relentless, systematic hunt
for new worlds...</i>

675
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:04,959
<i>...and an ever-deepening
understanding of nature.</i>

676
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:12,467
<i>Who among you will pick up that torch
and take us down that next stretch of road?</i>
