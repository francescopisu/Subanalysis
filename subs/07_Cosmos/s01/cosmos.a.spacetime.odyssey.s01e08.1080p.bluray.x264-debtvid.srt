...to see if she could determine
the actual chemical composition...

166
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,626
...and physical state of the stars.

167
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,763
She brought to this work her expertise
in theoretical and atomic physics.

168
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,268
<i>The most prominent features
in the spectra of stars...</i>

169
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,227
<i>...showed the presence of heavy elements
such as calcium...</i>

170
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,103
<i>...and iron, which are among
the most abundant elements in the Earth.</i>

171
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,489
So astronomers naturally concluded
that the stars...

172
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:21,118
...were made of the same elements as the
Earth and in roughly the same proportions.

173
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:27,455
<i>In 1924, Henry Norris Russell
was the dean of American astronomers...</i>

174
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:31,338
<i>...having made major contributions
to our understanding of the stars.</i>

175
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:36,377
RUSSELL: Forty to 45 of the chemical
elements that we have here on Earth...

176
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,466
...are also present
in the spectrum of the sun.

177
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:45,557
So we can assume that the composition
of the sun resembles that of the Earth.

178
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,439
If one were to heat the crust of the Earth
toincandescence“.

179
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,646
...its spectrum would resemble that
of the sun.

[MURMURING]

181
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:11,161
Annie, I think I now understand
what it all means.

182
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,170
All your years of work.

183
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,330
Tell me.

184
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,920
I've calculated what the spectra
should look like...

185
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,051
...across a wide range
of temperatures...

186
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,680
...and they match your system
of classification perfectly.

187
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,810
The spectrum of any star
tells you exactly how hot it is.

188
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:33,066
Your "O-B-A-F-G-K-M" is really a
temperature scale of the stars...

189
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,318
...from the hottest to the coldest.

190
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,897
Here's the headline, Annie.

191
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,532
Thanks to your work,
I've discovered that the stars...

192
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,035
...are made almost entirely
of hydrogen and helium.

193
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:49,199
There's a million times more hydrogen
and helium than the metals in the stars.

194
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,993
I know, it sounds daft.

195
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,662
Are you certain?

196
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,709
Has anyone else checked
your calculations?

197
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,877
Not yet, but it's all in my thesis...

198
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,842
...which is already on its way
to Professor Russell.

199
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,526
Poor woman.

200
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,529
<i>TYSON".
Russell felt sorry for Cecilia Payne.</i>

201
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:25,159
<i>Her thesis appeared to him
to be fundamentally flawed.</i>

202

<i>RUSSELL".
It is clearly impossible that hydrogen...</i>

203
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,381
<i>...should be a million times more abundant
than the metals.</i>

204
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,852
<i>TYSON: Her carefully
gathered evidence flew in</i>

205
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:48,600
<i>the face of conventional
scientific wisdom.</i>

206
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,261
<i>"How could I be right," she asked...</i>

207
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:57,230
<i>..."if that must mean that
such a distinguished scientist was wrong?"</i>

208
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,520
<i>Despite her confidence
in the quality of her research...</i>

209
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,701
<i>...she caved and added
a sentence to her</i>

210
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:06,739
<i>thesis that undermined
its greatest insight.</i>

211
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,628
It would be four years before Russell
realized that Payne was right.

212
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:21,963
To his credit, as soon as he did,
he acknowledged that it was her discovery.

213
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,136
<i>Payne's "Stellar Atmospheres"
is widely regarded...</i>

214
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,144
<i>...as the most brilliant PhD thesis
ever written in astronomy.</i>

215
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,681
<i>It became the standard text in its field.</i>

216
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,648
<i>PAYNE: I was to blame
for not having pressed my point.</i>

217
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:46,191
<i>I had given in to authority
when I believed I was right.</i>

218
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:51,158

you should defend your position.</i>

in other spheres of
human experience...

221
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,958
...but in science,
the only thing that counts...

222
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,500
...is the evidence
and the logic of the argument itself.

223
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,259
Cecilia Payne's interpretation...

00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,217
...of Annie Jump Cannon's sequence
of stellar spectra...

225
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,384
...made it possible for us
to read the life stories of the stars...

226
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,003
...and to trace the story
of life itself back

227
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:19,479
to its beginnings in
their fiery deaths.

228
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,910
<i>TYSON".
There are many kinds of stars.</i>

229
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,530
<i>Some are bright like the sun.</i>

230
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,369
<i>Some are dim.</i>

231
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:40,037
<i>The greatest stars are ten million
times larger than the smallest ones.</i>

232
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:45,585
<i>Some stars are old beyond imagining,
more than ten billion years of age.</i>

233
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,302
<i>Others are being born right now.</i>

234
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,769
When atoms fuse in the hearts of stars,
they make starlight.

235
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,224
Stars are born in litters...

236
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,062
<i>...formed from the gas and dust
of interstellar clouds.</i>

237
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,570
<i>The mass of the individual stars in
a litter can range from the runts--</i>

238
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,902
<i>Not much larger than the largest planets.</i>

239
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,069
<i>--to the supergiant stars
that dwarf the sun.</i>

240
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,207
The stars in the nebula below Orion's Belt
are newborns...

241
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,543
...around five million years old...

242
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:29,256
...and still swaddled in the gas and dust
that gave birth to them.

243
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,557
<i>The stars in the Pleiades are already
toddlers, about 100 million years old.</i>

244
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,059
<i>They've shed their blankets
of gas and dust...</i>

245
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,347
<i>...but they're still bound together
by their mutual gravity.</i>

246
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,186
<i>Another few hundred million years...</i>

247
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,227
<i>...and they'll drift apart
and go their separate ways...</i>

248
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,441
...never <i>to</i> meet again.

249
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,149
<i>Most of the stars of the Big Dipper
are adolescents...</i>

250
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,443
<i>...roughly a half a billion years old.</i>

251
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,237
<i>They've already drifted apart
from their birth cluster...</i>

252
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,123
<i>...although we can still trace
their common ancestry.</i>

253
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,286
<i>Eventually, they'll spread out
around the Milky Way galaxy.</i>

254
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:08,800
<i>But most of the familiar constellations
are a mix of entirely unrelated stars...</i>

255
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:13,589
<i>...some faint and nearby,
others bright and far away.</i>

256
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,221
<i>Our own sun?</i>

257
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,682
From the distance of even a few
light-years...

258
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,439
...it's hard to find amidst
the other stars.

259
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,395
It's that one.

260
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,689
Our sun is middle-aged and
a long way from where it was born.

261
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,109
Its sister stars, hatched from
the same interstellar cloud...

262
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,824
...are dispersed throughout
the galaxy.

263
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,164
Many of them have
their own planets.

264
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:44,623
Perhaps some of them nurture
the evolution of life and intelligence.

265
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,781
Most of the stars in
our night sky actually

266
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:50,341
orbit around one or more
stellar companions.

267
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,378
With the naked eye, we usually
can't see the fainter members...

268
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,797
...in such double
and multiple star systems.

269
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,053
<i>TYSON: On</i> a <i>world with three suns,
the nights would be rare...</i>

270
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,440
<i>...and the days might alternate
between red and blue.</i>

271
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,362
<i>It is the destiny of stars to collapse.</i>

272
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,325
<i>Of the thousands of stars you see
when you look up at the night sky...</i>

273
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,117
<i>...every one of them is living in
an interval between two collapses:</i>

274
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,628
<i>An initial collapse of a dark,
interstellar gas cloud to form the star...</i>

275
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:32,839
<i>...and a final collapse of the luminous
star on its way to its ultimate fate.</i>

276
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,005
Gravity makes stars contract,
unless some other force intervenes.

277
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,926
The sun is a great big ball
of incandescent gas.

278
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:45,597
The super-hot gas in its core pushes
the sun to expand outward.

279
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:49,939
At the same time, the sun's own gravity
pulls it inward to contract.

280
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,606
And our sun is poised between
these two forces in a stable equilibrium...

281
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,776
...between gravity and nuclear fire.

282
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,697
A balance it will maintain
for another 4 billion years.

283
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:07,244
But as the sun consumes hydrogen,
its core very slowly shrinks...

284
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,629
...and the sun's surface gradually expands
in response.

285
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:15,168
It happens very slowly, imperceptibly,
over the course of millions of years.

286
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:21,512
But in about a billion years, the sun will
be 1O percent brighter than it is today.

287
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,838
Ten percent may not sound
like much, but that

288
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,649
extra heat will have a
big effect on Earth.

289
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:42,329
When the sun finally exhausts its nuclear
fuel 4 or 5 billion years from now...

290
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:46,207
...its gas will cool and
the pressure will fall.

291
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:50,457
The sun's interior can no longer support
the weight of the outer layers...

292
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,793
...and the initial collapse will resume.

293
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,467
Nothing lasts forever.

294
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,627
Even the stars die.

295
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:04,972
Helium, the ash of 10 billion years of
hydrogen fusion, has built up in the core.

296
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,559
With no nuclear fire to sustain its weight,
the core collapses...

297
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:13,477
...until it becomes hot enough to start
fusing helium into carbon and oxygen.

298
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,692
The core of the sun is now much hotter
than it was before.

299
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,983
Its atmosphere rapidly expands.

300
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,948
Over the next billion years,
it'll become bloated...

301
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,867
...to more than 100 times
its original size, a red giant star.

302
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:36,667
<i>It will envelop and devour
the planets Mercury...</i>

303
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,633
<i>...and Venus...</i>

304
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,595
<i>...and possibly the Earth.</i>

305
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:54,483
<i>I like to think that tens of millions of
years before that far distant future...</i>

306
00:23:54,642 --> 00:24:00,900
<i>...if there still be life born of Earth, it
will have found new homes among the stars.</i>

307
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:07,618
<i>Once the sun burns through its helium,
it will become highly unstable...</i>

308
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,034
<i>...casting off its outer layers into space.</i>

309
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,624
<i>The exposed, super-hot core...</i>

310
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:18,883
<i>...will flood its surroundings
with high-energy ultraviolet light.</i>

311
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:25,386
<i>The atoms will perform a wild,
fluorescent dance.</i>

312
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,048
The sun will collapse
like a souffle, shrinking

313
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,859
a hundredfold to the
size of the Earth.

314
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,611
And at that point, the
sun will be so dense...

315
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,822
...that its overcrowded electrons will push
back, stopping any further contraction.

316
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:50,081
The kernel of light at the center will be
the only part of the sun that endures...

317
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,106
...a white dwarf star
that will go on shining

318
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:55,996
dimly for another
100 billion years.

319
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,758
Will the beings of a distant future,
sailing past this wreck of a star...

320
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:05,797
...have any idea of the life and worlds
that it once warmed?

326
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:57,731
<i>Sirius, the brightest star in the night
sky, has a very faint stellar companion...</i>

327
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,563
...a <i>white</i> dwarf.

328
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,103
<i>It was once a sun-like star.</i>

329
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:06,024
<i>Someday, when Sirius runs out of fuel
and becomes a red giant...</i>

330
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,114
<i>...it will shed its substance
onto the white dwarf.</i>

331
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,169
<i>The intense gravity of the
companion will attract</i>

332
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:16,042
<i>that gas, pulling it
into a spiraling disk.</i>

333
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,250
<i>When the gas from the larger star falls
onto the surface of the white dwarf...</i>

334
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,666
<i>...it will trigger nuclear explosions.</i>

335
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,141
<i>The greatest burst will release 100,000
times more energy than the sun.</i>

336
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,805
<i>Each one of those star bursts
is called a "nova"...</i>

337
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,974
<i>...from the Latin for "new."</i>

338
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,566
A star about 15 times as massive
as the sun, one like Rigel...

339
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,327
...the blue supergiant
that forms the right

340
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,950
foot of Orion, has a
different fate in store.

341
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,363
Its collapse will not be stopped
by the pressure of electrons.

342
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,291
The star will keep falling in on itself...

343
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:03,711
...until its nuclei become so overcrowded
that they push back.

344
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,928
Rigel will shrink down
about 100,000 times...

345
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:15,218
...until there's no space left between
the nuclei and it can shrink no more.

346
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:25,395
At that point, it ignites a more powerful
nuclear reaction: A supernova.

347
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,574
Most stellar evolution takes millions
or billions of years.

348
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:39,082
But the interior collapse that triggers
a supernova explosion takes only seconds.

349
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:44,588
What remains will be an atomic nucleus
the size of a small city...

350
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:49,172
...a rapidly rotating
neutron star called a pulsar.

351
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,188
<i>But for a star more than 30 times
as massive as the sun...</i>

352
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:11,153
...a <i>star like Alnilam in Orion's Belt,
there will be no stopping its collapse.</i>

353
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:16,867
<i>In a few million years, when Alnilam runs
out of fuel, it, too, will go supernova.</i>

354
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:22,081
<i>The imploding core of Alnilam
will be so massive...</i>

355
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:26,793
<i>...that not even nuclear forces will be
strong enough to hold off its collapse.</i>

356
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,299
<i>Nothing can withstand such gravity.</i>

357
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,962
<i>And such a star has an astonishing destiny.</i>

358
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:41,137
<i>It will continue to collapse,
crossing a boundary in space-time...</i>

359
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:45,558
<i>...called the "event horizon,"
beyond which we cannot see.</i>

360
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,981
<i>When it traverses that frontier,
the star will vanish completely from sight.</i>

361
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:57,657
<i>It will be inside a black hole,
a place where gravity is so strong...</i>

362
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,449
<i>...that nothing, not
even light, can escape.</i>

363
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:11,000
But there's an even more dramatic fate
that awaits a rare kind of star.

364
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,918
There's one of them in our galaxy.

365
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:19,092
It's so unstable that when it goes,
it won't become a mere nova or supernova.

366
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:24,059
It'll become something far more
catastrophic: A hypernova.

367
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,690
And it could happen in our lifetime.

368
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,489
<i>TYSON: There are few places on Earth
to get a better view of the night sky...</i>

369
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,249
<i>...than the Australian Outback.</i>

370
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:52,625
No buildings, no cars, streetlights,
nothing out here, just lots of starlight.

371
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,964
And the occasional kangaroo.

372
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,347
You can get a particularly good view
of the Milky Way from down here.

373
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:04,137
The center of our galaxy rises high in the
sky, and it arches across the heavens...

374
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,476
...like the backbone of night.

375
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,481
<i>We live in a spiral galaxy.</i>

376
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,267
<i>And when we look at the Milky Way...</i>

377
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:14,280
<i>...we're seeing light from billions
of stars in its spiral disk.</i>

378
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,493
<i>And under this beautiful
dark sky, you can see</i>

379
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:20,571
<i>that the Milky Way isn't
a uniform band of light.</i>

380
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,740
<i>There are dark patches,
breaks in the starlight.</i>

381
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,330
<i>Those dark patches
are caused by interstellar dust.</i>

382
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,042
<i>The dust blocks the starlight,
and there's lots of it.</i>

383
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,343
<i>Most cultures looked up at the stars
and connected the dots...</i>

384
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,845
<i>...to form familiar images in the sky.</i>

385
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,052
<i>Constellations.</i>

386
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:50,691
But the Aboriginal people of Australia
saw a pattern in the darkness...

387
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,817
...running through the Milky Way.

388
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:57,903
They saw an emu,
a large bird native to this continent.

389
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:01,945
<i>Not in the stars,
but in the absence of stars.</i>

390
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,408
There are so many ways
to look at the night sky.

391
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,453
For a million years or more,
we've watched the sky.

392
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,246
And a lot's happened in that time.

393
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:16,292
Supernova explode in our galaxy
about once a century.

394
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:21,385
If we could compress all those nights
of stargazing into a single minute...

395
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,425
...this is what we would see.

396
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,685
Now, if our eyes were telescopes...

397
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,817
...if they were light buckets
as big as wagon wheels...

398
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,149
...and our vision was not limited
to just one kind of light...

399
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,316
...then this is the Milky Way
we would see.

400
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:46,663
<i>A galaxy in near-infrared light
with streaming tendrils of dust...</i>

401
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,496
<i>...hurled outward by those
exploding supernovas...</i>

402
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:53,413
<i>...silhouetted against a backdrop
of countless stars.</i>

403
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:59,172
About 7500 light-years away,
in another part of our galaxy...

404
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:04,010

This is the Carina Nebula.</i>

406

408

<i>The titanic stars born here
sear the surrounding gas and dust...</i>

409
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,790
<i>...with their fierce ultraviolet radiation.</i>

410
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:43,713
<i>When a massive star dies,
it blows itself to smithereens.</i>

411
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,260
<i>Its substance is propelled
across the vastness...</i>

412
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,976
<i>...to be stirred by starlight
and gathered up by gravity.</i>

413
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:57,605
<i>Stars to dust and dust to stars.</i>

414
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,234
<i>In the cosmos, nothing is wasted.</i>

415
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:07,278
<i>But there's an upper limit
to how massive a star can be.</i>

416
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,707
<i>Back in the 17th century,
when Edmond Halley crossed the equator...</i>

417
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,743
<i>...to map the southern constellations...</i>

418
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,005
<i>...Eta Carinae seemed like
just another faint star.</i>

419
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:23,715
<i>But in 1843, Eta Carinae suddenly became
the second brightest star in the sky...</i>

420
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,879
<i>...outshined only by Sirius.</i>

421
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:29,095
<i>And it's been ﬂipping out ever since.</i>

422
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:36,599
<i>That dumbbell-shaped cloud
is the expanding remnant of that event.</i>

423
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,276
<i>At its center is one crazy star.</i>

424
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,016
<i>Talk about unstable, Eta
Carinae is at least</i>

425
00:33:47,028 --> 00:33:49,616
<i>100 times more massive
than the sun...</i>

426
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,533
<i>...and pouring out 5
million times more light.</i>

427
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,703
<i>It's pushing the upper limit
of what a star can be.</i>

428
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,154
<i>What's more, there's
evidence that Eta Carinae</i>

429
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,504
<i>is being gravitationally
tormented...</i>

430
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,385
...by an <i>evil</i> twin...

431
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:11,597
<i>...another massive star in orbit around it
as close as Saturn is to the sun.</i>

432
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,975
<i>The core of a supermassive star
pours out so much light...</i>

433
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:20,108
<i>...that the outward pressure can overwhelm
the star's gravity.</i>

434
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:24,773
<i>If a star is too massive, its radiation
pressure overpowers its gravity...</i>

435
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,282
<i>...and blows the star apart.</i>

436
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,914
The fate of Eta Carinae was sealed
when it was born millions of years ago.

437
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:38,498
When it finally does blow up--
And who knows, maybe it already has...

438

<i>harboring life, their

445
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:17,165

so much radiation into space...

446
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,328
...not just light, but
x-rays and gamma rays...

447

...that planets that are dozens,
or perhaps hundreds of light-years away...

448
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,465
...could be stripped of their atmospheres
and bathed in deadly radiation.

449
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:33,508
It would wreak havoc in thousands
of nearby star systems.

450
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,893
Right about now,
you're probably asking yourself:

451
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,599
"Are we safe?"

452
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:43,651

what happens to Earth?

453
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,104
<i>Rest assured, Earth will be just fine.</i>

How is the energy of a star transformed
into everything that happens in the world?

What is energy? We're awash in it.

471
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,984
When hydrogen atoms fuse inside the sun,
they make helium atoms.

472
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,396
And this fusion emits a burst of energy...

00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,378
Such transformations of energy
are happening everywhere all the time.

485
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:13,876
Energy from our star drives the wind
and the waves and the life around us.

486
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,797
How lucky we are to have this vast source
of clean energy...

487
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,091
...falling like manna from heaven
on all of us.

488
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:26,730
To Annie Jump Cannon,
Henrietta Swan Leavitt and Cecilia Payne...

489
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,233
...for blazing the trail
to modern astrophysics.

490
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,270
And to all the sisters of the sun.

491
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,413
<i>TYSON". There's no refuge
from change in the cosmos.</i>

492
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,621
Some 10 or 2O million years from now...

493
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,673
...it'll seem for a
cosmic moment as if Orion

494
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:52,586
is finally about to catch
the seven sisters.

495
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,796
But before he has them in his clutches, the
biggest stars of Orion will go supernova.

496
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,182
Orion's pursuit of the Pleiades
will finally end...

497
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,377
...and the seven sisters
will glide serenely

498
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:08,438
into the waiting arms
of the Milky Way.

499
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:17,281
<i>We on Earth marvel, and rightly so,
at the return of our solitary sun.</i>

500
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,033
<i>But from a planet orbiting a star
in a distant globular cluster...</i>

501
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,492
<i>...a still more glorious dawn awaits.</i>

502
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,415
<i>Not a sunrise...</i>

503
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,622
<i>...but a galaxy rise.</i>

504
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:35,006
<i>A morning filled with 200 billion suns.</i>

505
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,293
<i>The rising of the Milky Way.</i>

506
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:42,089
<i>An enormous spiral form
with collapsing gas clouds...</i>

507
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,850
<i>...condensing planetary systems,
luminous supergiants...</i>

508
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,886
<i>...stable middle-aged suns...</i>

509
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,976
<i>...red giants, white dwarfs,
planetary nebulae...</i>

510
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,064
<i>...supernovas, neutron stars, pulsars,
black holes.</i>

511
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,343
<i>And, there is every
reason to think, other</i>

512
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:01,484
<i>exotic objects that we
have yet to discover.</i>

513
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,199
<i>From such a world,
high above the Milky Way...</i>

514
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:10,162
<i>...it would be clear, as it is beginning
to be clear on our world...</i>

515
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:14,171
<i>...that we are made by the atoms
and the stars...</i>

516
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:20,719
<i>...that our matter and our form are forged
by the great and ancient cosmos...</i>

517
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,839
<i>...of which we are a part.</i>
