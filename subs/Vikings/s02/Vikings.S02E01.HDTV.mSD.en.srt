SEER: The gods desire you
to have a great future.

3
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:06,282
He's found a new way
to navigate the sea.

4
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:09,218
Great towns, and cities,
and treasures,

5
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:10,820
and a new God.

6
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,890
(Panicked screaming, swords slash)

7
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:16,526
- Why have you not killed this one?
- RAGNAR: I forbid it.

8
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:19,228
ROLLO: How can you forbid it,
little brother, we are equals.

9
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:23,066
EARL HARALDSON: You understand
that all this belongs to me.

10

LAGERTHA: In my dreams,
we are always together.

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,104
- RAGNAR: What does a man do?
- He look after his family.

12
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:30,926

ALL:
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

16

How will we ever be equal now,
my brother?

17
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:43,352
We shall have more ships to go West,

18
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:45,813
for that is our future.

19
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,993
Why did the gods make me Earl,
yet kill my son?

20
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,629
- We can have more sons.
- Have we not tried?

KONG HORIK:
Ragnar Lothbrok!

22

King Horik, how can I be of help?

23
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,702
There is a Jarl in Gotaland,
Jarl Borg.

24
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:01,471
He threatens me.

25
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:02,672
JARL BORG: Are you the emissaries
from King Horik?

26
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:04,173
You're wasting your time.

27
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:06,509
It's my land
and I want it returned to me.

28
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,845
King Horik resists your claim.

29
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:09,946

GILDA:
I am going to die.

31
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:14,417
You are not going to die.
What is it that the gods want?

32
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,752
SEER:
To take something from you.

33
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:18,454
ASLAUG:
I am Princess Aslaug,

34
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:21,090
my mother was
the shield-maiden Brunhilde.

35
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:24,127
Shall I tell Lagertha, your wife?

36
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:25,661
If you really want to be a great man,

37
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:27,728
you need me
as much as I need you.

38
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:30,227
What is it you really want?

39
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,795
The death of your brother
and the start of your own fame?

40
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,233
I'm carrying your child.

41
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,770
I will fight with you
against my bother.

RAGNAR: I've had no message
from my brother,

44
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:27,890
but I still believe in my heart
that he will not betray me,

45
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,660
for he has no reason.

46
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:36,566
Who needs a reason for betrayal?

47
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:40,803
One must always think
the worst, Ragnar,

48
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:43,673
even of your own kin.

49
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:47,944
That way, you avoid too much
disappointment in life.

50
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:51,047

51
00:02:56,553 --> 00:03:00,022

56
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:53,109
There is the treacherous one.

57
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:56,345
I was right, Ragnar.

58
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:59,548
(Inhales forcefully)
I was right.

I want to speak to his brother.

JARL BORG:
Then speak.

76
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:46,588
Rollo,

77
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:49,591
you and I fought together many times.

78
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,527
I don't suppose you've forgotten.

79
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,064
I think of you as a brother...

80
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:59,935
but over there is your real brother,

81
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:02,871
your own flesh and blood.

82
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:05,874
Are you sure you want to raise
your axe against him?

83
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,278
Did Ragnar send you?

(Exhales)

85
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,425

(Exhales slowly)

87
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:31,233

with blood.

KING HORIK:
Without being defeated,

172
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:32,187
we have grown weary
of the slaughter of our young men.

173
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:34,856
So, Jarl Borg,

174
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:36,858
I offer you...

175
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,062
one third of the profits
from the disputed lands.

176
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,466
Unless you continue
to dispute my claim to it.

177
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:50,572
I would rather go back fighting,
than receive such scant justice.

178
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,208
(Weary, frustrated sigh)

179
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,022
So, you'll not accept my fair offer?

180
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:03,017
No.

181
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:12,867
Why do we continue looking inwards?

182
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:17,632
(Shouts)
Why?!

183
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,835
Why do we fight each other

184
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:24,472
about this piece or that piece of land?

185
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:28,576
Why are we not looking outwards
to the West?

186
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:33,381
If we raided together,

187
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:39,153
we would not need to fight
amongst ourselves.

188
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:43,958
We would not need to kill
anymore of our young folk.

189
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:47,395
But instead,

190
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:50,398
offer them land,

191
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:53,268
land that they can farm.

192
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:55,807
WARRIOR: (Quietly)
He speaks the truth.

193
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:04,045
My mind tends the same way
as Ragnar's.

194
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:06,447
It is my intention to join with him

195
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:08,550
and sail West.

196
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:12,187
What do you say, Jarl Borg?

197
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:17,625
Yes,

198
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,196
I will raid with you,

199
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,968
and so I accept your offer.

200
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:33,074
(Warriors talk quietly)

201
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,957
Not that you'd care, brother,

202
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:51,860
but your niece, Gyda, is dead.

203
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,200
Time to go home.

204
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,835
(Spits in disgust, groans)

205
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:08,042
(Water churns)

206
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,621
(Shouts of surprise in the distance)

207
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:23,625
(Cries of excitement)

208
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,869
(Chain clanks)
(Torstein grunts with effort)

209
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,256
(Women weep openly)

210
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:44,087
Floki! Floki!

211
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:47,181
Don't die. Please don't die.

212
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:49,016
WOMAN:
What's happened to them?!

213
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:53,287
TOWNSPEOPLE:
(Shout angrily)

214
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:56,340
One Eye died.

215
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:59,023
Arne?!

216
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:03,464
Rollo killed him.

217
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:10,104
And Floki may not survive
for he is so badly wounded.

218
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:15,353
LAGERTHA:
This was not your quarrel.

219
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:17,344
You should not have become involved.

220
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:18,446
Look what has happened!

221
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,314
No man can walk through life

222
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,184
without things happening
to him, Lagertha.

223
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:24,785
You chose.

224
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:27,721
Yes. I chose, and Rollo chose.

225
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:29,790
And Rollo's choice led to all this!

226
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:31,959
BJORN:
Don't argue you two.

227
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:39,132
I am weary and I'm blood-sickened,

228
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,536
and that is the truth.

229
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:46,173
(Bites food)

230
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,142
(Quietly)
Who is Aslaug?

231
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,812
(Grunts angrily)
(Plate strikes floor)

232
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:55,249
Stop.

233
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:59,220
Who is Aslaug?

234
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:01,922
She's a Gotaland princess.

235
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,924
We met her over there.

236
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,426
You just met her?

237
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:07,582
SIGGY: (Warningly)
Lagertha.

238
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,390
What has the boy told you?

239
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,937
What did you tell her, boy?

240
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:20,975
LAGERTHA:
It doesn't matter what Bjorn says.

241
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:23,077
What do you say?

242
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:27,448
I say...

243
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,417
(Chairs crash)

244
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:35,890
we should not wash our dirty clothes
in front of others.

245
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:42,463
(Water splashes and drips)

246
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:44,932
(Doors crash open)

247
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:49,236
Ungh!

248
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,738
Ungh!
(Object smashes)

249
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,306
Did you have sex with her?

250
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:55,309
Yes, I had sex with her.

251
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:59,847
(Object clatters)
How many times?!

252
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,316
Once.

253
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:06,754
Ungh!
(Struggling grunts)

254
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:09,924
(Panting)

255
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:18,899
I don't love her.

256
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:20,834
(Sharp gasp)

257
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:27,775
How can I make you let this go?

258
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,310
Never see her again.

259
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:31,111
Done.

260
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:38,185
Never again.

261
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,722
(Passionate gasp)

262
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:44,725
BJORN: Why are there such problems
between you?

263
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:46,827
RAGNAR:
You know why.

264
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:49,129
But I don't want there
to be problems.

265
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,131
Can't you just say sorry
for what you've done?

266
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,234
(Laughs) It's not so easy
with your mother.

267
00:19:57,205 --> 00:20:00,274
And what will happen to Rollo?

268
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,876
RAGNAR:
I cannot judge my own brother.

269
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:06,813
We will have an assembly
and the Law-Giver will judge.

270
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:08,983
We will take Rollo
up to the Law Rock

271
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,852
and that is where his fate
will be decided.

272
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:15,823
What's that you have?

273
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,926
A gold coin. From England.

274
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:22,429
You see?

275
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,899
It even has King Aelle's
face upon it.

276
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:35,609
So it's worth a fortune?

277
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:39,813
(Townspeople chatter, seagulls cry)

278
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:42,983
(Approaching footsteps)

279
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,103
TORSTEIN:
What do you want?

280
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,891
To talk to him.

281
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:19,420
(Whispers)
Rollo...

282
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:24,091
Rollo, it's me.

283
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:30,097
Don't bother.

284
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:34,835
You cannot warm up a dead man.

285
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:37,171
(Angry shouting and jeering)

286
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:39,273
MAN:
He is without honor!

287
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:43,911
- MAN 2: Kill him!
- WOMEN: I spit on you!

288
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:48,849
MAN AND WOMAN:
Traitor! Traitor!

289
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:51,852
WOMAN 2:
Now he'll pay for what he's done!

290
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,388
- WOMAN 3: Kill him!
- MAN 2: Traitor! Traitor!

291
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:56,457
WOMAN 4:
Kill him!

292
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,261
WOMAN 5:
Shame on you!

293
00:22:02,964 --> 00:22:05,032
(Bangs staff)

294
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:09,470
LAW-GIVER:
People, as your Law-Giver,

295
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,440
I have been asked to determine
the fate of this man.

296
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:19,146
This man chose to fight
with our enemies.

297
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:23,884
Chose to fight against his brother.

298
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:25,719
MAN:
Traitor!

299
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,028
LAW-GIVER:
He killed many of our sons,

300
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:33,406
brothers, fathers.

301
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:35,462
What hope is there for him?

302
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,798
TOWNSPEOPLE:
(Angry jeers)

303
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,500
TORSTEIN:
He has no defense!

304
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,101
MAN:
He has no defense!

305
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:42,970
LAW-GIVER:
This man deserves to die.

306
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,438
TOWNSPEOPLE:
Yeah!

307
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:47,441
We all know that.

308
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:51,411
But... I have decided to spare him.

309
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:54,314
(Shouts of disagreement)

310
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,851
LAW-GIVER:
I have taken the advice of the gods.

311
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:02,282
If they had wanted him dead,

312
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,825
he would have died in battle.

313
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:07,294
But they spared him.

314
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:08,929
He came forward

315
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,032
and threw himself
upon the mercy of his brother.

316
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:16,804
He behaved in an interesting
and unexpected way,

317
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:20,374
and therefore, I conclude...

318
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:23,859
that the gods have made
their own judgment,

319
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,553
which I cannot overturn.

320
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:30,846
LAW-GIVER: I therefore order
this man be set free.

321
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:32,981
CROWD:
(Shouts angrily)

322
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:34,983
MAN:
Kill the traitor!

323
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,921
TORSTEIN: We should kill him anyway.
You are the Earl!

324
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:42,657
No. We must obey the law.

325
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:46,328
Who is the Law-Giver?
Just an ordinary man.

326
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:49,531
Not when he stands
on the Sacred Stone.

327
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:18,574
(Ships creak, dog barks, seagulls cry)

328
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:28,751
(Goats bleat, geese honk)

329
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:45,535
(Sighs heavily)

330
00:24:45,636 --> 00:24:48,204
I wanted to step out of your shadow.

331
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:52,032
You understand, don't you?

332
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:01,184
But when I stepped out of it,
there was... there was no sunlight,

333
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,262
no sunlight at all.

334
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,898
(Ships creaks, seagulls cry)

335
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,270
(Door creaks open)

336
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:27,977
What are you doing?

337
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:29,912
Leaving.

338
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:39,055
Everyone hates me here...
with good reason.

339
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:42,091
I have betrayed them.

340
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,994
There is no point in my staying.

341
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:50,833
But you are going to leave
and not even say goodbye to me?

342
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:53,302
I thought you would
prefer it that way.

343
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:04,513
Do you really know me so little?

344
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:11,153
I have nothing to offer you.

345
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,535
It would have been better
for you, for me, for everyone

346
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,335
if I had been executed.

347
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:30,873
So you take no account of the gods?

348
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:37,913
What would you say
the gods have offered you?

349
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:40,149
A lifetime of humiliation.

350
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,818
SIGGY:
No! That is not it!

351
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:46,022
The gods have offered you
a chance to be reborn,

352
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:48,157
to be redeemed, to gain Valhalla.

353
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:50,693
That is what they have offered you.

354
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,196
But you, you want to run away.

355
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:57,500
You want to hide in a hole
somewhere.

356
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:01,003
Where else can I go?

357
00:27:01,104 --> 00:27:04,740
Why do you have to go anywhere?

358
00:27:10,747 --> 00:27:14,050
(Birds chirp and cry, fire crackles)

359
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:18,154
RAGNAR:
Gyda,

360
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:21,590
I have come to say goodbye
to you properly.

361
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:27,730
I have been thinking about you,
about when you were small.

362
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,099
You were so lively,

363
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,203
you could run as swiftly
as the wind.

364
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:36,772
You were like quick-silver.

365
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,810
But then, before I knew it,

366
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:43,979
you stopped running
here and there and everywhere

367
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:46,182
and you became still.

368
00:27:48,852 --> 00:27:51,620
At 12-years-old,

369
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:55,958
you had the stillness
and the calm of a fine woman.

370
00:27:56,026 --> 00:27:59,495
What children
you would have produced!

371
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:05,534
What joy that would have
brought to all of us.

372
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:21,217
Dear child, Gyda,

373
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:25,654
you are not gone because
you are always in my heart.

374
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:31,093
They say that a man must love
his sons more,

375
00:28:31,194 --> 00:28:34,964
but a man can be jealous
of his sons,

376
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:39,301
and his daughter can always be
the light in his life.

377
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:50,579
I know very well
that you are with the gods,

378
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,816
but I will wait here awhile,

379
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,437
and if you want to come
and talk to me,

380
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,887
then come and talk,

381
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:05,795
and I will gently stroke
your long and beautiful hair once again

382
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:07,863
with my peasant hands.

383
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:12,735
(Waves lap gently)

384
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,180
(Waves lap against the ship)

385
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,986
(Ship creaks)

386
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,860
(Low hum of chatter, wind howls)

387
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:39,728
(Running footsteps)
BJORN: Father!

388
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,131
Father!

389
00:29:42,232 --> 00:29:44,467
- RAGNAR: What?
- BJORN: There's someone coming.

390
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:46,735
(Buzz of excited chatter)

391
00:29:58,815 --> 00:30:01,183
CAPTAIN:
Keep steady! Take the oars!

392
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:04,854
Pull in the ropes!

393
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,541
(Buzz of excited chatter)

394
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:28,944
RAGNAR: You must believe me,
I had no idea.

395
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:31,847
I did not ask her to come.

396
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:33,782
(Sheep bleats)

397
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:42,024
(Low hum of chatter)

398
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:47,897
(Excited whispers)

399
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:05,614
(Boisterous chatter)
(Music fill the hall)

400
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:11,053
(Goat bleats)

401
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:21,864
Bjorn told me that your mother

402
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,599
was the shield-maiden, Brunhilde,

403
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,200
of whom we've all heard?

404
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:26,735
It's true.

405
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:29,204
Although she died
when I was very young.

406
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,540
And your father?

407
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,509
My father was Sigurd.

408
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,044
Sigurd...?

409
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,212
Just Sigurd?

410
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:40,082
ASLAUG:
No, I mean the Sigurd

411
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:43,586
who, according to the sagas,
killed the dragon Fafnir.

412
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:48,015
Then your father is also a hero.

413
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:52,953
People talk about him, it's true,
and I'm proud that he was my father.

414
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:55,055
But I never knew him.

415
00:31:56,758 --> 00:31:58,525
What about your parents?

416
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,694
LAGERTHA:
Hmm.

417
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,863
They were just farmers.

418
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,966
Surely nobody is just a farmer.

419
00:32:08,236 --> 00:32:10,070
Believe me, princess,

420
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:14,341
that is exactly what some people are,
and are happy to be.

421
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:17,244
Forgive me.

422
00:32:20,882 --> 00:32:22,249
Do you remember me, Bjorn?

423
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:25,252
Do you remember we stood
in front of the Tree of Life?

424
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,955
It wasn't Yggdrasil.
It was just a tree.

425
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:33,727
ASLAUG: You're right.
We both know that.

426
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,629
It creates a bond between us.

427
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:38,031
BJORN:
I don't think so.

428
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:40,033
We don't have any bond.

429
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:42,669
I don't want any bond with you.

430
00:32:44,772 --> 00:32:46,940
(Uneasy silence)

431
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,969
BJORN: Why don't you just tell her
that she has to leave soon?

432
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,504
She can't stay here.

433
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:01,006
She is carrying my child.

434
00:33:01,107 --> 00:33:03,842
She brings unhappiness
and difficulty.

435
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:06,679
Can't you see that? Are you blind?

436
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:13,452
I know it is hard for you
to accept,

437
00:33:13,453 --> 00:33:16,722
but unhappiness
is more common than happiness.

438
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:21,693
Who told you
you should be happy?

439
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:26,565
You've come to an age
where you must be grow up

440
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:29,234
and be responsible
about such things.

441
00:33:30,336 --> 00:33:33,038
When I was your age,
I had many friends.

442
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:36,483
All are dead.

443
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,346
The happiness is
neither here nor there.

444
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:47,119
SIGGY: How much do you know
about this woman?

445
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,688
Only what Bjorn told me,
which was not much.

446
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:52,925
He did not wish to be disloyal
to his father.

447
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:59,665
(Sighs heavily) I did not know
she was carrying his child, though.

448
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:01,600
And you believe it?

449
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,769
LAGERTHA:
Ragnar believes it.

450
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:09,308
What of all her stories
of Brunhilde and Sigurd?

451
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,642
I suppose so.

452
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:13,412
She is clearly different from us.

453
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:16,581
(Women chatter nearby)

454
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:20,585
What are you going to do?

455
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:24,389
I don't know.

456
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:29,461
I must do what is right for my son.

457
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:36,368
(Water splashes)

458
00:34:38,004 --> 00:34:40,772
(Geese honk, people chatter)

459
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,578
Oh, Floki!

460
00:34:49,182 --> 00:34:51,683
I'm not dead yet, Bjorn.

461
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:54,686
No thanks to you, Ragnar.

462
00:34:54,754 --> 00:34:58,490
RAGNAR:
Oh. Say what you'd like about me,

463
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:02,728
I'm just glad that the gods
were stupid enough to save you.

464
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:06,631
FLOKI:
The gods... and Helga.

465
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:13,672
You must regain your strength.

466
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:17,275
There's much to do.
A whole fleet of boats to be built.

467
00:35:17,377 --> 00:35:22,347
You and I have seen nothing yet.
Our journeys have just begun.

468
00:35:23,383 --> 00:35:24,816
FLOKI:
It's true!

469
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,386
I thought I was dead

470
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:31,423
and while I was dead,
I was dreaming of other places,

471
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:34,793
the places that you and I
shall sail to, Ragnar.

472
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:37,562
(Laboured breath)
(Exhales in pain)

473
00:35:38,464 --> 00:35:41,633
Rest.

474
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:43,502
Come on, boy.

475
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:45,871
(Wind blows fiercely)

476
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:50,842
(Loud chatter fills the hall)
(Fire crackles)

477
00:35:52,211 --> 00:35:54,446
(Doors bang open)

478
00:35:54,547 --> 00:35:57,215
- BJORN: Floki!
- MAN: Hey, Floki!

479
00:35:57,283 --> 00:36:00,252
- FLOKI: Hello, Bjorn.
- MAN: Floki!

480
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:04,089
(Doors latches)

481
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,359
(Loud chatter resumes)

482
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:26,478
(Everybody quiets down)

483
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:29,324
ASLAUG: I hope you will accept
what I have chosen

484
00:36:29,348 --> 00:36:31,183
and prepared for you?

485
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:36,288
(Hushed whispers and laughter)

486
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:37,889
WOMAN:
Generous!

487
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:41,526
I did not expect you to go
to so much trouble.

488
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:45,263
It is no trouble,
if it is pleasing to you.

489
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:50,902
(People laugh and chatter)

490
00:36:58,644 --> 00:37:00,145
To tell you the truth,

491
00:37:00,246 --> 00:37:03,148
I did not imagine you could cook!

492
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:05,417
I can't. My women cooked,

493
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:07,686
I just bought the ingredients.

494
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:17,582
Looking at both of you here,
in my home...

495
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:21,600
I see no reason why you two
should not get on together.

496
00:37:26,506 --> 00:37:30,342
You two are very different,
yet both strong.

497
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:36,715
I have heard that
similar arrangements exist

498
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:38,850
all over this country.

499
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:43,755
What arrangements?

500
00:37:47,894 --> 00:37:52,164
That an Earl can live
with more than one woman.

501
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,335
In fact, it is not unusual.

502
00:37:59,406 --> 00:38:02,361
It works to the benefit of everyone,

503
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:04,476
especially the children.

504
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:12,517
Of both marriages, of course.

505
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:18,820
It's true.
I know of many such instances.

506
00:38:18,855 --> 00:38:20,792
Yes.

507
00:38:24,964 --> 00:38:29,501
Is that what you're suggesting?

508
00:38:33,673 --> 00:38:35,859
If I were,

509
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:41,215
what would you say?

510
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:53,558
I'm sorry, but this woman
is carrying my child.

511
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:58,762
I must take care of her.
You must accept.

512
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:07,839
When we lost our unborn son,
it broke my heart.

513
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,709
I had failed
and I will not fail again.

514
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:18,650
I cannot turn this woman away.

515
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:23,755
I have to take care of my child.

516
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:31,363
(Sighs heavily)

517
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,631
Don't forget the axe.

518
00:39:57,638 --> 00:39:59,806
You are leaving then?

519
00:40:02,743 --> 00:40:05,112
Of course I'm leaving.

520
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,982
TORSTEIN:
Is Bjorn going with you?

521
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:12,319
That's up to Bjorn.

522
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:26,133
Bjorn,
you have a big choice to make.

523
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:30,904
I admire your mother.
We all do.

524
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:33,749
But you have to stay
with your father.

525
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,719
If you don't, you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

526
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:44,226
Remember, your father
is Ragnar Lothbrok.

527
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:56,838
(Townspeople chatter)

528
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:07,383
Bjorn.

529
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:19,161
You have to choose.

530
00:41:22,332 --> 00:41:24,700
Say it now.

531
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,387
I... I choose my father.

532
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:40,148
(Emotional)
Very well.

533
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:45,387
(Tearful, shaky breaths)

534
00:41:45,488 --> 00:41:47,155
(Light kiss)

535
00:41:59,902 --> 00:42:02,070
(Shaky, emotional breaths)

536
00:42:05,908 --> 00:42:08,076
