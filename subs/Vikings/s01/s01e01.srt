00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,934
come on. Let's go home.

00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:50,644
Watch.

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,888
Agh!

31
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,878
What are you two doing?

32
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,748
I'm taking Bjorn
to the thing tomorrow.

33
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:33,687
Not yet. He's not old enough.

34
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:35,322
He's twelve years old.

35
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:36,924
Take him next year.

36
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:39,259
Next year is soon enough.

37
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:42,863
He'll need a silk ribbon,
Lagertha.

38
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,268
You're a handsome boy.

39
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,803
Funny ears, though.

40
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:59,713
<i>Don't sleep with
lots of women in Kattegat.</i>

41
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:01,915
I can do without it
for a few days.

42
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:06,854
Is that another way
of saying you love me?

43
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:10,858
Huh?

44
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,360
I always dream of you.

45
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:15,529
Last night,

46
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,700
I dreamt you were feeding me
blood pudding.

47
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:23,170
What does that mean?

48
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,939
It means you're giving me
your heart.

49
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:38,886
<i>Get your dog, boy.</i>

50
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:41,889
<i>Frodi! Come on, boy.</i>

51
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:58,405
<i>What will happen at the thing?</i>

52
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:01,275
<i>The Earl will deal
with some criminal offences</i>

53
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:05,078
<i>and then, we'll discuss</i>
<i>the summer raids.</i>

54
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,114
And where will you go?

55
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:09,149
The Earl decides.

56
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,884
He owns the ships.

57
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:14,555
He'll send us to the east,

58
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:17,958
as always, to the baltic lands.

59
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,927
But I want to know
what is to the west...

60
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:23,063
what cities and gods
are over there.

61
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:26,900
See, I'm not satisfied...
With this.

62
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:36,176
Odin gave his eye
to acquire knowledge,

63
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,581
but I would give far more.

64
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:47,988
And will Earl
Haraldson let you?

65
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:53,994
<i>Good.</i>

66
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:57,197
Like this, nice and tight..

67
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,401
<i>And on three.</i>

68
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:03,704
<i>One, two, three.</i>

69
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,741
Very good, Gyda.

70
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:15,115
Gyda, feed the goats.

71
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:18,652
Go on!

72
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,956
What do you want?

73
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:24,992
We know you're all alone here.

74
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,827
All the men are gone.

75
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:31,231
If you're thirsty,
I will give you a drink.

76
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:33,567
If you're hungry,
I will feed you.

77
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:36,136
Otherwise, you must go.

78
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:40,440
<i>We will eat and drink</i> after
we've satisfied our other needs.

79
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:54,621
<i>I don't want to kill you,</i>
<i>woman.</i>

80
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:55,622
You couldn't kill me

81
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:58,392
if you tried
for a hundred years.

82
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,164
Aggghhhhh!

83
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:18,245
Out!

84
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:29,456
<i>I went to
confess my love to her</i>

85
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:31,525
<i>but I was set upon by a bear</i>

86
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:35,462
<i>and an enormous hound</i>
<i>who guarded her home.</i>

87
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:38,632
I killed the bear with my spear

88
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:41,668
and I managed
to strangle the hound

89
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,170
with my bare hands.

90
00:09:45,673 --> 00:09:48,108
And that is how I gained
her hand in marriage.

91
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,014
Did she tell you
the same story?

92
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:56,617
Just about.

93
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,227
<i>Are you ready to receive</i>
<i>your arm ring</i>

94
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,396
and become a man?

95
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:10,931
Yes.

96
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:12,299
And what does a man do?

97
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:16,436
He fights.

98
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:17,771
<i>And...?</i>

99
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:21,041
He looks after his family.

100
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:23,777
<i>That's right.</i>

101
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:26,480
Could you look after
our family?

102
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,486
What do you mean?
You look after us.

103
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:34,187
Say I wasn't there.

104
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,760
<i>I have a big decision to make.</i>

105
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:41,862
It may change many things.

106
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:45,599
<i>Now, go to sleep.</i>

107
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,101
You have a big day tomorrow.

108
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,322
Arrggghhh!

109
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:16,423
Bjorn!

110
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,394
So, here you are, brother.

111
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:23,463
Rollo.

112
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:25,465
By frey and all the
gods how you've grown.

113
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:26,666
Hello, rollo.

114
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:28,101
Are you here for the thing?

115
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:30,570
You're a real man now.

116
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,239
Come, let's get a drink.

117
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,383
Looking a little pale, Bjorn.

118
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,421
Why don't you go lie down, hmm?

119
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:57,297
So where do you think the
Earl is going to send us this year?

120
00:12:57,398 --> 00:12:58,298
Those bastards to the east

121
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,400
are as poor as we are.

122
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:01,835
I know.

123
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:07,007
That's why we should sail west.

124
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:09,409
I've heard such tales, rollo.

125
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,312
Great towns, and cities,
and treasures;

126
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:16,283
Hordes of gold and silver,
and... and a new God.

127
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:18,285
I've heard those stories too.

128
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:20,387
But what does it mean?

129
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:23,990
We can't sail across
an open ocean.

130
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,558
I believe there's a way

131
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:27,659
to go west.

132
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:35,037
I have something
that will change everything.

133
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:37,737
What?

134
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,343
What is that?

135
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:44,544
Now just listen.

136
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:47,614
A while back, I met someone,

137
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:49,950
a wanderer.

138
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,551
He told me that it was possible

139
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:55,255
to go west, over the open sea,

140
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,690
using this.

141
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:02,395
It's a sun-board.

142
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,365
It needs to sit in water.

143
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:07,567
Another wanderer?

144
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:08,902
This time is different.

145
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:11,471
<i>Now tell me, Ragnar,
this-this wanderer of yours,</i>

146
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:13,173
has he ever sailed
west himself?

147
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,308
Just get some water.

148
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:31,892
<i>Now, this candle is the sun.</i>

149
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:33,560
Every day...

150
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:36,930
The sun rises up into the sky
until noon.

151
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:38,031
See how the shadow shortens?

152
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,868
<i>At noon, it is at its shortest.</i>

153
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:43,637
That only tells me how
far South I have travelled.

154
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:46,172
Didn't I just tell you
to listen?!

155
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:49,242
<i>The day before sailing</i>

156
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,678
<i>you mark a circle around</i>
<i>the pointer</i>

157
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,282
where the shadow
is at its shortest at noon.

158
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:57,117
The next day at sea,

159
00:14:57,218 --> 00:14:59,819
you place the board
back into water around noon

160
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:00,854
and watch the shadow.

161
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:05,358
<i>If the shadow only touches</i>
<i>the circle...</i>

162
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,093
Your course remains true?

163
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:08,561
Yes.

164
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:12,532
And if it passes outside
the circle, like this...

165
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,701
Then you have drifted

166
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,369
and you must steer
further South.

167
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,538
Yes.

168
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,308
And what if it never
reaches the circle?

169
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:22,442
<i>Then you are too far South</i>

170
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:23,877
and must steer more
to the north.

171
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:25,378
That's it!

172
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,449
Keep the noon shadow
on the circle

173
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,818
and your course will be true,

174
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,919
west.

175
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:41,695
But what if there is
no sun, hmm?

176
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,763
How can the board
help you then?

177
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:46,633
How could you find your way?

178
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:51,871
Using this.

179
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,178
Follow me outside.

180
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:05,618
They call it a sun-stone.

181
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:10,957
Oh! You see?

182
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,660
There is the sun.

183
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,428
Now we go west.

184
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,937
Come on. Come on.

185
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:37,988
<i>Silence!</i>

186
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,556
Silence!

187
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,211
<i>Olaf Anwend.</i>

188
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,881
You have pleaded guilty
to the charge of stealing.

189
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,285
<i>Tomorrow, you will run</i>
<i>a gauntlet of stones and turf</i>

190
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:09,586
as punishment.

191
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:13,723
Yes, lord. Thank you, lord.

192
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,659
<i>Let it be known
a fine is to be paid</i>

193
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,095
by anyone who fails
to throw something.

194
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,735
<i>Bring in the next accused.</i>

195
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,738
There he is! Murderer!

196
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,643
Eric Trygvasson,

197
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:37,180
you are accused of the murder
of Sigvald strut

198
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:38,315
this January.

199
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,750
How do you plead?

200
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,519
<i>It wasn't murder, lord.</i>

201
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:44,221
I killed him in self-defense.

202
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:46,756
<i>Liar!</i>

203
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:48,525
<i>If it wasn't murder,</i>

204
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:49,793
<i>why did you not declare</i>
<i>your crime</i>

205
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,562
to the first person
that you met afterwards,

206
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:54,764
<i>as the law obliges?</i>

207
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,901
In fact, you passed by
several houses

208
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:00,704
before you reported it.

209
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:02,873
I thought the
relatives of the dead man

210
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,207
might be living in them.

211
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:09,846
<i>The law allows
you to pass two houses</i>

212
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:11,948
in such circumstances,

213
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:13,450
but never a third.

214
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,585
You murdered
my brother in cold blood!

215
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,787
It's not true!

216
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:20,257
We argued about
some disputed land.

217
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:21,625
He pulled out a knife.

218
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,294
You wanted
that land for yourself!

219
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,230
<i>You're a liar and a coward.</i>

220
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:29,900
Who says I'm a coward?
I'm not a coward!

221
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:32,636
Silence!

222
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:37,274
<i>As the normal procedures</i>
<i>were not followed,</i>

223
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,577
this killing cannot be
atoned for

224
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:43,179
by compensating
the victim's family.

225
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:47,317
Murder is a dishonorable deed
amongst our people.

226
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:51,321
Carried out in secret,
unacknowledged,

227
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:52,789
and likely to give rise

228
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,091
to a series of revenge killings

229
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,427
that would involve
your own family.

230
00:18:57,528 --> 00:19:03,433
Lord, you knew about that land.
<i>You knew I had a claim to it...</i>

231
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:04,634
enough!

232
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:08,872
<i>I ask you to look</i>
<i>to the accused.</i>

233
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:12,976
If you think that he is guilty,

234
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:14,511
raise your arms.

235
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:29,993
The decision must be unanimous.

236
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:42,706
Eric Trygvasson,

237
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:46,176
<i>you have been found guilty</i>
<i>of murder.</i>

238
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:47,911
Yes! Justice!

239
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,247
How do you wish to die?

240
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:54,951
By beheading, lord.

241
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,021
Your wish is granted.

242
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,857
You shall be executed tomorrow.

243
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:05,562
After which we will shall feast
and talk about the summer raids.

244
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:26,516
You have to.

245
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,159
Yeah! Yeah!

246
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:10,093
<i>Why is he smiling, father?</i>

247
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:14,264
He wants to die
well, without fear,

248
00:21:14,331 --> 00:21:16,499
<i>to atone for his sins.</i>

249
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:28,678
You must watch, for his sake.

250
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:33,383
<i>It's his only hope
of reaching Valhalla.</i>

251
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,200
Feed him to your pigs!

252
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:55,405
And I curse him.

253
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,208
May he never enter Valhalla.

254
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,744
May he never feast
with the gods.

255
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,785
Why did he do that?

256
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:11,321
He should not have done that.

257
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:13,857
<i>Someone told me he
wanted that land for himself</i>

258
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,325
and he knew Trygvasson
had the best claim to it,

259
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:17,260
but refused to sell it.

260
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,231
You hear that, boy?

261
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,399
This how things are done
around here.

262
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,637
<i>Olaf, son of Ingolf,</i>

263
00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:29,506
<i>Bjorn, son of Ragnar.</i>

264
00:22:30,508 --> 00:22:34,144
May you accept this gift
of salt and earth

265
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:36,680
<i>to remind yourself</i>

266
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:40,450
that you belong to both
the land and the sea.

267
00:22:48,392 --> 00:22:51,361
These arm rings bind you
in loyalty to me,

268
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:53,630
your lord, your chieftain.

269
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:57,033
<i>Any oath that you swear</i>
<i>on these rings</i>

270
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:59,502
<i>must be honored and kept.</i>

271
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:01,204
<i>Do you understand</i>
<i>and swear to this?</i>

272
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:03,173
Yes, lord.

273
00:23:03,274 --> 00:23:05,208
And do you
freely give your fealty to me,

274
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:07,177
your lord, your chieftain?

275
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:08,678
Yes, lord.

276
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:12,249
Good.

277
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,517
You may put on the arm rings.

278
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,193
Come here.

279
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,443
<i>Wooooo!</i>

280
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:50,921
Let us feast!

281
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:52,122
My lord,

282
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:55,525
<i>we all want to feast,</i>

283
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:57,093
but we also want to know

284
00:23:57,194 --> 00:23:58,428
where we will be raiding
this summer.

285
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,164
Can't it wait, Ragnar?

286
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,100
<i>No. Tell us.</i>

287
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:06,303
We want to know.

288
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,238
We have a right to know.

289
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:09,940
<i>Very well.</i>

290
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,576
<i>We will raid east again,</i>
<i>to the Eastlands,</i>

291
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:14,577
and into Russia.

292
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:17,480
Every year

293
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,683
we go to the same places!

294
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:25,155
But there is an alternative...

295
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,259
If you choose.

296
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,665
Oh yes, yes. Choice, yes.

297
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,502
I have heard of these rumors,
these stories;

298
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,471
That if we travel west,

299
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:43,340
<i>that we will somehow</i>
<i>reach a land</i>

300
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,475
<i>that is rich and plentiful.</i>

301
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,081
But I tell you that
I will not risk my ships

302
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:52,248
or my reputation

303
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,452
on such a deluded fantasy.

304
00:24:57,588 --> 00:25:00,256
They are my ships -
I pay for them...

305
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:03,259
and they go where
I tell them to go.

306
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:06,262
Now that's the end
of the matter.

307
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:11,668
Let's feast!

308
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:28,284
<i>Let me see!</i>

309
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:31,688
<i>It's a fine ring.</i>

310
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,496
Ragnar Lothbrok,

311
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,066
<i>Earl Haraldson wants to</i>
<i>speak with you...</i>

312
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,167
in private.

313
00:25:46,971 --> 00:25:48,972
<i>Stay with your Uncle.</i>

314
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:02,685
Ragnar Lothbrok...

315
00:26:06,624 --> 00:26:07,757
Sit down.

316
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:15,331
Are you hungry?

317
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:18,068
Yes, lord.

318
00:26:23,107 --> 00:26:25,642
You want to feast in my hall?

319
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:28,011
You want to sail in my ships?

320
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:30,313
Anything else you want from me?

321
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:32,715
Lord...

322
00:26:32,817 --> 00:26:36,019
You keep
talking about the west...

323
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,954
what do you know of it, hmm?

324
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,252
Why are you so certain

325
00:26:40,377 --> 00:26:43,311
that it's a land
of great riches, hmm?

326
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:46,196
<i>I can't be sure.</i>

327
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:47,263
But I believe that...

328
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:50,600
I don't care what you believe.

329
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:53,236
You insulted me out there,

330
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:56,206
and not for the first time,

331
00:26:56,307 --> 00:27:00,443
but, believe me,
it will be the last.

332
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:10,520
<i>Who told you you could go?</i>

333
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:18,791
You are a farmer.

334
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:22,999
You should be content
with your lot.

335
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:27,871
Farms are few
and in great demand,

336
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:31,307
and there are many people here

337
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:35,044
who would like to possess
your land.

338
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:39,182
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

339
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:42,519
I understand.

340
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:47,590
Then don't ever stick your nose
in my face again.

341
00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:05,233
I don't trust him. Watch him.

342
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:17,877
<i>Where are they?</i>

343
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:19,445
Where are my sons?

344
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:21,781
You said you'd found them.

345
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:09,428
<i>Where are we going now?
I'm so tired.</i>

346
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:12,665
<i>To talk to the gods.</i>

347
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:14,200
It's what we do.

348
00:29:25,212 --> 00:29:28,214
Why don't you come in?
I'm waiting.

349
00:29:34,387 --> 00:29:35,688
Sit.

350
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,529
What do you want?

351
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,633
I want to know what
the gods have in store.

352
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:48,634
<i>For you...</i>

353
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:50,636
Or for the boy?

354
00:29:51,738 --> 00:29:54,373
I'm more interested in myself.

355
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:58,177
The gods desire you
to have a great future.

356
00:29:58,278 --> 00:29:59,712
I see that.

357
00:30:00,914 --> 00:30:02,548
But they can withdraw
their goodwill

358
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:03,649
at any time.

359
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:08,454
<i>To have this great future,</i>

360
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:10,656
must I challenge the law?

361
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:15,527
You must convince
the gods to alter the runes

362
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:19,164
so they work in your favor.

363
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,868
But the laws of men

364
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:27,339
are far below the workings
and shapings of the gods.

365
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:33,545
So I should take
the laws of men

366
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:35,614
into my own hands?

367
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:41,220
Answer me.

368
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:43,689
You already have your answer.

369
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,790
No I don't.

370
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:50,329
<i>Well, then go
and ask the gods yourself.</i>

371
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,331
What are you afraid of?

372
00:30:59,973 --> 00:31:01,573
<i>Wait outside.</i>

373
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:04,009
<i>All right.</i>

374
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:07,112
You haven't helped me at all,
ancient one.

375
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:13,619
Perhaps you asked
the wrong questions.

376
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,541
We have someone
special to visit.

377
00:31:35,642 --> 00:31:37,710
His name is Floki.

378
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:39,244
<i>Floki?</i>

379
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:40,813
Like loki the God?

380
00:31:42,082 --> 00:31:44,516
Yes, only different.

381
00:31:45,618 --> 00:31:47,519
How is he different?

382
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,954
He's not a God.

383
00:31:49,956 --> 00:31:52,558
Why didn't he come
to the thing?

384
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,426
Because...

385
00:31:55,428 --> 00:31:56,528
Because he's shy.

386
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:04,903
<i>Floki,</i>

387
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:07,172
this is my son, Bjorn.

388
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,540
<i>Hello.</i>

389
00:32:08,608 --> 00:32:10,209
How are you?

390
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,611
Well. Thank you, sir.

391
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
Let me see.

392
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:18,250
Ah!

393
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:21,520
You have your father's eyes...

394
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:23,188
Unfortunately.

395
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,225
Why unfortunately?

396
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,527
It means he will be like you,

397
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:31,363
and therefore he will want
to do better than you,

398
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:32,831
and you will hate him for it.

399
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:39,104
How can you tell that
by just looking at my face?

400
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:41,340
Oh, it's the same with trees.

401
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:43,909
I can tell which trees
will make the best planks

402
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:46,245
just by looking at them.

403
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:49,269
I can look inside the tree.

404
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,684
<i>Floki is a boat-builder...</i>

405
00:32:52,786 --> 00:32:54,053
Among other things.

406
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:22,915
Hmm...

407
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:27,286
This is one.

408
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:31,557
Inside this tree are two
almost perfect planks.

409
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:34,159
They will bend, then curve,

410
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,160
like a woman's body

411
00:33:35,261 --> 00:33:36,662
from the thighs to the back.

412
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:40,165
When I split this tree
I will find them.

413
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,635
You can see that?

414
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:48,740
Do you think I'm joking?

415
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:02,187
I joke about many things,

416
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:04,189
son of Ragnar,

417
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,758
but never about ship-building.

418
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,864
Do you imagine ships
are just dead things?

419
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,366
<i>So... what about our boat?</i>

420
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:21,440
<i>It will be lighter
and carry a bigger sail.</i>

421
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:22,975
The construction is different.

422
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:25,043
It's built with
a strong central plank.

423
00:34:25,111 --> 00:34:26,245
The two strakes above it
are nailed

424
00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:28,080
directly onto the knees
of the frame.

425
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:30,149
But the ones below - look!...

426
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,650
are cleated and lashed
onto the frames,

427
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:32,751
not nailed,

428
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:35,220
so they can move in relation
to each other.

429
00:34:35,288 --> 00:34:37,823
This means the boat won't butt
against the waves like a goat,

430
00:34:37,924 --> 00:34:39,958
but move over them
like a ripple.

431
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:41,426
Hmm.

432
00:34:41,528 --> 00:34:43,629
<i>The hull is deeper. How
will my men set their oars?</i>

433
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:45,597
<i>I will cut them
into the sheerstrakes,</i>

434
00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:48,000
<i>and the ports can be closed</i>
<i>when the boat is at sea.</i>

435
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:50,102
And you think it could handle
long sea voyages?

436
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:53,605
That's why I'm building it.

437
00:34:55,975 --> 00:34:58,877
But will it be strong enough?

438
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:01,613
We won't know that
until we try.

439
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:05,884
<i>For the anchor.</i>

440
00:35:05,952 --> 00:35:09,188
It's all I have left
from last summer's raids.

441
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:10,923
Don't worry.

442
00:35:11,024 --> 00:35:13,792
We'll soon be as rich
as dwarves!

443
00:35:23,684 --> 00:35:25,184
I missed you.

444
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:35,995
<i>Did anything happen</i>
<i>while we were away?</i>

445
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:40,166
No.

446
00:35:40,267 --> 00:35:41,667
<i>Hmm.</i>

447
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:47,206
Did you miss me?

448
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:55,048
I ached with love longing.

449
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:59,485
My belly was empty of laughter.

450
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:03,589
Is that what you want? Hmm?

451
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:10,530
You want me to make you laugh?

452
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:13,733
I don't want to laugh now.

453
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,038
I want to ride you,
like a bull.

454
00:36:24,912 --> 00:36:26,045
Like a wild bull.

455
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:55,641
Hello, young Bjorn.

456
00:36:55,742 --> 00:36:57,376
Hello, rollo.

457
00:36:57,478 --> 00:36:59,679
Where are your parents?

458
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,781
They are having sex.

459
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,651
Well, uh...

460
00:37:08,722 --> 00:37:11,124
I guess we'll have to wait.

461
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:26,272
So, Gyda,

462
00:37:27,274 --> 00:37:30,009
is your mother teaching you
<i>how to use a shield?</i>

463
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:33,412
Yes, I know how
to use a shield.

464
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:36,015
Your mother was a famous
shield-maiden.

465
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:37,016
<i>Was?</i>

466
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:39,852
Is a famous shield-maiden.

467
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:41,053
<i>Come on, children, to bed.</i>

468
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:41,988
<i>Do I have to?</i>

469
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:43,289
Let's leave the men.

470
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,791
But I'm a man. I have a ring.

471
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:47,527
<i>Let him stay awhile.</i>

472
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:48,628
To bed!

473
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:53,399
<i>Say good night.</i>

474
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,034
Good night, my children.

475
00:37:57,137 --> 00:37:58,037
Good night.

476
00:37:58,138 --> 00:37:59,138
<i>Hey!</i>

477
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:03,676
Shhhaaaaaa!

478
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:15,188
Tell me your news.

479
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:17,290
What about the boat?

480
00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:19,125
It's nearly ready.

481
00:38:21,328 --> 00:38:24,330
I won't go under your command.

482
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:29,635
I won't go
unless we're all equal.

483
00:38:29,736 --> 00:38:32,138
<i>We are brothers.</i>

484
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,309
You and I will always be equal.

485
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,750
Then we must find a crew.

486
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:49,622
Not many men will go against
the wishes of Haraldson.

487
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:51,524
Many will be afraid,

488
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:56,195
some may even go to him
and betray us.

489
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:00,132
I must go piss.

490
00:39:34,134 --> 00:39:36,102
Yesterday, I was
with a girl from the town.

491
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:37,270
Thank you.

492
00:39:38,272 --> 00:39:40,273
A good-looking girl too.

493
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:49,649
But when she shouted out
in pleasure,

494
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,184
I didn't see,

495
00:39:54,254 --> 00:39:55,888
I saw yours.

496
00:39:58,558 --> 00:39:59,892
Lagertha...

497
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:03,429
Don't talk like that.

498
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,197
<i>Why not?</i>

499
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,102
I think about you all the time.

500
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:12,104
That's too bad.

501
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,542
Don't insult me, shield-maiden.

502
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:17,710
No.

503
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:20,179
I would never insult you.

504
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,181
You're too great a warrior...

505
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,921
But perhaps not so great a man.

506
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,859
I saw something.

507
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:09,128
What did you see?

508
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:12,164
A sign.

509
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:18,504
It made me certain
we're doing the right thing.

510
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:26,812
Good night, brother.

511
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:47,666
Set the sail.

512
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,170
Floki! The sail!

513
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:53,572
She'll sink.

514
00:41:53,673 --> 00:41:54,940
No she bloody won't!

515
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:58,244
<i>I shouldn't have
pretended to build such a boat.</i>

516
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:00,646
It's beyond
my humble capabilities.

517
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:04,116
I'll set the sail.

518
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:05,918
Floki I'm sorry, Ragnar.

519
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:08,421
I've wasted all your money.
It was all a joke.

520
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:10,523
<i>Shut up, man.</i>

521
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:34,380
Ha!

522
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:42,121
Now it runs on its cool keel.

523
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:43,989
<i>Oh, it's beautiful.</i>

524
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,991
Why didn't you believe me?

525
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,793
I told you I could do it!

526
00:42:51,331 --> 00:42:52,264
<i>Ah?</i>

527
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:55,434
Now it's all up to you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

528
