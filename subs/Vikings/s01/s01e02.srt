1
00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:01,647
Last season on Vikings.

2
00:00:01,707 --> 00:00:03,540
One day, the whole world

3
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:07,883
will know and fear Ivar, the Boneless.

4
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:10,180
You must seek revenge.

5
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:12,116
We want blood-revenge against Aelle.

6
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:14,017
Not only against Aelle.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,648
King Ecbert offered our father
up like a sacrifice.

8
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:18,951
Ecbert's kingdom is vast.

9
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,385
How do we overcome it?

10
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:23,736
In the name of our dead father,
in the name of Ragnar Lothbrok,

11
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,343
we declare war on the whole world.

12
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:36,111
This is the time of war!

13
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,336
This is the time to hate!

14
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,039
Charge!

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,854
We are defeated.

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,446
I will renounce the crown in your favor.

17
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,815
You save yourself and your family,

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,573
and take back what is yours.

19
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,021
To the great hall!

20
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,291
Who paid for your army?

21
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:04,329
I was paid by King Harald Finehair.

22
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,500
I will give you legal claim
to the Kingdom of East Anglia.

23
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,468
I accept your offer of land.

24
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,770
But for what you did to my father...

25
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,772
You must die.

26
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,852
The only thing that kept
the sons of Ragnar together

27
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,043
was the death of their father.

28
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,045
And now I feel free to follow my destiny.

29
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,014
But, my brothers will be here for you.

30
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:25,783
We are all the sons of Ragnar.
We have to stick together.

31
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,252
We have a great army
and we should use it.

32
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:29,844
You cannot lead the army, Ivar.

33
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,845
Who among you will follow me?

34
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:33,991
I do not want to follow you, Ivar.

35
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,225
You are crazy.

36
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:36,827
Ivar! No!

37
00:01:56,115 --> 00:02:00,551
♪ More, give me more, give me more

38
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:07,176
♪ If I had a heart, I could love you

39
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:10,836

00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:01,938
I know what you're all thinking.

44
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:04,173
But it is not true!

45
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:07,009
I didn't mean to kill him.

46
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,813
He made me kill him.

47
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:15,751
He taunted me. He made fun of me.

48
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,020
What was I supposed to do?

49
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:21,203
What kind of a man

50
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,693
taunts and tells lies
about his own brother?

51
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:26,062
And what lies did he tell?

52
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:28,729
Well, you know that
as well as I do, Hvitserk.

53
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:30,254
He said you weren't a real man.

54
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:38,440
And what would you have done

55
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:40,399
if he had said that to you, Ubbe?

56
00:04:41,838 --> 00:04:44,839
What would you have done
if you were "a real man"?

57
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,020
I swear to the gods and
everything that is sacred

58
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,045
that I never meant to kill him.

59
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:56,958
Anger overcame me.

60
00:04:58,201 --> 00:04:59,534
And I wasn't thinking.

61
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:02,464
I am truly sorry.

62
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,150
You cannot leave him in charge
of the Great Army.

63
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:24,885
That is your affair, Ubbe.

64
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:27,254
You're his big brother.

65
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:29,524
You take charge.

66
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:32,059
I told you, this is none of my concern.

67
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:34,128
I plan to return to the Mediterranean...

68
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:39,266
With Halfdan.

69
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:44,071
Will you return first to Kattegat?

70
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:47,407
I have no intention of doing that.

71
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,205
My fate is too urgent.

72
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:54,067
Then I will go there.

73
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,074
And I will tell Lagertha about

74
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,099
the avenging of your father's death

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,967
and the defeat of the Saxons.

76
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,226
And the great gift of land to our people.

77
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:09,063
And tell my mother,

78
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:12,332
and Torvi and the children

79
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:14,934
that I think of them,

80
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:18,037
and I will return...

81
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:22,041
If the gods will it.

82
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:24,010
Skol.

83
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:25,745
Skol.

84
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:01,280
This place is full of ghostly memories.

85
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:04,339
God help those who did this.

86
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:06,985
If King Ecbert's body is here,
let us find it!

87
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:09,388
Yes, Your Grace!

88
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:12,268
Spread out!

89
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:14,860
Captain! Call your men forward!

90
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:16,762
Search through there!

91
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:20,932
Look for signs of life!

92
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:22,434
Can we make a search through here?

93
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,070
Bring some more men!

94
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,106
Yes! Five more!

95
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,475
Forward!

96
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:33,110
Tie it up!

97
00:07:36,783 --> 00:07:38,282
Time for food!

98
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,986
We need to hurry!

99
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:44,422
Put those in the front.

100
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:45,890
Take this! Be careful!

101
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,094
- Do you have it?
- Another turn!

102
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:51,228
Don't go away!

103
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,529
You are sure?

104
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,033
I don't understand why
you want to split with me.

105
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:59,504
We're brothers. We belong together.

106
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:01,404
We've always had the same dream.

107
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:04,374
No. It's your dream.

108
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:06,977
You want to be King of Norway.

109
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,713
I don't have a dream
about being the brother

110
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,281
of the King of Norway.

111
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,951
Then what is your dream?

112
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,954
I want to travel.

113
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:20,190
I mean, what is your ambition?

114
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,938
You have ambition enough
for the both of us, brother.

115
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:25,393
I'm a simple fellow.

116
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:27,864
Traveling to the ends of the known world,

117
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,065
that's enough for me!

118
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:34,904
I will miss you.

119
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:41,276
Everyone needs a brother
to cover their back.

120
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,114
I'll still do that.

121
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:48,283
Wherever I am.

122
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:04,065
Go to your new boyfriend!
Be happy together!

123
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,805
Tides are turning. We have to leave.

124
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,453
On the left.

125
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,823
Only if we can use it!

126
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:32,059
May as well pull it down.

127
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:33,994
- Keep searching.
- We need a fire!

128
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,763
It's destroyed, it's no good.

129
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:37,031
Salvage what you can!

130
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:38,165
Pull it down!

131
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,633
We might be able to use that!

132
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:58,251
I think we've found our King.

133
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,165
Godforsaken people.

134
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:15,535
Look what they've done.

135
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:31,652
We must clean and restore this place,

136
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:34,075
despoiled by those heathen barbarians.

137
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,457
Tell the people who fled from
here that it's safe to return.

138
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,992
Yes, Your Grace.

139
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:45,031
Hyah! Hyah!

140
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,432
Hah!

141
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:48,601
Hyah!

142
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:53,539
Walk on!

143
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:58,544
Ah...

144
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:08,254
Floki!

145
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:11,057
Why are you building a toy boat? Huh?

146
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,126
It's not a toy.

147
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:16,295
It's a one-man boat.

148
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:21,567
I don't need the help of
anyone to sail it.

149
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:24,036
And where do you think
you're going to sail it to?

150
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,708
To where the gods decide.

151
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:36,448
I don't want you to go.

152
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:40,085
I still need you in the fight
against the Christians.

153
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:43,021
My brothers are too soft
and you know that, Floki.

154
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:52,197
Please?

155
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:00,739
My brothers...

156
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:08,046
They don't believe that I
didn't mean to kill Sigurd.

157
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:12,150
But I didn't want to. He was my brother.

158
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,053
Hmm?

159
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:18,223
That is why you cannot leave.

160
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:24,095
I will be too lonely.

161
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,605
I have to leave, Ivar.

162
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:39,343
With Helga gone, there's
nothing left for me here.

163
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,781
This world no longer interests me.

164
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:47,417
That's why I will submit myself

165
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:48,909
to the tides and the winds,

166
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,333
and the will of the gods,

167
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:52,623
come what may.

168
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:57,861
My heart is broken.

169
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:02,232
It will repair.

170
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,704
Ivar, the Boneless.

171
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:11,841
Scourge of the world, hmm?

172
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:14,510
You don't need me.

173
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:26,356
Bring out the oars!

174
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:35,298
Good luck!

175
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,901
- Good luck!
- Safe return!

176
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,272
Gods be with you!

177
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,844
Row! Keep the pace!

178
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:49,279
May Thor be at your side!

179
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,043
And so we commit the body of Ecbert,

180
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:24,179
King of Mercia and Wessex, Bretwalda,

181
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,081
King of Kings, to the earth.

182
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:28,483
As the Lord sayeth,

183
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:31,286
"I am the Resurrection and I am the Life.

184
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:34,565
"He who believes in me
though he is dead will live on.

185
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:37,204
"He who has life and his faith in me,

186
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:38,945
"to all eternity

187
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:42,416
"will not die." Amen.

188
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,298
Amen.

189
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,297
Why did the Northmen let you live?

190
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:52,106
I don't know.

191
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,542
I suppose they weren't interested in me.

192
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,178
So when I had a chance,
I ran away and hid.

193
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,048
And what purpose did you serve here?

194
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:04,085
I transcribed and witnessed

195
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:07,121
the treaty between King Ecbert
and the sons of Ragnar,

196
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,757
whereby they were granted the title

197
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,147
to the lands of East Anglia.

198
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,162
Even as he feared death,

199
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,432
King Ecbert should have never
sold part of his inheritance

200
00:15:18,457 --> 00:15:19,790
to those pagans.

201
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:22,302
He didn't.

202
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:24,538
What do you mean?

203
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,173
It wasn't his to sell.

204
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,545
You had best explain yourself.

205
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:37,384
Before he sent his family
away, King Ecbert

206
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:41,422
renounced his crown in favor
of his son, Prince Aethelwulf.

207
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,468
Then Aethelwulf is King,

208
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,904
and the grant of land worthless.

209
00:15:58,006 --> 00:15:59,105
Yes.

210
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:01,041
The King is dead.

211
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:04,644
Long live the King.

212
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:23,929
They need to dry here.

213
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:25,397
Take that one.

214
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:37,542
I would use these nets.

215
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:42,414
Edgar!

216
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:30,995
How is he?

217
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:43,948
Alfred.

218
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:49,286
Is he dying?

219
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:55,719
I don't know.

220
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:01,659
I don't know.

221
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:14,571
It's just as the Holy Father said.

222
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:17,941
God has sent the Northmen
here to scourge us,

223
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:19,909
punish us for all our vanity,

224
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:24,086
all our wickedness, all our
abominable iniquities.

225
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,432
And how can you be so sure, Aethelwulf?

226
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:34,491
Because there's no other
way to understand

227
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:35,748
what's happened to us.

228
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:42,198
- None.
- Oh, of course.

229
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,100
Of course, God!

230
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:48,037
Alfred must... Must die for our sins?

231
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,194
For my sins!

232
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:52,274
No!

233
00:18:54,191 --> 00:18:57,460
No one is without sin, Judith.

234
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,649
And I can only pray

235
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:02,585
that our Lord chooses to be
merciful to us,

236
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:05,054
and bless us,

237
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:08,324
and cause His face
to shine upon us again.

238
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:41,492
You were planning to leave

239
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,327
without telling us, Floki, huh?

240
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,969
I wanted to spare you the
trouble of trying to stop me.

241
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:54,605
But we will anyway.

242
00:19:58,343 --> 00:19:59,376
And you can't.

243
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:03,980
So let us just say farewell
properly instead.

244
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:06,016
Where are you going?

245
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,452
Wherever the gods will take me.

246
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:11,354
But as long as I live and breathe,

247
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:13,223
you,

248
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:15,459
the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok,

249
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:17,016
will always be close to my heart.

250
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:27,103
- Farewell, Floki.
- Hmm.

251
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,472
You are the greatest boat
builder of all time.

252
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,198
Farewell, Floki.

253
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:38,048
Beloved by the gods.

254
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:49,259
You knock-kneed fool.

255
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,014
Stay.

256
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:55,431
We need you just as much
as our father needed you,

257
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:57,990
but instead you choose to
run away, you coward.

258
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,937
Stand up and say that to my face!

259
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:20,189
I will see you again.

260
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,424
Is it true he has completely

261
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,048
committed himself to the sea?

262
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:27,596
Do not worry.

263
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:30,132
I have given him
the means to guide himself.

264
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:34,236
We do not want him to be lost.

265
00:21:40,478 --> 00:21:42,011
Let Odin guide you!

266
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:50,419
Floki! Farewell!

267
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,590
All hail Floki!

268
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:57,459
All hail Floki!

269
00:21:57,561 --> 00:22:01,662
All hail Floki!

270
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:13,007
All hail Floki! All hail Floki!

271
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:27,413
Ecbert, our martyred king,

272
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,623
hear my prayer.

273
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:32,060
Let the wrath of God fall
upon these heathens

274
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:34,651
who desecrate the holy places
of our land.

275
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,364
Let them suffer at our hands.

276
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:39,967
Slaughter them in battle.

277
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:43,203
Cut them down like
the ears of corn at harvest.

278
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,724
Let us rejoice in their ruin,

279
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:50,352
and drive them back into
the sea from whence they came.

280
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,512
And let God's holy church arm itself

281
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,436
against these worshippers of the devil.

282
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,284
And let this war never end,

283
00:22:57,538 --> 00:22:59,538
until not a single pagan lives

284
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:01,121
or breathes.

285
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:05,125
Ecbert, martyr,

286
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:06,627
hear my prayer.

287
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:07,805
Hear my prayer.

288
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,329
Hallelujah.

289
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,713
Do not be afraid.

290
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:30,282
Christ is here.

291
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:32,652
You are safe.

292
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:36,889
Your Grace. Your Grace.

293
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:39,258
Your Grace.

294
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:42,528
Your Grace. Thank you.

295
00:23:43,564 --> 00:23:44,763
Thank you.

296
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:47,332
God bless you, Bishop Heahmund.

297
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:48,667
God bless you.

298
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,338
Your Grace.

299
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,873
Bless you, Your Grace. Bless you.

300
00:23:58,211 --> 00:24:00,578
Speaking for our father,
I think we should claim

301
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:03,103
and settle the land
given to us by Ecbert.

302
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:05,416
The Saxons are in disarray.

303
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,418
This is a good opportunity.

304
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:11,123
We have the resources to
make a permanent settlement.

305
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:13,725
Good.

306
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,661
Do you agree, Ivar?

307
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:18,165
I don't want to disband the army.

308
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:21,432
In fact, I want to continue
the war against the Saxons

309
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:23,690
while we are still in
a position of strength.

310
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,437
My suggestion is that we go back north,

311
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,139
to where we defeated Aelle.

312
00:24:29,476 --> 00:24:32,577
We should establish
a permanent camp, as you say,

313
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,381
but near the coast, from where
we can raid wherever we want.

314
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:42,853
Our father's dream was that
we wouldn't be just raiders.

315
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:45,323
That we would behave in a different way.

316
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:49,096
You're not listening, Ubbe.
We have to have a stronghold.

317
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:53,463
If we go north,
we are closer to our own lands

318
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:56,103
and shipping routes.

319
00:24:56,535 --> 00:24:59,135
We can build an impregnable fortress.

320
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:00,704
Where?

321
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:03,540
I've heard of a town called York.

322
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:07,821
It is built on a major river,

323
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,846
and it is not far from the sea.

324
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:13,450
And I think that we should take it.

325
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:17,487
No. It would seem like a withdrawal.

326
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,323
Yes, yes, it would.

327
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:21,658
But it is only tactical.

328
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:26,096
Surely you understand, Ubbe,

329
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,555
if we establish ourselves
in the middle of the country,

330
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,580
then we are surrounded by enemies.

331
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:33,807
In York, we are nearer home.

332
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:38,507
Right, Hvitserk?

333
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:45,181
I agree with Ivar.

334
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:47,279
We should go north and attack York.

335
00:25:52,991 --> 00:25:54,523
It's good.

336
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,806
Thank you, Ivar.

337
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,599
That the last of them?

338
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:11,338
There's a lady in the church
needs to talk to you.

339
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:20,646
Give us the strength,
which the world cannot give,

340
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:22,348
with Your kindness,

341
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:27,987
with mercy, and under
Thy protection. Amen.

342
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:29,989
For whom do you pray?

343
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:33,218
For all of us, in these terrible times.

344
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:36,729
- What is your name?
- Aethelgyth.

345
00:27:39,934 --> 00:27:41,167
Aethelgyth.

346
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,730
You should consider your own soul.

347
00:27:46,774 --> 00:27:48,707
Will you take Mass at my hands?

348
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:53,712
Then kneel.

349
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,649
Amen.

350
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:39,685
Amen.

351
00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:53,521
Lord, forgive this pitiful
and miserable sinner.

352
00:28:56,636 --> 00:29:00,271
I have sinned in thought and in deed.

353
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:05,042
Please forgive me, three-person God.

354
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,215
Punish me, ravish me!

355
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:13,384
Cleanse me of my sin.

356
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,355
Father.

357
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:21,626
Father.

358
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:28,875
York. Look at her.

359
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:32,048
So ripe for plucking!

360
00:29:32,073 --> 00:29:33,972
And they don't even know that we're here.

361
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,174
I say we attack tomorrow
before they find out.

362
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,976
- Yes.
- Hmm...

363
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,211
Wait.

364
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,113
I remember something our father said.

365
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,349
It was always better to attack
an English town

366
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:47,875
when they are celebrating
one of their Saint's Days.

367
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:49,386
On those days, most of the people

368
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:51,478
will either be in church
or they will be drunk.

369
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:53,636
So how do we find out?

370
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,361
We'll find a way.

371
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:00,798
All right.

372
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:07,162
_

373
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,900
_

374
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:14,770
Hmm?

375
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:23,882
_

376
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:26,815
Er...

377
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:31,821
_

378
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:33,822
_

379
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:45,800
_

380
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,237
_

381
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:16,310
Northmen! Ready your bows!

382
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:18,817
- The walls!
- Prepare!

383
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:21,455
- Ready.
- Ready your bows!

384
00:32:21,497 --> 00:32:23,064
Stand up, men!

385
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,419
Down!

386
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:31,457
You two, move!

387
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,724
Charge!

388
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,444
Hyah! Hyah!

389
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:35,854
Hyah! Hyah!

390
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:03,164
Shh, shh, shh.

391
00:36:04,502 --> 00:36:07,569
Domine...

392
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:11,940
No!

393
00:36:55,684 --> 00:36:57,251
Hold his head.

394
00:36:57,353 --> 00:36:58,485
Hold it.

395
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,868
_

396
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,523
Horse!

397
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:40,326
Hyah! Hyah!

398
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:04,806
To you, my brothers.

399
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:07,475
And to our town of York.

400
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:10,445
To York.

401
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,316
And to all our brothers,

402
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,185
not forgetting Sigurd.

403
00:38:28,497 --> 00:38:30,230
To all of us!

404
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,598
Skol.

405
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,171
Skol.

406
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,249
Oh!

407
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:35,694
Enough. Enough.

408
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,433
Oh!

409
00:39:41,903 --> 00:39:44,303
You are almost too
strong for me, Guthrum.

410
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:47,440
You need someone else to train with.

411
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:51,310
You must remember your father
was a great warrior.

412
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:53,146
He still is a very great warrior.

413
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:54,713
I don't mean Bjorn.

414
00:39:54,815 --> 00:39:57,116
I mean your real father, Jarl Borg.

415
00:39:57,218 --> 00:39:59,419
It is a name you must be
proud of, and never forget.

416
00:40:00,422 --> 00:40:02,755
And even though Ragnar killed him,

417
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:04,623
I know in my heart
that they are now fighting

418
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:06,314
and feasting together in Valhalla.

419
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:09,795
Ships!

420
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,842
Who are they?

421
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:29,682
I have to warn Lagertha.

422
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,978
Queen Lagertha, I bring wonderful news.

423
00:41:36,382 --> 00:41:39,517
The Great Army, led by
your son Bjorn Ironside,

424
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:43,987
succeeded in avenging the
death of Ragnar Lothbrok.

425
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:47,657
Both King Aelle and King Ecbert are dead,

426
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:50,593
but not before King Ecbert
gave us a great gift of land

427
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:53,496
for future settlement.

428
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:58,401
You've done well to tell
me this, King Harald.

429
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:00,736
But why did my son not bring the news?

430
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:03,606
- Is he dead?
- Oh, no.

431
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,676
Of Ragnar's sons, only Sigurd is dead,

432
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:10,046
killed by his own brother, Ivar.

433
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:20,756
Then I ask again, why is Bjorn not here?

434
00:42:22,026 --> 00:42:24,393
He told everyone he wished to sail

435
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,184
straight back to the Mediterranean,

436
00:42:26,363 --> 00:42:30,465
and asked me to convey
his respects to you,

437
00:42:30,568 --> 00:42:33,368
his mother, and to Torvi,

438
00:42:34,405 --> 00:42:36,505
the mother of his children.

439
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:43,004
Now tell me why you've really
come here, King Harald.

440
00:42:44,615 --> 00:42:45,914
I told you.

441
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,650
Since your own son

442
00:42:48,675 --> 00:42:51,009
refused to bring you
the news of our affairs,

443
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:53,622
I thought I should do it.

444
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:59,894
And I thought that perhaps you
wanted to find out how well

445
00:42:59,919 --> 00:43:02,319
Egil the bastard had served you.

446
00:43:05,568 --> 00:43:08,069
Perhaps you expected to find him here,

447
00:43:09,372 --> 00:43:10,772
sat upon the throne,

448
00:43:12,142 --> 00:43:14,508
keeping it warm for you?

449
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:19,948
Perhaps I did.

450
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:31,359
The truth can be a bad choice
for a wise man.

451
00:43:35,464 --> 00:43:38,866
I have never been accused of being wise.

452
00:43:38,968 --> 00:43:42,335
Even so, I never took you for a fool.

453
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,794
But you know what they say,

454
00:43:43,973 --> 00:43:47,975
"If a fool persists in his
folly, he can become wise."

455
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,780
The gods may not give you the time.

456
00:43:57,153 --> 00:43:58,685
I cannot blame the gods.

457
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:01,621
They gave me so much else.

458
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:04,124
So much else.

459
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:14,901
I'm happy to die.

460
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:26,145
Don't be afraid.

461
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:28,981
Strike.

462
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:34,821
Strike!

463
00:44:38,026 --> 00:44:39,158
Strike!

464
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:56,033
Ah!

465
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,575
Your Grace.

466
00:46:05,677 --> 00:46:07,011
I have news.

467
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:08,412
We know where the Northmen are.

468
00:46:08,514 --> 00:46:09,579
They're at York.

469
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:12,149
They captured the town
with great slaughter.

470
00:46:12,251 --> 00:46:14,584
They murdered Bishop Cynebert
most horribly.

471
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:22,893
Then we know what we must do
to them in return.

472
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,924
You have confessed your guilt.

473
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:56,058
Yes.

474
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,660
So that all could hear.

475
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,196
Then tell me why I should not kill you.

476
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,768
You have no reason to kill me.

477
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:09,104
No reason?

478
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:15,678
Do I not have half a reason?

479
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:20,850
No.

480
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,187
Everything has changed.

481
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:27,912
I did what I did because of a woman.

482
00:47:28,826 --> 00:47:32,995
She refused to marry me unless
I became King of all Norway.

483
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:37,099
So that was my idea.

484
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:38,957
That was my passion.

485
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:44,539
I loved her, you see.

486
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:45,830
So,

487
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,809
I tried to take your kingdom.

488
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:49,935
I had nothing against you.

489
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:51,913
It was just to be worthy of her.

490
00:47:51,938 --> 00:47:53,737
Then why has everything changed?

491
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:56,118
Because she lied to me.

492
00:47:58,655 --> 00:48:00,989
She couldn't wait for me
to become King of Norway.

493
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,892
She married a Danish Earl instead.

494
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:05,793
And what did you do?

495
00:48:07,664 --> 00:48:08,763
I killed her.

496
00:48:10,443 --> 00:48:12,310
And now that she is dead,

497
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:17,705
I no longer have any
intentions to attack Kattegat

498
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,198
or try to remove you as its ruler.

499
00:48:24,714 --> 00:48:28,115
So then, what are your intentions?

500
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,542
I want to offer you
my friendship and alliance.

501
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:32,844
Look at you.

502
00:48:33,356 --> 00:48:35,757
Do you think you are in a
position to offer me anything?

503
00:48:35,782 --> 00:48:37,915
I'm still a King!

504
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:41,068
With lordship over many kingdoms.

505
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,797
And I am Queen!

506
00:48:43,822 --> 00:48:44,969
Indeed.

507
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:48,869
And I know, above all people,

508
00:48:48,894 --> 00:48:56,132
how vulnerable Kattegat and its
beautiful Queen has become.

509
00:48:56,311 --> 00:48:59,980
After all, your son
might be away for a long time.

510
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:04,117
And how much do you trust
the other sons of Ragnar?

511
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:08,989
Do they still not desire vengeance
for their mother's death?

512
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:11,825
Or imagine themselves as Kings here?

513
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:17,597
And what would you want
in return for this alliance?

514
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:20,866
You have no man in your life,
and I no woman.

515
00:49:22,804 --> 00:49:26,038
Perhaps that's one answer
to your question.

516
00:49:32,246 --> 00:49:34,680
Do you really think, "King" Harald,

517
00:49:34,782 --> 00:49:38,784
that I would prostrate myself
at your feet,

518
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,978
and offer thanks to the Gods that
you would deign to be my husband?

519
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,215
And that I should be grateful

520
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,942
for you that you would offer
to come to my bed?

521
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,825
In all your glory?

522
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:00,772
Hmm?

523
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:11,517
What...

524
00:50:12,486 --> 00:50:14,453
What are you doing, woman?

525
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:31,427
Let us through.

526
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,498
Do you know who we are?

527
00:51:38,536 --> 00:51:39,969
We know who you are.

528
00:51:42,006 --> 00:51:43,206
What do you want?

529
00:51:43,307 --> 00:51:44,473
I want to speak to my brother Ivar.

530
00:51:44,575 --> 00:51:46,008
Now, get out of my way.

531
00:51:46,111 --> 00:51:47,977
I'll ask him and see if it's all right.

532
00:51:49,347 --> 00:51:51,513
No, you won't.

533
00:51:51,616 --> 00:51:53,983
Because you will not have
a tongue to ask him with.

534
00:51:55,053 --> 00:51:57,086
I will nail you to that post
just over there.

535
00:51:59,023 --> 00:52:00,156
Do you understand?

536
00:52:21,356 --> 00:52:23,088
Ubbe! Hvitserk!

537
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:27,849
Did you take a look around?

538
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:30,229
The work on strengthening
the defenses is going well.

539
00:52:30,254 --> 00:52:32,621
Why do you need
a personal bodyguard, Ivar?

540
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:34,122
What?

541
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:35,423
We were just stopped by your bodyguards.

542
00:52:35,448 --> 00:52:37,048
Why do you need them?

543
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:39,261
Hmm? Do you need protection against us?

544
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:40,385
Against your brothers?

545
00:52:41,198 --> 00:52:42,430
Of course not.

546
00:52:42,532 --> 00:52:43,698
Then why have them?

547
00:52:44,501 --> 00:52:45,867
I'm a cripple.

548
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:47,481
I need a bodyguard.

549
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:50,939
It's not just the bodyguard, Ivar.

550
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:54,655
The fact is, you never seem
to consult us about anything.

551
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:58,246
It's as if you think you are now
the leader of our Great Army.

552
00:53:05,522 --> 00:53:06,988
Do you think you are the leader?

553
00:53:07,624 --> 00:53:09,253
No, I don't.

554
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:12,092
Why would I ever think such a thing?

555
00:53:12,195 --> 00:53:15,592
I'm glad to hear you say that
because you are not the leader.

556
00:53:16,132 --> 00:53:18,132
We three brothers
are the leaders together.

557
00:53:18,234 --> 00:53:20,034
- Mmm.
- As our father would have wished.

558
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:21,859
We are older than you, Ivar.

559
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,181
You can't push us aside.

560
00:53:23,206 --> 00:53:24,905
It's unacceptable.

561
00:53:25,007 --> 00:53:27,709
No, you're right, Hvitserk.

562
00:53:29,278 --> 00:53:30,578
But you two have to understand

563
00:53:30,603 --> 00:53:35,153
that it is harder for me to
share and to stake my claim.

564
00:53:36,162 --> 00:53:37,662
I truly want to be your equal

565
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:41,021
but in order for me to do so,
I have to do better than you.

566
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:46,790
I have to make you forget
that I'm a cripple.

567
00:53:47,229 --> 00:53:49,363
Listen, Ivar, we know what you are.

568
00:53:49,465 --> 00:53:51,498
And we accept what you are.

569
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,334
- Huh.
- It makes no difference to us.

570
00:53:54,436 --> 00:53:55,535
You are just our brother.

571
00:53:55,637 --> 00:53:58,538
Don't try to make us feel sorry for you.

572
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,507
Because, my brother, we never will.

573
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:07,046
There's a large Saxon force
on its way here.

574
00:54:13,622 --> 00:54:15,088
But I thought you'd already know that.

575
00:54:49,132 --> 00:54:50,164
Well?

576
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:51,865
He explained himself.

577
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:53,967
He explained why he tried
to kill all of us?

578
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,408
He was in love.

579
00:54:58,307 --> 00:55:00,974
In any case, he's not in love anymore.

580
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:05,356
He wants to make a deal with us.

581
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:08,814
So you told him we do not make
deals with murderers.

582
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:11,284
I told him it depends on the offer.

583
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:12,572
What is he offering?

584
00:55:13,288 --> 00:55:14,387
Alliance.

585
00:55:16,468 --> 00:55:17,534
Protection.

586
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:18,991
In return for...

587
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:21,361
Marriage.

588
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:25,298
That's it?

589
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,999
Surely you can't entertain that?

590
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:28,178
Doesn't he know who you are?

591
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:30,036
Of course he does, that's the point.

592
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:32,027
I would never let a man like
that get anywhere near me!

593
00:55:32,052 --> 00:55:33,851
You can't be so pure.

594
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:37,011
Sometimes women have to do what women
have to do, just to keep a bit of power.

595
00:55:37,036 --> 00:55:38,588
That is what you say.

596
00:55:38,613 --> 00:55:41,446
There is an element of truth
in what Torvi says.

597
00:55:42,116 --> 00:55:43,248
In any case,

598
00:55:44,385 --> 00:55:46,152
I've no intention of marrying him.

599
00:55:46,253 --> 00:55:47,386
Then you will kill him?

600
00:55:48,422 --> 00:55:49,655
That's none of your business.

601
00:55:49,757 --> 00:55:51,023
You can't set him free!

602
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:53,148
Whatever I decide
is nothing to do with you.

603
00:55:53,327 --> 00:55:55,327
- I was only thinking of you.
- Thank you.

604
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:57,296
But I can think for myself.

605
00:57:03,162 --> 00:57:05,363
Shh.

606
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:10,401
Row.

607
00:57:30,522 --> 00:57:32,622
Get to the boats!

608
00:57:32,724 --> 00:57:34,957
- They've gone!
- Who has gone?

609
00:57:34,982 --> 00:57:36,249
King Harald and his men.

610
00:57:36,428 --> 00:57:38,127
Their boats have gone. They freed him

611
00:57:38,152 --> 00:57:39,385
and killed some of the guards.

612
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:42,078
Where is Astrid?

613
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,113
Astrid?

614
00:57:46,605 --> 00:57:47,604
Hold the rampart!

615
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,082
Row!

616
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,483
No slowing down now!

617
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:02,718
Heave!

618
00:58:08,326 --> 00:58:09,525
Pull! Pull!

619
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:22,171
Go faster!

620
00:58:29,113 --> 00:58:30,246
Why kidnap me?

621
00:58:31,648 --> 00:58:33,514
Oh, you can help me a great deal.

622
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:40,322
You see, I think
Lagertha's years are numbered

623
00:58:40,347 --> 00:58:42,982
as Queen of Kattegat.

624
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,295
And I still have ambitions to rule there.

625
00:58:47,898 --> 00:58:49,130
Pull!

626
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:55,036
I still intend to become
King of all Norway.

627
00:58:55,138 --> 00:58:59,807
Which means I shall take over
Kattegat, among other kingdoms.

628
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,410
But I remain unmarried.

629
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,981
I need a Queen.

630
00:59:05,995 --> 00:59:09,183
I need to breed and produce sons.

631
00:59:09,285 --> 00:59:12,365
You want me to be your Queen?

632
00:59:13,909 --> 00:59:15,109
Why not?

633
00:59:15,824 --> 00:59:17,291
You have to understand.

634
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:19,459
Lagertha has been so good to me.

635
00:59:19,561 --> 00:59:21,127
I owe her everything.

636
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:25,565
Then there is no way that you
will ever agree to marry me?

637
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:27,801
No.

638
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,638
Even if it means you will
become Queen of Norway?

639
00:59:32,052 --> 00:59:34,674
The most powerful woman
in the whole country?

640
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:40,547
Tell me honestly, Astrid,

641
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:44,117
doesn't that appeal to you at all?

642
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:50,356
Doesn't that make your blood
race just a little quicker?

643
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:53,259
Don't your eyes shine
just a little brighter?

644
00:59:54,908 --> 00:59:56,596
Or have I misjudged you?

645
01:00:00,235 --> 01:00:01,568
Pass it down here and pull.

646
01:00:06,374 --> 01:00:07,541
Heave!

647
01:00:21,432 --> 01:00:23,699
Well? What have you to report?

648
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:25,190
The Northmen have been busy

649
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:28,170
repairing and improving the
town's defenses, Your Grace.

650
01:00:28,272 --> 01:00:29,704
They are an industrious people.

651
01:00:29,806 --> 01:00:32,340
They are pagans and devils.
Nothing more. Go on.

652
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:34,242
The town is well defended.

653
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:37,078
Begging your pardon, but Your Grace
may not yet be strong enough

654
01:00:37,103 --> 01:00:39,404
to attack her.
Not with any hope of success.

655
01:00:41,036 --> 01:00:42,068
I disagree.

656
01:00:42,752 --> 01:00:44,719
I have every hope of success.

657
01:00:44,821 --> 01:00:47,522
It is a pity the new King
is not here with us.

658
01:00:47,624 --> 01:00:50,291
His presence in the field
might encourage new recruits.

659
01:00:51,694 --> 01:00:54,150
Unlike his father, he has
some credit as a warrior.

660
01:01:24,993 --> 01:01:26,626
What will we do about Alfred?

661
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,967
Why must we always talk about Alfred?

662
01:01:37,706 --> 01:01:41,174
Because he's dying, Aethelwulf.

663
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:43,509
He's dying before your eyes.

664
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,845
Can't you see?

665
01:01:52,954 --> 01:01:54,253
Alfred?

666
01:01:56,691 --> 01:01:57,856
Alfred?

667
01:01:59,927 --> 01:02:01,227
Alfred?

668
01:02:09,003 --> 01:02:10,002
Alfred.

669
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:12,338
What's he doing?

670
01:02:13,575 --> 01:02:14,607
Alfred?

671
01:02:16,996 --> 01:02:18,028
Alfred!

672
01:03:32,385 --> 01:03:33,750
No!

673
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:35,519
Save him!

674
01:03:39,058 --> 01:03:40,424
Alfred?

675
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:41,692
Save my boy!

676
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:50,534
Move!

677
01:03:51,737 --> 01:03:53,304
Alfred! My boy!

678
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,427
My life!

679
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:55,451
No!

680
01:03:56,809 --> 01:03:57,841
No!

681
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,049
No. No!

682
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:08,351
Please, please, please, please!

683
01:04:08,453 --> 01:04:10,954
No, please!

684
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,723
My boy! Please!

685
01:04:19,631 --> 01:04:20,997
He's alive!

686
01:04:21,022 --> 01:04:22,921
He's alive!

687
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,342
Shh, shh! He's trying to talk.

688
01:04:32,444 --> 01:04:33,543
York.

689
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:37,480
We must... We must go to York.

690
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:38,848
Why must we go to York?

691
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:43,909
The Northmen are there.

692
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:46,489
The Northmen.

693
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:49,125
And your...

694
01:04:49,227 --> 01:04:50,860
Your people need you.

695
01:04:54,399 --> 01:04:57,533
Alfred, how... How do you know?

696
01:04:59,738 --> 01:05:00,970
My father told me.

697
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:31,500
Oh, you Gods.

698
01:05:35,796 --> 01:05:37,096
Not like this.

699
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:41,843
I don't want to die like this.

700
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,974
Why have you abandoned me?

701
01:05:52,189 --> 01:05:55,691
Heimdall, watchman,

702
01:05:57,861 --> 01:05:59,728
you can vouch for me!

703
01:06:01,231 --> 01:06:03,732
Tell the other Gods
how often I think of them,

704
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,294
and how my heart belongs to them.

705
01:06:24,987 --> 01:06:26,086
Be gone, bird.

706
01:06:27,223 --> 01:06:29,790
Find a perch of land and stay there.

707
01:06:31,227 --> 01:06:32,793
Don't come back.

708
01:06:34,063 --> 01:06:35,663
Don't come back!

709
01:06:39,935 --> 01:06:41,935
Hold your line!

710
01:06:46,632 --> 01:06:48,564
Come on, men! Push, push!

711
01:06:50,311 --> 01:06:51,745
Come on!

712
01:07:05,226 --> 01:07:06,259
Forward!

713
01:07:07,061 --> 01:07:09,696
Keep going! Push!

714
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,733
One more!

715
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:30,258
Why do you think he kidnapped Astrid?

716
01:07:30,437 --> 01:07:33,953
I don't think King Harald ever
does anything without thought.

717
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:37,082
He told me that he had
abandoned his dreams

718
01:07:37,107 --> 01:07:39,013
of becoming King of all Norway.

719
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,767
I am sure he was lying.

720
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:44,252
He still believes in his dreams,

721
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:49,311
and, one day, his ships will return
to Kattegat full of warriors.

722
01:07:49,413 --> 01:07:51,592
Astrid must be part of his plan. But...

723
01:07:52,015 --> 01:07:53,615
What part, I cannot say.

724
01:07:53,717 --> 01:07:56,484
Astrid will never be part
of someone else's plan.

725
01:07:59,022 --> 01:08:01,823
I am old enough to know that
you can never say for sure

726
01:08:01,848 --> 01:08:03,681
what someone else will do.

727
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:06,961
That's it. Row!

728
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:11,887
I can smell home!

729
01:08:12,981 --> 01:08:14,147
Keep rowing!

730
01:08:23,092 --> 01:08:24,424
Keep the distance!

731
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:28,896
Not long now.

732
01:08:32,898 --> 01:08:34,230
Keep it going, men!

733
01:08:40,206 --> 01:08:41,438
Tie it fast!

734
01:08:41,463 --> 01:08:43,397
Have you thought any more
about what I said?

735
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:50,390
I'm sure you don't like the look of me

736
01:08:50,415 --> 01:08:53,182
but you will change your mind.

737
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:56,108
I will never marry you.

738
01:08:56,443 --> 01:08:58,410
You have made a big mistake.

739
01:08:59,147 --> 01:09:00,615
Oh, it's true.

740
01:09:00,949 --> 01:09:02,755
I've never had any luck with women.

741
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:04,784
And yet...

742
01:09:04,886 --> 01:09:09,709
What if, by mistake,
by accident, by the Gods,

743
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:13,993
and by fate, I made the right decision?

744
01:09:14,095 --> 01:09:16,344
What if you were always meant to be here?

745
01:09:17,131 --> 01:09:20,934
What if there was no place
else for you to be?

746
01:09:25,473 --> 01:09:26,505
Row!

747
01:09:29,843 --> 01:09:30,876
Row!

748
01:09:47,528 --> 01:09:48,860
Halt!

749
01:09:51,532 --> 01:09:52,898
Dismount!

750
01:09:56,971 --> 01:09:58,103
Who are you?

751
01:09:58,205 --> 01:10:00,138
We are men of Wessex.
We are here with our King.

752
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,040
With your King?
Do you mean King Aethelwulf?

753
01:10:03,143 --> 01:10:04,709
Son of Ecbert?

754
01:10:04,811 --> 01:10:06,744
He and his men are following
close behind.

755
01:10:06,846 --> 01:10:09,981
I am a companion of His Grace
Bishop Heahmund,

756
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:12,016
who is camped not very far from here.

757
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:13,751
My name is Lord Denewulf.

758
01:10:13,853 --> 01:10:15,253
Then well met, My Lord.

759
01:10:16,323 --> 01:10:17,822
Well met, indeed.

760
01:10:17,924 --> 01:10:19,190
This is a happy day.

761
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:21,892
My Lord Bishop was anxious for
the King to be at his side.

762
01:10:21,995 --> 01:10:25,896
And now, thank God, it has come to pass.

763
01:10:56,262 --> 01:10:58,195
Help me out.

764
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,486
Make room for their horses.

765
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:02,633
Most noble King,

766
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:05,068
by God's grace.

767
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,207
My Lord Bishop.

768
01:11:13,378 --> 01:11:16,111
We've heard many reports
of your prowess with arms,

769
01:11:16,214 --> 01:11:18,257
and of your personal sanctity.

770
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:20,616
We mean to model our lives upon yours.

771
01:11:21,386 --> 01:11:23,018
My wife, Judith.

772
01:11:23,555 --> 01:11:24,654
No, this way.

773
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,422
Noble lady.

774
01:11:27,124 --> 01:11:28,123
Come!

775
01:11:28,226 --> 01:11:30,059
Refresh yourself after your long journey,

776
01:11:30,562 --> 01:11:31,561
and eat.

777
01:11:32,463 --> 01:11:33,862
Make way for the carts!

778
01:11:33,964 --> 01:11:35,964
What courage you have, my lady,

779
01:11:35,989 --> 01:11:37,860
to accompany your husband here.

780
01:11:38,469 --> 01:11:41,030
I'm not so brave, Bishop Heahmund.

781
01:11:41,605 --> 01:11:45,240
But as my husband and my sons elect
to be on the field of battle,

782
01:11:45,419 --> 01:11:46,652
then what should I do?

783
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,411
Stay at home and weep and pray?

784
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,279
In any case,
as the daughter of King Aelle,

785
01:11:51,304 --> 01:11:56,141
I too have a score to settle
with these sons of Ragnar.

786
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,421
In the name of God, who is
both vengeful and merciful,

787
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,256
I swear I will make these pagans pay

788
01:12:01,281 --> 01:12:03,982
for their cruelty and their crimes.

789
01:12:04,161 --> 01:12:05,493
There's plenty to go 'round!

790
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:16,631
Prince Alfred?

791
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,107
- Yes, My Lord.
- Forgive me.

792
01:12:19,132 --> 01:12:21,065
I have heard stories about you already.

793
01:12:21,245 --> 01:12:24,212
How you traveled to Rome as a
boy, and met His Holiness.

794
01:12:24,237 --> 01:12:26,437
Yes. My father took me.

795
01:12:26,617 --> 01:12:29,517
It must have been an arduous
journey for one so young?

796
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:33,888
Well, is anything truly worthwhile not
likely to be difficult, my Lord Bishop?

797
01:12:33,913 --> 01:12:35,079
Well said.

798
01:12:35,104 --> 01:12:36,336
Who was your tutor?

799
01:12:36,593 --> 01:12:39,427
My grandfather, King Ecbert.

800
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:42,029
He was the wisest man I ever knew,

801
01:12:42,132 --> 01:12:43,164
and the most loving.

802
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:45,522
The barbarians who now occupy York

803
01:12:45,702 --> 01:12:47,468
are responsible for his death.

804
01:12:48,504 --> 01:12:49,737
That's why we are here.

805
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,868
The Northmen have been reinforcing
the defenses of the town.

806
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,547
They have repaired
and extended the ramparts.

807
01:13:00,572 --> 01:13:02,238
That is bad news.

808
01:13:02,418 --> 01:13:03,584
I thought so too.

809
01:13:05,388 --> 01:13:07,721
That is, until my scouts
reported something interesting.

810
01:13:09,525 --> 01:13:12,426
Apparently, they have felt
unable or unwilling

811
01:13:12,528 --> 01:13:15,296
to repair the old Roman walls
that are still standing.

812
01:13:15,398 --> 01:13:18,465
In fact, in several places,
the walls are crumbling.

813
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:21,268
The stones are loosened
and likely to fall.

814
01:13:22,304 --> 01:13:24,771
Even so, they remain unguarded

815
01:13:25,407 --> 01:13:26,406
and unprotected.

816
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:29,275
Then we have a plan of attack.

817
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:30,973
We do.

818
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,179
With your permission,

819
01:13:34,616 --> 01:13:35,748
we should wait,

820
01:13:37,131 --> 01:13:38,314
not rush.

821
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:40,653
Let our armies be combined.

822
01:13:40,755 --> 01:13:42,955
Let my scouts determine
with absolute certainty

823
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:47,049
that those sections of wall
remain unguarded and unprotected.

824
01:13:47,074 --> 01:13:48,541
And when all that is done?

825
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:50,326
Yes, my Prince.

826
01:13:50,732 --> 01:13:53,633
When all that is done, we shall attack.

827
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,176
Scouts!

828
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:05,743
_

829
01:21:05,828 --> 01:21:07,828
_

830
01:21:09,346 --> 01:21:11,346
_

831
01:21:11,379 --> 01:21:15,145
_

832
01:21:23,267 --> 01:21:24,833
Huh. Bring up the shield!

833
01:21:34,211 --> 01:21:36,210
What do you think
about Lagertha's mistake?

834
01:21:37,547 --> 01:21:39,294
What do you mean "mistake"?

835
01:21:39,849 --> 01:21:43,284
She ought to have killed King
Harald when she had the chance.

836
01:21:43,386 --> 01:21:44,852
Instead of just talking to him.

837
01:21:44,954 --> 01:21:46,521
Perhaps.

838
01:21:46,622 --> 01:21:50,724
Not allowed her enemy,
our enemy, to escape.

839
01:21:50,826 --> 01:21:52,626
And she sacrificed the life of Astrid.

840
01:21:52,651 --> 01:21:54,151
We don't know that.

841
01:21:56,466 --> 01:21:59,767
Listen, all I'm saying
is that Lagertha is fallible.

842
01:22:00,736 --> 01:22:02,370
She makes mistakes.

843
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:06,697
Maybe her grip of power is not as
fierce or complete as it once was.

844
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:08,240
Can't you see that?

845
01:23:54,014 --> 01:23:55,746
_

846
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:58,449
_

847
01:23:59,302 --> 01:24:01,661
_

848
01:24:25,945 --> 01:24:27,278
Ivar?

849
01:24:29,715 --> 01:24:31,548
Ah, what are you doing?

850
01:24:31,573 --> 01:24:34,219
Wait and I'll show you.

851
01:24:39,091 --> 01:24:40,090
Ready.
