1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,329
- Who are you?
- Jim Moriarty.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,006
Bye.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,044
Consulting criminal.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,248
I have loved this,
this little game of ours.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,125
- People have died.
- That's what people do!

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,884
I will stop you.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,724
If you don't stop prying...

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,731
I'll burn you.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,890
I will burn the heart
out of you.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,970
Catch you later.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,365
No, you won't.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,366
Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,730
It is a weakness with me,
but to be fair to myself,

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,290
it is my only weakness.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,243
You can't be allowed to continue.
You just can't.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,168
I would try to convince you

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,201
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,571
Probably my answer has crossed yours.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,764
Do you mind if I get that?

20
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,767
No, please.
You've got the rest of your life.

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,246
Hello?

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,406
Yes, of course it is. What do you want?

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,006
Say that again!

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,722
Say that again and know that
if you're lying to me,

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,044
I will find you and I will skin you.

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,166
Wait.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,804
Sorry.

28
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,689
Wrong day to die.

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,523
Did you get a better offer?

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,447
You'll be hearing from me, Sherlock.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,925
So if you have what you say you have,
I will make you rich.

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,644
If you don't.

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,688
I'll make you into shoes.

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,801
What happened there?

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,962
Someone changed his mind.

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,411
The question is, who?

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,964
Well, now, have you been wicked,
Your Highness?

38
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,925
Yes, Miss Adler.

39
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,685
- What are you typing?
- A blog.

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,404
- About?
- Us.

41
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,005
- You mean me.
- Why?

42
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,404
Well, you're typing a lot.

43
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,882
Right, then. So, what have we got?

44
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,642
My wife seems to be spending

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,802
- a very long time at the office.
- Boring.

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,086
I think my husband

47
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,481
- might be having an affair.
- Yes.

48
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,290
She's not my real aunt,
she's been replaced. I know she has.

49
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,609
- I know human ash.
- Leave.

50
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,526
We are prepared to offer
any sum of money you care to mention

51
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,568
- for the recovery of these files
- Boring!

52
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,048
We have this website, it explains
the true meaning of comic books,

53
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,009
'cause people miss a lot of the themes.

54
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,562
But then all the comic books
started coming true.

55
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,244
Interesting.

56
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,529
"Geek Interpreter", what's that?

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,763
- That's the title.
- What does it need a title for?

58
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,890
Do people actually read your blog?

59
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,689
Where do you think
our clients come from?

60
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,761
I have a website.

61
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,525
In which you enumerate
240 different types of tobacco ash.

62
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,931
Nobody's reading your website.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,925
Right, then, dyed blonde hair,
no obvious cause of death

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,651
except for these speckles,
whatever they are.

65
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,205
For God's sakes!

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,402
- What?
- "The Speckled Blonde"?

67
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,210
They wouldn't let us see
Granddad when he was dead.

68
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,770
Is that 'cause he'd gone to heaven?

69
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,490
People don't really
go to heaven when they die,

70
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,086
they're taken to a special room
and burned.

71
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,446
Sherlock...

72
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,569
There was a plane crash
in Dusseldorf yesterday.

73
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,485
- Everyone dead.
- Suspected terrorist bomb.

74
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,967
- We do watch the news.
- You said "boring" and turned over.

75
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,089
Well, according to the flight details,
this man was checked in on board.

76
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,208
Inside his coat he's got a stub
from his boarding pass,

77
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,760
napkins from the flight,
even one of those special biscuits.

78
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,841
Here's his passport,
stamped in Berlin airport.

79
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,247
So this man should have died
in a plane crash in Germany yesterday,

80
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,322
but instead he's in a car boot
in Southwark.

81
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,925
Lucky escape.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,480
- Any ideas?
- Eight so far.

83
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,290
Okay, four ideas.

84
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,164
Maybe two ideas.

85
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,562
No, no, no,
don't mention the unsolved ones.

86
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,650
People want to know you're human.

87
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,290
- Why?
- Because they're interested.

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,170
- No, they're not. Why are they?
- Look at that.

89
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,523
One thousand,
eight hundred and ninety-five.

90
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,409
- Sorry, what?
- I reset that counter last night.

91
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,689
This blog has had nearly 2,000 hits
in the last eight hours.

92
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,808
This is your living, Sherlock,

93
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,201
not 240 different types of tobacco ash.

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,565
Two hundred and forty-three.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,684
So what's this one?

96
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,604
- "Bellybutton Murders"?
- "The Navel Treatment"?

97
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,568
There's a lot of press outside, guys.

98
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,330
Well, they won't
be interested in us.

99
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,324
Yeah, that was before
you were an internet phenomenon.

100
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,961
Couple of them specifically
wanted photographs of you two.

101
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,530
For God's sake!

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,689
John.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,241
Cover your face and walk fast.

104
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,685
Still,
it's good for the public image,

105
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,125
big case like this.

106
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,926
I'm a private detective,
the last thing I need is a public image!

107
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,050
Hello. I think it's time,
don't you?

108
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,921
Dear! Thumbs?

109
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,807
The door was... The door was...

110
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,209
Boys! You've got another one!

111
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,564
Tell us from the start,
don't be boring.

112
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,286
Hey, are you okay?

113
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,406
Excuse me!

114
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,649
Are you all right?

115
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,961
Sir, phone call for you.

116
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,886
Carter.

117
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,405
Have you heard
of Sherlock Holmes?

118
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,289
- Who?
- Well, you're about to meet him now.

119
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,089
This is your case,
it's entirely up to you,

120
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,687
this is just friendly advice,
but give Sherlock five minutes

121
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,321
on your crime scene and listen
to everything that he has to say.

122
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,765
And as far as possible,

123
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,970
try not to punch him.

124
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,801
Okay.

125
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,362
Sir, this gentleman says
he needs to speak to you.

126
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,046
Yes, I know. Sherlock Holmes.

127
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,327
John Watson. Are you set up for Wi-Fi?

128
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,610
You realise this is
a tiny bit humiliating?

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,608
It's okay, I'm fine.
Now, show me to the stream.

130
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,643
I didn't really mean for you.

131
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,891
Look, this is a six.

132
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,562
There's no point in my leaving the flat
for anything less than a seven,

133
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,641
we agreed.

134
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,320
Now, go back, show me the grass.

135
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,607
- When did we agree that?
- We agreed it yesterday.

136
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,886
Stop.

137
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,284
Closer.

138
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,203
I wasn't even at home yesterday,
I was in Dublin.

139
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,050
It's hardly my fault
you weren't listening.

140
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,770
-- Shut up!

141
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,004
Do you just carry on talking
when I'm away?

142
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,844
I don't know, how often are you away?

143
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,049
Nam show me the car that backfired.

144
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,765
It's there.

145
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,089
That? the one that made the noise, yes?

146
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,611
Yeah. If you're thinking gunshot,
there wasn't one.

147
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,729
He wasn't shot;
He was killed by a single blow

148
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,768
to the back of the head
from a blunt instrument;

149
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,287
Which then magically disappeared,
along with the killer.

150
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,010
It's got to be an eight, at least.

151
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,890
You've got two more minutes,
they want to know more about the driver.

152
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,041
Forget him, he's an idiot.

153
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,849
Why else would he
think himself a suspect?

154
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,965
I think he's a suspect.

155
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,081
- Pass me over.
- All right, but there's a mute button

156
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,844
and I will use it.

157
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,048
Up a bit! I'm not talking
from down here!

158
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,804
Okay. just take it, take it.

159
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,326
Having driven to an isolated location
and successfully committed a crime

160
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,004
without a single witness,
why would he then call the police

161
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,128
and consult a detective? Fair play?

162
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,687
He's trying to be clever.
It's over-confidence.

163
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,085
Did you see him?

164
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,845
Morbidly obese, the undisguised
halitosis of a single man

165
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,082
living on his own. The right sleeve
of an internet porn addict

166
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,328
and the breathing pattern of
an untreated heart condition,

167
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,085
low self-esteem,
tiny IQ and a limited life expectancy

168
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,766
and you think he's
an audacious criminal mastermind?

169
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,444
Don't worry, this is just stupid

170
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,488
What did you say? Heart what?

171
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,560
- Go to the stream.
- What's in the stream?

172
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,324
- Go and see.
- Sherlock!

173
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,927
You weren't answering your doorbell.

174
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,525
His room's through the back,
get him some clothes.

175
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,523
- Who the hell are you?
- Sorry, Mr Holmes...

176
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,042
- Sherlock, what's going on?
- You're coming with us.

177
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,407
I've lost him. I don't know what...

178
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,527
- Dr Watson?
- Yeah.

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,045
- It's for you.
- Okay, thanks.

180
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,248
No, sir, the helicopter.

181
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,764
Please, Mr Holmes, where you're going
you'll want to be dressed.

182
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,167
I know exactly where I'm going.

183
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,970
- Are you wearing any pants?
- No.

184
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,166
Okay.

185
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,322
At Buckingham Palace. Right.

186
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,441
I am seriously fighting
an impulse to steal an ashtray.

187
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,525
What are we doing here, Sherlock?
Seriously, what?

188
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,326
- I don't know.
- Here to see the Queen?

189
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,084
Apparently, yes.

190
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,402
Just once can you two
behave like grownups?

191
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,205
We solve crimes, I blog about it
and he forgets his pants.

192
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,441
I wouldn't hold out too much hope.

193
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,045
I was in the middle of a case, Mycroft.

194
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,242
What, the hiker and the backfire?

195
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,482
I glanced at the police report,
a bit obvious, surely?

196
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,561
Transparent.

197
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,291
Time to move on, then.

198
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,167
We are in Buckingham Palace,
at the very heart of the British nation.

199
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,005
Sherlock Holmes, put your trousers on!

200
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,401
- What for?
- Your client.

201
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,522
And my client is?

202
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,046
Illustrious, in the extreme.

203
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,447
And remaining, I have to inform you,
entirely anonymous.

204
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,120
- Mycroft.
- Harry.

205
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,331
May I just apologise
for the state of my little brother?

206
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,369
A full-time occupation, I imagine.

207
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,204
And this must be Dr John Watson,
formerly of

208
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,284
- the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers?
- Hello, yes.

209
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,091
My employer is a tremendous fan
of your blog.

210
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,889
- Your employer?
- Particularly enjoyed the one

211
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,928
- about the aluminium crutch.
- Thank you.

212
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,724
And Mr Holmes the younger,
you look taller in your photographs.

213
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,327
I take the precaution
of a good coat and a short friend.

214
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,410
Mycroft, I don't do anonymous clients.

215
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,244
I'm used to mystery
at one end of my cases,

216
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,290
both ends is too much work.
Good morning.

217
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,724
This is a matter of national importance.
Grow up!

218
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,848
- Get off my sheet!
- Or what?

219
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,128
- Or I'll just walk away.
- I'll let you.

220
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,850
Boys, please. Not here.

221
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,045
Who is my client?

222
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,122
Take a look at where you're standing
and make a deduction.

223
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,282
You are to be engaged
by the highest in the land.

224
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,089
Now, for God's sake!

225
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,249
Put your clothes on!

226
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,681
I'll be mother.

227
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,565
And there is a whole childhood
in a nutshell.

228
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,128
My employer has a problem.

229
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,407
A matter has come to light
of an extremely delicate

230
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,725
and potentially criminal nature
and in this hour of need, dear brother,

231
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,689
- your name has arisen.
- Why?

232
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
We have a police force of sorts,
even a marginally secret service.

233
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,401
Why come to me?

234
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,562
People do come to you for help,
don't they, Mr Holmes?

235
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,404
Not to date anyone with a navy.

236
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,643
This is a matter of the
highest security and therefore of trust.

237
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,445
You don't trust your own secret service?

238
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,603
Naturally not.
They all spy on people for money.

239
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,401
I do think we have a timetable.

240
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,005
Yes, of course.

241
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,687
What do you know about this woman?

242
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,323
Nothing whatsoever.

243
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,171
Then you should be
paying more attention.

244
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,841
She's been at the centre of
two political scandals

245
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,403
in the last year and recently ended
the marriage of a prominent novelist,

246
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,445
by having an affair
with both participants separately.

247
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,402
You know
I don't concern myself with trivia.

248
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,646
Who is she?

249
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,488
Irene Adler;
Professionally known as The Woman.

250
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,404
- Professionally?
- There are many names

251
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,081
for what she does,
she prefers "dominatrix".

252
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,888
- Dominatrix.
- Don't be alarmed.

253
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,646
- It's to do with sex.
- Sex doesn't alarm me.

254
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,769
How would you know?

255
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,401
She provides, shall we say,
recreational scolding

256
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,210
for those who enjoy that sort of thing

257
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,123
and are prepared to pay for it.

258
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,441
These are all from her website.

259
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,448
And I assume this Adler woman
has some compromising photographs?

260
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,090
You're very quick, Mr Holmes.

261
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,482
Hardly a difficult deduction.
Photographs of whom?

262
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,841
A person of significance to my employer.

263
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,566
We'd prefer not to say
any more at this time.

264
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,051
You can't tell us anything?

265
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,530
I can tell you it's a young person.

266
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,808
A young female person.

267
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,129
- How many photographs?
- A considerable number, apparently.

268
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,324
Do Miss Adler
and this young female person

269
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,607
- appear in these photographs together?
- Yes, they do.

270
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,682
And I assume
in a number of compromising scenarios?

271
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,967
An imaginative range, we are assured.

272
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,690
John, you might want to put
that cup back in your saucer now.

273
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,207
- Can you help us, Mr Holmes?
- How?

274
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,044
- Will you take the case?
- What case?

275
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,202
Pay her, now and in full.

276
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,490
As Miss Adler remarks in her masthead,
know when you are beaten.

277
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,801
She doesn't want anything

278
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,327
She got in touch, she informed us
that the photographs existed,

279
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,846
she indicated that she had
no intention to use them

280
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,691
to extort either money or favour.

281
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,882
A power play.

282
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,086
A power play with the
most powerful family in Britain.

283
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,409
Now, that is a dominatrix. Ooh, this is
getting rather fun, isn't it?

284
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,527
Sherlock...

285
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,728
- Where is she?
- In London, currently.

286
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,245
- She's staying...
- Text me the details,

287
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,651
I'll be in touch by the end of the day.

288
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,290
Do you really think
you'll have news by then?

289
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,124
No, I think I'll have the photographs.

290
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,568
One can only hope
you're as good as you seem to think.

291
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,850
I'll need some equipment, of course.

292
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,206
Anything you require,
I'll have it sent over.

293
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,726
- Can I have a box of matches?
- I'm sorry?

294
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,609
Or your cigarette lighter,
either will do.

295
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,091
- I don't smoke.
- No, I know you don't,

296
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,083
but your employer does.

297
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,290
We have kept a lot of people
successfully in the dark

298
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,283
about this little fact, Mr Holmes.

299
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,010
I'm not the Commonwealth.

300
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,286
And that's as modest as he gets.
Pleasure to meet you.

301
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,846
Late rs!

302
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,529
Okay, the smoking, how did you know?

303
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,002
The evidence was right under your nose,
John, as ever you see

304
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,447
- but do not observe.
- Observe what?

305
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,931
The ashtray.

306
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,521
Kate?

307
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,764
We're going to have a visitor.
I'll need a bit of time to get ready.

308
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,281
- A long time?
- Ages.

309
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,124
What are you doing?

310
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,802
I'm going into battle, John,
I need the right armour.

311
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,483
- No.
- Nah.

312
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,845
- Works for me.
- Everything works on you.

313
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,405
- So, what's the plan?
- We know her address.

314
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,725
- We just ring her doorbell?
- Exactly. just here, please.

315
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,802
You didn't even change your clothes.

316
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,609
Then it's time to add
a splash of colour.

317
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,483
- Are we here?
- Two streets away, but this will do.

318
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,644
- For what?
- Punch me in the face.

319
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,960
Shade?

320
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,288
- Blood.
- Punch you?

321
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,921
Yes, punch me, in the face.
Didn't you hear me?

322
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,963
I always hear "punch me in the
face" when you're speaking,

323
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,008
- but it's usually sub-text.
- For God's sakes!

324
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,923
Thank you, that was, that was...

325
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,722
Okay, I think we're done now, John.

326
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,167
You want to remember,
Sherlock, I was a soldier.

327
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,163
- I killed people.
- You were a doctor!

328
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,765
I had bad days!

329
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,411
- What are you going to wear?
- My battledress.

330
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,209
Ooh, lucky boy.

331
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,322
- Hello?
- Um, sorry to disturb you.

332
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,641
Um, I've just been attacked.

333
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,290
Um, and I think they,
they took my wallet and, um,

334
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,008
and my phone.
Um, please, could you help me?

335
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,083
I can phone the police if you want.

336
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,730
Thank you, thank you. Could you, please?

337
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,644
Er; would you, would you mind if I
just waited here, just until they come?

338
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,723
Thank you, thank you so much.

339
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,971
Thank you.

340
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,844
I saw it all happen.
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

341
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,242
- Now, have you got a first aid kit?
- In the kitchen. Please.

342
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,687
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

343
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,246
Hello, sorry to hear
that you've been hurt.

344
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,890
I don't think Kate caught your name?

345
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,803
I'm so sorry, I'm...

346
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,488
It's always hard to remember
an alias when you've had a fright.

347
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,846
Isn't it?

348
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,526
There now, we're both defrocked.

349
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,041
- Mr Sherlock Holmes.
- Miss Adler, I presume?

350
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,962
Look at those cheekbones.
I could cut myself slapping that face.

351
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,642
Would you like me to try?

352
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,082
Right, this should do it.

353
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,726
I've missed something, haven't I?

354
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,084
Please, sit down.
Or if you'd like some tea,

355
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,525
I can call the maid.

356
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,523
- I had some at the Palace.
- I know.

357
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,840
Clearly.

358
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,802
I had a tea, too, at the Palace.
If anyone's interested.

359
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,928
Do you know the big problem
with a disguise, Mr Holmes?

360
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,367
However hard you try,
it's always a self-portrait.

361
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,485
You think I'm a vicar
with a bleeding face?

362
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,406
No, I think you're damaged, delusional
and believe in a higher power.

363
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,925
In your case, it's yourself.

364
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,046
And somebody loves you.

365
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,650
If I had to punch that face,
I'd avoid your nose and teeth too.

366
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,961
Could you put
something on, please?

367
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,769
Er, anything at all, a napkin?

368
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,002
Why? Are you feeling exposed?

369
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,809
I don't think John knows where to look.

370
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,531
No, I think he knows exactly where.

371
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,889
I'm not sure about you.

372
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,488
If I want to look at naked women,
I borrow John's laptop.

373
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,528
- You do borrow my laptop.
- I confiscate it.

374
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,121
Well, never mind,
we've got better things to talk about.

375
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,046
Now, tell me, I need to know.
How was it done?

376
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,086
- What?
- The hiker with the bashed-in head,

377
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,650
how was he killed?

378
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,768
That's not why I'm here.

379
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,490
No, no, no, you're here
for the photographs,

380
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,846
but that's never going to happen.

381
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,331
And since we're here
just chatting anyway...

382
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,687
That story's not been on the news yet,
how do you know about it?

383
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,570
I know one of the policemen.
Well, I know what he likes.

384
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,964
And you like policemen?

385
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,170
I like detective stories.
And detectives.

386
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,685
Brainy's the new sexy.

387
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,764
Position of the car
The position of the car

388
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,649
relative to the hiker at the time
of the backfire, that and the fact

389
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,131
that the death blow
was to the back of the head,

390
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,282
that's all you need to know.

391
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,930
Okay, tell me, how was he murdered?

392
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,646
He wasn't.

393
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,007
- You don't think it was murder?
- I know it wasn't.

394
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,491
- How?
- The same way that I know

395
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,245
the victim was an excellent sportsman,
recently returned from foreign travel

396
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,409
and that the photographs
I'm looking for are in this room.

397
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,527
Okay, but how?

398
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,365
- So, they are in this room.
- Thank you. John, man the door,

399
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,124
let no one in.

400
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,323
Two men alone in the countryside,
several yards apart and one car.

401
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,171
I... I thought you were
looking for the photos now.

402
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,323
No, no, looking takes ages,
I'm just going to find them,

403
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,640
but you're moderately clever
and we've got a moment,

404
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,963
so let's pass the time.
Two men, a car and nobody else.

405
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,121
Driver's trying to fix his engine.
Getting nowhere.

406
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,282
And the hiker is taking a moment,
looking at the sky.

407
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,641
Watching the birds? Any moment now,
something's going to happen.

408
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,762
- What?
- The hiker's going to die.

409
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,047
No, that's the result.
What's going to happen?

410
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,881
- I don't understand.
- Well, try to.

411
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,007
Why?

412
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,525
Because you cater to the whims
of the pathetic

413
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,090
and take your clothes off
to make an impression.

414
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,607
Stop boring me and think.
It's the new sexy.

415
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,010
- The car is going to backfire.
- There's going to be a loud noise.

416
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,002
- So what?
- Noises are important.

417
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,208
Noises can tell you everything.

418
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,930
For instance...

419
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,091
Thank you.

420
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,965
On hearing a smoke alarm,
a mother would look towards her child.

421
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,530
Amazing how fire exposes our priorities.

422
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,011
I really hope
you don't have a baby in here.

423
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,287
All right, John,
you can turn it off now.

424
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,284
I said you can turn it off now.

425
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,010
Give me a minute.

426
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,481
Thank you.

427
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,130
You should always use gloves
with these things, you know.

428
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,168
Heaviest oil deposit is always
on the first key used,

429
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,969
that's quite clearly a three,
but after that the sequence

430
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,405
is almost impossible to read.

431
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,369
I see from the make
that it's a six-digit code.

432
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,090
It can't be your birthday,
no disrespect,

433
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,323
but clearly you were born
in the '80s and 8's barely used,

434
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,050
- so...
- I'd tell you the code right now,

435
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,767
but you know what? I already have.

436
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,641
Think.

437
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,651
Hands behind your head, on the floor,
keep it still!

438
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,803
- Sorry, Sherlock.
- Miss Adler, on the floor!

439
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,287
Don't you want me on the floor too?

440
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,442
No, sir, I want you to open the safe.

441
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,281
American. Interesting.
Why would you care?

442
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,887
- Sir, the safe, now, please.
- I don't know the code.

443
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,684
We've been listening,
she said she told you.

444
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,802
Well if you've been listening,
you'll know she didn't.

445
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,650
I'm assuming I missed something.

446
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,644
From your reputation,
I'm assuming you didn't, Mr Holmes.

447
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,326
For God's sake, she's the one
who knows the code, ask her!

448
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,370
Yes, sir, she also knows the code
that automatically calls

449
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,647
the police and sets off
the burglar alarm.

450
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,688
- I've learned not to trust this woman.
- Mr Holmes doesn't...

451
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,321
Shut up!
One more word out of you, just one,

452
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,611
and I will decorate that wall
with the insides of your head.

453
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,081
That, for me, will not be hardship.

454
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,727
Mr Archer, at the count of three,
shoot Dr Watson.

455
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,802
- What?
- I don't know the code.

456
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,400
- One.
- I don't know the code.

457
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,846
- Two.
- She didn't tell me,

458
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,160
I don't know it!

459
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,811
I'm prepared to believe you,
any second now.

460
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,482
- Three!
- No, stop!

461
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,565
Thank you, Mr Holmes. Open it, please.

462
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,645
Vatican cameos!

463
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,889
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

464
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,083
- He's dead.
- Thank you.

465
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,362
You were very observant.

466
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,771
- Observant?
- I'm flattered.

467
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,889
- Don't be.
- Flattered?

468
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,610
There'll be more of them,
they'll be keeping an eye

469
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,284
on the building.

470
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,969
- We should call the police.
- Yes.

471
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,248
- On their way.
- For God's sake!

472
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,810
Shut up, it's quick.

473
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,645
Check the rest of the house,
see how they got in.

474
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,531
Well, that's the knighthood in the bag.

475
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,203
And that's mine.

476
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,288
All the photographs
are on here, I presume?

477
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,885
I have copies, of course.

478
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,246
No, you don't.

479
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,126
You'll have permanently disabled
any kind of uplink or connection.

480
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,089
Unless the contents of this phone
are provably unique,

481
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,685
you wouldn't be able to sell them.

482
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,765
Who said I'm selling?

483
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,490
Well, why would they be interested?

484
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,282
Whatever's on the phone,
it's clearly not just photographs.

485
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,840
That camera-phone is my life,
Mr Holmes.

486
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,727
I'd die before I let you take it.
It's my protection.

487
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,888
- Sherlock!
- It was.

488
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,805
- Must have come in this way.
- Clearly.

489
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,725
It's all right, she's just out cold.

490
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,883
Well God knows, she's used to that.
There's a back door.

491
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,042
Better check it, Dr Watson.

492
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,001
Sure.

493
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,329
You're very calm.

494
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,687
Well, your booby trap
did just kill a man.

495
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,651
He would have killed me.
It was self-defence in advance.

496
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,363
What...? What is that? What...

497
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,722
Give it to me. Now. Give it to me.

498
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,482
- No.
- Give it to me.

499
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,651
- No.
- For goodness' sake!

500
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,246
Drop it.

501
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,287
I said drop it!

502
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,960
Thank you, dear.

503
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,048
Now, tell that sweet little posh thing
the pictures are safe with me.

504
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,649
They're not for blackmail,
just for insurance.

505
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,728
Besides, I might want to see her again.

506
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,282
No, no, no, no, no, no

507
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,409
It's been a pleasure, don't spoil it.

508
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,364
This is how I want you to remember me,

509
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,647
the woman who beat you.

510
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,522
Goodnight, Mr Sherlock Holmes.

511
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,922
- Jesus! What are you doing?
- He'll sleep for a few hours.

512
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,050
Make sure he doesn't choke
on his own vomit,

513
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,804
it makes for a
very unattractive corpse.

514
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,723
What's this?
What have you given him? Sherlock?

515
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,083
He'll be fine.
I've used it on loads of my friends.

516
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,929
Sherlock, can you hear me?

517
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,044
You know, I was wrong about him.
He did know where to look.

518
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,885
For what? What are you talking about?

519
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,962
The key-code to my safe.

520
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,727
- What was it?
- Shall I tell him?

521
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,244
My measurements.

522
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,644
Got it!

523
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,766
No, don't get up.

524
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,444
I'll do the talking.

525
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,201
So the car's about to backfire

526
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,563
and the hiker, he's staring at the sky.

527
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,201
No, you said he could be watching birds,
but he wasn't, was he?

528
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,363
He was watching
another kind of flying thing.

529
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,810
The car backfires
and the hiker turns to look.

530
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,127
Which was his big mistake.

531
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,408
By the time the driver looks up,
the hiker is already dead.

532
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,482
What he doesn't see is what killed him,

533
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,484
because it's already being
washed downstream.

534
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,084
An accomplished sportsman
recently returned from foreign travel

535
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,606
with a boomerang.

536
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,162
You got that from one look?

537
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,763
Definitely the new sexy.

538
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,131
I...

539
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,520
I...

540
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,362
Hush now it's okay.

541
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,320
I'm only returning your coat.

542
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,645
John?

543
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,721
John!

544
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,690
- You okay?
- How did I get here?

545
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,044
Well, I don't suppose you remember much,
you weren't making a lot of sense.

546
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,885
I should warn you, I think
Lestrade filmed you on his phone.

547
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,691
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

548
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,842
- The woman, that woman.
- What woman?

549
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,128
The woman! The woman woman!

550
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,010
Irene Adler?
She got away, no one saw her.

551
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,923
She wasn't here, Sherlock.

552
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,084
What are you... What?
No, no, no. No. Back to bed.

553
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,281
You'll be fine in the morning.
Just sleep.

554
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,728
Of course I'll be fine, I am fine.
I'm absolutely fine.

555
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,246
Yes, you're great.
Now, I'll be next door if you need me.

556
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,721
- Why would I need you?
- No reason at all.

557
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,563
The photographs are perfectly safe.

558
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,768
In the hands of a fugitive sex worker?

559
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,880
She's not interested in blackmail.
She wants...protection, for some reason.

560
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,089
I take it you've stood down
the police investigation

561
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,247
into the shooting at her house?

562
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,846
How can we do anything
while she has the photographs?

563
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,570
Our hands are tied.

564
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,723
She'd applaud your choice of words.

565
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,609
You see how this works,
that camera-phone

566
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,445
is her get-out-of-jail-free card.
You have to leave her alone.

567
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,568
Treat her like royalty, Mycroft.

568
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,563
Though not the way she treats royalty.

569
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,325
-- What was that?

570
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,241
Text.

571
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,045
But what was that noise?

572
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,007
Did you know there were
other people after her, too, Mycroft,

573
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,525
before you sent John and I in there?

574
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,688
CIA trained killers,
I think excellent guess.

575
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,966
Yeah, thanks for that, Mycroft.

576
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,045
It's a disgrace, sending your
little brother into danger like that.

577
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,925
Family is all we have in the end,
Mycroft Holmes!

578
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,490
Shut up, Mrs Hudson!

579
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,005
- Mycroft!
- Hey!

580
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,963
- Apologies.
- Thank you.

581
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,247
- Though do, in fact, shut up.-

582
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,890
It's a bit rude,
that noise, isn't it?

583
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,849
There's nothing
you can do and nothing she will do,

584
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,649
as far as I can see.

585
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,441
I can put maximum surveillance on her.

586
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,688
Why bother?
You can follow her on Twitter.

587
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,525
I believe her username is TheWhipHand.

588
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,762
- Yes, most amusing.-

589
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,610
Excuse me.

590
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,841
Hello?

591
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,889
Why does your phone make that noise?

592
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,251
What noise?

593
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,049
That noise, the one it just made.

594
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,929
It's a text alert,
it means I've got a text.

595
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,363
Your texts
don't usually make that noise.

596
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,644
Well, somebody got hold of the phone
and apparently as a joke,

597
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,161
personalised their text alert noise.

598
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,807
So every time they text you...

599
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,885
- It would seem so.
- Could you turn that phone down a bit?

600
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,883
At my time of life it's...

601
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,124
See, I'm wondering who could have
got hold of your phone,

602
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,202
because it would have been
in your coat, wouldn't it?

603
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,567
I'll leave you to your deductions.

604
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,280
I'm not stupid, you know.

605
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,169
Where do you get that idea?

606
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,369
Bond Air is go, that's decided.
Check with the Coventry lot.

607
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,851
Talk later.

608
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,128
What else does she have?

609
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,881
Irene Adler.

610
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,371
The Americans wouldn't be
interested in her

611
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,046
for a couple of
compromising photographs.

612
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,281
There's more.

613
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,771
Much more.

614
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,281
Something big's coming, isn't it?

615
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,727
Irene Adler is no longer
any concern of yours.

616
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,087
From now on, you will stay out of this.

617
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,766
Will I?

618
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,162
Yes, Sherlock.

619
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,043
You will.

620
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,204
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a long and arduous apology

621
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,964
to make to a very old friend.

622
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,610
Do give her my love.

623
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,848
- Lovely, Sherlock. That was lovely.
- Marvellous.

624
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,725
- That was very good.
- I wish you could have worn the antlers.

625
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,008
Some things are best left to
the imagination, Mrs Hudson.

626
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,526
- Mrs H.
- No thank you, Sarah.

627
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,569
Er, no, no, no, no, no,
he's not good with names.

628
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,802
No, no, no, I can get this.
No, Sarah was the doctor

629
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,008
and then there was the one with
the spots and then the one with the nose

630
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,686
and then... Who was after
the boring teacher?

631
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,201
Nobody.

632
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,806
Jeanette! Process of elimination.

633
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,643
Dear Lord.

634
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,202
Hello, everyone. Sorry, hello.
It said on the door just to,

635
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,606
- just come up.
- Hello, Molly.

636
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,729
Everybody saying hello to each
other, how wonderful!

637
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,290
Let me, er... Holy Mary!

638
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,407
Wow!

639
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,323
So we're having
a Christmas drinkies, then?

640
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,323
- No stopping them, apparently.
- It's the one day of the year

641
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,164
where the boys have to be nice to me,

642
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,004
so it's almost worth it.

643
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,250
John? The counter on your blog...

644
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,891
- Molly, want a drink?
- It still says 1,895.

645
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,769
No, Christmas is cancelled.

646
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,410
And you've got a photograph of me
wearing that hat!

647
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,244
- People like the hat.
- No, they don't. What people?

648
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,603
- How's the hip?
- It's atrocious,

649
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,091
but thanks for asking.

650
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,891
I've seen much worse,
but then I do post-mortems.

651
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,800
God, sorry.

652
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,843
- Don't make jokes, Molly.
- No, sorry.

653
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,809
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

654
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,081
I wasn't expecting to see you.

655
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,049
I thought you were going to be
in Dorset for Christmas?

656
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,884
That's first thing in the morning,
me and the wife,

657
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,530
we're back together, it's all sorted.

658
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,409
No, she's sleeping with a PE teacher.

659
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,011
And John, I hear you're off
to your sister's, is that right?

660
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,522
- Yeah.
- Sherlock was complaining. Saying.

661
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,046
First time ever, she's cleaned-up
her act, she's off the booze.

662
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,531
- Nope.
- Shut up, Sherlock!

663
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,001
I see you've got a new boyfriend, Molly,
and you're serious about him.

664
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,366
What? Sorry, what?

665
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,647
In fact, you're seeing him
this very night and giving him a gift

666
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,370
- Take a day off.
- Shut up and have a drink.

667
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,205
Come on, surely you've all
seen the present at the top of the bag.

668
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,884
Perfectly wrapped with a bow.
All the others are slapdash at best.

669
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,083
It's for someone special, then.

670
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,640
The shade of red echoes her lipstick,
either an unconscious association

671
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,529
or one that she's deliberately
trying to encourage.

672
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,046
Either way, Miss Hooper
has love on her mind.

673
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,281
The fact that she's serious about him
is clear from the fact

674
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,284
she's giving him a gift at all.
That always suggests long-term hopes,

675
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,283
however forlorn,
and that she's seeing him tonight

676
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,328
is evident from her make-up
and what she's wearing.

677
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,610
Obviously trying to compensate
for the size of her mouth and breasts...

678
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,170
You always say such horrible things.
Every time. Always.

679
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,726
Always.

680
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,206
I am sorry. Forgive me.

681
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,521
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.

682
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,883
- No! That wasn't... I didn't...
- No, it was me.

683
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,651
- My God, really?
- What?

684
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,530
- My phone.
- Fifty-seven?

685
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,923
- Sorry, what?
Fifty-seven of those texts,

686
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,604
the ones I've heard.

687
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,206
Thrilling that you've been counting.

688
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,130
Excuse me.

689
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,008
- What's up, Sherlock?
- I said excuse me.

690
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,764
Do you ever reply?

691
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,409
Dear Lord, we're not going to have
Christmas phone calls now, are we?

692
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,602
Have they passed a new law?

693
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,691
I think you're going to find
Irene Adler tonight.

694
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,723
We already know where she is.

695
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,090
As you were kind enough to
point out, it hardly matters.

696
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,971
No, I mean you're
going to find her dead.

697
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,486
- You okay?
- Yes.

698
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,242
The only
who fitted the description

699
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,290
Had her brought here,
your home from home.

700
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,805
You didn't need to come in, Molly.

701
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,645
It's okay, everyone else
was busy with...Christmas.

702
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,567
The face is a bit sort of bashed-up,
so it might be a bit difficult.

703
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,764
- That's her, isn't it?
- Show me the rest of her.

704
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,885
That's her.

705
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,727
- Thank you, Miss Hooper.
- Who is she?

706
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,009
How did Sherlock recognise her
from not her face?

707
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,445
just the one

708
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,287
Why?

709
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,124
Merry Christmas.

710
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,171
Smoking indoors,
isn't there one of those...

711
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,163
one of those law things?

712
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,325
We're in a morgue.

713
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,966
There's only so much damage you can do.

714
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,524
How did you know she was dead?

715
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,881
She had an item in her possession,

716
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,485
one she said her life depended on.

717
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,562
She chose to give it up.

718
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,403
Where is this item now?

719
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,844
Look at them,

720
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,647
they all care so much.

721
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,251
Do you ever wonder if there's
something wrong with us?

722
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,526
All lives end, all hearts are broken.

723
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,882
Caring is not an advantage,

724
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,806
Sherlock.

725
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,364
This is low tar.

726
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,764
Well, you barely knew her.

727
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,569
Merry Christmas, Mycroft.

728
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,009
And a Happy New Year.

729
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,009
He's on his way.
Have you found anything?

730
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,605
No. Did he take the cigarette?

731
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,724
- Yes.
- Shit!

732
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,607
- He's coming, ten minutes.
- There's nothing in the bedroom.

733
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,206
Well, it looks like he's clean.
We've tried all the usual places.

734
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,362
Are you sure tonight's a danger night?

735
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,408
No, but then I never am.

736
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,530
You have to stay with him, John.

737
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,287
- I've got plans.
- No.

738
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,769
-- Mycroft...

739
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,564
I am really sorry.

740
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,889
You know my friends
are so wrong about you.

741
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,327
You're a great boyfriend.

742
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,931
Okay, that's good. I mean,
I always thought I was great...

743
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,003
And Sherlock Holmes
is a very lucky man.

744
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,889
Jeanette, please.

745
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,089
No, I mean it. It's heartwarming.

746
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,685
You'll do anything for him.

747
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,649
And he can't even
tell your girlfriends apart!

748
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,960
No, I'll do anything for you,

749
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,849
just tell me what it is
I'm not doing, tell me!

750
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,287
Don't make me compete
with Sherlock Holmes!

751
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,566
I'll walk your dog for you.

752
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,971
There, I've said it now,
I'll even walk your dog.

753
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,280
I don't have a dog!

754
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,647
No, because that was the last one.

755
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,006
Okay.

756
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,082
- Jesus!
- I'll call you.

757
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,969
- No!
"Okay"

758
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,201
That really wasn't very good, was it?

759
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,647
Hi.

760
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,961
You okay?

761
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,448
I hope you didn't mess up
my sock index this time.

762
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,807
Lovely tune, Sherlock.
Haven't heard that one before.

763
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,411
- You composing?
- Helps me to think.

764
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,168
What are you thinking about?

765
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,250
The count on your blog
is still stuck at 1,895.

766
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,687
Yes. Faulty, can't seem to fix it.

767
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,930
Faulty or you've been hacked
and it's a message.

768
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,571
Just faulty.

769
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,600
Right.

770
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,521
Right.

771
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,448
Well, I'm going out for a bit.

772
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,169
Listen, has he ever had any kind of

773
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,000
girlfriend, boyfriend,
a relationship, ever?

774
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,045
I don't know.

775
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,605
How can we not know?

776
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,841
He's Sherlock.

777
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,561
How will we ever know what
goes on in that funny old head?

778
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,770
Right. See you.

779
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,565
John?
- Yeah?

780
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,401
Hello.

781
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,641
Hello.

782
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,246
So, any plans for New Year tonight?

783
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,245
Um, nothing fixed.

784
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,286
Nothing I couldn't
heartlessly abandon, yeah.

785
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,606
Any ideas?

786
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,801
One.

787
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,722
You know, Mycroft could just phone me,

788
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,963
if he didn't have this bloody stupid
power complex.

789
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,767
Couldn't we just go to a café?

790
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,802
Sherlock doesn't follow me everywhere.

791
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,045
Through there.

792
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,930
He's on his way.

793
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,651
You were right, he thinks it's Mycroft.

794
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,529
He's writing sad music.

795
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,286
Doesn't eat,

796
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,404
barely talks,
only to correct the television.

797
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,082
I'd say he was heartbroken
but, well, he's Sherlock.

798
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,968
He does all that anyway...

799
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,410
Hello, Dr Watson.

800
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,365
Tell him you're alive.

801
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,724
He'd come after me.

802
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,131
I'll come after you if you don't.

803
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,043
I believe you.

804
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,490
You were dead on a slab.

805
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,810
It was definitely you.

806
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,721
DNA tests are only as good
as the records you keep.

807
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,961
And I bet you know
the record-keeper.

808
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,690
I know what he likes.

809
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,603
And I needed to disappear.

810
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,041
Then how come I can see you
and I don't even want to?

811
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,848
Look, I made a mistake.

812
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,763
I sent something to Sherlock
for safekeeping

813
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,490
and I now I need it back,
so I need your help.

814
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,887
No.

815
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,567
- It's for his own safety.
- So is this.

816
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,369
Tell him you're alive.

817
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,121
I can't.

818
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,649
Fine, I'll tell him
and I still won't help you.

819
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,562
- What do I say?
- What do you normally say?

820
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,608
You've texted him a lot!

821
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,085
- Just the usual stuff.
- There is no usual in this case.

822
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,962
"Good morning. I like your funny hat."

823
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,564
"I'm sad tonight, let's have dinner."

824
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,848
"You look sexy on
Crimewatch, let's have dinner."

825
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,810
'I'm not hungry

826
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,721
"Let's have dinner."

827
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,324
You flirted with Sherlock Holmes?

828
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,084
At him. He never replies.

829
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,401
No, Sherlock always replies,
to everything.

830
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,800
He's Mr Punchline.

831
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,362
He will outlive God
trying to have the last word

832
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,562
- Does that make me special?
- I don't know, maybe.

833
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,044
Are you jealous?

834
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,084
- We're not a couple.
- Yes, you are.

835
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,002
There. "I'm not dead.
Let's have dinner."

836
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,967
Who the hell knows about
Sherlock Holmes,

837
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,442
but for the record,
if anyone out there still cares,

838
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,571
- I'm not actually gay.
- Well, I am.

839
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,204
Look at us both.

840
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,686
I don't think so, do you?

841
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,720
Stop it!

842
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,851
Sherlock!

843
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,209
Sherlock. Sherlock.

844
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,846
Don't snivel, Mrs Hudson,

845
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,683
it'll do nothing to impede
the flight of a bullet.

846
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,244
What a tender world that would be.

847
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,243
Please, sorry, Sherlock

848
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,290
I believe you have something
that we want, Mr Holmes.

849
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,403
Then why don't you ask for it?

850
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,771
I've been asking this one,
she doesn't seem to know anything.

851
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,525
But you know what I'm asking
for, don't you, Mr Holmes?

852
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,525
I believe I do.

853
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,483
Please help.

854
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,242
- First get rid of your boys.
- Why?

855
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,481
I dislike being outnumbered,

856
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,642
it makes for too much stupid
in the room.

857
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,250
You two, go to the car.

858
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,890
Then get into the car and drive away.

859
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,770
Don't try to trick me,
you know who I am, it doesn't work.

860
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,042
Next, you can stop
pointing that gun at me.

861
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,531
So you can point a gun at me?

862
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,923
- I'm unarmed.
- Mind if I check?

863
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,445
I insist.

864
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,401
Don't do anything...

865
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,646
Moron!

866
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,121
- Thank you.
- You're all right now, you're all right.

867
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,851
Yes. Yes.

868
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,290
What's going on?

869
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,244
Jesus, what the hell is happening?

870
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,163
Mrs Hudson has been attacked
by an American,

871
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,844
I'm restoring balance to the universe.

872
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,161
Mrs Hudson, my God,
are you all right?

873
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,925
Jesus, what have they done to you?

874
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,088
I'm just being so silly.

875
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,442
Downstairs, take her downstairs
and look after her.

876
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,845
It's all right.

877
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,282
It's all right now,
I'll have a look at that.

878
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,044
I'm fine, I'm fine.

879
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,360
Are you going to tell me
what's going on?

880
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,204
I expect so, now go.

881
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,606
Lestrade?

882
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,726
We've had a break-in at Baker Street.

883
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,691
Send your least irritating
officers and an ambulance.

884
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,882
No, no, no, no, we're fine.

885
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,447
No, it's the, it's the burglar,

886
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,204
he's got himself rather badly injured.

887
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,524
A few broken ribs, fractured skull,
suspected punctured lung.

888
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,808
He fell out of a window.

889
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,650
It stings.

890
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,080
That was right on my bins.

891
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,690
And exactly how many times
did he fall out of the window?

892
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,760
It's all a bit of a blur,
Detective Inspector. I lost count.

893
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,768
She'll have to sleep upstairs
in our flat tonight,

894
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,451
- we need to look after her.
- No.

895
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,284
- She's fine.
- No, she's not, look at her.

896
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,202
She's got to take some time
away from Baker Street.

897
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,442
She can go and stay with her sister.
Doctor's orders.

898
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,168
- Don't be absurd.
- She's in shock, for God's sake,

899
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,686
and all over some bloody
stupid camera-phone.

900
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,565
- Where is it, anyway?
- Safest place I know.

901
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,203
You left it in the pocket of your
second-best dressing gown, you clot!

902
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,644
I managed to sneak it out when
they thought I was having a cw.

903
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,371
Thank you.

904
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,048
- Shame on you, John Watson.
- Shame on me?

905
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,727
Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street?
England would fall.

906
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,930
- Where is it now?
- Where no one will look.

907
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,362
Whatever's on that phone is
more than just pictures.

908
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,891
Yes, it is.

909
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,169
So, she's alive, then.

910
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,567
How are we feeling about that?

911
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,081
Happy New Year, John.

912
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,571
Do you think you'll be seeing her again?

913
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,807
- Is that a phone?
- It's a camera-phone.

914
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,043
- And you're x-raying it?
- Yes, I am.

915
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,764
- Whose phone is it?
- A woman's.

916
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,686
- Your girlfriend?
- You think she's my girlfriend

917
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,410
because I'm x-raying her possessions?

918
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,961
- Well, we all do silly things!
- Yes.

919
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,722
They do, don't they? Very silly.

920
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,529
She sent this to my address.
And she loves to play games.

921
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,001
She does?

922
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,084
Hey, Sherlock...

923
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,085
- We have a client.
- What, in your bedroom?

924
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,320
So, who's after you?

925
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,482
- People who want to kill me.
- Who's that?

926
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,361
Killers.

927
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,329
It would help
if you were a tiny bit more specific.

928
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,369
So you faked your own death
in order to get ahead of them?

929
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,487
It worked for a while.

930
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,562
Except you let John know that
you're alive and therefore me.

931
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,120
- I knew you'd keep my secret.
- You couldn't.

932
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,483
But you did, didn't you?

933
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,250
Where's my camera-phone?

934
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,527
It's not here. We're not stupid.

935
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,810
Then what have you done with it?

936
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,689
If they've guessed you've got it,
they'll be watching you.

937
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,205
If they've been watching me,
they'll know that I took

938
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,011
a safety deposit box at a bank
on the Strand a few months ago.

939
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,606
I need it.

940
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,285
Well, we can't just go
and get it, can we?

941
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,525
Molly Hooper.

942
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,884
She could collect it
and take it to Barts.

943
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:45,126
Then one of your homeless
network could bring it here,

944
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,201
leave it in the café

945
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,009
and one of the boys downstairs
could bring it up the back.

946
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,171
Very good, John, excellent plan,
full of intelligent precautions.

947
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,368
Thank you. So, why don't I phone...

948
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,201
So,

949
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,411
what do you keep on here?
In general, I mean?

950
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,011
Pictures, information,
anything I might find useful.

951
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,809
- For blackmail?
- For protection.

952
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,241
I make my way in the world,
I misbehave.

953
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,528
I like to know people will be on my side
exactly when I need them to be.

954
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,326
- So how do you acquire this information?
- I told you, I misbehave.

955
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,648
But you've acquired something
that's more danger than protection.

956
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,643
- Do you know what it is?
- Yes.

957
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,728
- But I don't understand it.
- I assumed.

958
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,400
Show me.

959
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,845
The passcode.

960
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,927
- It's not working.
- No,

961
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,411
because it's a duplicate
that I had made

962
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,801
into which you've just entered
the numbers 1058.

963
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,240
I assumed you'd choose something
more specific than that,

964
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,924
but thanks anyway.

965
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,280
I told you that camera-phone
was my life.

966
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,127
I know when it's in my hand.

967
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,885
- You're rather good.
- You're not so bad.

968
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,406
Hamish.

969
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,324
John Hamish Watson, just if
you were looking for baby names.

970
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:29,246
There was a man, an MOD official
and I knew what he liked.

971
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,403
One of the things he liked
was showing off.

972
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,809
He told me this email
was going to save the world.

973
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,484
He didn't know it,
but I photographed it.

974
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,605
He was a bit tied up at the time.

975
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,362
It's a bit small on that screen,
can you read it?

976
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,249
- Yes.
- Code, obviously.

977
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,967
I had one of the best cryptographers
in the country take a look at it,

978
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,328
though he was mostly upside-down,
as I recall.

979
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,769
Couldn't figure it out.

980
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,770
What can you do, Mr Holmes?

981
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,642
Go on, impress a girl.

982
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,282
There's a margin for error,
but I'm pretty sure there's a 747

983
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,761
leaving Heathrow tomorrow at 6:30
in the evening for Baltimore.

984
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,605
Apparently it's going to save the world,
I'm not sure how that could be true,

985
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,445
but give me a moment, I've only been
on the case for eight seconds.

986
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,966
Come on, it's not code,

987
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,849
these are seat allocations
on a passenger jet. Look!

988
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,002
There's no letter I because
it can be mistaken for a one

989
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,248
No letters past K,
the width of the plane is the limit.

990
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,482
The numbers always appear
randomly and not in sequence,

991
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,848
but the letters have little runs
of sequence all over the place.

992
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,809
Families and couples sitting together.

993
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,770
Only a jumbo is wide enough to
need a letter K or rows past 55,

994
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,080
which is why there's always an upstairs.

995
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,731
There's a row 13, which eliminates
the more superstitious airlines.

996
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,923
Then there's the style
of the flight number, 007,

997
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,126
that eliminates a few more.

998
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,202
And assuming the British point
of origin, which would be logical,

999
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,884
considering the original source
of the information

1000
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,530
and assuming from the increased
pressure on you lately

1001
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,647
that the crisis is imminent,

1002
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,291
the only flight that matches all
the criteria and departs within the week

1003
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:07,570
is the 6:30 to Baltimore tomorrow
evening from Heathrow airport.

1004
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,287
Please don't feel obliged to tell me
that was remarkable or amazing.

1005
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,361
John's expressed that thought

1006
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,408
in every possible variant
available to the English language.

1007
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,050
I would have you right here,

1008
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,805
on this desk, until you
begged for mercy twice.

1009
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,008
John, please can you check those
flight schedules, see if I'm right?

1010
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,324
Yeah, I'm on it, yeah.

1011
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,771
- I've never begged for mercy in my life.
- Twice.

1012
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,000
Yeah, you're right, flight 007.

1013
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,446
- What did you say?
- You're right.

1014
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,409
No, no, after that,
what did you say after that?

1015
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,528
007. Flight om.

1016
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,649
007, 007, 007, 007. Something.

1017
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,769
Something 007, 007. What?

1018
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,211
007, 007.

1019
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,890
007. 007 what?

1020
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,209
What, something, what?

1021
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,731
Bond Air is go.

1022
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,971
Bond Air is go.

1023
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,326
Bond Air is go.

1024
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,484
Bond Air is go.

1025
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,483
Band Air is go, that's decided.

1026
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,880
Check with the Coventry lat.

1027
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,404
- Coventry.
- I've never been.

1028
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,365
Is it nice?

1029
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,690
Where's John?

1030
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,762
He went out, a couple of hours ago.

1031
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,007
- I was just talking to him.
- He said you do that.

1032
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,122
What's Coventry got to do
with anything?

1033
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,285
It's a story.

1034
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,251
Probably not true.

1035
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,129
In the Second World War,
the Allies knew

1036
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,965
that Coventry was going to get bombed
because they'd broken the German code

1037
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,327
but they didn't want the Germans
to know that they'd broken the code

1038
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,209
so they let it happen anyway.

1039
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,691
Have you ever had anyone?

1040
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,731
I'm sorry?

1041
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,007
And when I say had,
I'm being indelicate.

1042
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,084
- I don't understand.
- I'll be delicate, then.

1043
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,845
- Let's have dinner.
- Why?

1044
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,251
- You might be hungry
- I'm not.

1045
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,481
Good.

1046
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:30,090
Why would I want to have dinner

1047
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,083
if I wasn't hungry?

1048
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,443
Mr Holmes,
if it was the end of the world,

1049
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,569
if this was the very last night,

1050
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,883
would you have dinner with me?

1051
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,566
Sherlock?

1052
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,761
Too late.

1053
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,928
That's not the end of the world,
that's Mrs Hudson.

1054
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,887
Sherlock, this man was at the door,
is the bell still not working?

1055
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,041
He shot it.

1056
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,929
Have you come to take me away again?

1057
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,605
- Yes, Mr Holmes.
- Well, I decline.

1058
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,329
I don't think you do.

1059
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,925
There's going to be a bomb
on a passenger jet.

1060
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,604
The British and American
governments know about it,

1061
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,887
but rather than expose
the source of their information,

1062
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,247
they're going to let it happen.
The plane will blow up.

1063
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,802
Coventry all over again

1064
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,324
The wheel turns, nothing is ever new.

1065
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,122
Well, you're looking all better.

1066
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,804
How are you feeling?

1067
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,846
Like putting a bullet
in your brain, sir.

1068
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:37,361
They'd pin a medal on me if I did, sir.

1069
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,003
The Coventry conundrum.

1070
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,167
What do you think of my solution?

1071
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,963
The flight of the dead.

1072
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,004
Plane blows up midair,
mission accomplished for the terrorists,

1073
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,401
hundreds of casualties but nobody dies.

1074
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,410
Neat, don't you think?

1075
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:39,762
You've been stumbling around
the fringes of this one for ages.

1076
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,320
Or were you too bored
to notice the pattern?

1077
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,406
They wouldn't let us see
Granddad when he was dead.

1078
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,290
She's not my real aunt.
I know human ash.

1079
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,011
We ran a similar project
with the Germans a while back,

1080
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,323
though I believe one of our passengers
didn't make the flight.

1081
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,767
But that's the deceased for you,

1082
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,771
late, in every sense of the word.

1083
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,211
How is the plane going to fly?

1084
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,011
Of course, unmanned aircraft,
hardly new.

1085
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,801
It doesn't fly. It will never fly.

1086
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,721
This entire project is cancelled.

1087
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,929
The terrorist cells have been informed
that we know about the bomb.

1088
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,409
We can't fool them now.

1089
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,049
We've lost everything.

1090
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,489
One fragment of one email
and months and years of planning,

1091
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,491
finished.

1092
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,806
- Your MOD man.
- That's all it takes.

1093
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,809
One lonely, naive man,
desperate to show off,

1094
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,529
and a woman clever enough
to make him feel special.

1095
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,802
You should screen your defence people
more carefully.

1096
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,885
I'm not talking about the MOD man,
Sherlock, I'm talking about you!

1097
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,604
A damsel in distress.

1098
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,404
In the end, are you really so obvious?

1099
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,884
Because this was textbook.

1100
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,924
The promise of love, the pain of loss,
the joy of redemption.

1101
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,967
Then give him a puzzle
and watch him dance.

1102
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,202
- Don't be absurd!
- Absurd?

1103
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,366
How quickly did you decipher
that email for her?

1104
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,451
Was it the full minute?

1105
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,087
Or were you really eager to impress?

1106
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,606
I think it was less than five seconds.

1107
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,968
I drove you into her path.

1108
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,885
I'm sorry. I didn't know

1109
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,570
- Mr Holmes, I think we need to talk.
- So do I.

1110
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,521
There are a number of aspects
I'm still not quite clear on.

1111
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,364
Not you, junior, you're done now.

1112
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,882
There's more, loads more.

1113
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,527
On this phone I've got
secrets and pictures and scandals

1114
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,409
that could topple your whole world.

1115
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,882
You have no idea how much
havoc I can cause

1116
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,962
and exactly one way to stop me.

1117
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,488
Unless you want to tell your
masters that your biggest security leak

1118
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,244
is your own little brother.

1119
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,845
We have people who can get into this.

1120
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,607
I tested that theory for you.

1121
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,291
I let Sherlock Holmes
try it for six months.

1122
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,930
Sherlock, dear, tell him what you found
when you x-rayed my camera-phone.

1123
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,886
There are four additional units
wired inside the casing.

1124
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,167
I suspect containing acid
or a small amount of explosive.

1125
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,766
Any attempt to open the casing
will burn the hard drive.

1126
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,251
Explosive.

1127
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,644
It's more me.
Some data is always recoverable.

1128
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,481
Take that risk.

1129
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,689
You have a passcode to open this.

1130
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,003
I deeply regret to say we have people
who can extract it from you.

1131
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,687
Sherlock?

1132
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,761
There will be two passcodes,

1133
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,161
one to open the phone,
one to burn the drive.

1134
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,802
Even under duress, you can't
know which one she's given you

1135
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,008
and there would be no point
in a second attempt.

1136
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,811
He's good, isn't he?
I should have him on a leash.

1137
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,050
In fact, I might.

1138
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,803
We destroy this, then.
No one has the information.

1139
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,531
Fine. Good idea.

1140
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,688
Unless there are lives of
British citizens

1141
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,444
depending on the information
you're about to burn.

1142
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,761
Are there?

1143
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,282
Telling you would be playing fair.

1144
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,882
I'm not playing any more.

1145
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,967
A list of my requests

1146
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,522
and some ideas about my protection
once they're granted.

1147
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,844
I'd say it wouldn't blow much
of a hole in the wealth of a nation,

1148
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,285
but then I'd be lying.

1149
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,929
I imagine you'd like to sleep on it?

1150
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,762
- Thank you, yes.
- Too bad.

1151
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,800
-- Off you pop and talk to people.

1152
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,961
You've been very thorough

1153
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,001
I wish our lot
were half as good as you.

1154
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,042
I can't take all the credit,
I had a bit of help.

1155
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,731
Jim Moriarty sends his love.

1156
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,450
Yes, he's been in touch

1157
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:09,963
Seems desperate for my attention,
which I'm sure can be arranged.

1158
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,051
I had all this stuff,
never knew what to do with it.

1159
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,807
Thank God for the consultant criminal.

1160
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,248
Gave me a lot of advice
about how to play the Holmes boys.

1161
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,445
Do you know what he calls you?

1162
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,726
The Ice Man

1163
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,085
and the Virgin.

1164
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,447
Didn't even ask for anything,
I think he just likes to cause trouble.

1165
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,443
Now, that's my kind of man.

1166
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:38,567
And here you are, the dominatrix
who brought a nation to its knees.

1167
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,887
- Nicely played.
- No.

1168
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,121
Sorry?

1169
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,851
I said no.

1170
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,368
Very, very close, but no.

1171
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,249
You got carried away.

1172
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,449
The game was too elaborate,
you were enjoying yourself too much.

1173
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,244
There's no such thing as too much.

1174
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,527
Enjoying the thrill
of the chase is fine.

1175
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,001
Craving the distraction of the game,
I sympathise entirely,

1176
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,684
but sentiment?

1177
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,604
Sentiment is a chemical defect
found in the losing side.

1178
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,171
Sentiment?

1179
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,290
What are you talking about?

1180
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,131
- You.
- Dear God.

1181
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,449
Look at the poor man.

1182
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,965
You don't actually think
I was interested in you?

1183
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,968
Why? Because you're
the great Sherlock Holmes,

1184
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,849
the clever detective in the funny hat?

1185
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,290
No.

1186
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,448
Because I took your pulse.

1187
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,926
Elevated.

1188
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,604
Your pupils dilated.

1189
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,202
I imagine John Watson thinks
love is a mystery to me

1190
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,648
but the chemistry is incredibly
simple and very destructive.

1191
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,844
When we first met, you told me
that disguise is always a self-portrait.

1192
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,604
How true of you.
The combination to your safe,

1193
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,047
your measurements, but this,
this is far more intimate.

1194
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,920
This is your heart and
you should never let it rule your head.

1195
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,161
You could have chosen any random number
and walked out of here today

1196
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,605
with everything you've worked for.

1197
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,842
But you just couldn't resist it,
could you?

1198
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,764
I've always assumed that love
is a dangerous disadvantage.

1199
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,929
Thank you for the final proof.

1200
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,611
Everything I said, it's not real

1201
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,206
- I was just playing the game.
- I know.

1202
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,648
And this is just losing.

1203
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,805
There you are, brother.

1204
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,564
I hope the contents make up
for any inconvenience

1205
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,120
- I may have caused you tonight.
- I'm certain they will.

1206
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,362
If you're feeling kind,
lock her up, otherwise let her go.

1207
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,090
I doubt she'll survive long
without her "protection".

1208
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,845
- Are you expecting me to beg?
- Yes.

1209
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,326
Please.

1210
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,080
You're right.

1211
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,127
I won't even last six months.

1212
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,489
I'm sorry about dinner.

1213
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,571
You don't smoke.

1214
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,927
I also don't frequent cafés.

1215
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,407
It's the file on Irene Adler?

1216
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,405
Closed forever.

1217
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,170
I am about to go and inform my brother,
or, if you prefer, you are,

1218
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,526
that she somehow got herself

1219
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,887
into a Witness Protection scheme
in America.

1220
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,967
New name, new identity.
She will survive and thrive,

1221
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,807
- but he will never see her again.
- Why would he care?

1222
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,802
He despised her at the end.

1223
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,121
Won't even mention her by name,
just The Woman.

1224
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,411
Is that loathing or a salute?

1225
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,042
One of a kind,
the one woman who matters?

1226
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,602
He's not like that.
He doesn't feel things that way.

1227
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,801
I don't think.

1228
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,687
My brother has the brain
of a scientist or a philosopher,

1229
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,001
yet he elects to be a detective.

1230
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,248
What might we deduce about his heart?

1231
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,801
- I don't know.
- Neither do I.

1232
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,367
But initially he wanted to be a pirate.

1233
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,885
He'll be okay with this,
Witness Protection,

1234
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,689
never seeing her again, he'll be fine.

1235
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,406
I agree.

1236
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,324
That's why I decided to tell him that.

1237
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,200
Instead of what?

1238
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,886
She's dead.

1239
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:22,763
She was captured by a terrorist cell
in Karachi two months ago and beheaded.

1240
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,481
It was definitely her?
She's done this before.

1241
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,922
I was thorough this time.

1242
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:37,924
It would take Sherlock Holmes
to fool me

1243
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,766
and I don't think he was on hand,
do you?

1244
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,246
So...

1245
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,722
What shall we tell Sherlock?

1246
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,566
Clearly you've got news.

1247
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,120
If it's about the Leeds triple murder,
it was the gardener.

1248
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,884
Did nobody notice the earring?

1249
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,324
Hi. No, it's um...

1250
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,483
It's about Irene Adler.

1251
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,046
Well?

1252
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,765
Has something happened?
Has she come back?

1253
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,081
No, no, she's... I just bumped
into Mycroft downstairs,

1254
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,844
he had to take a call.

1255
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,884
- Is she back in London?
- No.

1256
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,360
She's...

1257
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,966
- She's in America.
- America?

1258
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,601
Got herself on
a Witness Protection scheme, apparently.

1259
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,845
I don't know how
she swung it but...

1260
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,684
- Well, you know.
- I know what?

1261
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,489
Well, you won't be able
to see her again.

1262
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,971
Why would I want to see her again?

1263
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,089
- Didn't say you did.
- Is that her file?

1264
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,607
Yes, I was just going
to take it back to Mycroft.

1265
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,805
- Do you want to...
- No.

1266
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:03,846
Listen, actually...

1267
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,763
No, but I will have
the camera-phone, though.

1268
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,804
There's nothing on it any more.
It's been stripped.

1269
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,009
I know, but I... I'll still have it.

1270
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,325
I've got to give this back to Mycroft,
you can't keep it.

1271
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,769
Sherlock, I have to give this
to Mycroft, it's the government's now.

1272
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,490
- I couldn't...
- Please.

1273
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,051
Thank you.

1274
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,484
- Well, I'd better take this back.
- Yes.

1275
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,407
Did she ever text you again
after all that?

1276
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,643
Once, a few months ago.

1277
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,850
What did she say?

1278
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,404
"Goodbye, Mr Holmes."

1279
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,084
When I say run, run.

1280
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,811
The Woman.

1281
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,131
The Woman.
