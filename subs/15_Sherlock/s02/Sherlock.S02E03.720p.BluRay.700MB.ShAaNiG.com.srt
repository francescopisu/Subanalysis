1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,191
Why today?

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,946
Do you want to hear me say it?

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,068
Eighteen months
since our last appointment.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,984
You read the papers?

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,428
- Sometimes.
- And you watch telly?

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,864
You know why I'm here.

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,269
I'm here because...

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,144
What happened, John?

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,826
Sher...

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,029
You need to get it out.

11
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,502
My best friend, Sherlock,

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,186
is dead.

13
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,147
Falls of the Reichenbach.

14
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,063
Turner's masterpiece,

15
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,629
thankfully recovered
owing to the prodigious talent

16
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,748
of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

17
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,945
A small token of our gratitude.

18
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,780
Diamond cufflinks.
All my cuffs have buttons.

19
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,983
- He means 'thank you
- Do I?

20
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,341
- Just say it.
- Thank you.

21
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,941
Back together with my family,

22
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,388
after my terrifying ordeal.

23
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,589
And we have one person to thank
for my deliverance,

24
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,860
Sherlock Holmes.

25
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,903
- Tie pin. I don't wear ties.
- Shh.

26
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,665
Peter Ricoletti.

27
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,903
Number one on Interpol's
most wanted list since 1982.

28
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,387
But we got him.

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,504
And there's one person we have to thank
for giving us the decisive leads,

30
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,342
with all his customary
diplomacy and tact.

31
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,390
- Sarcasm.
- Yes.

32
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,185
We all chipped in.

33
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,305
Put the hat on!

34
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,350
-- Yeah, Sherlock. Put it on.

35
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,589
Just get it over with.

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,191
Boffin"? Boffin Sherlock Holmes

37
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,345
- Everybody gets one.
- One what?

38
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,751
Tabloid nickname.

39
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,504
SuBo, Nasty Nick.

40
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,071
Shouldn't worry.
I'll probably get one soon.

41
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,222
Page five, column six, first sentence.

42
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,389
- Why is it always the hat photograph?
- "Bachelor John Watson."

43
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,666
- What kind of hat is it, anyway?
- Bachelor?

44
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,901
What the hell are they implying?

45
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,711
- Is it a cap? Why has it got two fronts?
- It's a deerstalker.

46
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,988
"Frequently seen in the company
of bachelor John Watson."

47
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,222
How do you stalk a deer with a hat?
What am I going to do, throw it?

48
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,270
- "Confirmed bachelor John Watson."
- Is it like some sort of death Frisbee?

49
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,069
Okay, this is too much.
We need to be more careful.

50
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,269
It's got ?aps.
Ear flaps, it's an ear hat, John.

51
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,026
What do you mean, more careful?

52
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,821
I mean, this isn't a deerstalker now.
It's a Sherlock Holmes hat.

53
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,420
I mean that you're not exactly
a private detective any more.

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,106
- You're this far from famous.
- It'll pass.

55
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,503
It better pass. The press will turn,
Sherlock. They always turn.

56
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,190
And they'll turn on you.

57
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,666
- It really bothers you.
- What?

58
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,821
- What people say.
- Yes.

59
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,107
About me. I don't understand.
Why would it upset you?

60
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,508
Just try to keep a low profile.

61
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,548
Find yourself a little case this week.

62
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,390
Stay out of the news.

63
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,264
- That's your phone.
- Keeps doing that.

64
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,425
So, did you just talk to him
for a really long time?

65
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,781
Henry Fishguard
never committed suicide.

66
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,141
Bow Street Runners missed everything!

67
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,830
Pressing case, is it?

68
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,507
They're all pressing
till they're solved.

69
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,741
Put your key in there, please.

70
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,510
-- Excuse me, sir.

71
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,830
Any metal objects? Keys, mobile phones?

72
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,627
- Go through.
- Thank you.

73
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,626
- Fancy a cuppa, then, mate?
- Yeah, why not?

74
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,549
Gilts at seven.
Dutch Telecoms in freefall.

75
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,270
Thank you, Harvey.

76
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,985
What do you say? Refuse them all
parole and bring back the rope?

77
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,511
Let's begin.

78
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,906
This is an emergency. Please leave...

79
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,711
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

80
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,307
- Sir, there's been a break-in.
- Not our division.

81
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,381
You'll want it.

82
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,066
The vault!

83
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,311
Hacked into the Tower
of bloody London's security? How?

84
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,861
Tell them we're already on our way.

85
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,988
There's been another one.
Another break-in.

86
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,904
Bank of England!

87
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,828
Sir, security's down, sir.
It's failing.

88
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,221
- Where is it now?
- Pentonville Prison.

89
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,104
No!

90
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,506
No rush.

91
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,024
I'll get it, shall I?

92
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,622
- Here.
- Not now, I'm busy.

93
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,141
- Sherlock.
- Not now.

94
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,551
He's back.

95
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,703
That glass
is tougher than anything.

96
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,862
Not tougher
than crystallised carbon.

97
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,590
He used a diamond.

98
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,742
- Ready?
- Yes.

99
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,065
Let them through.

100
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,620
Thank you. I've got it.

101
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,590
- Remember...
- Yes.

102
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,631
- Remember...
- Yes.

103
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,501
Remember what they told you.

104
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,741
- Don't try to be clever...
- No.

105
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,187
And please, just keep it
simple and brief.

106
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,945
God forbid the star witness in the trial
should come across as intelligent.

107
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,069
Intelligent, fine.
Let's give smartarse a wide berth.

108
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,384
- I'll just be myself.
- Are you listening to me?

109
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,187
- So today, standing outside...
- Is this the trial of the century...

110
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,183
The trial of James Moriarty...

111
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,302
James Moriarty, early today
accused of attempting...

112
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,462
of attempting to steal
the Crown jewels.

113
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,510
At the Old Bailey we have
Reichenbach hero Sherlock Holmes...

114
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,911
Would you mind slipping your hand
into my pocket?

115
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,187
Thanks.

116
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,506
Crown versus Moriarty,
please proceed to Court 70.

117
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,781
You're him.

118
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,541
Wrong toilet.

119
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,668
- I'm a big fan.
- Evidently.

120
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,311
I read your cases. Follow them all.

121
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,263
Sign my shirt, would you?

122
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,581
There are two types of fans.

123
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,071
Catch me before I kill again, type A.

124
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,587
- What's type B?
- Your bedroom's just a taxi ride away

125
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,027
Guess which one I am?

126
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,345
- Neither.
- Really?

127
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,184
No, you're not a fan at all.

128
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,627
Those marks on your forearm.
Edge of a desk.

129
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,501
You've been typing in a hurry, probably.
Pressure on, facing a deadline.

130
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,508
- That all?
- There's a smudge of ink on your wrist

131
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,309
and the bulge
in your left jacket pocket.

132
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,861
Bit of a giveaway?

133
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,341
The smudge is deliberate. It's to see
if I'm as good as they say I am.

134
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,789
Oil-based.
Used in newspaper print.

135
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,144
But drawn on with an index finger.

136
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,388
Your finger. journalist

137
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,990
Unlikely you get your hands dirty
at the press.

138
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,260
You put that there to test me.

139
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,145
- Wow! I'm liking you.
- You mean I'd make a great feature.

140
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,222
"Sherlock Holmes,
the man beneath the hat."

141
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,907
Kitty. Riley.

142
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,465
- Pleased to meet you.
- No.

143
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,226
I'm just saving you
the trouble of asking.

144
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,541
No, I won't give you an interview.
No, I don't want the money.

145
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,310
You and John Watson. just platonic?

146
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,065
Can I put you down for a no there
as well?

147
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,666
There's all sorts of gossip
in the press about you.

148
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,300
Sooner or later, you're going to need
someone on your side.

149
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,584
Someone to set the record straight.

150
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,188
You think you're the girl
for that job, do you?

151
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,429
I'm smart. And you can trust me.

152
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,621
Totally.

153
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,261
Smart? Okay. Investigative journalist.

154
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,271
Good. Well, look at me
and tell me what you see.

155
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,949
If you're that skilful,
you don't need an interview,

156
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,103
you can just read what you need.

157
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,347
No? Okay, my turn.

158
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,223
I look at you and I see someone who's
still waiting for their first big scoop

159
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,540
so that their editor will notice them.

160
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,590
You're wearing an expensive skirt
that has been re-hemmed twice.

161
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,866
The only posh skirt you've got.

162
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,908
And your nails, you can't afford
to do them that often.

163
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,946
I see someone who's hungry.
I don't see smart.

164
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,704
And I definitely don't see trustworthy,

165
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,989
but I'll give you a quote, if you like.
Three little words.

166
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,820
You repel me.

167
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,703
- A consulting criminal.
- Yes.

168
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,829
Your words.
Can you expand on that answer?

169
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,507
James Moriarty is for hire.

170
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,503
- A tradesman?
- Yes.

171
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,344
But not the sort
who'd fix your heating?

172
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,906
No, the sort who'd plant
a bomb or stage an assassination,

173
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,869
but I'm sure he'd make a pretty
decent job of your boiler.

174
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,587
Would you describe him as...

175
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,707
- Leading.
- What?

176
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,941
Can't do that.
You're leading the witness.

177
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,226
He'll object and the judge will uphold.

178
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,506
Mr Holmes!

179
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,469
Ask me how. How would I describe him?

180
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,066
What opinion have I formed of him?
Did they not teach you this?

181
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,064
Mr Holmes,
we're fine without your help.

182
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,231
How would you describe
this man, his character?

183
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,341
First mistake,

184
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,704
James Moriarty isn't a man at all.

185
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,110
He's a spider.

186
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,743
A spider at the centre of a web.

187
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,949
A criminal web with a thousand threads

188
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,070
and he knows precisely how each
and every single one of them dances.

189
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,103
And how long...

190
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,070
No, no, don't... Don't do that.
That's really not a good question.

191
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,701
- Mr Holmes!
- How long have I known him?

192
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,464
Not really your best line of enquiry.

193
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,065
We met twice, five minutes in total.

194
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,063
I pulled a gun. He tried to blow me up.

195
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,989
I felt we had a special something

196
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,229
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously
claiming this man is an expert?

197
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,589
After knowing the accused
for just five minutes?

198
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,708
Two minutes would have made me
an expert. Five was ample.

199
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,147
Mr Holmes, that's a matter for the jury.

200
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,701
Really?

201
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,709
One librarian, two teachers,

202
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,147
two high-pressure jobs,
probably the City.

203
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,271
Foreman's a medical secretary,

204
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,705
trained abroad,
judging by her short hair.

205
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,020
- Mr Holmes...
- Seven are married

206
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,864
and two are having an affair
with each other, it would seem.

207
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,351
And they've just had
tea and biscuits.

208
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,660
Would you like to know
who ate the wafer?

209
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,665
Mr Holmes!

210
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,784
You've been called here to answer
Miss Sorrel's questions,

211
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,786
not to give us a display
of your intellectual prowess.

212
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,182
Keep your answers brief
and to the point.

213
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,622
Anything else will be treated
as contempt.

214
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,225
Do you think you could survive
for just a few minutes

215
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,790
without showing off?

216
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,061
What did I say?
I said, "Don't get clever."

217
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,582
I can't just turn it on and off
like a tap.

218
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,791
- Well?
- Well what?

219
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,466
You were there for the whole thing.
Up in the gallery, start to finish.

220
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,747
Like you said it would be.
Sat on his backside, never even stirred.

221
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,788
Moriarty's not mounting any defence.

222
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,790
Bank of England, Tower of London,
Pentonville.

223
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,666
Three of the most secure places
in the country

224
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,666
and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in,
no one knows how or why.

225
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,987
- All we know is...
- He ended up in custody.

226
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,346
Don't do that.

227
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,940
- Do what?
- The look.

228
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,505
- Look?
- You're doing the look again.

229
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,105
Well, I can't see it, can I?

230
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,184
- It's my face.
- Yes, and it's doing a thing.

231
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,342
You're doing a "we both know
what's really going on here" face.

232
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,751
- Well, we do.
- No, I don't.

233
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,663
Which is why I find the face
so annoying.

234
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,311
If Moriarty wanted the jewels,
he'd have them.

235
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,428
If he wanted those prisoners freed,
they'd be out on the streets.

236
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,229
The only reason he's still in a prison
cell right now

237
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,029
is because he chose to be there.

238
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,706
Somehow, this is part of his scheme.

239
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,547
Mr Crayhill,
can we have your first witness?

240
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,949
Your honour, we're not calling
any witnesses.

241
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,589
I don't follow.
You've entered a plea of "not guilty".

242
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,785
Nevertheless,
my client is offering no evidence.

243
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,302
The defence rests.

244
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,149
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

245
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,507
...James Moriarty stands accused...
- ...James Moriarty stands accused

246
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,060
of multiple counts
of attempted burglary.

247
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,906
Crimes which, if he's found guilty,

248
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,740
will elicit
a very long custodial sentence

249
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,188
and yet his legal team has...

250
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,787
...chosen to offer
no evidence whatsoever

251
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,066
to support their plea.

252
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,064
I find myself in the unusual position

253
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,828
of recommending a verdict
wholeheartedly.

254
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,623
You must find him guilty.

255
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,100
Guilty.

256
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,989
You must find him guilty.

257
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,466
Coming back.

258
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,744
That was six minutes.

259
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,582
Surprised it took them that long,
to be honest.

260
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,628
There was a queue for the loo.

261
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,024
Have you reached a verdict
on which you all agree?

262
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,262
Not guilty. They found him not guilty.

263
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,468
No defence and Moriarty's walked free.

264
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,422
Sherlock? Are you listening?

265
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,264
He's out. You know he'll be
coming after you.

266
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,341
- Sher...-

267
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,270
Most people knock.

268
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,788
But then, you're not most people,
I suppose.

269
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,425
Kettle's just boiled.

270
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,508
Johann Sebastian
would be appalled.

271
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,910
- May I?
- Please.

272
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,150
You know, while he was
on his deathbed, Bach,

273
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,310
he heard his son at the piano
playing one of his pieces.

274
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,389
The boy stopped
before he got to the end.

275
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,905
And the dying man jumped out of his bed,

276
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,470
ran straight to the piano
and finished it.

277
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,383
Couldn't cope with an unfinished melody.

278
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,825
Neither can you. It's why you've come.

279
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,346
But be honest,
you're just a tiny bit pleased.

280
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,422
- What? With the verdict?
- With me.

281
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,630
Back on the streets.

282
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,985
Every fairy tale needs
a good old-fashioned villain.

283
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,867
You need me or you're nothing.

284
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,828
Because we're just alike, you and I.

285
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,670
Except you're boring.

286
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,583
You're on the side of the angels.

287
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,671
You got to the jury, of course.

288
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,551
I got into the Tower of London,

289
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,385
you think I can't worm my way
into 12 hotel rooms?

290
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,421
Cable network.

291
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,264
Every hotel bedroom
has a personalised TV screen.

292
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,828
And every person
has their pressure point;

293
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,831
Someone that they want
to protect from harm.

294
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,300
Easy peasy.

295
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,864
So how are you going to do it?

296
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,144
- Burn me?
- That's the problem.

297
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,425
The final problem.

298
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,390
Have you worked out what it is yet?

299
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,030
What's the final problem?

300
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,071
I did tell you.

301
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,907
But did you listen?

302
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,111
How hard do you find it
having to say "I don't know"?

303
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,427
- I don't know.
- That's clever. That's very clever.

304
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,871
Awfully clever.

305
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,184
Speaking of clever,
have you told your little friends yet?

306
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,746
- Told them what?
- Why I broke into all those places

307
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,390
- and never took anything?
- No.

308
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,140
- But you understand.
- Obviously.

309
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,261
Off you go, then.

310
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,626
You want me to tell you
what you already know?

311
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,623
No, I want you to prove
that you know it.

312
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,067
You didn't take anything
because you don't need to.

313
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,181
Good.

314
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,910
You'll never need to take
anything ever again.

315
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,744
Very good. Because?

316
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,061
Because nothing, nothing

317
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,746
in the Bank of England, the Tower
of London or Pentonville Prison

318
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,663
could possibly match
the value of the key

319
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,787
that could get you into all three.

320
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,582
I can open any door anywhere
with a few tiny lines of computer code.

321
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,061
No such thing
as a private bank account now.

322
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,109
They're all mine.
No such thing as secrecy.

323
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,421
I own secrecy.

324
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,947
Nuclear codes, I could blow up NATO
in alphabetical order.

325
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,264
In a world of locked rooms,
the man with the key is king.

326
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,391
And honey,
you should see me in a crown.

327
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,511
You were advertising
all the way through the trial.

328
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,662
You were showing the world
what you can do.

329
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,471
And you were helping. Big client list.

330
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,107
Rogue governments,
intelligence communities.

331
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,946
Terror cells.

332
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,262
They all want me. Suddenly I'm Mr Sex.

333
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,831
You can break any bank.

334
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,704
What do you care
about the highest bidder?

335
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,067
I don't.
I just like to watch them all competing.

336
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,781
"Daddy loves me the best!"
Aren't ordinary people adorable?

337
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,941
Well, you know. You've got John

338
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,023
I should get myself a live-in one.

339
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,186
- Why are you doing all of this?
- It must be so funny.

340
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,183
You don't want money or power,
not really.

341
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,826
What is it all for?

342
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,143
I want to solve the problem.

343
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,111
Our problem. The final problem.

344
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,382
It's going to start very soon, Sherlock.

345
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,986
The fall.
But don't be scared.

346
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,382
Failing's just like flying except
there's a more permanent destination.

347
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,343
I never liked riddles.

348
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,466
Learn to.

349
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,302
Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock.

350
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,226
I owe you.

351
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,102
Excuse me,

352
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,828
I'm looking for Mycroft Holmes.

353
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,507
Would you happen to know
if he's around at all?

354
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,430
Can you not hear me?

355
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,427
Yes, all right. Anyone?

356
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,381
Anyone at all know

357
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,506
- where Mycroft Holmes is?-

358
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,820
I've been asked to meet him here.

359
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,310
No takers. Right. Am I invisible?
Can you actually see me?

360
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,430
Thanks, gents.
I've been asked to meet Mycroft Holmes.

361
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,671
Tradition, John
Our traditions define us.

362
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,027
So total silence is traditional, is it?

363
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,989
You can't even say "pass the sugar"?

364
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,630
Three quarters
of the diplomatic service

365
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,829
and half of the Government front bench
all sharing one tea trolley?

366
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,550
It's for the best, believe me.

367
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,624
They don't want a repeat of 1972.

368
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,940
- But we can talk in here.
- You read this stuff?

369
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,626
Caught my eye.

370
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,945
Saturday, they're doing a big exposé.

371
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,101
I'd love to know
where she got her information.

372
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,104
Someone called Brook.
Recognise the name?

373
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,183
- School friend, maybe?-

374
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,986
Of Sherlock's?

375
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,827
But that's not why I asked you here.

376
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,145
- Who's that?
- Don't know him?

377
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,184
- No.
- Never seen his face before?

378
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,224
- Um...
- He's taken a flat in Baker Street,

379
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,540
two doors down from you.

380
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,100
I was thinking of doing
a drinks thing for the neighbours.

381
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,503
I'm not sure you'll want to.

382
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,385
Sulejmani. Albanian hit squad.
Expertly trained killer,

383
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,111
living less than 20 feet
from your front door.

384
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,466
Well, it's a great location.

385
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,110
- Jubilee Line's handy.
- John...

386
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,104
- What's it got to do with me?
- Dyachenko, Ludmila.

387
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,190
Um, actually, I think I have seen her

388
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,264
Russian killer.
She's taken the flat opposite.

389
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,941
Okay.

390
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,060
I'm sensing a pattern here.

391
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,905
In fact,
four top international assassins

392
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,666
relocate to within spitting distance
of 221 b.

393
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,791
- Anything you care to share with me?-

394
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,901
I'm moving?

395
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,548
It's not hard to guess
the common denominator, is it?

396
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,985
You think this is Moriarty?

397
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,625
He promised Sherlock he'd come back.

398
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,504
If this was Moriarty,
he would be dead already.

399
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,708
If not Moriarty, then who?

400
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,348
Why don't you talk to Sherlock
if you're so concerned about him?

401
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,743
God! Don't tell me.

402
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,783
Too much history between us, John.

403
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,386
Old scores, resentments.

404
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,906
Nicked all his Smurfs?
Broke his Action Man?

405
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,702
Finished.

406
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,104
We both know what's coming, John.

407
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,265
Moriarty is obsessed,
he's sworn to destroy his only rival.

408
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,582
So you want me
to watch out for your brother

409
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,071
because he won't accept your help.

410
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,023
If it's not too much trouble.

411
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,182
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

412
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,782
Sherlock, there's something weird...

413
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,100
- What's going on?
- Kidnapping.

414
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,427
Rufus Bruhl, the Ambassador to the US.

415
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,588
- He's in Washington, isn't he?
- Not him. His children.

416
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,908
Max and Claudette. Aged seven and nine.

417
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,061
They're at St Aldate's.

418
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,630
Posh boarding place
down in Surrey.

419
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,782
School broke up.
All the other boarders went home.

420
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,589
Just a few kids remained,
including those two.

421
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,707
The kids have vanished.

422
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,464
The Ambassador's asked
for you personally.

423
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,429
The Reichenbach hero.

424
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,590
Isn't it great to be working
with a celebrity?

425
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,100
- It's all right.
- Miss MacKenzie, House Mistress.

426
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,706
Go easy.

427
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,823
Miss MacKenzie.
You're in charge of pupil welfare,

428
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,584
yet you left this place
wide open last night!

429
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,185
What are you,
an idiot, a drunk or a criminal?

430
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,591
Now, quickly, tell me!

431
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,786
All the doors and windows
were properly bolted.

432
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,143
No one, not even me,
went into their room last night.

433
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,665
You have to believe me!

434
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,310
I do.
I just wanted you to speak quickly.

435
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,667
Miss MacKenzie will need to
breathe into a bag now.

436
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,470
Six grand a term, you'd expect them
to keep the kids safe for you.

437
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,862
So the other kids
had all left on their holidays?

438
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,863
They were the only two
sleeping on this floor.

439
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,789
Absolutely no sign of a break-in.

440
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,147
The intruder must have been
hidden inside someplace.

441
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,741
Show me where the brother slept.

442
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,103
Boy sleeps there every night

443
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,346
gazing at the only light source,
outside in the corridor.

444
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,901
He'd recognise every shape,
every outline.

445
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,341
The silhouette of everyone
who came to the door.

446
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,666
Okay! SO?

447
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,868
So someone approaches the door
who he doesn't recognise.

448
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,023
An intruder. Maybe he can even
see the outline of a weapon.

449
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,305
What would he do

450
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,550
in the precious few seconds
before they came into the room?

451
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,588
How would he use them,
if not to cry out?

452
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,151
This little boy,
this particular little boy,

453
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,030
who reads all those spy books.
What would he do?

454
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,787
- He'd leave a sign.-

455
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,947
Get Anderson.

456
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,344
Linseed oil.

457
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,501
Not much use.
Doesn't lead us to the kidnapper.

458
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,630
- Brilliant, Anderson.
- Really?

459
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,021
Yes, brilliant impression of an idiot.

460
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,301
The floor.

461
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,662
He made a trail for us

462
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,106
The boy was made to walk ahead of them.

463
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,468
- On tiptoe?
- Indicates anxiety.

464
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,224
Gun held to his head.

465
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,390
The girl was pulled beside him,
dragged sideways.

466
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,269
He had his left arm
cradled about her neck.

467
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,664
That's the end of it.
We don't know where they went from here.

468
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,709
Tell us nothing after all.

469
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,065
You're right, Anderson. Nothing.

470
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,068
Except his shoe size, his height,
his gait, his walking pace.

471
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,185
Having fun?

472
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,711
Starting to.

473
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,184
Maybe don't do the smiling.
Kidnapped children?

474
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,423
How did he get past the CCTV?
If all the doors were locked.

475
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,271
He walked in when they weren't locked.

476
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,144
A stranger can't just
walk into a school like that.

477
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,905
Anyone can walk in anywhere
if they pick the right moment.

478
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,984
Yesterday, end of term,

479
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,461
parents milling around,
chauffeurs, staff.

480
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,985
What's one more stranger
among that lot?

481
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,469
He was waiting for them.

482
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,342
All he had to do
was find a place to hide.

483
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,941
- Molly!
- Hello. I'm just getting out.

484
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,545
- No you're not.
- I've got a lunch date.

485
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,065
- Cancel it. You're having lunch with me.
- What?

486
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,347
Need your help.

487
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,343
It's one of your boyfriends,
we're trying to track him down.

488
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,263
- He's been a bit naughty.
- It's Moriarty.

489
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,580
Of course it's Moriarty.

490
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,789
Jim actually wasn't even my boyfriend.
We went out three times. I ended it.

491
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,261
Yes, and then he stole the Crown jewels,
broke into the Bank of England

492
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,671
and organised a prison break
at Pentonville.

493
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,787
For the sake of law and order,

494
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,704
I suggest you avoid all future
attempts at a relationship, Molly.

495
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,301
Oil, John.

496
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,985
The oil in the kidnapper's footprint.
It'll lead us to Moriarty.

497
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,187
All the chemical traces on his shoe
have been preserved.

498
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,625
The sole of the shoe is like a passport.

499
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,429
If we're lucky, we can see everything
that he's been up to.

500
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,864
I need that analysis.

501
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,264
- Alkaline.
- Thank you, John.

502
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,109
- Molly.
- Yes.

503
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,425
Glycerol molecule.

504
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,028
What are you?

505
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,988
What did you mean, "I owe you"?

506
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,704
You said, "I owe you."

507
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,820
You were muttering it
while you were working.

508
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,425
Nothing. Mental note.

509
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,421
You're a bit like my dad.
He's dead. Sorry.

510
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,309
Molly, please don't feel the need
to make conversation.

511
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,109
It's really not your area.

512
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,942
When he was dying,
he was always cheerful, he was lovely.

513
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,466
Except when he thought no one could see.

514
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,186
- I saw him once. He looked sad.
- Molly...

515
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,469
You look sad.
When you think he can't see you.

516
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,702
Are you okay? Don't just say you are,

517
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,066
because I know what that means,

518
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,746
looking sad when you think
no one can see you.

519
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,428
- You can see me.
- I don't count.

520
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,188
What I'm trying to say is that
if there's anything I can do,

521
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,262
anything you need, anything at all,

522
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,948
you can have me.
No, I just mean... I mean...

523
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,826
If there's anything you need.
It's fine.

524
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,308
But what could I need from you?

525
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,903
Nothing. I don't know.

526
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,980
But you could probably say
thank you, actually.

527
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,986
Thank you.

528
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,063
I'm just going to go and get some
crisps. Do you want anything?

529
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,108
It's okay. I know you don't.

530
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,709
- Well, actually, maybe I'll...
- I know you don't.

531
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,231
Sherlock?

532
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,826
This envelope was in her trunk.

533
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,944
- There's another one.
- What?

534
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,991
On our doorstep. Found it today.

535
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,150
Yes, and look at that.

536
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,586
Look at that. Exactly the same seal.

537
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,266
- Bread crumbs.
- It was there when I got back.

538
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,068
A little trace of bread crumbs,
hardback copy of fairy tales.

539
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,981
Two children led into the forest
by a wicked father

540
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,028
follow a little trail of bread crumbs.

541
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,261
That's Hansel and Gretel.

542
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,749
What sort of kidnapper leaves clues?

543
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,347
The sort that likes to boast.
The sort that thinks it's all a game.

544
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,270
He sat in our flat and he said
these exact words to me.

545
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,989
All fairly tales need
a good old-fashioned villain.

546
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,666
The fifth substance.

547
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,748
It's part of the tale.
The witch's house.

548
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,581
The glycerol molecule.

549
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,504
What's that?

550
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,184
It's used in making chocolate.

551
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,950
This fax arrived an hour ago.

552
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,950
What have you got for us?

553
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,021
We need to find a place in the city

554
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,182
where all five of these things
intersect.

555
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,740
Chalk, asphalt, brick dust,
vegetation...

556
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,021
What the hell is this? Chocolate?

557
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,909
I think we're looking for
a disused sweet factory.

558
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,909
We need to narrow that down.
A sweet factory with asphalt?

559
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,062
No, no, no. Too general.

560
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,230
Need something more specific,
chalk, chalky clay.

561
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,825
That's a far thinner band of geology.

562
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,145
Brick dust.

563
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,262
Building site. Bricks from the 19505.

564
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,422
There's thousands of building sites
in London!

565
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,267
- I've got people out looking.
- So have I!

566
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,502
Homeless network.
Faster than the police.

567
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,781
Far more relaxed about taking bribes.

568
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,867
John.

569
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,505
Rhododendron ponticom.

570
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,581
Matches.

571
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,106
- Addlestone.
- What?

572
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,308
There's a mile of disused factories
between the river and the park.

573
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,745
- It matches everything.
- Come on.

574
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,300
Come on!

575
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,421
You, look over there.
Look everywhere.

576
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,344
Spread out, please. Spread out!

577
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,790
This was alight moments ago.
They're still here!

578
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,581
Sweet wrappers.
What's he been feeding you?

579
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,949
Hansel and Gretel.

580
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,546
- Mercury.
- What?

581
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,463
The papers,
they're painted with mercury. Lethal.

582
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,463
- The more of the stuff they ate...
- It was killing them.

583
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,668
It's not enough to kill them
on its own.

584
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,941
Taken in large enough quantities,
eventually it would kill them.

585
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,863
He didn't need to be there
for the execution.

586
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,223
Murder by remote control.
He could be 1,000 miles away.

587
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,068
The hungrier they got,
the more they ate,

588
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,383
the faster they died. Neat.

589
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,780
Sherlock.

590
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,749
Over here!

591
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,463
We've got you, don't worry.

592
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,547
Right, then.
The professionals have finished

593
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,146
if the amateurs want to go in
and have their turn.

594
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,463
Now, remember that she's in shock
and she's just seven years old so...

595
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,986
Anything you can do to...

596
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,983
- Not be myself.
- Yeah.

597
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,505
Might be helpful.

598
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,547
Claudette, I...

599
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,746
-- No, no,

600
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,185
I know it's been hard for you,
Claudette.

601
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,386
- Listen to me.-

602
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,706
Get out!

603
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,506
- Makes no sense.
- Kid's traumatised.

604
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,140
Something about Sherlock
reminds her of the kidnapper.

605
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,551
What's she said?

606
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,224
Hasn't uttered another syllable.

607
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,143
- And the boy?
- No, he's unconscious.

608
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,631
Still in intensive care.

609
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,427
Well, don't let it get to you,

610
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,185
I always feel like screaming
when you walk into a room.

611
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,950
In fact, so do most people.

612
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,581
Come on.

613
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,625
Brilliant work you did,
finding those kids

614
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,065
from just a footprint.

615
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,949
- It's really amazing.
- Thank you.

616
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,306
Unbelievable.

617
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,821
You okay?

618
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,631
Thinking.

619
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,903
This is my cab, you get the next one.

620
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,830
- Why?
- You might talk.

621
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,821
What the hell is this? Chocolate?

622
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,981
We're looking for
a disused sweet factory.

623
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,028
-- Gel' out'!

624
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,820
Problem?

625
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,309
...nation,
this is stunning eveningwear

626
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,270
- sent from us here at London...
- Could you turn that off, please?

627
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,911
As you can see,
the set comprises of a beautiful...

628
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,345
Can you turn this off?

629
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,586
Accompanied by four...

630
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,508
Hello. Are you ready for the story?

631
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,141
This is the story of Sir Boast-A-Lot.

632
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,828
A footprint, that's all he has.

633
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,341
A footprint.

634
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,708
Yeah, well, you know what he's like,
CSI Baker Street.

635
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,350
Well, our boys couldn't have done it.

636
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,225
Well, that's why we need him.
He's better.

637
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,311
- That's one explanation.
- And what's the other?

638
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,783
Sir Boast-A -Lot was the bravest and
cleverest knight at the round table.

639
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,468
But soon, the other knights
began to grow tired of his stories

640
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,067
about how brave he was
and how many dragons he'd slain.

641
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,341
And soon they began to wonder,

642
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,710
are Sir Boast-A -Lot's stories even true?

643
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,223
Only he could have found
that evidence.

644
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,666
No.

645
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,028
And then the girl screams
her head off when she sees him,

646
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,263
a man she has never seen before.

647
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,865
Unless she had seen him before.

648
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,510
- What's your point?
- You know what my point is,

649
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,230
you just don't want to think about it.

650
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,906
So one of the knights
went to King Arthur

651
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:35,464
and said "I don't believe
Sir Boast-A -Lot's stories. "

652
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:41,391
He's just a big old liar who makes
things up to make himself look good.

653
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,060
You're not seriously suggesting
he's involved, are you?

654
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,063
I say we have to entertain
the possibility.

655
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,469
And then even the King
began to wonder...

656
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,262
But that wasn't the end
of Sir Boast-A -Lot's problem.

657
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,107
No.

658
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,829
That wasn't the final problem.

659
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,350
The end.

660
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,627
Stop the cab. Stop the cab!

661
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,465
What was that?

662
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,905
What was that?

663
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,186
No charge.

664
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,501
Look out!

665
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,907
Thank you.

666
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,631
Sherlock!

667
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,750
That is him. It's him.

668
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,104
Sulejmani or something.
Mycroft showed me his files.

669
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,667
A big Albanian gangster
who lives two doors down from us.

670
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,230
He died because I shook his hand.

671
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,347
- What do you mean?
- Saved my life,

672
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,945
but he couldn't touch me. Why?

673
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,029
Four assassins
living right on our doorstep.

674
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,909
They didn't come here to kill me.

675
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,910
They have to keep me alive.

676
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,707
I've got something
that all of them want.

677
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,505
But if one of them approaches me...

678
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,790
The others kill them
before they can get it.

679
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,465
All of the attention
is focused on me.

680
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,102
There's a surveillance web
closing in on us right now.

681
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,101
So, what have you got
that's so important?

682
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,828
We need to ask about the dusting.

683
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,346
Precise details.
In the last week, what's been cleaned?

684
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,185
- Well, Tuesday I did your lino...
- No, in here. This room.

685
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,388
This is where we'll find it.
Any break in the dust line.

686
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,066
You can put back anything but dust.
Dust is eloquent.

687
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,667
- What's he on about?
- I don't know.

688
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,861
- Cameras. We're being watched.
- What?

689
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,065
Cameras? Here?

690
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,268
-- I'm in my nightie.

691
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,464
- No, Inspector.
- What?

692
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,870
The answer is no.

693
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,988
- You haven't heard the question.
- You want to take me to the station.

694
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,221
Just saving you the trouble of asking.

695
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,230
- Sherlock...
- The scream?

696
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,347
Yeah.

697
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,468
Who was it? Donovan?
I bet it was Donovan.

698
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,429
Am I somehow responsible
for the kidnapping?

699
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,980
Moriarty's smart.

700
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,267
He planted that doubt in her head.

701
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,429
That little nagging sensation you
got to have to be strong to resist.

702
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,750
You can't kill an idea, can you?

703
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,184
Not once it's made a home...

704
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,026
there.

705
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,144
- Will you come?
- One photograph, that's his next move.

706
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,950
Moriarty's game. First the scream,

707
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,307
then a photograph of me
being taken in for questioning.

708
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,431
He wants to destroy me inch by inch.

709
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,270
It is a game, Lestrade,
and not one I'm willing to play.

710
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,500
Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.

711
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,301
- He'll be deciding.
- Deciding?

712
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,261
Whether to come back
with a warrant and arrest me.

713
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,944
- You think?
- Standard procedure.

714
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,625
Should have gone with him.

715
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,431
- People will think...
- I don't care what people think.

716
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,181
You'd care if they thought
you were stupid or wrong.

717
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,705
No, that would just make them
stupid or wrong.

718
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,386
Sherlock, I don't want
the world believing you're...

719
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,027
That I am what?

720
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,506
A fraud

721
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,110
- You're worried they're right.
- What?

722
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,944
- You're worried they're right about me.
- No.

723
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,068
That's why you're so upset, you can't
even entertain the possibility

724
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,381
that they might be right, you're afraid
that you've been taken in as well.

725
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,461
No, I'm not.

726
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,144
Moriarty is playing with your mind, too.

727
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,904
Can't you see what's going on?

728
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,147
- No, I know you're for real.
- A hundred percent?

729
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,667
Nobody could fake being
such an annoying dick all the time.

730
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,620
- Sherlock Holmes?
- Yes, sir.

731
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,942
That bloke that's been in the press?

732
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,703
I thought he was
some sort of private eye?

733
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,109
- He is.
- We've been consulting with him,

734
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,705
that's what you're telling me?

735
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,226
Not used him on any proper cases,
though, have we?

736
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,706
Well, one or two.

737
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,191
Twenty or 30.

738
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,788
- What?
- Look, I'm not the only senior officer

739
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,789
- who did this...
- Shut up.

740
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:11,301
An amateur detective given access
to all sorts of classified information?

741
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,787
And now he's a suspect in a case?

742
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,545
- With all due respect...
- You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade.

743
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,861
Now, go and fetch him in, right now.

744
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,941
Do it!

745
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,785
Proud of yourselves?

746
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:32,349
What if it's not just this case? What if
he's done this to us every single time?

747
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,227
So, I've still got some friends
on the force.

748
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,031
It's Lestrade. Says they're all
coming over here right now.

749
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,304
Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs,

750
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,269
every single officer
you ever made feel like a tit.

751
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,586
Which is a lot of people.

752
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,230
Yoo hoo!

753
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,511
Sorry, am I interrupting?

754
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,742
Some chap delivered a parcel. I forgot.

755
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,710
Marked perishable.
I had to sign for it.

756
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,508
Funny name. German.
Like the fairy tales.

757
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,709
Burnt to a crisp.

758
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,784
- What does it mean?-

759
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,749
-- I'll go.

760
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,111
- Sherlock.
- Excuse me, Mrs Hudson.

761
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,910
We need to talk to you!

762
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,108
Don't barge in like that.

763
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,982
- Have you got a warrant? Have you?
- Leave it, John.

764
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,905
Me? But...

765
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,220
Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of abduction and kidnapping.

766
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,301
- It's all right, John.
- He's not resisting.

767
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,144
No, it's not all right.
This is ridiculous.

768
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,665
Get him downstairs, now.

769
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,311
- You know you don't...
- Don't try to interfere

770
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,348
or I shall arrest you, too.

771
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,588
- You done?
- I said it.

772
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,340
- First time we met.
- Don't bother.

773
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,741
Solving crimes won't be enough.

774
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,421
One day, he'll cross the line.

775
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,703
Now ask yourself, what sort of man
would kidnap those kids

776
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,067
just so he can impress us all
by finding them?

777
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,342
- Donovan? That's our man?
- Sir.

778
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,230
Yes, sir.

779
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,901
Looked a bit of a weirdo,
if you ask me.

780
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,870
Often are, these vigilante types.

781
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,061
What are you looking at?

782
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,789
Are you all right, sir?

783
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,068
-- Joining me?

784
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,786
Yeah.

785
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,387
Apparently it's against the law
to chin the Chief Superintendent.

786
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,390
Bit awkward, this.

787
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,151
There's no one to bail us.

788
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,541
I was thinking more about
our imminent and daring escape.

789
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,742
All units to 2-7.

790
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,424
- What?
- All units to two...

791
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,261
Ladies and gentlemen,
will you all please get on your knees?

792
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,988
- Now would be good!
- Do as he says!

793
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,141
just so you're aware,
the gun is his idea,

794
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,070
- I'm just, you know...
- My hostage!

795
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,983
Hostage, yes, that works.

796
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,949
That works. So what now?

797
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,583
Doing what Moriarty wants.

798
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,947
Becoming a fugitive. Run.

799
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,909
Get after him, Lestrade!

800
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,424
- Take my hand.-

801
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,743
Now people will definitely talk.

802
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,504
- The gun!
- Leave it.

803
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,790
Sherlock, wait!

804
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,985
We're going to need to coordinate.

805
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:44,901
Go to your right.

806
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,981
Go to your right.

807
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,507
Everybody wants to believe it.
That's what makes it so clever

808
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,224
A lie that's preferable to the truth.

809
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,870
All my brilliant deductions
were just a sham.

810
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,341
No one feels inadequate.
Sherlock Holmes is just an ordinary man.

811
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,309
What about Mycroft? He could help us.

812
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,944
If he thinks I want a reconciliation?

813
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,431
Now's not really the moment.

814
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,351
Sherlock, Sherlock!

815
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,307
We're being followed.
I knew we couldn't outrun the police.

816
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,621
It's not the police. It's one of our
new neighbours from Baker Street.

817
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,064
Let's see if he can
give us some answers.

818
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,666
Where are we going?

819
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,430
We going to jump in front of that bus

820
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,189
Tell me what you want from me.

821
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,667
Tell me!

822
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,666
He left it at your flat.

823
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,308
- Who?
- Moriarty.

824
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,141
What?

825
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,341
The computer key code.

826
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,468
Of course, he's selling it.

827
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,431
The programme he used
to break into the Tower.

828
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,503
He planted it when he came around.

829
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,824
It's a game-changer.

830
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,991
It's a key.
It could break into any system

831
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,221
and it's sitting in our flat right now.

832
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,825
That's why he left that message

833
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,301
telling everyone where to come.
"Get Sherlock."

834
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,111
We need to get back into the flat
and search.

835
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,909
CID will be camped out.
Why plant it on you?

836
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,383
It's another subtle way
of smearing my name,

837
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,145
now I'm best pals
with all those criminals.

838
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,541
Yeah, well, have you seen this?

839
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,866
A kiss and tell.
Some bloke called Rich Brook.

840
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,831
Who is he?

841
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,142
Too late to go on the record?

842
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,786
Congratulations.
The truth about Sherlock Holmes.

843
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,987
The scoop that everybody wanted
and you've got it. Bravo.

844
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,903
I gave you your opportunity.

845
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,586
I wanted to be on your side, remember?

846
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:26,981
You turned me down.

847
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,188
And then, lo and behold, someone
turns up and spills all the beans.

848
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,786
How utterly convenient. Who is Brook?

849
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:36,302
Come on, Kitty. No one trusts
the voice at the end of a telephone.

850
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,428
There were all those
furtive little meetings in cafés,

851
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,107
those sessions in the hotel room
where he gabbled into your Dictaphone.

852
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,830
How do you know
that you can trust him?

853
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,625
A man turns up
with the Holy Grail in his pocket.

854
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,270
What were his credentials?

855
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,385
Darling, they didn't have
any ground coffee,

856
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,507
so I just got normal.

857
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,665
You said that
they wouldn't find me here.

858
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,266
- You said that I'd be safe here.
- You are safe, Richard.

859
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,422
I'm a witness. He wouldn't harm you
in front of witnesses.

860
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,423
So, that's your source?

861
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,503
Moriarty is Richard Brook?

862
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:17,744
Of course he's Richard Brook, there is
no Moriarty, there never has been.

863
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,107
- What are you talking about?
- Look him up.

864
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,629
Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes
hired to be Moriarty.

865
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,745
Doctor Watson, I...

866
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,627
I know you're a good man. Don't...
Don't... Don't hurt me.

867
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,387
No, you're Moriarty! He's Moriarty!

868
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,622
We've met, remember?
You were going to blow me up!

869
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,107
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

870
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,982
He paid me. I needed the work.

871
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,030
- I'm an actor, I was out of work...
- Sherlock, you'd better explain,

872
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,990
- 'cause I am not getting this.
- I'll be doing the explaining.

873
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,347
In print. It's all here.

874
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,185
Conclusive proof.

875
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,663
You invented James Moriarty,
your nemesis.

876
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:02,981
Invented him?

877
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,903
Invented all the crimes, actually.

878
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,108
And to cap it all,
you made up a master villain.

879
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,990
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Ask him, he's right here!

880
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,061
Just ask him!

881
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,341
- Tell him, Richard.
- No, for god's sake,

882
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,026
- this man was on trial.
- Yes, and you paid him.

883
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,625
Paid him to take the rap.

884
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,907
Promised you'd rig the jury

885
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,506
Not exactly a West End role,
but I'll bet the money was good.

886
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,262
But not so good
he didn't want to sell his story.

887
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:27,230
I am sorry. I am, I am sorry.

888
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,588
So, this is the story
that you're going to publish?

889
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,824
The big conclusion of it all,
Moriarty is an actor?

890
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,709
He knows I am. I have proof.

891
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,623
I have proof, show him.
Can you show them something?

892
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,350
Yeah, show me something.

893
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:47,346
I'm on TV, I'm on kids TV.
I'm the Storyteller.

894
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,346
I'm the Storyteller. It's on DVD.

895
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,350
Just tell him.

896
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,627
It's all coming out now. It's all over.

897
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,862
Just tell them, just tell them.
Tell him!

898
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,908
It's all over... No! No!
Don't you touch me.

899
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,550
Don't you lay a finger on me.

900
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,424
Stop it, stop it now!

901
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:13,947
No, no, don't hurt me.

902
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,671
- Don't let him get away!
- Leave him alone!

903
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,790
No, no, no, he'll have backup.

904
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,544
Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?

905
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,191
I look at you now and I can read you.

906
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,707
And you repel me.

907
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,748
Can he do that?
Completely change his identity?

908
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,347
- Make you the criminal?
- He's got my whole life story.

909
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,661
That's what you do. You sell a big lie.

910
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,742
You wrap it up in a truth
to make it palatable.

911
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,231
It's your word against his.

912
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,430
He's been sowing doubt into
people's minds for the last 24 hours.

913
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,862
There's only one thing he needs to do
to complete his game and that's to...

914
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,860
Sherlock?

915
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,226
There's something I need to do.

916
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,506
- What, can I help?
- No, on my own.

917
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,982
You're wrong, you know.

918
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,710
You do count.

919
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:29,023
You've always counted
and I've always trusted you.

920
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,384
But you were right.

921
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,945
I'm not okay.

922
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,744
Tell me what's wrong.

923
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,391
Molly, I think I'm going to die.

924
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,465
- What do you need?
- If I wasn't everything

925
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,030
that you think I am,

926
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,307
everything that I think I am,

927
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,431
would you still want to help me?

928
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,229
What do you need?

929
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,701
You.

930
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:25,462
She has really done her homework,
Miss Riley.

931
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,670
There's things that only someone
close to Sherlock could know.

932
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,667
Have you seen
your brother's address book lately?

933
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,468
There's two names, yours and mine.

934
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,464
And Moriarty didn't get this stuff
from me.

935
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,940
- John...
- So, how does it work, then?

936
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,825
Your relationship?
You go out for a coffee

937
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,141
now and then? You and Jim?

938
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:52,984
Your own brother and you blabbed
about his entire life

939
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,149
to this maniac?

940
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:01,582
- I never intend... I never dreamt...
- This, see, this...

941
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,869
is what you were trying to tell me,
isn't it?

942
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,863
Watch his back,
'cause I've made a mistake.

943
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:12,431
How did you meet him?

944
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,387
People like him, we...

945
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,546
know about them, we watch them.

946
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,870
But James Moriarty

947
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,061
the most dangerous criminal mind
the world has ever seen,

948
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,546
and in his pocket's the ultimate weapon,
a key code.

949
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:39,267
A few lines of computer code
that can unlock any door.

950
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,822
And you abducted him?

951
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,667
To try and find the key code.

952
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:49,828
- Interrogated him for weeks.
- And?

953
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,943
He wouldn't play along.

954
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,028
He just sat there,
staring into the darkness.

955
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,431
The only thing that made him open up...

956
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,428
I could get him to talk. just a little.

957
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,749
But...

958
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,147
in return, you had to offer him
Sherlock's life story.

959
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,148
So there's one big lie,

960
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,384
Sherlock's a fraud.

961
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,703
But people will swallow it
because the rest of it is true.

962
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,430
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed,
right?

963
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:38,671
And you have given him
the perfect ammunition.

964
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,627
-- John.

965
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,501
I'm sorry.

966
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,510
Please.

967
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,230
Tell him, would you?

968
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,825
Got your message.

969
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,868
The computer code is key to this.
If we find it, we can use it,

970
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,544
beat Moriarty at his own game.

971
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,667
- What do you mean, use it?
- He's used it

972
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,071
to create a false identity.

973
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,021
So we can use it to break into
the records and destroy Richard Brook.

974
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,745
And bring back Jim Moriarty again.

975
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,387
Somewhere in 221 b, somewhere,
on the day of the verdict,

976
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,191
he left it hidden.

977
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,749
- What did he touch?
- An apple, nothing else.

978
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,862
- Did he write anything down?
- No.

979
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,311
Yeah, speaking.

980
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,783
What? What happened? Is she okay?

981
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,861
My God.

982
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:34,940
- Right. Yes, I'm coming.-

983
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,067
- What is it?
- Paramedics.

984
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,029
- Mrs Hudson's been shot.
- What? How?

985
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,387
Well, probably one of the killers
you managed to attract. Jesus.

986
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,543
- Jesus! She's dying, Sherlock. Let's go.
- You go, I'm busy.

987
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,187
- Busy?
- Thinking, I need to think.

988
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,069
You need to...
Doesn't she mean anything to you?

989
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,427
You once half killed a man
because he laid a finger on her.

990
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,265
- She's my landlady.
- She's dying,

991
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,827
you machine. Sod this.

992
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,543
Sod this.
You stay here if you want. On your own.

993
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,463
Alone is what I have.
Alone protects me.

994
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,588
No, friends protect people.

995
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,861
Well.

996
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,064
Here we are at last.

997
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,023
You and me, Sherlock.

998
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,586
And our problem, the final problem,

999
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,508
stayin' alive.

1000
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,303
So boring, isn't it?

1001
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,985
It's just...

1002
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,701
staying...

1003
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,746
All my life, I've been searching
for a distraction

1004
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,711
and you were the best distraction
and now I don't even have you.

1005
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,630
Because I've beaten you.

1006
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,989
And you know what?
In the end, it was easy.

1007
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,026
It was easy.

1008
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,865
Now I've got to go back
to playing with the ordinary people.

1009
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:24,149
And it turns out you're ordinary,
just like all of them.

1010
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,786
Well.

1011
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,750
Did you almost start to wonder
if I was real?

1012
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,264
Did I nearly get you?

1013
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,548
Richard Brook.

1014
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,501
Nobody seems to get the joke.

1015
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,705
- But you do.
- Of course.

1016
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,941
Attaboy.

1017
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,500
Rich Brook in German is Reichenbach.

1018
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:48,945
The case that made my name.

1019
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,261
Just trying to have some fun.

1020
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,668
Good, you got that, too.

1021
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,021
Beats like digits.

1022
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,783
Every beat is a one,
every rest is a zero.

1023
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:11,431
Binary code. That's why all those
assassins tried to save my life.

1024
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,229
It was hidden on me,
hidden inside my head.

1025
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,509
A few simple lines of computer code
that can break into any system.

1026
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,984
Told all my clients.

1027
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:24,068
- Last one to Sherlock is a sissy.
- Yes, but now that it's up here,

1028
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,791
I can use it to alter all the records.

1029
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:31,588
I can kill Rich Brook
and bring back Jim Moriarty.

1030
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:37,826
No, no, no, no, no, this is too easy.

1031
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,905
This is too easy.
There is no key, doofus!

1032
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:48,742
Those digits are meaningless.
They're utterly meaningless.

1033
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,549
You don't really think
a couple of lines of computer code

1034
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,304
are going to crash the world
around our ears?

1035
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,906
I'm disappointed.
I'm disappointed in you.

1036
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:59,506
- Ordinary Sherlock.
- But the rhythm...

1037
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:03,027
Partita No 7.
Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.

1038
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,910
- Then how did you...
- Now, how did I break into the bank,

1039
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:08,790
to the Tower, to the prison?
Daylight robbery.

1040
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,151
All it takes
is some willing participants.

1041
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,949
I knew you'd fall for it.
That's your weakness.

1042
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:24,269
You always want everything to be clever.
Now, shall we finish the game?

1043
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,623
One final act.
Glad you chose a tall building.

1044
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,709
Nice way to do it.

1045
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,384
Do it? Do... Do what?

1046
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,145
Yes, of course.

1047
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,671
My suicide.

1048
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,101
Genius detective proved to be a fraud.

1049
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,831
I read it in the paper,
so it must be true.

1050
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,709
I love newspapers.

1051
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,341
Fairy tales.

1052
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,942
And pretty grim ones, too.

1053
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,467
God, John, you made me jump.

1054
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:09,581
Is everything okay now with the police?
Has, um, Sherlock sorted it all out?

1055
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,109
My God.

1056
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,341
Taxi!

1057
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,266
Taxi!

1058
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,422
No, no, no, no, police!

1059
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,184
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot.

1060
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,060
I can still prove that you created
an entirely false identity.

1061
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,189
Just kill yourself,
it's a lot less effort.

1062
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,101
Go on.

1063
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,421
For me.

1064
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,630
Please?

1065
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,501
You're insane.

1066
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,061
You're just getting that now? Whoa!

1067
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,861
Okay.

1068
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,703
Let me give you
a little extra incentive.

1069
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,788
Your friends will die if you don't.

1070
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,583
John?
- Not just John. Everyone

1071
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,743
- Mrs Hudson?
- Everyone.

1072
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:09,909
- Lestrade?
- Three bullets, three gunmen,

1073
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:13,423
three victims.
There's no stopping them now.

1074
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,467
Unless my people see you jump.

1075
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:29,384
You can have me arrested.
You can torture me.

1076
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,823
You can do anything you like with me.

1077
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:34,665
But nothing's going to prevent them
from pulling the trigger.

1078
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:38,187
Your only three friends in the world
will die. Unless...

1079
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,469
Unless I kill myself,
complete your story.

1080
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,467
You've got to admit, that's sexier.

1081
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,822
And I die in disgrace.

1082
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,467
Of course, that's the point of this.

1083
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,101
Look, you got an audience now.

1084
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,505
Off you POP...

1085
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,381
Go on.

1086
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,782
I told you how this ends.

1087
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:10,269
Your death is the only thing
that's going to call off the killers.

1088
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,821
I'm certainly not going to do it.

1089
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,510
Would you give me one moment, please?

1090
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,665
One moment of privacy.

1091
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,221
Please?

1092
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,869
Of course.

1093
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,386
What?

1094
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,825
What is it?

1095
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,470
What did I miss?

1096
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,269
You're not going to do it?

1097
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:07,944
So the killers can be called off, then,
there's a recall code

1098
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,306
or a word or a number.

1099
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,143
I don't have to die...

1100
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:17,267
...if I've got you.

1101
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,348
You think you can
make me stop the order?

1102
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,390
- You think you can make me do that?
- Yes.

1103
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,666
So do you.

1104
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,186
Sherlock, you're big brother and all
the king's horses

1105
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:31,103
couldn't make me do a thing
I didn't want to.

1106
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,581
Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember?

1107
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,064
I am you.

1108
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:40,707
Prepared to do anything.
Prepared to burn.

1109
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,266
Prepared to do what ordinary people
won't do.

1110
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:49,629
You want me to shake hands with you
in Hell? I shall not disappoint you.

1111
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:52,741
Nah.

1112
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,584
You talk big.

1113
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,068
Nah. You're ordinary.

1114
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:03,383
You're ordinary,
you're on the side of the angels.

1115
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:06,271
I may be on the side of the angels,

1116
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:11,301
but don't think for one second
that I am one of them.

1117
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,707
No.

1118
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,345
You're not.

1119
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,706
I see.

1120
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:38,029
You're not ordinary. No.

1121
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,306
You're me.

1122
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,703
You're me.

1123
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,831
Thank you,

1124
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,264
Sherlock Holmes.

1125
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,704
Thank you.

1126
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,586
Bless you.

1127
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:12,229
As long as I'm alive,
you can save your friends.

1128
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:14,189
You've got a way out.

1129
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:16,947
Well, good luck with that.

1130
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,664
Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye.

1131
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,026
Hello?

1132
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,625
- John.
- Hey, Sherlock, you okay?

1133
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,990
Turn around and walk back
the way you came.

1134
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:49,189
- No, I'm coming in.
- Just do as I ask!

1135
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:51,429
- Please.
- Where?

1136
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:56,342
- Stop there.
- Sherlock?

1137
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,300
Okay, look up, I'm on the rooftop.

1138
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,780
God.

1139
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:06,670
I... I... I can't come down,
so we'll just have to do it like this.

1140
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,062
- What's going on?
- An apology.

1141
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:16,420
- It's all true.
- What?

1142
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,661
Everything they said about me.

1143
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:23,030
I invented Moriarty.

1144
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,106
Why are you saying this?

1145
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,147
I'm a fake.

1146
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,703
- Sherlock.
- The newspapers were right all along.

1147
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:43,825
I want you to ted Lestrade-
I want you to ted Mrs Hudson.

1148
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,466
And Molly.

1149
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,150
In fact, tell anyone
who will listen to you

1150
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,503
that I created Moriarty

1151
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,421
for my own purposes.

1152
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:58,271
Okay, shut up, Sherlock, shut up.
The first time we met.

1153
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,390
The first time we met,
you knew all about my sister.

1154
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,384
- Right?
- Nobody could be that clever.

1155
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,504
- You could.-

1156
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,226
I researched you.

1157
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:20,385
Before we met, I discovered
everything that I could to impress you.

1158
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,547
It's a trick. just a magic trick.

1159
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:27,742
No, all right, stop it now.

1160
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,902
No, stay exactly where you are.

1161
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,150
- Don't move.
- All rig ht.

1162
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,866
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

1163
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:41,145
- Please, will you do this for me?
- Do what?

1164
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:44,021
This phone call, it's; um-.

1165
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:46,271
It's my note.

1166
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,828
It's what people do, don't they?

1167
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,351
Leave a note?

1168
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,230
Leave a note when?

1169
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:01,591
- Goodbye, John.
- No, don't.

1170
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:13,787
Sherlock!

1171
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,541
Sherlock.

1172
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,341
Sherlock.

1173
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:07,741
Sherlock.

1174
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:12,983
I'm a doctor. Let me come through.
Let me come through, please.

1175
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:15,540
No, he's my friend.
He's my friend. Please.

1176
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,628
Please, let me just

1177
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:42,821
Jesus, no...

1178
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,626
God, no.

1179
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,021
God.

1180
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:27,108
There's stuff
that you wanted to say,

1181
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,787
- but didn't say it.
- Yeah.

1182
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,549
Say it now.

1183
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,501
No.

1184
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:46,383
I'm sorry, I can't.

1185
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,902
There's all of this stuff.

1186
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,028
All the science equipment.

1187
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,224
I left it all in boxes.
I don't know what needs doing.

1188
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:05,106
I thought I'd take it to a school.

1189
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,990
- Would you...
- I can't go back to the flat again.

1190
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:10,789
Not at the moment.

1191
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,551
I'm angry.

1192
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,585
It's okay, John.

1193
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:18,866
There's nothing unusual in that.

1194
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:21,261
That's the way he made everyone feel.

1195
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:24,708
All those marks on my table
and the noise.

1196
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:27,267
Firing guns at half past one
in the morning.

1197
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:30,105
- Yeah.
- Bloody specimens in my fridge.

1198
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:32,786
Imagine, keeping bodies
where there's food.

1199
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:35,101
- Yes.
- And the fighting.

1200
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,700
Drove me up the wall
with all his carryings on.

1201
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:40,386
Yeah, listen,
I'm not actually that angry, okay?

1202
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:43,703
Okay, I'll leave you alone to,
you know...

1203
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,661
Um...

1204
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:02,269
Right, you... You told me once...

1205
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,261
that you weren't a hero

1206
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,586
Um...

1207
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,305
There were times I didn't even think
you were human

1208
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,391
but let me tell you this,
you were the best man

1209
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:17,989
and the most human human being

1210
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,667
that I've ever known
and no one will ever convince me

1211
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,947
that you told me a lie, okay? So...

1212
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,343
there.

1213
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,345
I was...

1214
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,581
I was so alone.

1215
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:39,342
And I owe you so much.

1216
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:46,700
Please, there's just one more thing
right? One more thing.

1217
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:50,705
One more miracle, Sherlock, for me.
Don't be...

1218
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,706
dead.

1219
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:59,069
Would you, just for me, just stop it?
Stop this.
