1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,940
Elizabeth! Hey!

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,310
Elizabeth!

3
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,540
I'm not supposed to tell anyone this, but according to Barry,

4
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,460
the Colonel is trying to expose the people in the military involved in that Lab 5 place.

5
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,340
Research Laboratory 5...

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,270
Al...

7
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,360
I have to go.

8
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,800
I might find out something about
the person who killed Mr. Hughes.

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,270
Hey, hang on! What about the secret to your body?

10
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,440
I'll tell you when I get back.

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,770
What's up with that?!

12
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,260
Well, I'm off.

13
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,160
Make sure you come back.

14
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,260
Yes. I promise.

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,800
Done already?

16
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,050
Can I eat you now?

17
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,440
Shut up, you're in the way!

18
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,730
Lieutenant!

19
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,210
Out of bullets? Out of bullets?

20
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,960
Then it's time for dinner!

21
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
Looks like I made it in time.

22
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,340
Colonel...

23
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,580
Why did you come?!

24
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,440
Despite whatever may have happened to us, if you had just ignored it, you could have escaped suspicion!

25
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,690
And yet, you came out here?!

26
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,030
Seriously, are you an idiot?!

27
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,030
Okay, okay. I'm an idiot.

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,870
What the hell was that guy...

29
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,180
Colonel! Our target is on the run!

30
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,230
Sergeant, pull out!

31
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,500
Don't leave a trace!

32
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,340
Hayate, you stay with the Sergeant!

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,500
Yes, sir!

34
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,580
Colonel.

35
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,680
What is it?

36
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,740
Thank you.

37
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,820
Save it for later. We're in the middle of an operation.

38
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,640
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,650
Get in!

40
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,750
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,760
This has something to do with Mr. Hughes, right?

42
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,040
Do you want to come?

43
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,560
Yes.

44
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,620
Don't lose sight of him!

45
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,800
I won't let him get away!

46
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,380
My soul keeps shaking...

47
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,050
It's telling me where he is!

48
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,970
I wonder if other monsters like that fat one are going to show up?

49
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,270
I don't know. What the hell was that?

50
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,580
I hit his vitals many times,
but it didn't seem to bother him at all.

51
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,450
Did he have a tattoo of Ouroboros?

52
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,010
Tattoo?

53
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,400
Oh, maybe that thing...

54
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,700
He had something on his tongue.

55
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,330
That's probably a homunculus.

56
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,290
That was close, idiot!

57
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,740
Wait, wait, wait! A homunculus?!

58
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,430
There's no way something like that could exist!

59
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,870
I met a homunculus by the name of Greed in the south.

60
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,260
And this is what he said.

61
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,490
"There's no way there's no way."

62
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,140
Homunculi have extraordinary regeneration abilities.

63
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,150
Greed had half of his head blown off, but he fixed himself right away.

64
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,680
But I guess that's hard to believe, huh...

65
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,190
We'll just have to believe you after seeing that thing.

66
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,660
You're not going to tell me he's still alive after being burnt to a crisp and falling from the top of the tower, are you?

67
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,670
Probably.

68
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,730
What is this... a nonsensical mutant all-around freak show?!

69
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,300
My body escaped into here.

70
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,440
Research Laboratory 3, huh?

71
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,360
Now we have a chance to blackmail the upper echelon.

72
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,860
That's sufficient for this operation.

73
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,130
We're withdrawing.

74
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,560
No, it's not!

75
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,240
No! Idiot!

76
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,410
This is bad, Colonel.

77
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,190
No, it's actually convenient.

78
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,500
What?

79
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,710
Outta the way!

80
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,710
I'm not interested in your meat!

81
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,710
Where are you, my meat?!

82
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,100
All personnel are to evacuate immediately!

83
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,320
C-Colonel!

84
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,310
The intruder is a vicious criminal.

85
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,560
Leave his capture to us.

86
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,160
The guards are to seal off all entrances!

87
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,690
Yes, sir!

88
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,280
That damn Barry... which way did he go?

89
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,200
We're splitting up.

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,370
Roger.

91
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,750
Looks like it's been quite some time since this place was abandoned.

92
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,560
Could it be... an experiment room?

93
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,000
If that were true, it doesn't seem any pleasant experiments were carried out here.

94
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Oh my, what a coincidence.

95
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,020
I can't believe you stood me up.

96
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,240
You know, I was waiting for you.

97
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,620
I wanted to see you, Jean.

98
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,370
Solaris...

99
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,300
Why are you here?

100
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,850
Hey Havoc, she's got a tattoo of Ouroboros!

101
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,770
I just noticed that, myself!

102
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,060
Sorry for tricking you.

103
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,900
Well, I can see how you were tricked.

104
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,250
You like big breasts, don't you?

105
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,310
Yes! You bet I do!

106
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,680
...I do! ...I do! ...I do!

107
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,190
Did you tell her anything?

108
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,360
I didn't tell her anything related to my work!

109
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,190
Do you know Maes Hughes?

110
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,370
He was a handsome, smart man.

111
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,250
It's a pity I couldn't finish him off-

112
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,390
Get on your knees!

113
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,360
Tell me everything you know.

114
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,570
That's impossible.

115
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,480
You boys can't make me kneel-

116
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,430
As expected from the hero of Ishbal.

117
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,160
You're relentless.

118
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,190
H-Homunculus?!

119
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,380
Oh my, looks like you did your homework, Jean.

120
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,660
As a reward, I'll show you.

121
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,580
Do you see it?

122
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a philosopher's stone.

123
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,740
Humans created with this stone as their core...

124
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,130
That's what we, homunculi, are.

125
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,050
You monsters!

126
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,960
How rude.

127
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,830
We have feelings and love for our parents.

128
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,560
We're...

129
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,560
...human.

130
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,560
If you're telling us your huge secret,
you must not be planning on letting us go alive.

131
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,670
Yes, unfortunately for you.

132
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,620
Too slow!

133
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,770
Oh my, you can't even make your fire now.

134
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,010
What do we do now?! At this rate, we'll get tortured to death!

135
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,190
No, it's actually convenient.

136
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,350
If there's a lot of water...

137
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,100
...I just have to decompose it to create hydrogen and oxygen!

138
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,990
Geez, just look at this thing...

139
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,370
I got it from my ex, too...

140
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,040
Damnit!

141
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,010
Colonel, could you give me a light?

142
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,180
I guess it's impossible.

143
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,680
What am I, a wet match?!

144
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,260
That woman definitely burned up.

145
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,850
How can you tell?

146
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,450
By the smell.

147
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm used to the smell of burnt corpses.

148
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,480
From Ishbal?

149
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,850
But we can't take her regeneration ability lightly.

150
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,380
Stay alert.

151
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,370
Roger.

152
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,080
Havoc!

153
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,130
Havoc, hang in there!

154
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,970
It's no use.

155
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,320
You can't save him anymore.

156
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,390
No!

157
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,850
It's pointless!

158
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,270
It'll take more than that to kill me!

159
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,350
I can save him with this!

160
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,160
I'm going to use it to treat him.

161
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,210
Medical alchemy isn't my specialty,

162
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,920
but if I boost my ability with this stone...

163
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,720
It's not very gentlemanly of you to suddenly stick your hand into a lady's chest.

164
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,870
F-Führer President!

165
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,580
An intruder?

166
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,370
Yes, sir! The culprit who attacked the western district jail is inside!

167
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,460
Colonel Mustang is after him!

168
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,210
I think I'll lend him a hand.

169
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,290
We'll come with you, too, sir!

170
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,280
No.

171
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,160
I'll be fine on my own.

172
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,830
I thought I told you.

173
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,060
The philosopher's stone is my core.

174
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,210
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,840
You're a candidate for sacrifice,

176
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,140
but you're going to die here.

177
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,150
You bitch...

178
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,170
Why don't you die as you lay there, watching your man go cold?

179
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,710
Second Lieutenant Havoc...

180
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,160
Answer me... damnit...

181
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,220
I'm not going to allow you to die before me...

182
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,650
Havoc...

183
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,580
You sure took your time, lady.

184
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,650
Just look how rotten my body has become.

185
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,010
It's impossible to place a soul on a body that doesn't belong.

186
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,070
If separate souls and bodies can't be mixed,

187
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,670
then I, who am made of a human soul and an iron body...

188
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:27,930
That's right, there's no guarantee this body will last to the time we fulfill our goal...

189
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,470
Brother...

190
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,490
There you are, Miss Lust.

191
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,010
Number 66, why did you join forces with the Colonel?

192
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,430
Because it seemed like it'd be fun!

193
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,820
And also...

194
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,400
...I want to cut you up, more than anything!

195
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,370
What a troublesome man.

196
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,620
And the armor boy, too? What are you doing here?

197
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,760
What a loss.

198
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,500
That I have to kill two candidates for sacrifice in one night!

199
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,590
Sacrifice? Two?

200
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,510
Yes. You and someone else.

201
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,800
What are you blabbering on for, Miss Lust?!

202
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,530
I hate persistent guys.

203
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,660
Now, Lieutenant. I'll send you to the place where I sent your superior right away.

204
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,680
Wait...

205
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,070
You said two sacrifices in one night, right...

206
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,570
Don't tell me... you didn't...

207
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,470
Y...You bitch!!!

208
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,040
Finished?

209
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:46,170
You humans really are foolish, weak, pitiful beings.

210
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,110
Lieutenant, get up and run.

211
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,380
Do you want to die first?

212
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,120
I see... so you opened the gate.

213
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,670
It's a shame.

214
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,790
Forget candidate, you're a confirmed sacrifice.

215
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,400
Alphonse, leave me and run.

216
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,180
No.

217
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,310
Run!

218
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,310
No!

219
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,920
Save yourself, at least!

220
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,850
I said, no!!!

221
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,190
Seeing people die before my eyes...

222
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,940
I hate it! I'm tired of it!

223
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,990
I'm not going to let anyone die anymore! I'll protect you!

224
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,910
Well said, Alphonse Elric!

225
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,850
You finally got down on your knees.

226
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,170
Using flint as the starter, and magnifying it with
a transmutation circle made of your own blood...

227
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,520
How can you even move with that wound?!

228
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,430
I sealed it with fire!

229
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,620
Although I almost fainted a few times.

230
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,370
You said, "It'll take more than that to kill me", right?

231
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,130
Then I'll just keep killing you until you die!

232
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,510
Colonel!

233
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,670
I lost.

234
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,170
It's a shame, but it doesn't feel
too bad to be killed by a man like you.

235
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,180
With honest eyes with no hesitation.

236
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,460
I can't wait...

237
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,660
The days when those eyes will show anguish...

238
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,310
...are... close...

239
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,640
Colonel!

240
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,910
You were all right...

241
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,120
Please worry about yourself!

242
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,010
Alphonse, you have my gratitude for protecting my subordinate.

243
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,880
Forget that! We need a doctor!

244
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,060
That's right... Please... hurry and have a doctor see Havoc...

245
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,430
He'll be all right... he'll be all right...

246
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,370
Hey... I'm back.

247
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,380
Idiot! Welcome back!

248
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,360
W-Well...

249
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,480
U-Umm... Where to start...

250
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,080
Umm...

251
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,730
It broke off!

252
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,290
Oh no! I can't fix this!

253
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,410
Dear me, I barely managed to survive...

254
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,760
...but in a form like this...

255
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,040
I wonder if someone can't fix me up...

256
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,350
Whoa! You were still alive?!

257
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,290
H-Hey... stop! What are you doing?!

258
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,130
I still haven't killed enough!

259
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,330
S... Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! W-Wait!

260
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,810
S-S-S-Stop!

261
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,300
No way...

262
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,430
Impossible...

263
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,400
Hohenheim!

264
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,980
The truth revealed both of his emotions: joy, and unhappiness.

265
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,410
When the boy had to take a stand against the past he threw away,

266
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,420
what he had been hiding behind his resolve was exposed.

267
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,720
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

268
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,220
Episode 20, Father in Front of the Grave.

269
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,100
It is possible to cry without tears.

270
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,620
If you're a human.
