1
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,300
Edward, huh?

2
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,280
You've grown.

3
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,890
I heard from Pinako...

4
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,280
...that you attempted human transmutation.

5
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,660
After all this time, why did you come back now?!

6
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
There's no place for you here anymore!

7
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,380
Oh, right.

8
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,670
Why did you burn down my house?

9
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,070
We decided we wouldn't turn back anymore.

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,480
We did it to show our determination-

11
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
That's not it.

12
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,680
You just didn't want to see it again.

13
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,430
You wanted to escape your horrifying memories.

14
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,650
You wanted to conceal all traces of the sin you committed.

15
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,610
That's not true!

16
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,260
You're no different from a child who hides
his sheets after wetting himself in his sleep.

17
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,490
You ran, didn't you, Edward?

18
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,920
What do you know?!

19
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,620
Damn it! You're sickening!

20
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,380
He's so similar to the way I was when I was young.

21
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,490
You haven't changed at all.

22
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,260
Not even a bit from the old days.

23
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,860
Why didn't you come back sooner?

24
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,820
Trisha was always waiting for you.

25
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,970
Pinako.

26
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,890
Hm?

27
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,070
The thing my sons transmuted...

28
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,250
Was it really Trisha?

29
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,370
What?

30
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,500
I told you. It didn't even look remotely human.

31
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,070
I can't even call that thing Trisha-

32
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,180
No, that's not what I mean.

33
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,350
For example, the color of her eyes and hair.

34
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,810
What do you mean?

35
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,470
You're telling me that wasn't her?

36
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,650
You're telling me those boys lost their bodies by creating something that wasn't even their mother?

37
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,700
What?! You can continue to function without food or sleep?!

38
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,210
Yup, as long as this seal remains unscathed.

39
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,710
That's amazing! You're literally immortal!

40
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,590
That's not true.

41
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,130
My body is almost like a bomb.

42
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,090
I heard it from Barry.

43
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,570
It's impossible to place a soul that doesn't belong on a body.

44
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,040
If you force a soul on to one, it will eventually be rejected.

45
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,030
Whether that will be tomorrow or ten years later...

46
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,850
...even I don't know.

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,530
No way... then you have to find a way to get your body back as soon as possible!

48
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:14,310
Wait, if your body starts to deteriorate, can't you transfer your soul on to something else and continue to live?

49
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,750
If you do that, you can stay the way you are.

50
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,260
Without feeling pain or needing to eat!

51
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,050
What a convenient body!

52
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,880
Of course it's not convenient!

53
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,600
You don't even know anything!

54
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,110
Sorry.

55
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,310
Winry!

56
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,310
Winry?

57
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm coming in.

58
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,500
Geez... You and Brother always get mad before I ever can, so I never get to.

59
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,760
It's because....

60
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,350
It seems this body can't sleep...

61
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,430
Al...

62
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,440
You'll be able to return to your old body, right?

63
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,610
Right?

64
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,030
Give me back my brother's body!

65
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,420
He's... He's the only family I've got!!!

66
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,750
Give it back?

67
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,450
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,590
You're the one who put your brother in that state.

69
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,420
Alchemist.

70
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
That's right.

71
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,780
You and I are the same.

72
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,780
Edward Elric!

73
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,130
And...

74
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,070
Edward... don't leave me like this...

75
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,260
Ed! You still asleep?

76
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,650
Your dad's about to leave.

77
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,830
Can I take this?

78
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,210
It's the only one that has all four of us.

79
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,380
Help yourself.

80
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,720
Thanks.

81
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,120
As a token of my gratitude, I'll tell you something.

82
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,790
Something terrible will happen in this country soon.

83
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,480
Flee to another country.

84
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,410
That's not uncommon here.

85
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,790
And besides, there are kids who call this place home.

86
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,370
Don't say I didn't warn you.

87
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,660
Hohenheim.

88
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,920
Come back every now and then for a meal, won't you?

89
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,350
It's a shame, Pinako,

90
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,580
that I won't be able to eat your cooking anymore.

91
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,540
Are you really going to dig that thing up?

92
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,750
Want to call it off?

93
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,090
No, it's just that my joints are starting to hurt.

94
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,950
Probably because it's about to rain. Let's get this over with.

95
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,910
Ed!

96
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,340
I told you so!

97
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,110
Let's stop this.

98
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,250
No...

99
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,390
If I don't confirm it, I'll never be able to move forward.

100
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,640
Also...

101
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,970
You ran, didn't you?

102
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,970
No way in hell am I going to run!

103
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,130
Granny.

104
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,430
Mom had auburn hair.

105
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,010
This is black.

106
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,870
The femur is way too long.

107
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,190
The pelvis... This is a man.

108
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,910
Granny.

109
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,380
Ed.

110
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,390
This is not your mother.

111
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,570
That's right. You cannot revive the dead.

112
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,940
That's a truth.

113
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,380
It was impossible from the very beginning.

114
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,310
Ed, pull yourself together!

115
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,160
Snap out of it!

116
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,190
I'm fine, Granny...

117
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,360
Since that day, this has been the symbol of despair.

118
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,850
But now, it will lead me to a path with hope.

119
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,940
Al can get his body back.

120
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,480
Hello, you've reached the Curtis'.

121
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,660
Oh, it's you, Ed.

122
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,600
What is it?

123
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,800
Umm... There was something I wanted to ask you...

124
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,260
Well...

125
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,890
What's wrong?

126
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,130
Speak clearly.

127
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,280
It's about the time you tried to revive your baby...

128
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,410
What about it?

129
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,670
Master, the person Al and I transmuted was not our mother.

130
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,380
What do you mean? What are you trying to say?!

131
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,630
The child that was created by your transmutation...

132
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,930
Are you sure it was your child?

133
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,320
I see...

134
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,670
So my son and his wife helped a lot on the battlefield, eh?

135
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,450
Good to know...

136
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,850
He...

137
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,590
Where did Hohenheim say he was headed?

138
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,470
Who knows? He didn't mention a word about it.

139
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,100
Oh, I completely forgot!

140
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,160
I had an important message for him.

141
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,400
Message?

142
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,350
Yeah.

143
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,530
Trisha's will.

144
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,870
Could you pass this on to him when he comes back?

145
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,070
Please tell him I couldn't keep my promise.

146
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,710
That I have to leave him first, and that I'm sorry.

147
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,600
A promise? What promise?

148
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,760
No idea.

149
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,480
Sorry to make you do this, but could you tell him for me if you see him?

150
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,960
Why do I have to do it?!

151
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,460
He may not look it, but he's actually quite worried about you two.

152
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,010
I'll deliver the message after I give him a good punch in the face.

153
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,220
Are you going back to Central?

154
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,990
Yeah, just to get yelled at by Al,

155
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,920
since I went and did a bunch of stuff without telling him.

156
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,530
What the hell is this?!

157
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,230
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,710
Y-You...

159
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,510
You're in ruins!

160
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,830
And...

161
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,130
What the hell are you guys doing?!

162
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,330
Eating.

163
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,170
Geez, just what happened to you?!

164
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,310
Homunculi and Barry the Chopper?

165
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,210
And on top of it all, a rejection reaction due to different souls and bodies, huh...

166
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,350
Stretching the armor that's left...

167
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,560
Al will be able to return to his old body, right?

168
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,050
Of course.

169
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,150
If I say I'll get his body back, I will.

170
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,210
Al...

171
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,380
I dug up the thing we transmuted back in Resembool.

172
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,800
W-Why did you do something like that?!

173
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,810
As a result, I discovered that what we transmuted wasn't Mom.

174
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,420
What? What does this mean?

175
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,690
But we...

176
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,920
We transmuted something completely different.

177
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,610
No way! Then I...

178
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,870
And now, I'm also confident we can get your body back.

179
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Really?!

180
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,900
Yeah.

181
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,570
But before I get into that...

182
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:33,300
Y-You remember the time we fought over who'd be m-marrying W-Winry... right?

183
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,930
The thing we talked about up on the roof?

184
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,810
Yeah. So you turned Al down?

185
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,810
Yeah. I did.

186
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,150
And so, I have a question for you two.

187
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,310
Why did you turn him down?

188
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,650
"I don't want to marry a guy who's shorter than me."

189
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,880
Don't decide a man's worth by his height!!!

190
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,680
Huh?

191
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,200
Does this have anything to do with getting Al's body back?

192
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:10,260
To sum it up, if Al knows something I don't, and Winry remembers the same thing, too...

193
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,520
...it really happened.

194
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:19,100
Since he remembers something that really happened,
it means the soul affixed to that armor is the real Al's.

195
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:26,110
Even though I could only get your soul,
I was able to pull you back from that gate.

196
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,360
If I could pull your soul from the gate, then I should be able to get your body back the same way.

197
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,640
Separated from each other, the body and soul still exist....

198
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,370
Barry the Chopper!

199
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,720
Al, try to remember.

200
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,420
The time you were dragged into the truth.

201
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,920
That time...

202
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,590
That was me! I was there!

203
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,720
That's right. So all I have to do...

204
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,270
...is pull your body out like I did with your soul!

205
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,480
Brother!

206
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:14,940
I was watching you from that thing's point of view!

207
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,320
So it was you inside that thing?

208
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,130
The soul probably didn't affix due to the rejection reaction.

209
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,350
So we didn't damage anyone's soul...

210
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,260
Sir Elric.

211
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,730
Miss Izumi Curtis is on the line.

212
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,000
I looked into the family lineages of both my husband and me.

213
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,650
As a result, the skin and hair color of that child...

214
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,520
...cannot possibly have come from the two of us.

215
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,940
You were able to find something out, weren't you?

216
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,140
Yes.

217
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,650
Confidence that I'll be able to get Al's body back...

218
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,380
It's impossible to revive the dead.

219
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,170
I see...

220
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,420
It wasn't that I was missing something...

221
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,710
...but rather it was impossible from the very beginning.

222
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,570
Ed.

223
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,820
Yes, ma'am!

224
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,260
Thank you.

225
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,470
What did the master say?

226
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,570
I don't really get it, but she thanked me.

227
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,400
Al?

228
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,790
To be honest, I've been blaming myself nonstop since that day.

229
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,330
That it was me...

230
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,140
...who put Mom in that state and killed her.

231
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,050
Same goes for me, Al.

232
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,730
Thank you, Brother...

233
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,990
I didn't kill Mom!

234
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,380
Izumi.

235
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,550
I feel saved.

236
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,940
I didn't kill our child twice...

237
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,850
But it's true that I put you in that state.

238
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm going to get your body back, no matter what-

239
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,980
Brother!

240
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,830
We carry the same sin, since I approved of the plan.

241
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,990
Please don't talk as though it's all your fault.

242
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,840
Trying to do everything by yourself...

243
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,720
I'm tired of other people having to suffer because of me!

244
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,180
Same with Mr. Hughes, too!

245
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,600
When I heard about his death...

246
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,940
I felt from the bottom of my heart I didn't want to return to my body if other people would have to suffer.

247
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,780
Brother...

248
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,620
...even if they don't have the body of humans...

249
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,370
...I've been watching people who live according to the way they are.

250
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,700
Even if I'm in this state, people around me interact with me as though I'm human.

251
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:25,470
I know my body's like a bomb, but even a body made of flesh could die from accident or disease at any time.

252
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,090
So in order to live a normal life,
this body isn't all that inconvenient either.

253
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,470
I've truly started to feel that way.

254
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,050
But...

255
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,980
...I can't stand it any longer.

256
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,290
I'm... I'm...

257
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,480
...tired of spending nights by myself!

258
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,270
That's my reason for wanting to return to my old body.

259
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,540
Yeah, I'll make it happen.

260
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,840
After I beat the shit out of that "truth" guy, I'm going to drag your body out of there!

261
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,880
Yeah!

262
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,970
Huh?

263
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,640
Has he always had such a large back?

264
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,290
The figure of a wounded comrade hurries the man's steps,

265
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:10,110
and the boy risks everything he has to escape a dead end.

266
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,740
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

267
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,390
Episode 21, The Fool's Progress.

268
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,650
You shall be the one to open fire.
