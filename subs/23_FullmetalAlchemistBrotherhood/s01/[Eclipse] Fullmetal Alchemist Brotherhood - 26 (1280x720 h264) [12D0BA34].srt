1
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,540
Ed!

2
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
You little shit!

3
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,970
Lin!

4
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,260
You bastard!

5
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,050
Kill... me...

6
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,690
Save me...

7
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,060
Please... kill me!

8
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,330
Please...

9
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,670
I want to die...

10
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,290
Mommy!

11
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,610
What are you just staring out into space for, idiot?!

12
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,600
Why are you hesitating?!

13
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,460
There are...

14
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,390
There are people inside of him...

15
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,580
They want our help.

16
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,890
No! They're monsters!

17
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,600
But...

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,640
Pull yourself together!

19
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
They're monsters!

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,810
Kill me!

21
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,950
Mommy!

22
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,480
Please! Give me back my child!

23
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,110
Shut up! Stop it!

24
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,210
Dad!

25
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,230
It hurts...

26
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,110
Help me!

27
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,300
I said, "Stop it!"

28
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,110
Ed.

29
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,770
Let's play.

30
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,580
Let's play.

31
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,250
Playtime's over.

32
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,100
Damn...

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,180
...it...

34
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,390
Help me...

35
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,360
You don't understand the pain...

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,860
Ed! Wake up!

37
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,890
Come to your senses!

38
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,410
Join us!

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,350
Ed!

40
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,570
Ed!

41
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,100
Good! Good!

42
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,670
All right, bring it over this way!

43
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,420
Oh yeah.

44
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,160
I saw it over by the waste plant earlier.

45
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,680
If I recall, it was with some huge guy in an armor.

46
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,020
Armor?

47
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,690
Don't tell me it's the one from yesterday!

48
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,190
I'll never forgive him for kidnapping Shao May!

49
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,360
Demon! Devil! Loincloth!

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,870
There she is! Shao Ma-

51
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,750
Wait.

52
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,630
That fat one...

53
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,820
If I recall, they called him a Homunculus.

54
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,220
Homunculus?

55
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,870
Their regeneration ability matches that of an immortal.

56
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,780
We can't jump in carelessly.

57
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,350
Immortal?

58
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,020
This is my chance! Let's go after him!

59
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,110
I told you. He's not an easy opponent.

60
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,820
Why are those two together?

61
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,980
What's wrong?

62
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,810
This place... is strange.

63
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,080
I've had a feeling that something was out of place, ever since I arrived in this country, but...

64
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,690
This is...

65
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,570
There are things crawling beneath my feet... and a lot of them...

66
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,960
What's wrong? Are you cold?

67
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,090
You okay?

68
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,460
This way.

69
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,980
I never would've thought something like this was under Central...

70
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,720
W-What the heck is this?!

71
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,170
That was done by the gatekeepers.

72
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,600
Gatekeepers?

73
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,450
They won't attack you if you're with me.

74
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,970
There's something up there.

75
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,480
Do we still have a long way to go?

76
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,000
A long way.

77
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,150
We're meeting your father, right?

78
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,750
He knows where people go after you swallow them, right?

79
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,000
Father knows everything.

80
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,080
Brother... You're alive, right?

81
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Brother...

82
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,560
What's that?

83
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,140
A red... stone?

84
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,730
Right, Envy's core.

85
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,710
A philosopher's stone.

86
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,140
After all the time we spent looking for one,
there's one right in front of me...

87
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,660
Let me out, Envy!

88
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,090
It stinks in here!

89
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,070
What?

90
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,570
We may be able to get out of here!

91
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,030
Let's work together, Envy!

92
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,680
What in the world are these?

93
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,630
They are chimera.

94
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,540
There's no end to them.

95
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,470
No...

96
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,650
As I thought... there's something beneath us...

97
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,040
Are they chimera?

98
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,270
No.

99
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,220
Is this... a person?!

100
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,310
Father made us all!

101
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,650
Me, Lust, and Envy!

102
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,510
It's loud up there.

103
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,500
Someone's coming...

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,110
I don't remember my parents' names, their faces, or even my own name.

105
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,930
No... I don't remember if I was abandoned or sold before I had even been given a name.

106
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,320
Which one of you will lead this country?

107
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,570
Will it be you?

108
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,070
We were called the "FÃ¼hrer President Candidates".

109
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,080
And we were all gathered into one place and educated in many different fields.

110
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,910
How to be a good emperor, anthropology...

111
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,460
We were trained in military combat, marksmanship, and swordsmanship until we were highly capable.

112
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't sweat it.

113
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,190
He was just a pawn for you to achieve your goal.

114
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,440
"I will lead this country someday."

115
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,690
With that thought in mind,
I endured the toughest of trainings.

116
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,490
He was no good either.

117
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,750
Next.

118
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,880
Lie down here.

119
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,010
Umm... What is this about?

120
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,220
Relax.

121
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,520
It'll be over soon.

122
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,290
What are you planning to do?! Those bodies are...

123
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,850
This is the twelfth one, huh?

124
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,990
Are you the one...

125
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,660
...who will receive my wrath?

126
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,620
A philosopher's stone is a high energy substance that includes the souls of many humans.

127
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,470
As it enters a human's body, it goes on a rampage and tries to take over.

128
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:56,260
The destruction and reconstruction by the stone is repeated until either the body dies or wins.

129
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,370
Eventually...

130
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,140
Amazing!

131
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,010
A new species of life!

132
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,110
Congratulations.

133
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,350
You've been selected to be the man who will lead this country.

134
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,620
He will prepare everything you may need.

135
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,010
From this day on, your name shall be...

136
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,840
King Bradley!

137
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:25,800
All that was left was a soul and the emotion of wrath.

138
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't even know if this soul belongs to someone who was turned into the stone, or if it was mine to begin with.

139
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:48,470
If you were human, couldn't you live as a human instead of a Homunculus, sir?

140
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,690
You're telling me to go back to being a human?

141
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,960
That's impossible.

142
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,460
This body has far surpassed human capabilities.

143
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,160
It's far superior.

144
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:09,550
Just as how you humans are proud to be human,
we are proud to be Homunculi.

145
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,680
I'm sure that woman took that pride to her death, as well.

146
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,730
Ow.

147
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,580
Just something temporary.

148
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,920
Thanks.

149
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,990
I've collected all the ones around here.

150
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,990
Are these all from Xerxes?

151
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,390
Yeah.

152
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,560
It's a portion of the mural that was in a temple in the ruins.

153
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,380
When I first saw it,

154
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,010
I thought it was a transmutation circle for a philosopher's stone, like the one beneath Research Laboratory 5.

155
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,330
But I was wrong.

156
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,970
The sun represents the soul.

157
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,220
The moon represents the mind.

158
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,270
And this stone which has the mural on it. This represents the body.

159
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,300
Come on... explain it so I can understand.

160
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,270
Basically, what was drawn there...

161
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,530
...is a circle for human transmutation.

162
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,110
Human transmutation?

163
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,280
So that means, to raise the dead...

164
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,240
No.

165
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,020
The principle of alchemy is equivalent exchange.

166
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,460
One cannot create a soul that doesn't exist in this world, at least through alchemy.

167
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,290
I've confirmed that.

168
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,550
So, I've thought of a way to get out of here.

169
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,730
What if I transmute myself from scratch...

170
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,930
A human that's alive?

171
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,170
Transmute from scratch?

172
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,190
Yeah.

173
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:41,140
I use this transmutation circle to decompose myself, then put myself back together.

174
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,940
That's also human transmutation.

175
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,440
The gate should open.

176
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,460
If Gluttony is a fake Gate of Truth,

177
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,200
shouldn't we be able to get to
the real world by going through the real gate?

178
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,710
I'll open the gate; you guys leap in.

179
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,730
What if this doesn't work?

180
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,760
Then we suffer from rebound.

181
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,340
All of the effects of the rebound go to the one who attempted it.

182
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,330
In this case, me.

183
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,880
I know nothing about alchemy.

184
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,470
I'll leave it to you.

185
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,460
All right.

186
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,100
So, Envy, there's something I need to ask you.

187
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,670
The mural I saw at Xerxes looked like this.

188
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,180
I'm curious about this symbol.

189
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,340
It's the word representing God, but flipped over.

190
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,720
And the dragon with two heads.

191
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,040
This represents the perfect being.

192
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,690
This means "I will cast God from the Heavens to the Earth, and become the perfect being."

193
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,450
People think of outrageous things.

194
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,370
It would be wonderful if they had only thought about it.

195
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,050
The problem here is...

196
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,050
...this part, which is broken off.

197
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,940
A lion that swallows the sun.

198
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,210
This represents the philosopher's stone.

199
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,030
And the ingredients of philosopher's stones are live humans.

200
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,030
Right, Envy?

201
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,980
Yeah, you're right.

202
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,620
Why did the nation of Xerxes,
a nation so prosperous, perish overnight?

203
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,150
Where did its citizens go?

204
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,300
Isn't a portion of the ruins in here to cover up the evidence?

205
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,380
You guys turned all of Xerxes' citizens into a philosopher's stone, didn't you?!

206
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,940
Who did it?!

207
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,030
Who transmuted themselves?!

208
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,640
Who's the one who turned all of the country's people into a philosopher's stone for tremendous power...

209
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,950
...for the sole purpose of becoming a being that would surpass God?!

210
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,200
Is it the "Father" that you talked about?

211
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:06,710
Isn't that guy trying to recreate that event in this country by using you guys, the Homunculi?!

212
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,960
I'll tell you if you get us out of here.

213
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,890
Let's stop beating around the bush, Fullmetal Alchemist.

214
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,590
You need a toll if you're going to open the gate, right?

215
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,250
Use it.

216
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,210
Help me!

217
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,290
Please, just kill me!

218
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,740
These are all people from Xerxes, aren't they?

219
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:42,740
Their bodies and minds have rotted away in the ancient past, and they are beings who are solely used as an energy source.

220
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,430
They don't even remember what they used to look like.

221
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,540
Are you sympathizing with them?

222
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,250
What a stupid emotion.

223
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,840
The sole reason you want to think of them as humans is that you want to believe that your brother, who's only a soul, is human, too.

224
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,070
You hesitate to set fire to coal because you feel sorry for a tree that died ages ago?

225
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,640
They can't return to being human anymore.

226
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:13,000
Lay down a definition for a human with logic and not emotion, alchemist.

227
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,910
All right.

228
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,160
Lin, if something happens to me,
tell everyone about what these guys are up to.

229
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,200
Whatever happens to Amestris isn't my problem.

230
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,800
Hey!

231
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,300
There are people precious to you waiting for you in that country, right?

232
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,500
Get out of here alive and tell them yourself.

233
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,210
I'm sorry. Please let me use your souls.

234
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,320
Let's do this!

235
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:05,430
I thought that pose of putting their hands together looked similar to something...

236
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,900
It's almost like a prayer to God.

237
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,930
It's been a while since I've done this.

238
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,350
I never thought I'd open it again... under this situation.

239
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,930
Lin! Jump in!

240
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,940
I'm counting on you, alchemist!

241
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,820
This is the same sensation I felt while being swallowed by Gluttony...

242
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,890
Thank you...

243
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,240
Thank you...

244
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,030
The body and the soul are connected by the mind.

245
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,140
A part of my body is before the Gate of Truth.

246
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,420
If I just let my mind guide me,
I should be able to get to the gate...

247
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,530
Oh, so you didn't come here to get your body back?

248
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,370
Your father is through here, right?

249
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,600
Yeah.

250
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,000
I can find clues on how to find my brother...

251
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,220
All right, I'm here.

252
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,670
Why are there two gates?

253
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,030
Al!

254
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,240
Al! Come here!

255
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,270
Hurry up! Al!!!

256
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,650
Al!!!

257
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,020
I can't.

258
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,770
You're not my soul.

259
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,050
I can't go with you.

260
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,380
Alphonse!

261
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,220
Alphonse!

262
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,680
Alphonse!

263
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,060
Someday, I'll come and bring you back.

264
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,060
Wait for me.

265
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,870
Wait for me!!!

266
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,040
It is hard to find the shape of an illusion, like a wavering flame.

267
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,880
And a flame can be cruel at times, but can also be a flame of hope.

268
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,970
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

269
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,680
Episode 27, Banquet at the Crevice.

270
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,380
You mustn't be afraid of the darkness inside of you.
