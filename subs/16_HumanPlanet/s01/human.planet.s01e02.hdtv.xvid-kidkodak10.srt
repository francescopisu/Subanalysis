00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:23,565
For now, at least,
they know they're on the right path.

175
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:30,650
It's day three.

176
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:32,847
Today they must find the well.

177
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:38,889
While packing up, Foni decides
Shede is ready to take charge.

(CAMEL GROWLS)

179
00:18:43,177 --> 00:18:44,815
But the well is so hidden

180
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:49,009
that even if she's only a few hundred
metres away, she could miss it.

She sets them off in the right direction,

183
00:18:56,857 --> 00:19:01,885
aligning herself between the ridges ahead
and the sunrise to the east.

184
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:07,646
For some children Shede's age,
just ten years old,

185
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:10,495
finding their way to school
is challenge enough.

186
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:17,531
But Shede has to find her way 20 miles
across the bleakest landscape on Earth.

187
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,534
But with her mother's guiding words
echoing in her head,

188
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:28,966
she strides forward.

189
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:38,212
After a gruelling 1 2-hours'riding,
the tenth ridge is finally in sight.

190
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:45,490
The lonely bush in the dip of the dune
marks the valley of the well.

191
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:01,811
Shede has found the only well
for 80 kilometres around.

192
00:20:03,177 --> 00:20:05,645
She's made her mum proud.

193
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:16,373
Finally, Shede can water the camels.

194
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:28,568
With their thirst quenched,
she washes off three days of dust.

(GIGGLING)

196
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:36,091
Now they've got water,
they'll make it to market,

197
00:20:36,137 --> 00:20:39,732
but they're still weeks away
from finishing theirjourney.

198
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:47,733
Not all deserts are swelteringly hot.

199
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:52,892
The Gobi in Mongolia is
a desert of extremes.

200
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:55,656
Lying far north of the equator,

201
00:20:55,697 --> 00:21:01,135
here scorching summer highs plunge
to freezing Arctic lows.

202
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:05,813
It's February, minus 20 degrees Celsius,

203
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:09,975
and the few wells people have
are frozen over.

204
00:21:13,177 --> 00:21:17,216
But, amazingly,
water appears here as snow.

205
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:21,407
The snow doesn't fall here.

206
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:25,245
It's blown over 3,000 kilometres
from Siberia.

207
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:28,926
And these bitter winds means
it never settles for long.

208
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:37,173
So, Ganbold
and his twin-humped Bactrian camels

209
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:41,495
must chase the snow
towards the mountains where it lingers.

210
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:44,131
This rare snow is a lifeline.

211
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:54,732
It's so important,

212
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:58,895
he and his family have set up
their winter camp in the foothills.

213
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:02,173
But he's taking a risk.

214
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:05,897
His herd, including pregnant females,

215
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:10,215
are now in the hunting grounds
of a voracious desert predator,

216
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:14,455
and they like nothing better
than newborn camel flesh.

217
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:34,930
Gobi desert wolves roam
over thousands of kilometres.

218
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:40,448
Their keen sense of smell
helps them shadow the herds at a distance.

219
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:47,447
If Ganbold drops his guard,
they'll attack.

220
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:52,810
He returns to camp to hear that
his son has interrupted a wolf attack.

221
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:55,530
One sheep has been killed.

wolves are the only topic of conversation.

226
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:08,535
At midnight, Ganbold checks
his pregnant camels one last time.

227
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:19,126
He suddenly realises
his prize female is missing

228
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:22,772
but, with the storm,
they can't look for her until daylight.

229
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:46,176
Come dawn, the search is on to find out
what has become of her

230
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:48,447
and her unborn calf.

231
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:04,010
Ganbold musters his friends.

232
00:25:04,057 --> 00:25:07,333
It's a race between them and the wolves.

233
00:25:12,497 --> 00:25:14,806
They find tracks.

234
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:25,969
Ganbold heads to the highest ridge,
and the scale of his task becomes clear.

235
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:44,370
More fresh tracks.

236
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:07,575
They've seen off the enemy,

237
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:10,336
but is the camel nearby?

238
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:17,097

And she's given birth.

Only a few hours old,
the calf is too weak to walk back to camp.

255

Unlike the Gobi, there are some deserts
where water never exists.

256
00:27:49,577 --> 00:27:55,846
In the Chilean Atacama desert, some areas
are as desolate as the surface of Mars.

257
00:27:55,897 --> 00:27:59,970
This is the driest place on Earth.

258
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:08,611
Here people have been inspired by nature
to conjure water from thin air.

259
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:15,448
Cactus flowers are a source of food
for the guanacos,

the wild camels of South America.

261
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:24,175
But these cacti are also the key
to their water supply.

262
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:28,654
They're covered in furry lichen,
which traps any moisture in the air.

263
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:36,130
Orlando has taken inspiration
from the cacti's natural solution.

264
00:28:36,177 --> 00:28:41,251
With his friends,
he erects a vast net six metres high.

265
00:28:57,617 --> 00:29:02,247
The net's mesh is designed
to mimic the lichen hairs,

266
00:29:02,297 --> 00:29:05,846
because in this coastal strip
of the Atacama desert

267
00:29:05,897 --> 00:29:10,846
they have a lifeline to moisture -
the Pacific Ocean.

268
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:17,972
Here, cold sea currents cool
the hot desert air

269
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:20,577
and produce huge fog blankets.

270
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:31,056
The fog is sucked ashore...

271
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:35,055
...and sweeps over the cacti...

272
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:39,847
...and also Orlando's nets.

273
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:48,817
When the fog hits the cacti,
it condenses onto the lichen hairs,

274
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:51,291
which capture the precious water.

275
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:58,606
In no time,
the cacti are dripping with dew.

276
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:08,531
On the nets, the fog does
exactly the same.

277
00:30:08,577 --> 00:30:13,605
Drop by precious drop, this miracle water
is channelled to a reservoir.

278
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:45,728
Each day, these magical nets produce
nearly 500 litres of water...

279
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:50,606
...which allows Orlando to nurture
a few plants in the sand.

Around the world,
signs are etched in the landscape.

Scars show where water used to flow.

285
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:27,889
7,000 years ago, the Sahara was crossed
by a network of rivers and lakes,

286
00:31:27,937 --> 00:31:30,656
which disappeared as it turned to desert.

287
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:36,447
Yet, in this now barren land,
some of this water remains

288
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:38,852
deep in rocks underground.

Mafourdi is 70 years old,
and committed to a life in the desert.

294
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:13,089
Every morning after prayer,
the men head off to find water.

295
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:21,334
With stubborn devotion and very
simple tools, they have dug a well.

296
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:28,167
It's taken them six months to carve out
a shaft through the desert rock.

297
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:31,766
Only now are they ready
for their most dangerous mission.

298
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:41,451
As the oldest and the most experienced,
Mafourdi climbs down alone.

299
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:44,614
It's a sheer nine-metre drop.

(SHOUTS)

301
00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:17,652
At the bottom lies knee-deep water
in hand-dug passages.

302
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:21,929
Mafourdi knows they are vital
to keep the water supply flowing.

303
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:28,330
But many men have been buried alive
down here, when the walls have collapsed.

304
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:34,608
The water seeps from the rocks themselves.

305
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:41,935
Mafourdi has released it from
thousands of years trapped in the rock.

306
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:44,047
This ancient water

307
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:47,726
is all that's left of the rivers
that used to flow across the land above.

308
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,977
But one well isn't enough.

309
00:34:02,017 --> 00:34:04,247
The real trick is to connect several wells

310
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:08,131
and create
an underground channel of water.

311
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:17,131
Mafourdi's neighbour, Abdullah,
has also been digging a well

312
00:34:17,177 --> 00:34:19,133
for the last six months.

313
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,771
Today's the day they're going to join up.

314
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:37,050
But Abdullah must leave Mafourdi.

315
00:34:37,097 --> 00:34:40,612
Joining the tunnels
is the most dangerous part.

316
00:34:43,737 --> 00:34:47,969
With so much earth removed, 30 foot
of rock could collapse at any moment.

317
00:34:48,017 --> 00:34:51,214
It would crush Mafourdi,
with no hope of escape.

318
00:34:57,177 --> 00:35:00,806
Back at the surface,
Abdullah prays for Mafourdi.

323
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:06,886
This new channel is just part
of a much bigger system.

324
00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:09,690
Every generation for the last 700 years

325
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:13,093
has been digging new wells
and connecting them up.

326
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,932
There are over 800 wells here now,

327
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,970
channelling water
60 kilometres under the desert floor.

328
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:32,089
The passages are cut so that the water
continually runs slightly downhill.

329
00:36:34,897 --> 00:36:37,457
When it reaches the surface,
it's divided up

330
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:41,172
to sustain a village
that otherwise wouldn't exist.

331
00:36:46,657 --> 00:36:52,209
With his share of the water, Mafourdi
has created an oasis to grow date palms.

332
00:36:57,097 --> 00:37:01,375
And this attracts
all sorts of surprising visitors.

333
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:19,051
Once you have a permanent water supply,
anything's possible.

using more water per person
than almost anywhere else in the world.

339
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:44,330
Is this humanity realising
an impossible dream?

340
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:47,175
Or is it just a neon mirage?

00:37:51,777 --> 00:37:56,726
The deserts of the world are littered with
ruins of boom-and-bust civilisations

342
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,654
where the water ran out.

343
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:06,333
Petra in Jordan was an ancient city
which once had an aqueduct system

344
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:11,405
delivering 40 million litres of water
a day to 20,000 people.

345
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:23,813
For most desert dwellers,
life revolves around the meagre rains.

346
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:29,254
Only with rain can they hope
to survive the next blazing year.

347
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:35,249
But in Mali, desert rains are
anything but reliable.

348
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:43,171
Some years, they don't come at all.

350
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,934
But if they do,
the villagers know they come violently

351
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:52,287
so they must make their granaries
watertight.

(CHATTER)

353
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:02,007
The rains are preceded by sandstorms,

354
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:07,131
so now people watch the skies,
waiting for a rampaging wall of dust.

355
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:20,645
At 50 kilometres wide, and advancing
at a speed of 1 00 kilometres an hour,

356
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:24,087
the sandstorm engulfs the village
in minutes.

357
00:39:56,177 --> 00:40:00,090
But people know
this darkness is ultimately a good sign.

358
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:08,609
Finally the rain is unleashed.

359
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:13,014
1 5 centimetres falls in 20 minutes,

360
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:17,130
turning the desert into
a network of streams.

00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:26,094

it's suddenly a moment to rejoice.

In deserts across the world,
rains transform the landscape.

364
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:16,531
This is the one moment when life is
no longer about the quest for water.

When the rains are good enough,

370
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:43,327
they can abandon
their normally isolated lives.

371
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:46,847
There's enough food and water
to support a few hundred Wodaabe

coming together for one of
the most extraordinary gatherings

of fertility and flirtation in the world.

00:41:57,137 --> 00:42:00,652
In this hive of activity is Djao.

375
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:05,646
He's walked 80 kilometres to be here,
for a contest called Gerewol.

376
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:09,695
It's a courtship dance for sex.

377
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,695
Winning means he'll get a new lover.

00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:32,289
This year is special.

It's the first Gerewol
after six years of drought,

380
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:39,853
so expectations are running high.

381

Djao is already married,
and his wife Tembe is here too.

Indeed, this festival
is full of married couples.

Wodaabe culture allows both men and women

384
00:42:54,297 --> 00:42:59,166
to set aside their marriage vows
without stigma for these few days.

385
00:43:00,857 --> 00:43:04,167

He must show his teeth,
flutter his lips and sing from his throat.

He must dance in time

to choose their champions.

The first walks up the line

416

and, with a subtle gesture,
indicates the man of her dreams.

417

00:46:58,337 --> 00:47:00,373
Nor the third.

00:47:03,217 --> 00:47:05,253
Djao has missed his chance.

421
00:47:05,297 --> 00:47:08,892
His best efforts weren't enough
to win a lover.

422
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:15,407
It'll be at least a year before he has
the opportunity to dance again.

Many new couples are hanging out,

425

but at least Djao and Tembe
still have each other.

So, the men and women disperse,
some with new lovers, some with old,

but all have been touched
by the flush of fertility and community

to the isolation of the desert.

the truly epic nature

of the Tubu women's Sahara crossing
was to film from the air.

439
00:49:31,777 --> 00:49:35,611
The best tool for this job
was a Cinebulle -

440

a hot-air balloon with a small motor.

441

But temperamental technology
and cantankerous camels

442

combined to make this
the hardest desert shoot of all.

443
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:56,695
It took three days of hard driving

444
00:49:56,737 --> 00:50:01,128
before cameraman Toby Strong and the crew
could reach the women and start filming.

of the beast. We're here in the desert.

and start assembling the Cinebulle.

Dany Cleyet-Marrel designed it
specifically for filming.

453
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,087
With only a small engine,
it flies best in the cool morning air

454
00:50:34,137 --> 00:50:36,890
with no more than a light breeze.

455
00:50:43,337 --> 00:50:45,726
This is my first time up in a...
in a Cinebulle.

456
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:49,133
I've got two friends, two cameramen,
who've been up in this.

457
00:50:49,177 --> 00:50:52,169
The first one, they crashed into a tree,

458
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:57,849
and on the second occasion,
that caught fire, the actual engine.

459
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:01,335
What I think we're gonna do is go up,

460
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:04,016
and I might have lied a little bit
about how heavy I am,

461
00:51:04,057 --> 00:51:06,491
so we might find out
that he needs a little more gas.

462
00:51:06,537 --> 00:51:08,926
Kind of a bit of test flight, like that.

463
00:51:08,977 --> 00:51:13,971
But the camels haven't read the schedule
and they've gone to the four corners.

464
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:18,135
Every night, the camels are released
to search for food.

465
00:51:18,177 --> 00:51:23,126
So, each morning, it takes time
to round them up again.

466
00:51:23,177 --> 00:51:26,374
OK, we have to go, we have to go.
It will be too late after.

467
00:51:28,257 --> 00:51:30,930
When the camels are finally ready,

468
00:51:30,977 --> 00:51:35,050
Toby and Dany set off
to film the women loading up.

469
00:51:35,097 --> 00:51:37,565
But the shoot doesn't go well.

470
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:41,886
What happened was, the balloon took off,

471
00:51:41,937 --> 00:51:46,055
the butane gas has been cold overnight,
and the burner was cutting out.

472
00:51:47,257 --> 00:51:49,452
They almost came down
within the women and the camels.

473
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:55,774
And then the balloon came down,
bounced, took off again,

474
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:57,967
completely freaking out the camels.

475
00:51:58,017 --> 00:51:59,928
So, not a very good start to the morning.

476
00:52:02,057 --> 00:52:03,649
TOBY: We lost the burner four times,

477
00:52:03,697 --> 00:52:08,725
plummeted down over the camels,
the Tubu women and the kids.

478
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:11,416
Obviously, freaked them out.
Freaked me out a little bit.

479
00:52:11,457 --> 00:52:14,255
So, that wasn't great on the first flight.

480
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:19,815
After a few more flights,
Toby becomes acutely aware of the wind.

481
00:52:19,857 --> 00:52:22,815
TOBY: Working with Cinebulles
is almost exactly like a boat.

482
00:52:22,857 --> 00:52:24,256
You've got the wind going
in that direction

483
00:52:24,297 --> 00:52:28,051
and, although the Cinebulle's got a motor,
you can't really go against the wind.

484
00:52:28,097 --> 00:52:30,565
So, you've really only got
one pop at each shot.

485
00:52:30,617 --> 00:52:32,926
Difficult with the wind.

486
00:52:34,257 --> 00:52:37,374
TOBY: We're fighting the wind, engine's
rewing and there's vibration and shake.

487
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:41,012
I've only got a very limited arc
to pan around.

488
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,287
So, there's a huge amount of skill
involved from Dany

489
00:52:43,337 --> 00:52:46,852
and the guys on the ground
getting the camels going the right way.

490
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,933
So, it's a massive logistical operation.

491
00:52:48,977 --> 00:52:51,775
In the beginning we had
a problem with the gas,

492
00:52:51,817 --> 00:52:53,728
and after, a problem with the wind.

493
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:56,052

The next day, after an early flight,
they face another problem.

496
00:53:03,857 --> 00:53:07,850
The Tubu women don't hang around
for the crew to pack up the Cinebulle.

497
00:53:10,697 --> 00:53:14,372
They only have enough provisions
for a normal trek across the desert,

498
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,169
so the team has to play catch-up.

499
00:53:16,217 --> 00:53:18,970
TOBY: We've no idea
where our camels have gone.

500
00:53:19,017 --> 00:53:22,327
There's 25 camels out there, you'd think
we'll find them, but it's not...

501
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:26,495
you know, you look around and it is
just like an ocean with a gentle swell.

502
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:29,847
So we're just driving round peak to peak,
seeing if we can spot them.

503
00:53:32,497 --> 00:53:35,534
Good news, we've hit
the main caravan route,

504
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:38,045
which is a bit like...bit like the M6,

and even better news, there's a few groups
of camels coming this way.

506
00:53:42,537 --> 00:53:46,894
The boys, with better eyes than I, say
they think that this is some of our group,

507
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,848
so it's good news.

508
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:56,810
With the camels in place,

509
00:53:56,857 --> 00:54:01,567
Toby and Dany at last see the opportunity
for getting some really good shots.

510
00:54:04,537 --> 00:54:07,734
- DANY: Not so bad.
- TOBY: It's nice.

511
00:54:12,017 --> 00:54:13,973
I think we've got some nice shots.

512
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,531
And then at the end,
we went up really high,

513
00:54:16,577 --> 00:54:19,728
and to see the whole desert opened up
was extraordinary.

514
00:54:19,777 --> 00:54:21,096
That was a good flight.

515
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:26,170
They've had some success,
but the biggest challenge lies ahead -

516
00:54:26,217 --> 00:54:28,777
filming the women's arrival at the well.

517
00:54:28,817 --> 00:54:32,935
But on a dusty night,
the stars of the show go missing.

518
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:35,969
TOBY: We've just been using
our big spotlight as a beacon,

519
00:54:36,017 --> 00:54:38,451
because three of the women
and six of the camels

520
00:54:38,497 --> 00:54:40,135
didn't make it into camp tonight

521
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,408
and here in the desert, there's
a very good chance of people getting lost.

522
00:54:43,457 --> 00:54:47,336
Thankfully, it worked, so everyone is
safely into camp for the night,

523
00:54:47,377 --> 00:54:48,696
which is brilliant news.

524
00:54:50,177 --> 00:54:52,566
It's only when the sun's gone down

525
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:56,166
that Toby has time
to deal with a domestic problem.

526
00:54:56,217 --> 00:54:59,175
We brought out 30-odd cases from England.

527
00:54:59,217 --> 00:55:02,254
One bag didn't turn up,
and that bag was my clothes.

528
00:55:02,297 --> 00:55:05,175
So, couldn't wait for it,
had to come into the desert,

529
00:55:05,217 --> 00:55:09,290
and that is why I'm washing my shirt
quite regularly

530
00:55:09,337 --> 00:55:12,329
in, er...my allowance of water.

531
00:55:15,697 --> 00:55:20,213
None of this goes to waste. This water
will be used for...for tea tomorrow.

532
00:55:22,457 --> 00:55:23,856
No, it won't.

533
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,094
The next morning
is the most important one.

534
00:55:30,137 --> 00:55:31,855
The women are due to arrive at the well

535
00:55:31,897 --> 00:55:33,967
after days of navigating
across the desert.

536
00:55:34,017 --> 00:55:37,327
It's crucial that Toby gets shots
of them arriving,

537
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:40,687
but, as usual, there are difficulties.

538
00:55:43,617 --> 00:55:47,246
The logistics involved
of finding where the well is

539
00:55:47,297 --> 00:55:50,494
and then driving the whole way round
so as not to get any tyre tracks.

540
00:55:50,537 --> 00:55:53,051
Dany having to guess
where the wind's coming from.

541
00:55:53,097 --> 00:55:57,215
The whole logistical operation of getting
right here, for this point, is enormous

542
00:55:57,257 --> 00:55:59,851
and we've just about managed
to get it right.

543
00:55:59,897 --> 00:56:02,206
We're all here, we're ready to go.

544
00:56:02,257 --> 00:56:05,010
The wind is perfect. Dany got it spot-on.

545
00:56:05,057 --> 00:56:10,256
And the camels are maybe 45 minutes away.
So, it's...it's massively frustrating.

546
00:56:10,297 --> 00:56:15,451
Now it's absolutely perfect. No camels.

547
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:20,412
Yet again, the camels have gone off
foraging in the night,

548
00:56:20,457 --> 00:56:25,133
then, at last, as the sun rises,
they appear over the horizon.

549
00:56:30,857 --> 00:56:32,734
Everything comes together.

550
00:56:32,777 --> 00:56:35,211
The women and the camels are ready,

551
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:39,375
and, with no wind, Toby is able
to move around them in the early light,

552
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:42,454
capturing a magical scene.

553
00:57:21,177 --> 00:57:24,886
As the women close in on the town of Fachi
at the end of the trek,

554
00:57:24,937 --> 00:57:29,215
the crew can finally relax,
with their problems behind them.

555
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:35,526
Nice. It was a very, very nice flight.
Nice light. Good speed of wind.

556
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,805
We've got a problem.

557
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:40,167
I thought we landed far enough away
from town to be out of everyone's way.

558
00:57:40,217 --> 00:57:43,766
But lurking to the horizon...and there are
hundreds of specks

559
00:57:43,817 --> 00:57:46,206
running this way.
I reckon we've got three minutes

560
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:48,930
before we're completely engulfed.

561
00:57:48,977 --> 00:57:52,492
OK, I think Dany's off to, er...
intercept the hordes.

562
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:01,411
Those kids must be so excited.

563
00:58:01,457 --> 00:58:03,687
I think Dany's got a bit of a treat
for them.

564
00:58:06,257 --> 00:58:08,248
(WHOOSH)

565
00:58:16,177 --> 00:58:20,568
To the delight of all, the crew
have triumphed against the odds...

566
00:58:20,617 --> 00:58:23,370
and the stubborn camels.

567
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,373
(CHEERING)
