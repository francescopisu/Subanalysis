35
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:03,133
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: Sometimes I would
hear a car crunch up in the snow,

36
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:05,566
and I'd think maybe it
would be somebody coming

37
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:07,133
to give us bad news.

38
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:10,165
Which was not good for me to think.

39
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:12,165
It was an underlying anxiety

40
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,165
that I really think was there all the time.

41
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,699
NARRATOR: All his young
life, Denton Crocker, Jr....

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
known as "Mogie" to his family...

43
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,133
had dreamed of serving his country,

44
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,500
of putting his own life on the line

45
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,432
in defense of what he called
"individual freedom."

46
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:34,500
He'd wanted to serve in Vietnam so much

47
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,633
he'd pressured his parents
into granting their permission

48
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:40,765
for him to join the Army before he was 18.

49
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:46,800
He was eager for combat and
pleased when he was assigned

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,233
to the 1st Brigade of the
celebrated 101st Airborne,

51
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:55,532
the "Screaming Eagles" who
had led the way on D-Day.

52
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,400
But he was quickly disappointed
to find himself attached

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,400
to battalion headquarters,
repairing weapons, making lists,

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,265
keeping records.

55
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:09,865
It was "boring," he wrote home.

56
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:13,206
MOGIE CROCKER (dramatized): I think perhaps
you will understand my disappointment

57
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:16,033
when you see that there is
little sense in being over here

58
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,332
unless one faces the main objective,

59
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:21,000
the destruction of the VC.

60
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:25,633
Certainly one feels no
sense of accomplishment

61
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:28,432
when one's friends are
facing all the dangers.

62
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:34,966
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: I had a map on
the back of the living room door.

63
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:39,000
And I put pins in it every
time Denton Jr. moved.

64
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,533
And he moved a lot.

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,165
And I knew those names at one time

66
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:49,466
as well as any area of our own world.

67
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,932
LYNDON JOHNSON: Well, how'd
you have a good weekend?

68
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:04,032
ROBERT McNAMARA: (laughs)

69
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,400
Yeah, I did, Mr. President.

70
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,699
I hope you did too.

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,308
JOHNSON: What's your thinking these days?

72
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,600
I haven't talked to you.

73
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,000
What's happening to our pause?

74
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,533
What are our generals saying?

75
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:15,065
McNAMARA: See, I think you'll
find some foreign leaders

76
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:17,966
will criticize you if you resume bombing.

77
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:21,665
As a matter of fact, no
other intelligence source

78
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:24,800
that I've seen indicates that
Hanoi is even considering

79
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,600
moving toward negotiation

80
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,832
in order to lead us to extend the pause.

81
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:30,365
Intelligence information...

82
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:34,266
NARRATOR: As 1966 began, the
president of the United States

83
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:36,766
was just learning the name of the man

84
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:41,132
who was the most powerful member
of the Politburo in Hanoi...

85
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,733
Le Duan.

86
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,675
McNAMARA: ...First Secretary
of the Communist Party,

87
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,832
a man named Le Duan... L-E capital D-U-A-N...

88
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:50,300
who today is putting considerable pressure

89
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,932
on Ho Chi Minh and others
to ensure continuing a war

90
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:56,432
that he thinks they either
are winning or can win.

91
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,453
("Masters of War" by The
Staple Singers playing)

92
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,932
♪ They're masters of war

93

♪ You build the big planes. ♪

95
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:12,308
NARRATOR: As they continued
to escalate the war,

96
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:15,199
Johnson and McNamara were frustrated

97
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,233
that American commanders in
Vietnam, who had come of age

98
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:21,665
during World War II and Korea,

99
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,899
were having a hard time making sense

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,399
of what was happening on the ground.

101
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,632
In the months and years to come,
as the American presence grew,

102
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:34,033
Hanoi would escalate too,

103
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:36,932
sending more and more soldiers south,

104
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:40,199
strengthening its own air defenses,

105
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,432
and recruiting more fighters

106
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:45,932
from the alienated South
Vietnamese countryside.

107
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,766
The Johnson administration
was desperately trying

108
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:57,000
to prop up the government in
Saigon and, at the same time,

109
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,300
help that government to
somehow win the loyalty

110
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,266
of its own people.

111
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:06,432
Johnson had tried to forge
an international coalition

112
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,833
to defend South Vietnam.

113
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:14,033
But only five other countries
would ever send combat troops...

114
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:18,033
Australia and New Zealand,
Thailand, the Philippines,

115
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:20,065
and South Korea.

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,165
America's most important allies,
Britain, France and Canada,

117
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:32,266
refused to take part and were
calling instead for peace talks.

118
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:35,033
And more and more Americans,

119
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,865
including some of the
country's most respected

120
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,800
foreign policy experts,

121
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,399
were beginning to question the
way the war was being fought,

122
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,733
whether it could ever be won,

123
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:50,766
and if the United States
should be in Vietnam at all.

124
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,300
(explosion)

125
00:06:53,399 --> 00:07:01,199
As 1966 began, 2,344 Americans
had died in Vietnam.

126
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,165
Nearly 200,000 were stationed there,

127
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:07,333
and more were on their way.

128
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,233
Those soldiers would quickly discover

129
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,565
that the war they were being asked to fight

130
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:16,365
was not their father's war.

131
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:22,500
SAM WILSON: We tend to fight the next war

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,466
in the same way we fought the last one.

133
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:29,733
We are prisoners of our own experience.

134
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:32,233
And many of the things that
we learned that worked

135
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:33,399
in World War II

136
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,000
were not applicable to the war in Vietnam.

137
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:41,000
We simply thought we'd go
in with a sledgehammer

138
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,766
and knock things down, clean them up,

139
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:44,733
and it would be all over.

140
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:48,300
It was a kind of an oversimplification

141
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,132
of the problem

142
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:54,533
combined with our
overconfidence that caused us,

143
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:57,165
I think, to be arrogant.

144
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,565
And it's very, very difficult
to dispel ignorance

145
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:02,833
if you retain arrogance.

146
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:08,065
STAPLES SINGERS: ♪ I'll stand over your

(gavel pounding)

148
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,065
NARRATOR: In early February of 1966,

149
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:25,232
President Johnson got more bad news.

150
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:28,133
His old friend, J. William Fulbright,

151
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,298
the powerful chairman

152
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,899
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,100
planned to hold hearings
on the Vietnam War,

154
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,700
and the television networks
intended to cover the hearings

155
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,600
from gavel to gavel.

156
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,133
Fulbright, who had once supported the war,

157
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,133
now opposed it.

158
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:50,500
LBJ was alarmed.

159
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,432
His own advisers had been
giving him conflicting advice

160
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,033
about Vietnam for years.

161
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:59,200
But a public debate about
how he was running the war

162
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:03,332
in front of millions of Americans
filled him with dread.

163
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,399
As the hearings got underway,

164
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,166
the president tried to deflect attention

165
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:13,000
by suddenly announcing he was
going to a military conference

166
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,299
in Honolulu, to meet for the
first time the two generals

167
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,166
who now headed the Saigon government.

168
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:21,976
ED HERLIHY: It is a meeting
without precedent,

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,799
and is designed to strengthen
United States determination

170
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,365
to pursue to the end the drive
against communist domination

171
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:29,832
in South Vietnam.

172
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,332
NARRATOR: General Nguyen Van
Thieu was the chief of state,

173
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:40,899
but real power lay with
Thieu's bitter rival,

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,200
the former head of the South
Vietnamese Air Force,

175
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:47,365
Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky.

176
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:52,265
Ky was "an unguided missile,"
according to one U.S. diplomat,

177
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:55,066
known for his flamboyant uniforms,

178
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:59,200
his gaudy private life, and
his public pronouncements.

179
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,566
He once told a reporter that
what Vietnam really needed

180
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,100
was "five Hitlers."

181
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,865
PHAN QUANG TUE: How could we
allow and accept that to happen?

182
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:11,899
He was a charlatan.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,566
The man not only has no training,

184
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,732
has no education, but
doesn't seem to inter...

185
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:23,299
be interested in being educated,
and proud of his ignorance.

186
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,932
TRAN NGOC CHAU (speaking English):

187
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,899
(laughing)

188
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,000
NARRATOR: President Johnson spent
most of his time in Honolulu

189
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,299
urging Ky to focus on pacification...

190
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,432
earning the support of the
South Vietnamese people

191
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,799
by undertaking economic and social reforms

192
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,966
Americans had been calling
for for more than a decade.

193
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:17,600
Johnson wasn't interested
in "high-sounding words"

194
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,865
about progress, he said.

195
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:22,365
He wanted genuine achievements...

196
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:27,500
what they called in Texas,
"coonskins on the wall."

197
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,399
BUI DIEM: Well, nobody understood
what does it mean "coonskin."

198
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,100
And people the Vietnamese at
the delegation they ask me,

199
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,033
"You understand what it is?"

200
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,566
And myself I said, "Well,
I don't understand."

201
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,066
I have to ask some Americans
to explain to me.

202
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:46,332
And some American friends,
they explain to me later on

203
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,566
and only by then the Vietnamese understood.

204
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,299
I happen to hold the point of view

205
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,966
that it isn't going to be too long

206
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,133
before the American people, as a people,

207
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,799
will repudiate our war in Southeast Asia.

208
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,676
MAXWELL TAYLOR: That,
of course, is good news

209
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,899
to Hanoi, Senator.

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,666
MORSE: Oh, I know that

211
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,399
that's the smear artist that you
militarists give to those of us

212
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,176
that have honest differences
of opinion with you.

213
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,865
But I don't intend to get
down in the gutter with you

214
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:13,200
and engage in that kind of debate, General.

215
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,732
NARRATOR: Johnson's trip to
Honolulu had not distracted

216
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:18,133
the American public.

217
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:21,332
They were riveted to the hearings.

218
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:23,865
And I also think that great countries,

219
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,932
especially this country,

220
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,865
is quite strong enough to
engage in a compromise

221
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:31,133
without losing its standing in the world,

222
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:33,700
without losing its prestige
as a great nation.

223
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,865
On the contrary, I think it would be

224
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:40,232
one of the greatest victories
for us and our prestige

225
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:44,165
if we could-could be ingenious
enough and magnanimous enough

226
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,133
to bring about some kind of a settlement

227
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,000
of this particular struggle.

228
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,533
NARRATOR: Fulbright invited the
respected diplomat George Kennan

229
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,232
to testify.

230
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:57,299
For two decades, his
doctrine of containment...

231
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,299
stopping Soviet expansion...

232
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,466
had been the basis of
American foreign policy,

233
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:05,633
and had in some ways been the justification

234
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:11,000
for leading the United States
into its proxy war in Vietnam.

235
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,476
KENNAN: The first point
I would like to make

236
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,732
is that if we were not already
involved as we are today

237
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,533
in Vietnam,

238
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,100
I would know of no reason

239
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,799
why we should wish to become so involved,

240
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,500
and I could think of several reasons

241
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,033
why we should wish not to.

242
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:30,265
You have referred to containment here.

243
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:35,633
How... how can we contain in Vietnam?

244
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,399
We would do better if we
really would show ourselves

245
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,966
a little more relaxed and less
terrified of what happens

246
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,033
in the...

247
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:48,932
certainly in the smaller
countries of Asia and Africa,

248
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:53,066
and not jump around like an
elephant frightened by a mouse

249
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,365
every time these things occur.

250
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:59,133
NARRATOR: Johnson was relieved
when, at the last moment,

251
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:02,200
instead of airing Kennan's testimony,

252
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,700
CBS showed reruns ofThe Real McCoys,

253
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,799
The Andy Griffith Show andl Love Lucy.

254
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,966
But NBC kept the cameras running.

255
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,865
This is not only not our business,

256
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:18,865
but I don't think we can
do it successfully.

257
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,832
And I take it by this you mean that

258
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:24,932
this is simply not a practicable objective,

259
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:27,500
as I understand it, in this country.

260
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,865
We can't achieve it even
with the best of will.

261
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,600
This is correct, and I have a fear

262
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,232
that our thinking about this
whole problem is still affected

263
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:42,966
by some sort of illusions about
invincibility on our part.

264
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:54,899
NARRATOR: Just before the hearings began,

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,066
the president had decided to
resume the bombing of targets

266
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,033
in North Vietnam.

267
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:05,932
The 37-day pause that had
begun on Christmas Eve 1965

268
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:09,100
had yielded no hint of Hanoi's willingness

269
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,332
to come to the negotiating table.

270
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,399
In South Vietnam, Viet Cong
guerrillas were now believed

271
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,500
to control nearly
three-quarters of the country.

272
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,399
But General William Westmoreland,

273
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,299
the American commander,
thought his most urgent task

274
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,100
was to destroy the North
Vietnamese regular army units

275
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,000
Hanoi was sending South.

276
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,865
Westmoreland's target
for the next two years

277
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:43,133
would be reaching what he
called the "crossover point"...

278
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:46,100
the point at which U.S. and ARVN forces

279
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,100
were killing more enemy troops
than could be replaced.

280
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,765
It would be a war of attrition.

281
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:59,765
But that would require still
more American soldiers.

282
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:05,133
They came from every corner of the country.

283
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,832
MATT HARRISON: I was born at West Point
when my dad was on the faculty there.

284
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:14,432
From my earliest recollection,

285
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,799
West Point was what I wanted to do,

286
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:19,666
not even particularly
because I had an inkling

287
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:21,932
or a strong desire for a military career.

288
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,133
It's just...

289
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,141
West Point was kind of the
height of my ambition.

290
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:27,265
("On, Brave Old Army Team" playing)

291
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:30,432
NARRATOR: The son of a colonel
who had served in World War II,

292
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:35,299
Matt Harrison had grown up on
Army bases around the world.

293
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,399
For him and his four siblings,

294
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,865
the military was always at
the center of their lives.

295
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:46,100
ANNE HARRISON BOWMAN: You addressed
parents "sir" and "ma'am,"

296
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,000
and you said "yes" and not "yeah."

297
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,365
And you answered the phone,
"Colonel Harrison's quarters."

298
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:55,265
We got up every Saturday morning
and we dusted the house.

299
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:58,299
My dad would put on the
West Point marching band

300
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,560
and my sister and I would
dust around the living room.

301
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:03,566
NARRATOR: It seemed to Matt's parents

302
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:05,865
that he could do no wrong.

303
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:09,232
He was the embodiment of the
values they had hoped to instill

304
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:14,365
in all their children:
duty, honor, and country.

305
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,299
HARRISON: The strongest
impression I have from my class

306
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,732
and my classmates was they were
guys who just were idealists.

307
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,766
And I think guys drawn from little towns

308
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:29,200
all across the United
States had that in common.

309
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,200
It was a time before the questions

310
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,365
about American exceptionalism.

311
00:17:34,465 --> 00:17:36,400
We didn't question.

312
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,633
We believed in what this country stood for,

313
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:43,965
and we believed that
people who had the ability

314
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,200
to lead soldiers should do that.

ROGER HARRIS: I wanted to
go with the gladiators.

319
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,532
I wanted to go with the tough guys.

320
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:11,165
I was born in Boston, in the
Roxbury section of Boston.

321
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:14,333
There were those who would
recruit you for gangs

322
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:17,700
and try to entice you to do things

323
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,365
that-that weren't in the
best interest of society.

324
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:22,500
Let's put it like that.

325
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,099
NARRATOR: Roger Harris
dreamed of going to college

326
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,865
on a football scholarship,
but was not big enough

327
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:31,400
to play for his team in high school.

328
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,665
HARRIS: And so I enlisted
in the Marine Corps.

329
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:37,732
And I felt that... that it was a win-win

330
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,633
because, one, if I died,
then my mother would be able

331
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:45,900
to receive the $10,000 insurance policy.

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
I thought that was a lot of money,

333
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,365
that my mother will be rich if I die.

334
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,465
You know, she'll be rich.

335
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,865
If I live, then I'll be a hero, you know,

336
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:57,232
and I can come back and get a job.

337
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,700
Naive, dumb, you know?

338
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,799
NARRATOR: John Musgrave was
from the Fairmount neighborhood

339
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,266
of Independence, Missouri.

340
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:09,732
MUSGRAVE: I was 17 and my best friend and I

341
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,965
went down and enlisted in the Marine Corps.

342
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:15,000
I had always dreamed of being a Marine.

343
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,732
And...

344
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:23,465
Well, I knew I wasn't going
to be a man right away

345
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:26,066
but I was going to be a
Marine, and that was enough.

346
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,365
I'd be doing something mature.

347
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:33,032
And I'd be doing something
that was important.

348
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:37,932
And there was a war on and
I wanted a piece of it.

00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,232
And every Memorial Day

351
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,432
all that generation of World
War II would dress up

352
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:49,612
in their American Legion
uniforms and parade around.

353
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,932
And I'd put red, white, and
blue crepe paper on my bicycle.

354
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:57,333
And the kids could ride behind the parade.

355
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,566
NARRATOR: Bill Ehrhart would sign
up in part because his father,

356
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:05,500
a pastor, had not served.

357
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,633
Ehrhart was a gifted student

358
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:10,665
and in his senior year in high school

359
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:13,766
was accepted by four colleges.

360
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:15,665
Had he attended any one of them,

361
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:19,032
he would have been deferred from the draft.

362
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,665
It all came down to this notion

363
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:23,700
of I was going to serve
my country and be a hero

364
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:27,266
and have that gorgeous
Marine Corps uniform.

365
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:30,333
And the girls would just
be draped around my neck

366
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:33,066
and nobody would beat me up again.

367
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,465
But at the same time

368
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,000
I would really be serving my country.

369
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:40,833
It was my chance to be... (sighs)

370
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:43,500
one doesn't want to trivialize
it, but it was my chance to be

371
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,432
the star of my own John Wayne movie.

372
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:50,732
It was my chance to do what that
World War II generation had done

373
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,066
and seemed to be so proud of.

374
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:56,133
Now I had my turn.

375
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:58,841
NARRATOR: Wherever they came from,

376
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:01,833
whatever their reasons for
joining the military,

377
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,333
training transformed them.

378
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:08,799
(United States Marine Band
playing "Semper Fidelis" march)

379
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:15,566
For about the first five
weeks at Parris Island,

380
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:19,165
I was convinced that I
was going to die there.

381
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:22,793
The drill instructors said
they were going to kill me.

382
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,400
And they certainly sounded serious.

383
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:29,732
MUSGRAVE: I grew up in segregated
neighborhoods all my life.

384
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,599
So, I'd never met a black person
till I arrived at boot camp.

385
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,400
Never stood next to a black
person or a Hispanic

386
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,165
or anyone who was Jewish.

387
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:42,400
I just... they didn't mix where I grew up.

388
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,965
So that was just eye opening.

389
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:48,532
But when I got to talking to
everybody, we were all the same.

390
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:51,232
We were all working class and poor.

391
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,566
And we all wanted to be Marines real bad.

392
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,266
EHRHART: By the time I graduated,

393
00:21:58,365 --> 00:22:01,665
I felt like I was king of the world.

394
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:03,700
I was God.

395
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,066
I could do anything.

396
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:09,400
On that day I became a Marine.

397
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,299
You know, the Marine Corps
trains you to be a fighter.

398
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,465
They train you to fight,
they train you to kill.

399
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:18,700
They used to say that if
you're a Marine, you can't die

400
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,400
until you kill three Vietnamese.

401
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,633
And I said, "Well, I'm from Roxbury.

402
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:29,633
If the expectation is three, I'll do ten."

403
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:33,066
You know, craziness.

404
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:35,133
(gunshot)

405
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
LESLIE GELB: The tendency
for a great power is to use

406
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,000
what it's greatest at...

407
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,299
namely its firepower, destructive power.

408
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,633
Dropping a lot of bombs and
shooting a lot of artillery

409
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,500
at a distance.

410
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,865
You save lives.

411
00:22:56,965 --> 00:22:59,566
You kill a lot of them, you
don't lose a lot of us.

412
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:03,932
NARRATOR: The central coastal
province of Binh Dinh

413
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:06,932
was home to more than
half a million people.

414
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:10,633
For decades, it had been
a guerrilla stronghold,

415
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:13,599
and in early 1966,

416
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,833
the Viet Cong had been augmented
by North Vietnamese regulars,

417
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:21,532
some 8,000 men in all.

418
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:27,900
General Westmoreland sent 20,000 American,

419
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,865
South Vietnamese and South Korean troops

420
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:34,266
storming across the province
in pursuit of the enemy

421
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:36,932
and their sources of supply.

422
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:41,599
They first dropped leaflets and
broadcast from loudspeakers

423
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,732
to warn villagers of the terrible fate

424
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:47,532
that awaited anyone who
fired on their helicopters,

425
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,865
urged them to leave their homes,

426
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:53,200
promised safe passage to any Viet Cong

427
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,865
who wished to surrender.

428
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:58,532
Then they called in
airstrikes and artillery

429
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:02,400
and blew the hamlets to bits.

430
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,900
It was the first large-scale
search-and-destroy campaign

431
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,833
of the war.

432
00:24:08,932 --> 00:24:10,333
(shouting, gunfire)

433
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,099
The offensive lasted 42 days.

434
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,799
The Army reported 2,389
enemy soldiers killed.

435
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,833
Westmoreland was pleased.

436
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,532
But commanders on the scene were concerned

437
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,299
that despite all the American
firepower brought against them,

438
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,232
most of the North Vietnamese
regulars had still managed

439
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,965
to escape back into the Central Highlands.

440
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:44,665
The operation would drive
more than 100,000 civilians

441
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:46,432
from their homes.

442
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:50,799
Similar search-and-destroy
and bombing campaigns...

443
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:56,066
17 large-scale U.S.
offensives in 1966 alone...

444
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:57,599
would produce a total

445
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,665
of more than three million homeless people

446
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,333
all across the country,

447
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:07,665
roughly one-fifth of South
Vietnam's population.

448
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:15,266
Since there was no front in Vietnam,

449
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:18,865
as there had been in the
first and second World Wars,

450
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:23,299
since no ground was ever
permanently won or lost,

451
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,032
the American military
command in Vietnam... MACV...

452
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:31,566
fell back more and more on
a single grisly measure

453
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:33,432
of supposed success:

454
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,766
counting corpses.

455
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:38,532
Body count.

456
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,109
JAMES WILLBANKS: The problem with the war,

457
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:47,766
as it often is, are the metrics.

458
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:52,732
It is a situation where if you
can't count what's important,

459
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:55,333
you make what you can count important.

460
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:58,542
So, in this particular
case what you could count

461
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:01,032
was dead enemy bodies.

462
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:05,700
JOE GALLOWAY: You don't get
details with a body count.

463
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,633
You get numbers.

464
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:12,500
And the numbers are lies, most of 'em.

465
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:17,133
If body count is your success mark,

466
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:23,299
then you're pushing otherwise
honorable men, warriors,

467
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,732
to become liars.

468
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:28,400
ROBERT GARD: If body count

469
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,732
is the measure of success,

470
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:33,400
then there's the tendency
to count every body

471
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,633
as an enemy soldier.

472
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:40,200
There's a tendency to want
to pile up dead bodies

473
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:46,365
and perhaps to use less
discriminate firepower

474
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:47,932
than you otherwise might

475
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:51,500
in order to achieve the result

476
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,266
that you're charged with trying to obtain.

477
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:11,299
(man shouting)

478
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,232
MERRILL McPEAK: Just think about the
problem from the North's point of view.

479
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:24,599
They had to supply the South.

480
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,932
I'm talking about bringing in
people, equipment, supplies,

481
00:27:28,032 --> 00:27:29,932
and so forth.

482
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:35,000
They started from nothing and
pushed a road through that...

483
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,032
through an area the size of Massachusetts.

484
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:42,066
So this is not a trivial
amount of real estate

485
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:45,333
that they took over, built a road on,

486
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:47,032
and then maintained it.

487
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:53,432
NARRATOR: For years, Hanoi had
smuggled most of its arms and supplies

488
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:56,865
to the South aboard an
improvised fleet of junks,

489
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:59,333
trawlers and freighters.

490
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:01,965
But when the U.S. Navy
effectively blockaded

491
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,833
the Southern coastline,

492
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,266
the North Vietnamese
would be forced to move

493
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:09,133
almost all of their supplies overland,

494
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:11,333
through Laos and Cambodia,

495
00:28:11,432 --> 00:28:13,766
neutral countries Hanoi considered

496
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:16,232
part of the greater battlefield.

497
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,932
Americans called it the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

498
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:24,032
The North Vietnamese called it Route 559,

499
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:28,099
after the men and women
of the 559th Army Corps,

500
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,599
who were turning it from a
braided web of footpaths

501
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,865
into 12,000 tangled miles
of jungle roadways

502
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:39,665
down which men and materiel streamed south.

503
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,200
When they had fought the French,

504
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:46,365
the Viet Minh had depended on
tens of thousands of porters,

505
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:49,432
then on legions of bicycles.

506
00:28:49,532 --> 00:28:52,700
Now, to offset the growing
American presence,

507
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,532
the North Vietnamese used
more mechanized transport...

508
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:59,732
relays of six-wheeled Russian-built trucks

509
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:03,465
traveling under cover of darkness.

510
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:06,532
MACV reasoned that if the Ho Chi Minh Trail

511
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:09,133
could somehow be sufficiently damaged,

512
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:13,532
the enemy would be unable
to sustain itself.

513
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:19,665
Three million tons of explosives
would eventually be dropped

514
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:22,365
on the Laos portion of the trail alone...

515
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:26,599
a million more tons than
fell on Germany and Japan

516
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,500
during all of World War II.

517
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,599
Some key choke-points
were hit so many times

518
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,099
the workers gave them names...
"the Gate of Death,"

519
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,900
"Fried Flesh Hill" and
"the Gorge of Lost Souls."

520
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:47,566
To expose enemy traffic,

521
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:50,532
other aircraft dropped chemical defoliants,

522
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,566
including Agent Orange,

523
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,599
that destroyed thousands of acres of jungle

524
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,465
and turned the earth into what
one American pilot called

525
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:02,165
"bony, lunar dust."

526
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:06,400
McPEAK: We'd punch a hole
in the road and say,

527
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,109
"Ha ha, they'll never get around that one."

528
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:10,732
And the next day you'd come up,
and the hole wouldn't be there;

529
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,566
and there'd be dust on the trees
back, you know, 50 meters

530
00:30:13,665 --> 00:30:16,532
in both directions, saying,
heavy traffic all night.

DONG SI NGUYEN:

532
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,665
NARRATOR: As many as 230,000
teenagers, many of them volunteers,

533
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:42,799
worked to keep the roads
open and the traffic moving.

534
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,833
More than half of them were women.

535

Le Minh Khue, who had left
her home in the North

536

with a novel by Ernest
Hemingway in her backpack,

537
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:58,099

LE MINH KHUE:

539
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:19,432
NARRATOR: Thousands died on the trail
from starvation and accidents,

540
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:23,133
fevers and snakebite and sheer exhaustion,

541
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:26,066
as well as from the relentless bombing.

545
00:32:38,032 --> 00:32:40,441
HOWARD K. SMITH (on television): But
in this kind of war you never know.

546
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:42,232
You have to be constantly alert

547
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,766
because you can't tell
friends from enemies.

548
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:48,333
Relax for a moment and your
reward may be a grenade

549
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:49,865
or a hail of bullets.

550
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:52,133
CAROL CROCKER: I couldn't watch the news.

551
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:55,400
My parents would be sitting
in front of the television

552
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,900
and I would hide in the kitchen.

553
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:03,599
Of course you don't tell
anybody, but it was too much.

554
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,633
I really didn't want to know.

spent most of his boyhood

558
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,865
reading about war.

559
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:28,299
But nothing had prepared him

00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:03,666
There'd be at least eight to ten
days usually between letters.

So knowing he was in action,
you just didn't know what,

573
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:13,465
NARRATOR: Mogie's battalion commander,

574
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:15,766
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Emerson,

575
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:17,365
known as "The Gunfighter,"

576
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:21,199
was courageous, implacable, relentless.

577
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,500
A few months before Mogie got there,

578
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,000
he had offered a case of whiskey
to the first of his men

579
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,166
to bring him the hacked-off
head of an enemy soldier.

580
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:35,132
They did.

581
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:42,065
For nine days in early May of 1966,

582
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:46,500
Mogie and his outfit battled
nothing but the terrain.

583
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:49,599
They struggled through a
labyrinth of elephant grass

584
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,032
and thorn bushes,

585
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:53,932
bamboo taller than three men

586
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:56,766
and triple-canopied jungle so thick

587
00:34:56,865 --> 00:35:00,900
it sometimes took an hour to move 100 feet.

588
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,166
(thunder rumbles)

589
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,699
The monsoon had begun.

590
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,266
Sunlight rarely reached the forest floor.

591
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:09,400
Finger-long black leeches

592
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,132
caused wounds that quickly became infected.

593
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:16,532
When Colonel Emerson learned
that four companies

594
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:19,233
of North Vietnamese were
preparing an ambush,

595
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,432
he decided to ambush the ambushers.

596
00:35:23,632 --> 00:35:27,199
On May 11, he ordered his men to attack,

597
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,800
backed by massive air
and artillery strikes.

598
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,199
Before the fighting ended,

599
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:41,333
some 2,000 shells had slammed
into the enemy positions.

600
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:45,233
Blood was everywhere, pooled on the ground,

601
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,800
smeared on leaves and grass and bamboo.

602
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,333
There were scores of corpses,

603
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:55,900
torn to pieces or blown into
the earth, hidden in thickets,

604
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,132
half-buried in scooped-out graves.

605
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:01,565
The earth-shaking concussions

606
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:05,565
had blown the eyeballs of some
of them from their heads.

607
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,365
In the midst of the fighting,

608
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:11,132
Mogie's squad was moving
along a narrow path

609
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:14,400
when two enemy machine
guns opened up on them.

610
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,266
(gunfire)

611
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:23,965
His closest friend was fatally wounded.

612
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:28,733
Mogie crouched in front of him,
radioed for suppressive fire,

613
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:32,733
and then, as both machine
guns continued shooting,

614
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:37,233
he carried his dying friend
off the battlefield.

615
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,532
For his courage,

616
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:43,865
he would be awarded the
Army Commendation Medal.

617
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:49,365
In his letters home, Mogie told his family

618
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:53,365
nothing of what he'd seen or done.

620
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:04,065
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: One day when I was
at the post office mailing something,

621
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:08,065
I asked the clerk, "How
do they let you know

622
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,032
if your son is wounded?"

623
00:37:10,132 --> 00:37:13,166
It was very hard for me
to form those words.

624
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:15,865
But I just felt I've got to know.

625
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:20,266
I just felt so suspended
in space, in anxiety.

626
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:25,599
And the man said, "Now, don't ask that.

627
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:28,132
Don't think about that."

628
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:30,900
I said, "Well, I have to know."

629
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,599
And he said, "Don't
worry, they'll tell you."

BILL ZIMMERMAN: The war by 1966

644
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,800
began to impact the middle class

645
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,065
because the draft calls had to be enlarged.

646
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:37,166

648

They started drafting
people out of college.

649
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:45,733
And that's when the

NARRATOR: Bill Zimmerman
was a graduate student

657
00:39:06,932 --> 00:39:11,300
at the University of
Chicago in May of 1966.

658
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,032
The son of Eastern European refugees,

659
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:16,699
he'd worked for civil rights in Mississippi

660
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,099
and had been opposed to
American involvement in Vietnam

661
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,932
since 1963.

662
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:25,500
The draft was a consuming issue

663
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,132
for young men of Zimmerman's generation.

664
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:32,532
Since 1942, every male
citizen of the United States

665
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:36,333
had been required to register at age 18.

666
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:39,900
But of the nearly 27 million American men

667
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,733
who came of age during the Vietnam War,

668
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,833
more than half avoided military service

669
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:48,400
through exemptions and deferments.

670
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,166
Nearly 500,000 Americans applied

671
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:54,500
for conscientious objector status

672
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,766
on religious or moral grounds,

673
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:59,865
six times as many as in World War II.

674
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:06,132
In all, 170,000 were allowed
to perform alternative service

675
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:10,599
in hospitals, homeless
shelters, and schools.

676
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,766
Some were trained as medics
and sent to Vietnam.

677
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:17,365
At least two were killed;

678
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:21,233
both received the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

679
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:25,699
A million young men served in
the Reserves or National Guard

680
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,400
with the expectation they would
never be sent into combat.

681
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,032
Reservists and Guardsmen
were almost always white,

682
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,833
generally better educated,
better connected,

683
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:39,565
and better paid than draftees.

684
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:43,266
Interrupting their lives,
President Johnson felt,

00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:46,199

00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:18,166
though they represented
only 12% of the population,

696
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:22,000

number of casualties.

00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:33,441

702
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:34,599
That's what we got to do!

00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:36,065

We've got to build so much
strength inside our community,

706
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,565
so that when LBJ says, "Come
here, boy, to my war,"

707
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,666
we say, "Hell no, we ain't going."

708

NARRATOR: At first, 10,000 draftees
were called up each month,

722
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:25,565
but in 1966, the growing demand
for fresh troops in Vietnam

723
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:29,266
raised that number to 30,000.

724
00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:32,565
Now, thousands of college students

725
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:36,000
could no longer expect a deferment.

726
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:39,400
ZIMMERMAN: And if your rank
fell below a certain threshold,

727
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,632
you were yanked out of college.

00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:45,365
And the worst that could happen
to you is you would be killed

730
00:42:47,266 --> 00:42:50,699
So we protested at the
University of Chicago

731
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,400
that the university was
complicit with this war

732
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,766
by agreeing to supply those
rankings to the draft board.

733
00:42:59,865 --> 00:43:02,465
We thought for the first time, you know,

734
00:43:02,565 --> 00:43:04,365
we're really having an impact.

735
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:13,766
NARRATOR: But a majority of Americans,
old and young, supported the war.

736
00:43:13,865 --> 00:43:16,065
The Young Americans for Freedom,

LE QUAN CONG:

741
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,699
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: I was brought up to
believe that the communists were people

742
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,800
who destroy the family, destroy religion,

743
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,365
and people who had no
allegiance to our country

744
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,532
but to international communism.

745
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:42,666
My mother would describe them
as (speaking Vietnamese),

746
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:45,000
which means that these are people

747
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,766
with the head of a water buffalo
and the face of a horse,

748
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:51,800
meaning that they were
subhumans, and they were brutal.

749
00:44:53,132 --> 00:44:56,400
But on the other hand I thought
they also include people

750
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,166
like my sister Thang and
a lot of my cousins.

751
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:04,532
I couldn't quite reconcile the two images.

752
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:08,900
But of the two, I think the
other image was much stronger

753
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,900
because I was so scared of them.

754
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,500
I thought these people must be
really, really horrible people.

755
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:17,065
That was the frame of mind I had

756
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:21,400
when I started doing research
into the communist movement.

757

NARRATOR: Duong Van Mai was
the daughter of an official

758
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:28,266
in the South Vietnamese
government and was now married

759

to an American, David Elliott.

760
00:45:31,032 --> 00:45:34,166
Back in 1964, she had gone to work

761
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:36,865
for the RAND Corporation in Saigon.

762
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:39,199
The think tank had been commissioned

763
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,099
by Robert McNamara to do a
study of enemy prisoners

764
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,166
to find out "Who are the Viet Cong?

765
00:45:46,266 --> 00:45:48,565
And what makes them tick?"

766
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,599
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: I
remember my first interview.

767
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:54,365
I was by myself.

768
00:45:54,465 --> 00:45:59,333
I was very young and I was going
to this pretty grim prison

769
00:45:59,432 --> 00:46:04,065
to interview this high-ranking
cadre who had been captured.

770
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:08,199
I went in thinking I'm going
to meet this beast, you know,

771
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,666

772
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:12,300
and the face of a horse.

773
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,000
He walked in and he was
very surprised to see me.

774
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:16,266
(chuckles)

775
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:19,000
Just as surprised as I was to see him.

776
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:23,400
Here was a man who had devoted
all his life to fight

777
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,400
for what he called a just cause

778
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,132
to free his country of foreign domination,

779
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:33,800
to reunify the country
under just government.

780
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,900
So he really totally believed in it

781
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,233
to the point that he sacrificed
his whole life to this cause.

782

as a dedicated enemy

that "could only be
defeated at enormous cost,"

787
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,632
one senior official said,
"If what you say is true,

"we're fighting on the wrong side,

tactics to terrorize and murder

795

00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,000
that image is the...

797
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:54,365
it-it doesn't do justice
to the young men and women

798
00:47:54,465 --> 00:47:55,666
who served over there.

799
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:58,599
It's certainly not an accurate depiction

800
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:01,199

Johnson administration understood

00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,132
that the war could not be won

803
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:12,065
without convincing poor farmers
living in the countryside

804
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,932
that the government in
Saigon, not the Viet Cong,

805
00:48:16,032 --> 00:48:20,565
had their best interests at heart.

806
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:22,833
In addition to the military,

807
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:25,965
many American aid
organizations were at work

808
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:27,766
in Vietnamese villages.

809
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:30,666
They dug wells and built windmills,

810
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:34,733
started schools, introduced improved rice,

811
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,532
provided medical care,

812
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:40,400
and electrified much of the countryside.

813
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:45,800
Under pressure from Robert McNamara,

814
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,632
MACV struggled to find ways
to measure the progress

815
00:48:49,733 --> 00:48:54,099
of pacification in South
Vietnam's 44 provinces,

816
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:59,065
220 districts and 13,000 hamlets,

817
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:04,333
and finally came up with the
Hamlet Evaluation System.

818
00:49:04,432 --> 00:49:08,565
Soon some 220 U.S. district advisers

819
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:12,432
were required to produce some 90,000 pages

820
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:17,300
of data every month... a mountain
of information so daunting

821
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,065
no one could make sense of it.

822
00:49:23,766 --> 00:49:26,599
PHILIP BRADY: Everything can be quantified.

823
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:30,565
So you can literally say, "How
pacified is this village?"

824
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:33,699
"It's 37.5% pacified."

825
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,000
Well, what does that mean?

826
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:37,432
An American would tell you,

827
00:49:37,532 --> 00:49:40,865
"You know, we haven't had
an incident in this village

828
00:49:40,965 --> 00:49:43,500
or this province," whatever.

829
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,432
"The incident rate's going down,
and therefore we're winning."

830
00:49:49,532 --> 00:49:52,132
But we would point out that
certain troubled areas

831
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:54,833
in the provinces that we were working in,

832
00:49:54,932 --> 00:49:58,132
we would say simply that it's not pacified

833
00:49:58,233 --> 00:50:02,032
unless you want to consider it
pacified by the other side.

834
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:06,093
HERRINGTON: To the extent that
pacification was succeeding,

835
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:09,233
schools were being built,
wells were being cleaned.

836
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:10,632
And then one fine night

837
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:13,500
here comes 400 North Vietnamese
soldiers into the village,

838
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,432
executes the village chief,
kidnaps 12 of the young people

839
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:20,000
for, you know, service in the
revolutionary armed forces,

840
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,199
and the people look at
the government and say,

841
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:27,565
"You promised us you'd protect
us, but you didn't stay."

842
00:50:32,932 --> 00:50:34,699
MIKE HEANEY: I was over there early.

843
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,132
I was with a really good unit,
who believed in Army traditions,

844
00:50:39,233 --> 00:50:40,833
they believed in honor,

845
00:50:40,932 --> 00:50:44,932
they believed even in
treating your enemy humanely

846
00:50:45,032 --> 00:50:47,099
once he was a POW.

847
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,632
NARRATOR: Lieutenant Mike Heaney
from Basking Ridge, New Jersey,

848
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:54,800
was a platoon leader in
the 1st Cavalry Division.

849
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,166
He'd arrived late in 1965

850
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:01,266
and was assigned to a
densely populated section

851
00:51:01,365 --> 00:51:02,599
of central Vietnam,

852
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:04,800
where he found himself surrounded

853
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,166
by North Vietnamese infiltrators

854
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:10,800
and villagers whose loyalties were unclear.

855
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,099
HEANEY: We never really figured out

856
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:16,666
how to determine who the enemy was.

857
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:21,632
Being normal, decent American boys,

858
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:24,599
you don't just put your rifle
up and take a shot at a guy

859
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:25,865
and try to kill him

860
00:51:25,965 --> 00:51:29,733
unless you're pretty sure this is an enemy.

861
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,400
And if he wasn't armed,

862
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,500
or wasn't menacing you in any
way, we wouldn't shoot him.

863
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,865
We'd go through a village

864
00:51:39,965 --> 00:51:42,400
in which there would be no
people we could identify

865
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,000
as enemy soldiers, and we'd
find a big cache of rice.

866
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:49,365
So the standing instructions
were blow that up, burn it,

867
00:51:49,465 --> 00:51:51,233
destroy it, poison it, whatever.

868
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:54,965
We really didn't want to
do that because it...

869
00:51:55,065 --> 00:51:57,300
You didn't have to be a rocket
scientist to look around

870
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,008
and see these people are depending on this.

871
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,032
This is their food.

872
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:05,500
We were told sometimes to
burn thatched dwellings.

873
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:06,932
And guys would unenthusiastically

874
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:09,166
try to light a roof.

875
00:52:09,266 --> 00:52:11,000
And as soon as the flame burned out,

876
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:13,500
they weren't going to try again.

877
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,900
Our hearts really weren't
in trying to destroy

878
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,199
civilian food, civilian homes.

879
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,432
It gave us an uneasy feeling about,

880
00:52:22,532 --> 00:52:24,266
"What is this war is about?"

881
00:52:27,065 --> 00:52:28,632
(gunfire)

882
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:30,733
NARRATOR: Most of the fighting in Vietnam

883
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:33,400
was the kind Mike Heaney was about to see...

884
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:39,266
small-scale, close-up, and
initiated by the elusive enemy.

885
00:52:40,733 --> 00:52:43,465
The military called it "contact."

886
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,632
"War is hell," grunts liked to
say, "but contact is a mother."

887
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:59,965
HEANEY: The job of an infantry platoon
usually is to try to scare up

888
00:53:00,065 --> 00:53:03,132
enemy infantry and take it down.

889
00:53:03,233 --> 00:53:07,699
Really, the tactic was
we were acting as bait.

890
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,833
And at some level we knew that.

891
00:53:09,932 --> 00:53:12,699
You know, go walk in the
woods and draw fire.

892
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:16,132
NARRATOR: Six months into his tour,

893
00:53:16,233 --> 00:53:18,932
Heaney undertook what
he and his men thought

894
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:20,699
would be an easy assignment:

895
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,000
climb a slope not far
from their base at An Khe

896
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:28,733
and drive a small enemy
mortar unit off a ridge line.

897
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:33,532
HEANEY: As soon as we started out,
we started to get some bad vibes.

898
00:53:33,632 --> 00:53:38,932
We found some boot prints in the mud

899
00:53:39,032 --> 00:53:41,632
at the edge of this landing zone,

900
00:53:41,733 --> 00:53:44,733
and a nice trail, a well-used
trail going up the ridge.

901
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:48,965
I remember talking to one of
my squad leaders about this.

902
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:53,233
And we were both sitting there,
"Well, shit, this sucks."

903
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:57,333
And all of a sudden the very point man,

904
00:53:57,432 --> 00:53:59,766
the first guy in the column, Sergeant Mays,

905
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:03,333
without saying anything just
put his M16 up to his shoulder

906
00:54:03,432 --> 00:54:04,865
and fired off a round.

907
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:08,132
And he turned around and
he said, "VC on the trail.

908
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:09,965
VC on the trail."

909
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,900
Before I had a chance to
digest this, he went down,

910
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,900
shot right through the chest.

911
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
(bullet hitting) Boom!

912
00:54:19,365 --> 00:54:21,166
And all of a sudden

913
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:25,132
what was a very well-laid ambush erupted.

914
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:30,565
And it was so loud and so unexpected

915
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:35,000
I was stunned for... for
a little bit, you know.

916
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,766
"What the fuck is going on?"

917
00:54:36,865 --> 00:54:40,699
NARRATOR: Heaney's radio operator,
Private Terry Carpenter,

918
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,233
got the company commander on the line.

919
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:46,500
"We've run into something
bad," Heaney said.

920
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:51,500
At that moment, a bullet
hit Carpenter in the head.

921
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,099
HEANEY: I knew Terry was down.

922
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:55,099
I knew Sergeant Mays was down.

923
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:57,599
I had asked the first
machine gun crew to come up

924
00:54:57,699 --> 00:54:59,400
and start laying down machine gun fire.

925
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,932
They got blown away pretty quickly.

926
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,400
They never really had a
chance to lay down much fire.

927
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,233
At that point there wasn't anybody left

928
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:09,199
in my forward unit.

929
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,199
Every one of them had been
taken down except me.

930
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,065
Every one.

931
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:16,465
(voice breaking): Every one had been killed

932
00:55:16,565 --> 00:55:18,666
or mortally wounded at that point.

933
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,365
NARRATOR: Night fell.

934
00:55:24,465 --> 00:55:26,432
What was left of Heaney's company braced

935
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:30,233
for the assault they assumed
would come at dawn.

936
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,400
I was lying there on the perimeter.

937
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,666
I was right next to a dead enemy soldier.

938
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:38,500
It was kind of my face and his feet

939
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:40,199
and I kept looking back at him,

940
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,833
because I couldn't see any wounds on him.

941
00:55:42,932 --> 00:55:45,365
And, you know, the strange
things you think,

942
00:55:45,465 --> 00:55:47,132
"This guy's going to kill me.

943
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:48,532
"He's faking it.

944
00:55:48,632 --> 00:55:49,908
"He's waiting until the assault,

945
00:55:49,932 --> 00:55:51,932
then he's going to jump up and kill me."

946
00:55:52,032 --> 00:55:53,532
And I almost shot him again.

947
00:55:53,632 --> 00:55:55,300
Just to make sure he was dead.

948
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:59,099
NARRATOR: Then the enemy
began to lob mortar shells

949
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:01,465
among Heaney's men.

950
00:56:01,565 --> 00:56:03,666
HEANEY: I felt like
somebody had taken a bat

951
00:56:03,766 --> 00:56:07,900
and hit me on my calf, my right
calf, as hard as he could.

952
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I was so stunned by the shock of being hit,

953
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:18,233
and I just drew in a deep
breath of air in terrible pain.

954
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,632
I couldn't speak.

955
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:23,565
Right after the ambush happened,

956
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:25,532
and I knew I'd lost a bunch of guys,

957
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,833
I said a prayer to God saying, basically,

958
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:32,465
"If you need any more guys
from my platoon, take me.

959
00:56:32,565 --> 00:56:34,500
Don't take any more of my men."

960
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,932
As soon as I said it, I
freaked myself out and said,

961
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:41,733
"Holy shit, can I take that prayer back?"

962
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:42,865
But it was too late.

963
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:44,432
I'd-I'd said it.

964
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:45,865
And as it turns out,

965
00:56:45,965 --> 00:56:49,565
not one more man in my platoon
died after that prayer.

966
00:56:51,132 --> 00:56:55,400
NARRATOR: American artillery
finally zeroed in on the enemy.

967
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,333
The survivors of Heaney's
company stumbled down the hill

968
00:56:58,432 --> 00:57:00,132
to safety.

969
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:03,132
He was carried to a hospital.

970
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,865
HEANEY: I was lying on my bed sobbing.

971
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:16,300
And this nurse came over.

972
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,000
She bent over and said, "Lieutenant...

973
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:20,500
"You... the-the your men
are all over the place.

974
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:22,666
You've gotta stop crying."

975
00:57:22,766 --> 00:57:25,532
And at that point my platoon sergeant,

976
00:57:25,632 --> 00:57:29,000
huge black guy from Detroit
whom I loved dearly,

977
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:32,599
Sergeant Sam Hunt, he came over
and he sat down next to me

978
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,199
(voice breaking): and he took my hand

979
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,666
and he said to this nurse,

980
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:37,400
"Ma'am, this here lieutenant

981
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,500
don't have to stop doing anything."

982
00:57:43,865 --> 00:57:48,500
LE CONG HUAN:

983
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,233
(crowd shouting angrily)

984
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:33,013
JOHN LAURENCE: The students are angry now.

985
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:34,632
And the word is passed

986
00:58:34,733 --> 00:58:38,099
to gather at Saigon's main
Buddhist pagoda after dark.

987
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,532
JOHN QUINN: After all these years,

988
00:58:41,632 --> 00:58:45,000
the Vietnamese have learned
to live with crises and war.

989
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:48,365
But they haven't learned
yet to live as a nation.

990
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,065
JOHNSON: Now, Dean, what
are we going to do?

991
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:56,032
Are we moving to the point where
it would be difficult for us

992
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,932
to ask people to continue to die out there,

993
00:58:58,032 --> 00:59:00,965
this kind of stuff going on
every two or three months?

994
00:59:01,065 --> 00:59:02,905
DEAN RUSK: I think not
yet, sir, by any means.

995
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,233
I think that this is still
a minority problem.

996
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:09,233
But political talk is not going
to be able to get anywhere

997
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,199
if they don't maintain
the elements of order.

998
00:59:15,266 --> 00:59:18,099
NARRATOR: On May 15, 1966,

999
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:21,333
the government of South
Vietnam, the country for which

1000
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,932
so many Americans were risking their lives,

1001
00:59:24,032 --> 00:59:26,800
again seemed on the brink of collapse.

1002
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:32,865
The ascendancy of Prime Minister
Ky had dealt a severe blow

1003
00:59:32,965 --> 00:59:35,632
to activist Buddhists,
who had been demanding

1004
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:39,432
representative government and
a negotiated end to the war

1005
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:41,733
since 1963.

1006
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:45,833
When Ky suddenly fired a rival general,

1007
00:59:45,932 --> 00:59:47,666
a popular Buddhist commander,

1008
00:59:47,766 --> 00:59:53,032
demonstrators poured into the
streets of Hue and Danang.

1009
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:55,400
They shut down the port

1010
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,699
through which U.S.
supplies had been flowing.

1011
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,766
Some South Vietnamese soldiers,
loyal to the dismissed general,

1012
01:00:03,865 --> 01:00:06,400
abandoned the struggle
against the communists

1013
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,932
and headed for the city.

1014
01:00:09,032 --> 01:00:12,400
Angry crowds burned American jeeps.

1015
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,532
Signs reading "Peace!"
and "Americans Go Home!"

1016
01:00:16,632 --> 01:00:18,333
appeared everywhere.

1017
01:00:18,432 --> 01:00:21,599
President Johnson was so concerned,

1018
01:00:21,699 --> 01:00:25,266
he asked his advisors to
ready a fallback position

1019
01:00:25,365 --> 01:00:27,365
if the Ky government fell.

1020
01:00:27,465 --> 01:00:31,065
If necessary, he said, the U.S.
should be prepared

1021
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:33,632
to get out of Vietnam and perhaps

1022
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:38,032
make a stand against communism
in Thailand instead.

1023
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:42,300
Ky ordered South Vietnamese soldiers

1024
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,065
to surround and subdue Danang,

1025
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:48,932
where they exchanged fire
with their former comrades.

1026
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:57,865
As Ky's forces stormed
Buddhist pagodas in Danang,

1027
01:00:57,965 --> 01:01:01,032
his warplanes strafed dissident troops

1028
01:01:01,132 --> 01:01:02,865
occupying the central market.

1029
01:01:05,865 --> 01:01:07,599
The rebellion was crushed.

1030
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:10,599
Washington was relieved.

1031
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:14,465
Ky seemed to be back in control.

1032
01:01:14,565 --> 01:01:18,865
But from his command post on
a hilltop outside the city,

1033
01:01:18,965 --> 01:01:22,365
an American Marine lieutenant
had watched in disbelief

1034
01:01:22,465 --> 01:01:26,166
as two battles unfolded simultaneously:

1035
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:31,432
in the west, his fellow Marines
were fighting the Viet Cong;

1036
01:01:31,532 --> 01:01:35,233

JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: It
was a lovely spring day,

1055
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,965
and I opened the letter that said that.

1056
01:02:38,065 --> 01:02:40,932
And I was just really devastated

1057
01:02:41,032 --> 01:02:45,199
because by that time Vietnam
was in total chaos.

1058
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,733
There was a continuing changeover

1059
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:51,900
of people in authority at the
government in South Vietnam.

1060
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,532
And there were protests of the
Buddhist monks and others

1061
01:02:55,632 --> 01:02:56,833
that...

1062
01:02:56,932 --> 01:02:58,865
there were anti-American demonstrations.

1063
01:02:58,965 --> 01:03:01,666

CAROL CROCKER: I think that
letter when my brother

1065
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,000
showed a kind of despair

1066
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:11,365
is probably the first time
he'd expressed that openly

1067
01:03:11,465 --> 01:03:14,266
to the whole family.

1068
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:22,365
It echoed back to the day he'd said to me,

1069
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,000
"I don't want to go back."

1071
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,365

MOGIE CROCKER (dramatized): Dear Duff,

1073
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:36,500
Since I last wrote, which
is several months,

1074
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:38,699
a number of exciting but
terribly unpleasant events

1075
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,599
have occurred, the worst of
which was being pinned down

1076
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:44,132
by two Chinese light machine guns

1077
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:46,733
firing 900 rounds per minute

1078
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:49,532
and having my best friend
killed more or less beside me.

1079
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:53,266
Someday I may tell you the whole story

1080
01:03:53,365 --> 01:03:56,199
if my nerves aren't
completely gone by then.

1081
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,599
Actually the latter is
just wishful thinking,

1082
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:03,965
in false hope they will
take me off the line.

1083
01:04:04,065 --> 01:04:07,965
I was fantastically religious for a while,

1084
01:04:08,065 --> 01:04:11,233
sending up various and sundry
prayers mainly concerned

1085
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:14,300
with trying to stay alive,

1086
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,932

that we had to stop the
communist expansion.

1091
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:47,166
I also believed that we were
on the side of the angels.

1092
01:04:47,266 --> 01:04:49,733
Just as France had provided us with support

1093
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:52,865

providing the South Vietnamese

1094

and endured nine weeks of
the most demanding training

1102
01:05:13,865 --> 01:05:15,766

Chargin' Charlie...

1107
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,465
hero of the siege of
Plei Me the year before.

"If a man is bloody stupid," he
told each group of newcomers,

1109
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:37,400
"his mother will receive a
telegram and it will say,

1110
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,266
"'Your son is dead because he's stupid.'

1111
01:05:40,365 --> 01:05:45,666
"Let's hope your telegram only
reads, 'Your son is dead.'

1112
01:05:45,766 --> 01:05:48,800
"With the training we're
going to give you here,

1113
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,800
"maybe your mother won't
receive any telegram at all.

1114
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,800
So pay attention."

1115
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,333
To make it through,

1116
01:05:57,432 --> 01:05:59,532
Harrison and his fellow
trainees had to survive

1117
01:05:59,632 --> 01:06:04,000
days without sleep; were
deprived of food and water,

1118
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:08,065
forced to march up mountains
until their feet bled

1119
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:11,699
and patrol through swamps
that harbored copperheads

1120
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,032
and cottonmouths;

1121
01:06:13,132 --> 01:06:16,166
had to learn how to detect booby traps

1122
01:06:16,266 --> 01:06:21,400
and outmaneuver veterans
masquerading as Viet Cong.

1123
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:25,800
"Expect the unexpected,"
Beckwith told his trainees

1124
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,532
again and again.

1125
01:06:27,632 --> 01:06:30,932
"Life is unfair."

1126
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,300
Once he'd become a Ranger,
Harrison was eager

1127
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,199
to get to Vietnam and put into action

1128
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,733
the survival and leadership
skills he'd been absorbing

1129
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:44,099
for five years.

1130
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:47,132
HARRISON: I remember
discussing with my classmates

1131
01:06:47,233 --> 01:06:49,632
how horrible it would
be to serve in the Army

1132
01:06:49,733 --> 01:06:54,099
if everybody just a year ahead
of us had served in combat

1133
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:56,465
and we didn't have the
opportunity to do that.

1134
01:06:56,565 --> 01:06:59,733
I was afraid we were going
to win the war too quickly

1135
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:02,532
and I wouldn't have a
chance to experience it.

Mogie Crocker's 19th birthday.

1138
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,532
His company was involved
in yet another campaign,

1139
01:07:35,632 --> 01:07:39,300
aimed at finding and killing
North Vietnamese troops

1140
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,932
filtering into the Central
Highlands from Laos.

1141
01:07:44,032 --> 01:07:47,932
As night fell, Mogie and
his squad were ordered

1142
01:07:48,032 --> 01:07:50,199
to move up toward the crest of a hill

1143
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,632
overlooking a besieged ARVN outpost

1144
01:07:53,733 --> 01:07:55,800
so that artillery could be brought up

1145
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:59,266
and positioned to shell
the enemy in the morning.

1146
01:08:02,233 --> 01:08:06,065
They moved slowly, warily up the slope.

1147
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,233
Mogie was the point man.

1148
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:13,932
Out of the darkness, a
machine gun opened up.

lovely day to be out in our garden.

1155
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:46,500
Candy, our little girl,
went to a birthday party.

1156
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,832
And the other children were
just around the house, I guess.

1157
01:08:49,932 --> 01:08:54,899
But shortly after lunchtime,
I stepped out on the porch.

1158
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:02,432
I saw two men in uniform
coming to the house.

1159
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,699
And I knew something terrible had happened.

1160
01:09:10,065 --> 01:09:11,666
And I ran down the steps.

1161
01:09:11,765 --> 01:09:14,332
And I just grabbed hold
of one of them and said,

CAROL CROCKER: I was sitting on
the couch in the living room.

1168
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:32,065
I suddenly heard my mother
screaming for my father.

1169
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:36,100
Like in a movie, here came
the priest up the stairs

1170
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:38,600
with a soldier, and she's going, "Oh no."

1171
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:42,399
And she's calling my dad.

1172
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,265
My reaction was to leap up off the couch,

1173
01:09:45,365 --> 01:09:46,832
race out the back door

1174
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,865
and I grabbed my little brother's hand

1175
01:09:48,966 --> 01:09:50,332
and I just started walking.

1176
01:09:50,432 --> 01:09:52,832
I said, "You have to come with me."

1177
01:09:52,932 --> 01:09:54,600
I said, "I have something to show you."

1178
01:09:54,699 --> 01:09:56,699
I have no idea where I was going.

1179
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,533
I just said to myself, "No.

1180
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,000
This isn't going to happen."

1181
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,765
And something made me turn around

1182
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:10,865
and I walked up to the back
of the house from the alley.

1183
01:10:10,966 --> 01:10:13,832
And my dad was standing there.

1184
01:10:13,932 --> 01:10:17,466
And I fell into his arms and I said,

1185
01:10:17,565 --> 01:10:19,399
"Don't let it be true, Dad.

1186
01:10:21,765 --> 01:10:23,832
Is it true?"

1187
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:25,500
And he said, "Yes."

1188
01:10:28,533 --> 01:10:31,733
I somehow knew that things
had changed forever.

1189
01:10:33,432 --> 01:10:36,466
That my mom as my mom and my dad as my dad,

1190
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,600
it was never going to be
quite the same again.

1191
01:10:39,699 --> 01:10:41,600
I just, I remember sitting on the couch

1192
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:43,699
and I put my arms around them and I said,

1193
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,000

JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: Carol
said to me one day

1200
01:11:02,899 --> 01:11:05,265
very shortly after Denton was killed,

1201
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:10,065
probably that very day, "How
can you believe in God?"

1202

01:11:21,265 --> 01:11:24,365
It was a privilege to have him.

1205
01:11:24,466 --> 01:11:25,632
A friend wrote to me,

1206
01:11:25,733 --> 01:11:29,399
"Our children are really
only on loan to us,"

1207
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,399
which I guess is true.

1208
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:37,666
NARRATOR: Ten days later, an Army
captain escorted Mogie's body

1209
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:40,033
to Dick Stone's funeral home.

1210
01:11:40,132 --> 01:11:43,033
The family priest had suggested

1211
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,533
that Mogie be buried in Saratoga Springs

1212
01:11:45,632 --> 01:11:49,565
so that his parents could
easily visit his grave.

1213
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:54,399
But they chose Arlington
National Cemetery instead.

1214
01:11:55,765 --> 01:12:00,000
"A corner of my heart knew,"
his mother remembered,

1215
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,733
"that if he were buried near us,

1216
01:12:01,832 --> 01:12:06,533
I would want to claw the ground
to retrieve the warmth of him."

1217
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:14,000
(applause)

1218
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,632
LYNDON JOHNSON: I hear my friends say,

1219
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:18,065
"I am troubled," and "I am confused,"

1220
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,565
and "I am frustrated,"

1221
01:12:19,666 --> 01:12:22,233
and all of us can understand those people.

1222
01:12:22,332 --> 01:12:25,300
Sometimes I almost develop
a stomach ulcer myself,

1223
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:27,466
just listening to them.

1224
01:12:27,565 --> 01:12:30,233
And we all wish the war would end.

1225
01:12:30,332 --> 01:12:32,466
We all wish the troops would come home.

1226
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:35,765
There is no human being in all this world

1227
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:39,533
who wishes these things to happen,

1228
01:12:39,632 --> 01:12:41,600
for peace to come to the world,

1229
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:44,300
more than your president
of the United States.

1230
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:47,800
("The Beginning of the End"
by Nine Inch Nails playing)

1231
01:12:54,765 --> 01:12:56,666
NARRATOR: The military
claimed to have killed

1232
01:12:56,765 --> 01:13:03,399
some 57,000 enemy soldiers in
the first six months of 1966.

1233
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,432
But privately the administration worried

1234
01:13:06,533 --> 01:13:09,432
that General Westmoreland's
"crossover point"...

1235
01:13:09,533 --> 01:13:12,765
the moment when more enemy
soldiers had been killed

1236
01:13:12,865 --> 01:13:16,800
than could be replaced... seemed no nearer.

1237
01:13:16,899 --> 01:13:20,600
From the first, the Joint
Chiefs had urged the president

1238
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:21,966
to be more aggressive...

1239
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:27,699
to permit troops to pursue the
enemy into Laos and Cambodia

1240
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,600
and to expand the target list
for bombing in North Vietnam.

1241
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:36,800
Johnson still would not
allow borders to be crossed

1242
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:40,265
by regular ground troops
for fear of bringing China

1243
01:13:40,365 --> 01:13:43,865
or even the Soviet Union into the war.

1244
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:46,632
And he was wary of heavier bombing,

1245
01:13:46,733 --> 01:13:49,666
fearful of hitting more civilians.

1246
01:13:49,765 --> 01:13:52,500
But despite his concern,

1247
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,265
the president now agreed to
intensify the bombing campaign

1248
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:58,932
called Operation Rolling Thunder.

1249
01:13:59,033 --> 01:14:02,100
He approved attacks on oil facilities

1250
01:14:02,199 --> 01:14:04,432
all over North Vietnam,

1251
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:07,432
including some sites adjacent to the cities

1252
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:11,100
of Haiphong and Hanoi.

1253
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,132
His commanders assured him

1254
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:15,899
that this would be a
mortal blow to the enemy,

1255
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,733
sure to force the North Vietnamese

1256
01:14:18,832 --> 01:14:20,399
to the bargaining table.

1257
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:31,632
Tens of thousands of sorties were flown.

1258
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:37,932
Many bombs hit their intended targets.

1259
01:14:38,033 --> 01:14:40,100
But many missed

1260
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:43,899
and fell on residential
neighborhoods instead,

1261
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,899
just as the president had feared.

1262
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:54,565
JOHNSON: Things are going reasonably
well in the South, aren't they?

1263
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:56,832
McNAMARA: Yes, I think so.

1264
01:14:56,932 --> 01:14:59,365
Because we think we're
taking a heavy toll of them,

1265
01:14:59,466 --> 01:15:02,132
but it just scares me to
see what we're doing there

1266
01:15:02,233 --> 01:15:05,332
with God knows how many
airplanes and helicopters

1267
01:15:05,432 --> 01:15:10,199
and firepower and going after a
bunch of half-starved beggars.

1268
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,466
This is what's going on in the South.

1269
01:15:12,565 --> 01:15:15,065
And the great danger is that,

1270
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:19,765
that they can keep that
up almost indefinitely.

1271
01:15:19,865 --> 01:15:21,808
The only thing that'll prevent it, Mr.
President,

1272
01:15:21,832 --> 01:15:23,565
is their morale breaking.

1273
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:26,065
There's no question but what
the troops in the South,

1274
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:27,699
the VC and North Vietnamese,

1275
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,600
they know that we're bombing in the North.

1276
01:15:30,699 --> 01:15:32,199
And we just have a free rein.

1277
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,875
And when they see they're getting killed

1278
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:35,533
in such high rates in the South,

1279
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:38,966
and they see that the supplies
are less likely to come down

1280
01:15:39,065 --> 01:15:40,741
from the North, I think it
will just hurt their morale

1281
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:41,832
a little bit more.

1282
01:15:41,932 --> 01:15:43,276
And to me that's the only way to win

1283
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,166
because we're not killing enough of them

1284
01:15:45,265 --> 01:15:48,399
to make it impossible for the
North to continue to fight.

1285
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,265
But we are killing enough
to destroy the morale

1286
01:15:51,365 --> 01:15:52,765
of those people down there

1287
01:15:52,865 --> 01:15:54,985
if they think this is going
to have to go on forever.

1288
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:57,832
JOHNSON: All right.

1289
01:15:57,932 --> 01:15:59,765
Go ahead, Bob.

1290
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,166
BAO NINH:

1291
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:27,765
HO HUU LAN:

1292
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:48,865
McPEAK: People talk about collateral
damage, but it means something.

1293
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,065
You don't want to do collateral damage.

1294
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:56,265
You want to do the damage you want to do.

1295
01:16:56,365 --> 01:16:58,233
That's the winning way to do this.

1296
01:17:06,233 --> 01:17:09,399
(distant, echoing shouting)

1297
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:14,233
EVERETT ALVAREZ: Even though
I was in a cell by myself

1298
01:17:14,332 --> 01:17:17,100
and others were in by
themselves, we weren't alone.

1299
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,666
We were together in this old French prison

1300
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:22,565
halfway around the world
from the United States.

1301
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:27,166
Gradually I began to realize
this could go on a long time.

1302
01:17:27,265 --> 01:17:30,600
A long time to me was
like maybe a year or two.

1303
01:17:30,699 --> 01:17:34,966
I never dreamed it would
be eight-and-a-half years.

1304
01:17:35,065 --> 01:17:39,666
NARRATOR: By the summer of 1966,
Lieutenant Everett Alvarez,

1305
01:17:39,765 --> 01:17:42,699
the first American pilot
to have been shot down

1306
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,132
over North Vietnam, had been a
captive for nearly two years

1307
01:17:47,233 --> 01:17:50,100
and had been joined in and around Hanoi

1308
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:53,300
by more than 100 other downed airmen.

1309
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:57,265
Even though the North
Vietnamese considered them all

1310
01:17:57,365 --> 01:18:00,632
"aggressors," "criminals,"
and "air pirates"

1311
01:18:00,733 --> 01:18:04,132
rather than prisoners of war
deserving of humane treatment,

1312
01:18:04,233 --> 01:18:07,932
Alvarez and the others had
been treated relatively well

1313
01:18:08,033 --> 01:18:09,265
at first.

1314
01:18:09,365 --> 01:18:12,365
But that hadn't lasted long.

1315
01:18:12,466 --> 01:18:16,265
The men were soon forbidden to
communicate with one another,

1316
01:18:16,365 --> 01:18:18,733
forced to bow to their jailers,

1317
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:22,166
and told that their country
had forgotten them.

1318
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:25,733
They were subjected to isolation, beatings,

1319
01:18:25,832 --> 01:18:28,365
and hour upon hour of torture,

1320
01:18:28,466 --> 01:18:32,065
all aimed at forcing them
to admit their guilt

1321
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:36,565
and record statements denouncing the war.

1322
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:38,100
(door slams)

1323
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:40,932
ALVAREZ: When that cell door
would open, when they would say,

1324
01:18:41,033 --> 01:18:46,466
"You, your turn," you know, the
bottom just fell out of you,

1325
01:18:46,565 --> 01:18:49,632
and you knew that you may not come back.

1326
01:18:49,733 --> 01:18:54,899
The manacles, the ropes, the
beatings, they broke bones.

1327
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,832
They... they did everything.

1328
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:00,065
My arms turned black

1329
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:03,332
from the cuffs that cut
off all circulation.

1330
01:19:03,432 --> 01:19:05,199
And they didn't let me die.

1331
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,399
They just kept the pain.

1332
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:10,565
That's when I realized that
I was not a superhuman.

1333
01:19:14,265 --> 01:19:19,600
The first time I broke and gave
them something, I felt so low.

1334
01:19:19,699 --> 01:19:23,000
I felt so little.

1335
01:19:25,166 --> 01:19:27,800
NARRATOR: Some of the men who
were forced to record statements

1336
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:32,332
did their best to make their
true feelings known back home.

1337
01:19:32,432 --> 01:19:36,365
Commander Jeremiah Denton
blinked his eyes to spell out

1338
01:19:36,466 --> 01:19:38,865
"torture" in Morse code.

1339
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:49,932
On July 6, just one week
after American bombs

1340
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:52,865
had first fallen on Hanoi and Haiphong,

1341
01:19:52,966 --> 01:19:57,332
jailers rounded up Alvarez
and 51 other prisoners,

1342
01:19:57,432 --> 01:19:59,899
and, while cameras rolled,

1343
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,500
marched them through downtown Hanoi,

1344
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,932
past the angry citizens of the city.

1345
01:20:06,033 --> 01:20:08,399
ALVAREZ: I could hear the
crowd being whipped up.

1346
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:12,432
And as I passed this one
fellow with the megaphone,

1347
01:20:12,533 --> 01:20:14,600
he looked at me and he yelled to the crowd.

1348
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:17,765
"Alvarez, Alvarez, son of
a bitch, son of a bitch!"

1349
01:20:17,865 --> 01:20:21,399
People started pressing
in, throwing things...

1350
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
bottles, shoes.

1351
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,765
But the guards by this time
were having a hard time

1352
01:20:25,865 --> 01:20:28,265
keeping the people away.

1353
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:31,199
NARRATOR: The North
Vietnamese had hoped to rally

1354
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:35,699
international support for trying
the prisoners as war criminals.

1355
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,699
It backfired.

1356
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,033
People everywhere, even many
of those who opposed the war,

1357
01:20:42,132 --> 01:20:46,166
sympathized with the
stumbling, helpless men.

1358
01:20:47,533 --> 01:20:50,500
Plans for public trials were canceled.

1359
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:57,300
The bombing continued, and more
American planes were shot down.

1360
01:21:00,132 --> 01:21:04,666
The North Vietnamese took pride
in capturing American airmen.

1361
01:21:04,765 --> 01:21:08,699
Even children were
expected to do their part.

1362
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,442
(call and response with
teacher and children)

1363
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:12,365
TEACHER: Hands up! Hand up!

1364
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:15,000
TEACHER:

1365
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,166
Hands up!

1366
01:21:16,265 --> 01:21:17,065
Hands up!

1367
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:18,000
TEACHER:

1368
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,100
Hands up!

1369
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:22,632
McPEAK: The bombing
around Hanoi and Haiphong

1370
01:21:22,733 --> 01:21:25,132
that resulted in so many
of our people being POWs

1371
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:26,365
for a long period of time

1372
01:21:26,466 --> 01:21:28,300
was fought out of the White House basement,

1373
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:31,300
with the president himself picking targets,

1374
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:33,199
and deciding that we're
going to attack now,

1375
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,332
and then we're going to pause for awhile.

1376
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:41,132
Airpower was being misused, big time.

1377
01:21:44,565 --> 01:21:47,100
NARRATOR: Operation Rolling
Thunder did destroy

1378
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:51,632
most of North Vietnam's
oil storage facilities.

1379
01:21:51,733 --> 01:21:54,632
But the North Vietnamese shifted

1380
01:21:54,733 --> 01:21:57,466
most of their oil to underground tanks,

1381
01:21:57,565 --> 01:22:03,399
and more arrived every day from
China and the Soviet Union.

1382
01:22:06,565 --> 01:22:09,632
The bombing was stepped up anyway.

1383
01:22:11,632 --> 01:22:12,699
Throughout the North,

1384
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,533
enough crude air shelters were fashioned

1385
01:22:15,632 --> 01:22:19,666
from concrete pipe buried
five feet beneath the ground

1386
01:22:19,765 --> 01:22:22,733
to accommodate some 18 million people...

1387
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:26,100
virtually the entire population.

1388
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:30,065
(workers singing in Vietnamese)

1389
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:34,100
Over a million people were said
to be working around the clock

1390
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,865
to undo what American bombs had done.

1391
01:22:36,966 --> 01:22:39,600
When key bridges were destroyed,

1392
01:22:39,699 --> 01:22:42,100
they fashioned pontoon bridges overnight

1393
01:22:42,199 --> 01:22:43,966
to keep traffic moving.

1394
01:22:44,065 --> 01:22:48,832
Crews waited along the roads
with heaps of gravel and stone

1395
01:22:48,932 --> 01:22:52,932
and stacks of wood to fill bomb craters.

1396
01:22:53,033 --> 01:22:59,100
They worked under the slogan
"The enemy destroys, we repair.

1397
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:03,832
The enemy destroys, we repair again."

1398
01:23:03,932 --> 01:23:08,699
(workers continue singing)

1399
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:12,565
WILLBANKS: Rolling Thunder
was the dumbest campaign

1400
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:15,000
ever devised by a human being.

1401
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,265
The normal human thing to do

1402
01:23:17,365 --> 01:23:19,899
is to think that your
enemy thinks like you.

1403
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,899
There's the old story, apocryphal,

1404
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,765
that when McNamara wants to know

1405
01:23:24,865 --> 01:23:27,865
what Ho Chi Minh is thinking,
he interviews himself.

1406
01:23:27,966 --> 01:23:30,733
What the problem then becomes is

1407
01:23:30,832 --> 01:23:34,466
that you keep trying to send
messages that are rational

1408
01:23:34,565 --> 01:23:36,899
based upon your judgment of rationality,

1409
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,265
but have nothing to do with
the definition of rationality

1410
01:23:40,365 --> 01:23:41,800
on the other side.

1411
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,132
So what's irrational to us

1412
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,033
is totally rational to the other side

1413
01:23:47,132 --> 01:23:51,832
if you've decided that you are
going to reunify the Vietnams

1414
01:23:51,932 --> 01:23:56,300
no matter what it takes, no
matter how many casualties.

1415
01:23:59,966 --> 01:24:02,832
NARRATOR: Hanoi did all it
could to publicize the damage

1416
01:24:02,932 --> 01:24:06,199
American bombs were doing to civilians.

1417
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:11,466
Most Americans dismissed the
reports as communist propaganda.

1418
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,832
But when Harrison Salisbury
of theNew York Times

1419
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:22,600
traveled to North Vietnam and
reported on Christmas Day, 1966,

1420
01:24:22,699 --> 01:24:23,966
what he had seen,

1421
01:24:24,065 --> 01:24:28,265
public doubts about the
morality of the war grew.

1422
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:32,265
GELB: A lot of the military we talked to

1423
01:24:32,365 --> 01:24:36,666
shared our concerns about how
the war was being fought,

1424
01:24:36,765 --> 01:24:39,100
and whether or not it could be won.

1425
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,199
But when it came to an official position,

1426
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:45,166
it was what we know well,

1427
01:24:45,265 --> 01:24:48,199
namely, "We can win this war
and we're doing it right.

1428
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:52,865
We just need more... more
troops, more bombing."

1429
01:24:59,065 --> 01:25:03,600
WILSON: I recall on one instance
after I had returned from Vietnam,

1430
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:07,365
I went by to see McNamara.

1431
01:25:09,332 --> 01:25:13,765
He was saying, "Well, how is
our strategic bombing program

1432
01:25:13,865 --> 01:25:16,332
affecting the course of the war?"

1433
01:25:17,533 --> 01:25:22,132
I said, "It is not gaining us anything.

1434
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:25,932
Indeed, it is counterproductive."

1435
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,800
He said, "What do you mean?"

1436
01:25:31,466 --> 01:25:37,699
"Mr. Secretary, the sledgehammer
approach is not working.

1437
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,800
"These people know that at some point

1438
01:25:40,899 --> 01:25:43,466
"we're going to get tired of killing them.

1439
01:25:43,565 --> 01:25:45,932
And they think they can outlast us."

1440
01:25:46,033 --> 01:25:50,632
And he said, "Why don't
people tell me these things?"

1441
01:25:53,233 --> 01:25:56,666
I said, "Mr. Secretary, you don't ask."

01:26:33,699 --> 01:26:35,832
was a student at St. Paul's School

1453

where a teach-in about
the war was to be held.

1455
01:26:41,966 --> 01:26:45,365
I remember calling my father
from a phone booth and saying,

Three days after he got to Hoi An,

1528

a group of civilian detainees
was brought into the compound.

1542
01:31:10,432 --> 01:31:13,899
"And these people know
where those mines are.

1543
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,632
"You treat these people nice
in front of the trackers

1544
01:31:17,733 --> 01:31:18,932
"and those trackers

1545
01:31:19,033 --> 01:31:20,673
"will rearrange your head and ass for you

1546
01:31:20,765 --> 01:31:22,265
and walk away laughing."

1547
01:31:23,865 --> 01:31:27,033
Well, at that point,
three days into Vietnam,

1548
01:31:27,132 --> 01:31:28,932
I'm thinking, "Whoa.

1549
01:31:29,033 --> 01:31:32,332
What the hell is going on here?"

1550
01:31:35,632 --> 01:31:38,100
I think it is destroying the good name

1551
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:40,765
and the leadership of the United States.

1552
01:31:40,865 --> 01:31:45,800
Furthermore, I believe that the
war is militarily unwinnable.

1553
01:31:45,899 --> 01:31:50,332
I believe that thousands
of American young men

1554
01:31:50,432 --> 01:31:54,600
are being asked to die to
save Lyndon Johnson's face.

1555
01:31:54,699 --> 01:31:58,166
He must know by now that
this war is unwinnable,

1556
01:31:58,265 --> 01:32:00,632
but he does not know how to give up.

1557
01:32:00,733 --> 01:32:04,432
Therefore, I believe that young
men are not only justified

1558
01:32:04,533 --> 01:32:07,565
but to be thanked if they point this out

1559
01:32:07,666 --> 01:32:11,533
by refusing to take part in such
an outrageous war any longer.

("Footprints" by Wayne Shorter playing)

1561
01:32:15,533 --> 01:32:18,800
NARRATOR: Dr. Benjamin Spock was
the best-loved pediatrician

1562
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:20,233
of his time;

1563
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:24,265
millions of American parents
had consulted his bestseller,

1564
01:32:24,365 --> 01:32:26,699
Baby and Child Care.

1565
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,300
In early 1967, he wrote
the preface to an article

1566
01:32:31,399 --> 01:32:34,100
in the leftist magazine Ramparts

1567
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:39,765
on the impact of American napalm
on South Vietnamese children.

1568
01:32:39,865 --> 01:32:44,666
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was
among those who had read it.

1569
01:32:44,765 --> 01:32:47,899
He had been agonizing
about the war for months.

1570
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,832
But he had been reluctant to break openly

1571
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:54,932
with Lyndon Johnson, who had
done so much for civil rights.

1572
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:59,199
Now he could no longer stay silent.

1575
01:33:09,666 --> 01:33:15,666
A time comes when silence is betrayal.

1576
01:33:15,765 --> 01:33:22,565
That time has come for us
in relation to Vietnam.

("Talking World War III

NARRATOR: Eleven days later,

01:33:34,132 --> 01:33:36,233
organized by a new coalition,

01:33:49,565 --> 01:33:51,000
in our lives.

1587
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:55,233
And when the front of the march
got down to the United Nations,

1588
01:33:55,332 --> 01:33:58,265
the back of the march had
not yet left Central Park.

1589
01:33:58,365 --> 01:34:01,600
That's how many people we were.

1590
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:10,500
Not all of the people on
that march were students.

1591
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:15,432
And as a result, we all
felt we have a chance now.

1592
01:34:15,533 --> 01:34:20,132

we could see to ending the war.

to the peace table.

1599
01:34:44,733 --> 01:34:46,233
Stop the bombing.

1600
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:49,865
NARRATOR: The antiwar movement was growing

1601
01:34:49,966 --> 01:34:53,100
in numbers and militancy.

1602
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:57,065
"We are no longer interested
in merely protesting the war,"

1603
01:34:57,166 --> 01:35:00,632
one organizer said, "we
are out to stop it."

1604
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:07,432
Meanwhile, some in the Johnson
administration became convinced

1605
01:35:07,533 --> 01:35:10,765
the antiwar movement was
a communist conspiracy

1606
01:35:10,865 --> 01:35:12,733
directed by Moscow.

1607
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:17,565
The FBI and the CIA, which
was barred by statute

1608
01:35:17,666 --> 01:35:20,065
from operating within the United States,

1609
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:24,466
began infiltrating the movement,
wiretapping its leaders,

1610
01:35:24,565 --> 01:35:29,632
even inciting violence in order
to undercut their appeal.

1611
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:36,666
ZIMMERMAN: At that time,
people who supported the war

1612
01:35:36,765 --> 01:35:40,166
were fond of saying "My
country right or wrong";

1613
01:35:40,265 --> 01:35:43,233
"America, love it or leave it."

1614
01:35:43,332 --> 01:35:46,765
Or "Better dead than Red."

1615
01:35:46,865 --> 01:35:51,033
Those sentiments seemed insane to us.

1616
01:35:51,132 --> 01:35:53,300
We don't want to live in a country

1617
01:35:53,399 --> 01:35:55,666
that we're going to support
whether it's right or wrong.

1618
01:35:55,765 --> 01:35:57,132
We want to live in a country

1619
01:35:57,233 --> 01:36:00,466
that acts rightly and doesn't act wrongly.

1620
01:36:00,565 --> 01:36:04,899
And if our country isn't doing
that, it needs to be corrected.

1621
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,199
So we had a very different
idea of patriotism.

1622
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:14,899
So we began an era in which
two groups of Americans,

1623
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,966
both thinking that they
were acting patriotically,

1624
01:36:18,065 --> 01:36:20,265
went to war with each other.

1625
01:36:20,365 --> 01:36:24,100
Over 200,000 communist sympathizers

1626
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:27,199
in that park this morning
tried to burn this flag,

1627
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:28,932
but they didn't succeed.

1628
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,633
RICHARD NIXON: I would put it this way...

1629
01:36:30,699 --> 01:36:33,065
there's a monstrous myth abroad,

1630
01:36:33,166 --> 01:36:36,632
a myth which Hanoi creates
and which it believes,

1631
01:36:36,733 --> 01:36:39,865
and that is that the United
States is so divided

1632
01:36:39,966 --> 01:36:44,600
that if they just hang on that
they will win in Washington,

1633
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:46,942
and in the United States the
victory that our fighting men

1634
01:36:46,966 --> 01:36:48,666
are denying them in field.

1635
01:36:48,765 --> 01:36:51,600
WESTMORELAND: As I have said before,

1636
01:36:51,699 --> 01:36:55,533
in evaluating the enemy
strategy it is evident to me

1637
01:36:55,632 --> 01:36:59,265
that he believes our Achilles'
heel is our resolve.

1638
01:37:00,666 --> 01:37:02,899
NARRATOR: Two weeks after
the Manhattan protest,

1639
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,166
General Westmoreland addressed
a joint session of Congress,

1640
01:37:07,265 --> 01:37:10,565
the first general ever to be
called home from a battlefield

1641
01:37:10,666 --> 01:37:13,166
by his president to do so.

1642
01:37:13,265 --> 01:37:18,932
Backed at home by resolve,
confidence, patience,

1643
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:22,100
determination, and continued support,

1644
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:26,265
we will prevail in Vietnam
over the communist aggressor.

1645
01:37:26,365 --> 01:37:27,832
(applause)

1646
01:37:27,932 --> 01:37:30,100
NARRATOR: Behind the scenes,

1647
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:33,600
neither Westmoreland nor the
administration he served

1648
01:37:33,699 --> 01:37:36,832
was confident the United
States would prevail.

1649
01:37:38,365 --> 01:37:40,632
Westmoreland reported to the president

1650
01:37:40,733 --> 01:37:43,265
that according to the latest statistics,

1651
01:37:43,365 --> 01:37:47,265
the crossover point had finally
been reached that spring,

1652
01:37:47,365 --> 01:37:51,765
except in the military sector
just south of the DMZ.

1653
01:37:51,865 --> 01:37:55,966
But, he warned, the United
States was doing little better

1654
01:37:56,065 --> 01:37:57,500
than holding its own.

1655
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,332
If he were given 200,000 additional troops

1656
01:38:01,432 --> 01:38:04,699
and allowed to go into Laos and Cambodia,

1657
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,865
he could cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail

1658
01:38:06,966 --> 01:38:09,666
and end the war in two years.

1659
01:38:09,765 --> 01:38:13,132
But "When we add divisions," Johnson asked,

1660
01:38:13,233 --> 01:38:15,800
"can't the enemy add divisions?

1661
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:18,100
Where does it all end?"

1662
01:38:18,199 --> 01:38:21,432
Westmoreland had no answer.

1663
01:38:21,533 --> 01:38:24,565
Instead, he and the Joint
Chiefs asked the president

1664
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:28,500
to permit them to bomb sites
just below the Chinese border,

1665
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,332
and to mine the harbors of North Vietnam

1666
01:38:31,432 --> 01:38:37,265
to keep Hanoi's Soviet ally
from resupplying her by sea.

1667
01:38:37,365 --> 01:38:42,733
Meanwhile, Robert McNamara,
the chief architect

1668
01:38:42,832 --> 01:38:45,899
of American strategy in Vietnam,

1669
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,132
had grown less and less confident

1670
01:38:48,233 --> 01:38:50,365
in its ultimate success

1671
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:54,432
and in the repeated calls for
more men and more bombing

1672
01:38:54,533 --> 01:38:57,565
made by the military he oversaw.

1673
01:38:57,666 --> 01:39:02,699
GELB: Robert McNamara was the
giant of Washington, D.C.

1674
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:08,000
He was the embodiment of
intellect and self-confidence.

1675
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:11,666
If there was a problem,
there had to be an answer.

1676
01:39:11,765 --> 01:39:14,800
And that was his fatal flaw.

1677
01:39:14,899 --> 01:39:17,565
The startling thing is

1678
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:23,765
that this man who never seemed
to doubt anything he said,

1679
01:39:23,865 --> 01:39:27,432
actually began to doubt
profoundly what he was doing

1680
01:39:27,533 --> 01:39:29,065
in Vietnam.

1681
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:30,765
But we didn't know about it.

1682
01:39:30,865 --> 01:39:34,265
NARRATOR: In a private
memorandum to the president,

1683
01:39:34,365 --> 01:39:36,932
McNamara told Johnson that

1684
01:39:37,033 --> 01:39:39,800
"the picture of the world's
greatest superpower

1685
01:39:39,899 --> 01:39:44,800
"killing or seriously injuring
1,000 non-combatants a week,

1686
01:39:44,899 --> 01:39:49,365
"while trying to pound a tiny,
backward nation into submission

1687
01:39:49,466 --> 01:39:52,466
"on an issue whose merits
are hotly disputed

1688
01:39:52,565 --> 01:39:54,565
is not a pretty one."

1689
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:59,365
He urged the president to limit
troop levels, not raise them,

1690
01:39:59,466 --> 01:40:03,565
and to declare an unconditional
end to all bombing

1691
01:40:03,666 --> 01:40:06,132
north of the 20th parallel.

1692
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:10,199
"The war in Vietnam is acquiring
a momentum of its own

1693
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:13,300
that must be stopped," McNamara wrote.

1694
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:16,800
"Dramatic increases in U.S.
troop deployments

1695
01:40:16,899 --> 01:40:19,765
"and attacks on the North are not necessary

1696
01:40:19,865 --> 01:40:21,533
"and are not the answer.

1697
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:25,399
"The enemy can absorb them or counter them,

1698
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,100
"bogging us down further

1699
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:32,432
and risking even more serious
escalation of the war."

1700
01:40:32,533 --> 01:40:37,233
In the end, Johnson tried
to find a middle ground.

1701
01:40:37,332 --> 01:40:39,832
He expanded the list of bombing targets,

1702
01:40:39,932 --> 01:40:42,765
but he refused to mine the harbors

1703
01:40:42,865 --> 01:40:45,100
and he agreed to send Westmoreland

1704
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:47,966
only 47,000 more troops,

1705
01:40:48,065 --> 01:40:51,265
which would bring the total of U.S.
forces in the country

1706
01:40:51,365 --> 01:40:53,632
to more than half a million men.

1707
01:40:55,966 --> 01:41:01,166
On June 17, 1967, Robert
McNamara placed a call

1708
01:41:01,265 --> 01:41:05,432
to his military assistant,
Lieutenant Colonel Robert Gard.

1709
01:41:05,533 --> 01:41:08,600
GARD: My phone rang and
the little light showed

1710
01:41:08,699 --> 01:41:11,300
it was the secretary on the line.

1711
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:14,565
And I picked it up and said, "Yes, Mr.
Secretary?"

1712
01:41:14,666 --> 01:41:16,533
And Mr. McNamara said,

1713
01:41:16,632 --> 01:41:19,265
"Bob, I want a thorough study
done of the background

1714
01:41:19,365 --> 01:41:21,865
of our involvement in Vietnam,"
and hung up the phone.

1715
01:41:21,966 --> 01:41:25,332
NARRATOR: Leslie Gelb, a 30-year-old member

1716
01:41:25,432 --> 01:41:28,632
of the International
Security Affairs staff,

1717
01:41:28,733 --> 01:41:31,765
was named to oversee the
top-secret analysis

1718
01:41:31,865 --> 01:41:36,100
of how key decisions had been
made, going all the way back

1719
01:41:36,199 --> 01:41:38,332
to the Truman administration.

1720
01:41:40,432 --> 01:41:45,365
GELB: McNamara gave us
full access to his closet,

1721
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:48,033
in his office, which was like a room.

1722
01:41:48,132 --> 01:41:50,565
But all his private papers were there.

1723
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:53,100
And I was picking out the memos,

1724
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,865
a lot of which I helped to write.

1725
01:41:55,966 --> 01:41:59,100
But there were others in
there that I had never seen.

1726
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:06,300
In these memos you began to see
Robert McNamara communicating

1727
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:11,466
with the president, alone, his doubts.

1728
01:42:11,565 --> 01:42:13,865
It stunned me.

1729
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:24,432
HARRISON: I had thought that we were
mostly fighting a guerrilla war.

1730
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:33,365
I didn't know that we were going
to be fighting guys like us,

1731
01:42:33,466 --> 01:42:35,300
that I had a doppelganger out there

1732
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:40,666
who was leading a rifle platoon,
who knew what he was doing,

1733
01:42:40,765 --> 01:42:46,199
who was as fully prepared to
kill me as I was to kill him.

1734
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:48,365
(band playing a march)

1735
01:42:48,466 --> 01:42:51,533
NARRATOR: That June, First
Lieutenant Matthew Harrison

1736
01:42:51,632 --> 01:42:56,332
finally got his orders to
join the 173rd Airborne,

1737
01:42:56,432 --> 01:43:00,632
an elite unit ready to rush
anywhere they were needed.

1738
01:43:00,733 --> 01:43:06,233
They called themselves General
Westmoreland's Fire Brigade.

1739
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:14,132
Harrison's arrival at Bien
Hoa was a reunion of sorts.

1740
01:43:14,233 --> 01:43:19,000
He and seven others from the
West Point class of 1966

1741
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:22,132
all found themselves serving
in the 2nd Battalion,

1742
01:43:22,233 --> 01:43:25,533
including two especially close friends:

1743
01:43:25,632 --> 01:43:29,632
Donald Judd and Richard Hood.

1744
01:43:29,733 --> 01:43:32,899
HARRISON: As young
lieutenants, as 22-year-olds,

1745
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,100
we really were idealists and
we really were Boy Scouts.

1746
01:43:38,199 --> 01:43:42,432
I really felt as though I
was uniquely qualified

1747
01:43:42,533 --> 01:43:44,166
to lead American soldiers

1748
01:43:44,265 --> 01:43:46,565
and that there was nothing more important

1749
01:43:46,666 --> 01:43:49,065
than what I was going to be doing.

1750
01:43:49,166 --> 01:43:52,699
But when I joined the 173rd,

1751
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,466
I think the first day I was
there some guy showed me

1752
01:43:56,565 --> 01:44:00,399
what looked like a bunch of
apricots on a leather thong.

1753
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:04,065
Turns out they were ears,
dried, desiccated.

1754
01:44:05,865 --> 01:44:09,565
I understood theoretically
what it meant to be in a war.

1755
01:44:09,666 --> 01:44:12,600
But, of course, no one
can really understand it

1756
01:44:12,699 --> 01:44:14,100
until they've done it.

1757
01:44:15,865 --> 01:44:18,932
("Wild Child" by the Ventures playing)

1758
01:44:19,033 --> 01:44:21,765
NARRATOR: Harrison was a platoon
leader in Charlie Company.

1759
01:44:21,865 --> 01:44:27,565
His West Point classmates
served with Alpha Company.

1760
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:29,932
Within a few days,

1761
01:44:30,033 --> 01:44:32,932
they were helicoptered into the
heart of the Central Highlands

1762
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:36,533
near Dak To, where North
Vietnamese regulars

1763
01:44:36,632 --> 01:44:41,666
were said to be threatening
a Special Forces camp.

1764
01:44:41,765 --> 01:44:44,565
They were all airlifted into landing zones

1765
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:47,932
hacked out of the steep,
jungle-blanketed slope

1766
01:44:48,033 --> 01:44:51,800
of a mountain the Americans
called Hill 1338

1767
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:57,233
for its height in meters, with
orders to hunt down the enemy.

1768
01:44:57,332 --> 01:44:59,699
They walked for two days,

1769
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,666
following a well-worn enemy trail,

1770
01:45:02,765 --> 01:45:07,399
constantly on the lookout for
booby traps or ambushes.

1771
01:45:11,865 --> 01:45:13,765
On the evening of June 21,

1772
01:45:13,865 --> 01:45:17,132
Harrison's Charlie Company
settled in for the night

1773
01:45:17,233 --> 01:45:20,632
while his friends in Alpha
Company set up camp

1774
01:45:20,733 --> 01:45:23,065
a little less than two miles to the south,

1775
01:45:23,166 --> 01:45:26,932
along the same slippery jungle path.

1776
01:45:27,033 --> 01:45:31,800
No one knew that an entire
North Vietnamese battalion...

1777
01:45:31,899 --> 01:45:34,300
perhaps 500 men...

1778
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:37,132
was encamped on the other
side of a ridgeline,

1779
01:45:37,233 --> 01:45:41,000
just a few hundred yards away.

1780
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
At 6:58 the next morning,

1781
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,832
a patrol from Alpha Company
stumbled into a squad

1782
01:45:48,932 --> 01:45:50,600
of North Vietnamese.

1783
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:53,600
The Americans withdrew

1784
01:45:53,699 --> 01:45:57,000
and struggled to establish a perimeter.

1785
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:59,632
Within minutes, they were under attack

1786
01:45:59,733 --> 01:46:04,265
from relentless AK-47 automatic fire.

1787
01:46:04,365 --> 01:46:07,632
The enemy mounted attack after attack,

1788
01:46:07,733 --> 01:46:10,632
drawing closer each time.

1789
01:46:10,733 --> 01:46:14,565
Alpha Company radioed for
air and artillery support,

1790
01:46:14,666 --> 01:46:18,666
but the triple-canopy jungle
blocked the spotter's view.

1791
01:47:10,166 --> 01:47:13,533
NARRATOR: At around noon, Harrison's
unit was ordered to rescue

1792
01:47:13,632 --> 01:47:16,565
the trapped men of Alpha Company.

1793
01:47:16,666 --> 01:47:20,332
HARRISON: It was mountainous terrain.

1794
01:47:20,432 --> 01:47:22,166
We were carrying two bodies

1795
01:47:22,265 --> 01:47:24,733
along with a bunch of engineer equipment.

1796
01:47:24,832 --> 01:47:30,065
And we could not push down
the couple of hundred meters

1797
01:47:30,166 --> 01:47:33,132
to where the most of the
fighting had taken place.

1798
01:47:33,233 --> 01:47:34,966
(explosion)

1799
01:47:35,065 --> 01:47:37,332
NARRATOR: The going was steep and slippery.

1800
01:47:37,432 --> 01:47:39,500
North Vietnamese troops,

1801
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,399
now entrenched along
both sides of the trail,

1802
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:47,132
prevented Matt Harrison and his
men from reaching Alpha Company.

1803
01:47:47,233 --> 01:47:50,800
At dusk, the shooting died down,

1804
01:47:50,899 --> 01:47:53,332
and they dug in at the top of a ridge

1805
01:47:53,432 --> 01:47:56,399
and did their best to sleep.

1806
01:47:58,199 --> 01:48:01,966
HARRISON: So we lay there
on the night of June 22

1807
01:48:02,065 --> 01:48:06,565
and we could hear the screams
of the wounded down the hill

1808
01:48:06,666 --> 01:48:11,265
as the North Vietnamese
went around and shot them.

1809
01:48:11,365 --> 01:48:14,533
NARRATOR: By dawn, the
enemy had melted away.

1810
01:48:18,233 --> 01:48:21,500
Harrison and his platoon
crept down the hillside

1811
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,233
and reached what was left of Alpha Company.

1812
01:48:26,632 --> 01:48:32,466
Out of 137 men, 76 lay dead along the path.

1813
01:48:32,565 --> 01:48:37,565
Forty-three had been shot
in the head at close range.

1814
01:48:37,666 --> 01:48:42,300
Ears had been cut from
some; eyes gouged out;

1815
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:44,332
ring fingers missing.

1816
01:48:44,432 --> 01:48:48,132
Twenty-three more men were wounded.

1817
01:48:48,233 --> 01:48:54,100
Harrison found his classmates,
Donald Judd and Richard Hood,

1818
01:48:54,199 --> 01:48:56,300
among the dead.

1819
01:48:57,932 --> 01:49:02,065
HARRISON: This was my introduction to war.

1820
01:49:02,166 --> 01:49:06,000
This was my welcome to Vietnam.

1821
01:49:08,233 --> 01:49:11,699
We spent the rest of the
day putting those bodies

1822
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:15,199
into body bags and getting
them out of there.

1823
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:18,065
Getting-getting killed is forever.

1824
01:49:18,166 --> 01:49:23,932
And, um, that was something
that I had known theoretically

1825
01:49:24,033 --> 01:49:26,233
but I now understood particularly

1826
01:49:26,332 --> 01:49:28,899
when I put my two classmates in body bags,

1827
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,632
guys that I had gone to
school with for four years

1828
01:49:31,733 --> 01:49:34,733
and were good friends and
who just the week before

1829
01:49:34,832 --> 01:49:37,765
we had been drinking beer
and ribbing each other

1830
01:49:37,865 --> 01:49:41,000
and these guys were now gone.

1831
01:49:42,033 --> 01:49:43,108
NARRATOR: Charlie Company found

1832
01:49:43,132 --> 01:49:46,733
just nine or ten North Vietnamese bodies.

1833
01:49:46,832 --> 01:49:49,533
Harrison and his men were ordered to search

1834
01:49:49,632 --> 01:49:53,466
the nearby hillsides for more enemy dead,

1835
01:49:53,565 --> 01:49:57,600
who commanders assumed had
been killed by U.S. artillery.

1836
01:49:57,699 --> 01:50:01,300
MACV needed its body count.

1837
01:50:03,899 --> 01:50:06,966
HARRISON: We never located
them and I believe today

1838
01:50:07,065 --> 01:50:10,065
that we didn't locate them
because they weren't there.

1839
01:50:10,166 --> 01:50:14,666
I think we just took a
terrible loss on June 22.

1840
01:50:14,765 --> 01:50:21,865
To admit that a rifle company
in the 173rd had been wiped out

1841
01:50:21,966 --> 01:50:24,132
by the North Vietnamese was not something

1842
01:50:24,233 --> 01:50:25,632
our leaders were prepared to do.

1843
01:50:25,733 --> 01:50:31,399
So we had to sell ourselves
and we had to sell the public

1844
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,899
on the idea that we had
inflicted casualties

1845
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,765
on the North Vietnamese as severe

1846
01:50:36,865 --> 01:50:39,132
as they had inflicted on us.

1847
01:50:39,233 --> 01:50:43,765
NARRATOR: An officer told a reporter
that the shattered rifle company

1848
01:50:43,865 --> 01:50:48,100
had killed 475 enemy soldiers.

1849
01:50:48,199 --> 01:50:52,265
When another officer suggested
to General Westmoreland

1850
01:50:52,365 --> 01:50:55,300
that the figure seemed too
high to be believable,

1851
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:57,765
he replied, "Too late.

1852
01:50:57,865 --> 01:51:00,265
It's already gone out."

1853
01:51:00,365 --> 01:51:03,233
HARRISON: Within a few
days after the battle,

1854
01:51:03,332 --> 01:51:05,565
Westmoreland came up to speak

1855
01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:09,399
to what we thought of
ourselves as his brigade.

1856
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:15,533
And he hopped up on a hood of
a jeep in very crisp fatigues

1857
01:51:15,632 --> 01:51:18,533
looking every inch the battle commander

1858
01:51:18,632 --> 01:51:22,966
and gave us a pep talk and
told us how proud he was

1859
01:51:23,065 --> 01:51:25,600
and what a magnificent job we had done.

1860
01:51:25,699 --> 01:51:30,666
But by then I had more
than just a suspicion

1861
01:51:30,765 --> 01:51:36,932
that this was a fairy tale,
that Westmoreland was wrong

1862
01:51:37,033 --> 01:51:39,966
and I didn't know whether
he knew he was wrong

1863
01:51:40,065 --> 01:51:43,800
or whether he believed
what he was being told

1864
01:51:43,899 --> 01:51:46,132
and wanted to believe.

1865
01:51:46,233 --> 01:51:50,632
But this was the first time
that I had to come to grips

1866
01:51:50,733 --> 01:51:52,500
with the fact that the leadership

1867
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:56,300
was either out of touch or was lying.

CAROL CROCKER: I remember a very
difficult conversation I had

1872
01:52:07,132 --> 01:52:10,466
with a girl who had really
been a best friend of mine.

1873
01:52:10,565 --> 01:52:13,966
And the talk turned to Vietnam.

1874
01:52:14,065 --> 01:52:16,966
And I remember her looking
at me and saying,

1875
01:52:17,065 --> 01:52:24,399
"My father says that you
can't listen to people

1876
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:27,132
"who've lost someone in the war

1877

1884
01:52:48,332 --> 01:52:52,065

to do with his death for me.
