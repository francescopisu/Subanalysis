HELICOPTER PILOT: This is 2-3 arriving.

37
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,700
We have them in sight and we're
engaging at present time.

38
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,933
MAN: Roger.

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,099
RON FERRIZZI: Helicopters
are phenomenal machines.

40
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:05,566
You could float in the air.

41
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:07,265
You can be like God.

42
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:17,265
I flew below 500 feet.

43
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:20,400
Above 500 feet was a kill zone.

44
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,165
You better be below 200
feet, the lower the better.

45
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,033
My job was to get shot at.

46
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,800
My job was to draw enemy fire.

47
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,500
I was a duck, a decoy.

48
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,265
I got shot at a lot.

49
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,432
I engaged the enemy a lot.

50
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,233
(voice on helicopter radio)

51
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:42,832
(gunfire)

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,033
You're screaming as loud as you
can to try to cover up the sound

53
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,199
of the incoming bullets

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,900
because when they pass by your ear

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,432
you could hear the popping sound.

56
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:56,332
You don't hear the gunshot.

57
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:58,432
That a 50-caliber just opened up on you,

58
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,099
shooting a half-inch piece
of lead flying at you...

59
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,399
And the aircraft was... vroom!

60
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,932
You're flying, you're 90
degrees the other way

61
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:09,000
and you're-you're shooting yourself down

62
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,009
because the rotor blades
are right in front of you

63
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,873
and you're trying to keep
the gun from jamming

64
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:15,332
because you're running around like this.

65
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:17,633
And if your gun jams, you're done.

66
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:28,900
NARRATOR: Vietnam was the
first real helicopter war.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,199
Helicopter pilots flew more
than 36 million sorties.

68
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,099
Their crews scattered propaganda
leaflets over the enemy

69
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:42,533
and poured lethal fire
into their positions;

70
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:47,033
carried troops and supplies
and artillery into battle;

71
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:51,466
and lifted the wounded off
the battlefield so swiftly

72
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:56,000
that most reached a field
hospital within 15 minutes.

73
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,932
Ron Ferrizzi, a policeman's son

74
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:08,233
from the Swampoodle neighborhood
of North Philadelphia,

75
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:12,033
got to Vietnam in November of 1967.

76
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:15,100
He was a crew chief in a scout helicopter

77
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,065
with the 1st Air Cavalry,

78
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:22,332
flying out of Landing Zone
Two-Bits in the Central Highlands.

79
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:25,266
One day, after returning
from a combat mission,

80
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,466
he was approached by a journalist.

81
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,199
FERRIZZI: And there was this...

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,266
there was a beautiful woman.

83
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:37,466
You know, round eye woman...
statuesque, round eye woman

84
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:42,132
with nice hair and she looked pretty.

85
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,466
Wow!

86
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:47,300
She said, "Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

87
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,865
"What was it like out there?

88
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:52,699
"How does it feel that a
50-caliber just opened up

89
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,533
shooting a half-inch piece of lead at you?"

90
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:59,533
When you... it's hard to describe.

91
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,733
It's shitty.

92
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,365
I mean, isn't it... isn't
it apparent what it's like?

93
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,165
You want to know what it's like?

94
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,466
Go look at it.

95
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:11,466
Go out there.

96
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:13,332
Go see the bodies.

97
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:15,132
I was ready to whack her.

98
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,766
I wanted to blast her.

99
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:17,899
I was ready to... whoa!

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,041
"You want to know what it's like?

101
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:19,966
"Boom! There it is.

102
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:21,305
"I'll give it to you right now!

103
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,875
"You want to feel it? You want to see it?

104
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:24,541
"I'll give it to you if
that's what you want.

105
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:26,266
Is that what you want?"

106
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:27,966
I don't want to tell you what it's like

107
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,533
because I don't want to remember it.

108
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:33,066
That's the insanity that it brings out.

109
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:49,066
(Big Brother and the Holding
Company playing "Summertime")

110

LYNDON JOHNSON: The enemy has been
defeated in battle after battle.

111
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,332
He continues to hope that
America's will to persevere

112
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:12,966
can be broken.

113
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:18,766

there were 485,600
American troops in Vietnam

00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,766
that would result in a
terrible defeat for them,

125
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,600
that in the long run would
turn out to have been

who had escalated American

that you'd never been more encouraged

in August of 1945.

179
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,299
With Saigon defeated, the
Americans would have no choice

180
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,299
but to withdraw from Vietnam.

181
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,500
The surprise attacks would
begin at the end of the month,

182
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,832
at the start of the Lunar New
Year celebration called Tet.

183
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,665
HO HUU LAN:

184
00:10:41,832 --> 00:10:44,765
NARRATOR: The Viet Cong
were already infiltrating

185
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:47,665
scores of cities and towns.

186
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:50,832
Tens of thousands of
North Vietnamese troops

187
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:54,265
were now in place in South Vietnam.

188
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:58,700
Tons of smuggled Chinese
and Soviet-made weapons

189
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,865
had been spirited towards
intended targets in sampans

190
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:05,899
and flower carts and false-bottomed trucks,

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,365
and then buried in paddy fields
and garbage dumps and cemeteries

192
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:14,399
until the moment came for
them to be retrieved.

193
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,000
LE VAN CHO:

194
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:47,466
NARRATOR: More than
10,000 American military

195
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:50,033
and civilian intelligence
officers were at work

196
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,365
in South Vietnam,

197
00:11:52,466 --> 00:11:56,100
and here and there, hints
of what was to come

198
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,700
filtered up the chain of command.

199
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,600
Enemy units were moving
around in inexplicable ways;

200
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,899
captured enemy reports
described coming attacks

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,166
on different cities;

202
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:11,100
11 agents were caught
in the city of Qui Nhon

203
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,166
carrying prerecorded tapes
calling on the local people

204
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:18,399
to rise up against the Saigon government.

205
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,732
All of these things were saying to us,

206
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:22,332
"Something's going to happen."

207
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:24,700
But we don't know exactly what.

208
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,700
NARRATOR: General
Westmoreland thought he knew.

209
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,700
"I believe that the enemy will attempt

210
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,466
a country-wide show of
strength just prior to Tet,"

211
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:38,966
he cabled Washington, "with Khe
Sanh being the main event."

212
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,942
("Voodoo Chile" by the Jimi
Hendrix Experience playing)

213
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,500
Some 30,000 North Vietnamese
troops had gathered

214
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,033
near Khe Sanh, the westernmost
strongpoint below the DMZ

215
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:51,899
that was being held by just 6,000 Marines.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,232
Westmoreland believed North
Vietnam wanted to isolate

217
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:58,332
and annihilate the U.S. forces there,

218
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:02,700
just as the Viet Minh had done
to the French at Dien Bien Phu

219
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,899
14 years earlier.

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,133
Enemy attacks elsewhere,
Westmoreland was sure,

221
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:11,466
would only be a diversion.

222
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:16,232
One American general, Frederick C.
Weyand, was not so sure.

223
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:20,100
He was able to persuade
Westmoreland to let him pull

224
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,033
half his troops back from
the Cambodian border

225
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:29,133
to take up defensive positions
outside Saigon just in case.

226
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:31,633
ROBERT GORALSKI: This is an
underground bunker at Khe Sanh,

227
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:33,533
one of two cement havens left

228
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,000
from the earlier days of the war

229
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,765
when the Special Forces held this base.

230
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:39,533
It is dark, dank, dreary.

231
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:45,600
You feel something in the
air, about the buildup.

232
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,066
I don't know, you could...

233
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:50,000
you could almost feel them
working around you at night.

234
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,399
Who?

235
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,399
Uh, the NVA.

236
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,000
NARRATOR: On January 21,

237
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,166
the North Vietnamese
began shelling Khe Sanh.

238
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:02,000
(mortar shrieks)

239
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,365
(explosions, shouting)

240
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,765
CAO XUAN DAI:

241
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:49,832
("You Keep Me Hangin' On"
by Vanilla Fudge playing)

242
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,932
(song continues, gunfire, men shouting)

243
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:09,533
NARRATOR: When he learned
of the attack on Khe Sanh,

244
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:12,666
Lyndon Johnson made the
Joint Chiefs sign a pledge

245
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:14,765
that the base would never fall.

246
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:19,033
"I don't want any damn
'Dinbinphoo, '" he said.

247
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:23,299
The president had a scale-model
of the battlefield installed

248
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,700
in the White House so that he
could follow the fighting there

249
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,033
hour by hour.

250
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,066
("You Keep Me Hangin' On" continues)

251
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:36,732
NARRATOR: But Westmoreland's and
Johnson's basic assumption was wrong.

252
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:39,500
Khe Sanh was the sideshow;

253
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
the attacks on cities and towns
that were about to begin

254
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,732
throughout South Vietnam
would be the main event.

255
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:56,700
But First Secretary Le
Duan's basic assumptions

256
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,932
were about to be tested, too.

257
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,299
For the coming offensive to succeed,

258
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,799
the South Vietnamese Army, the
ARVN, would have to collapse,

259
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,865
and the people of the South

260
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,666
would have to join the revolution.

261
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:16,600
LE CONG HUAN:

262
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:38,799
NARRATOR: "All our thinking was
focused on finishing off the enemy,"

263
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,566
one North Vietnamese general remembered.

264
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:46,232
"We were intoxicated by that thought."

265
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,466
HUY DUC:

266
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,766
MORTON DEAN: Okay, we've got our
three wounded Gis on board.

267
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:18,965
At least one of them is hit pretty bad.

268
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:22,566
Medic's got a busy, busy
few minutes ahead of him

269
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,299
before we get back.

270
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,133
NARRATOR: As the date for the
Tet Offensive approached,

271
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,932
the war continued for the
hundreds of thousands

272
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:34,232
of Americans in country.

273
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,732
HAL KUSHNER: I did see the reality of war,

274
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,599
a real education for a young doctor.

275
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,000
The war seemed to be going very
well from our point of view.

276
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:55,732
The war seemed to be going
just fine, thank you.

277
00:17:55,833 --> 00:18:00,566
NARRATOR: Captain Hal Kushner was
a 26-year-old recent graduate

278
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:04,165
of medical school from Danville, Virginia.

279
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,133
The father of a three-year-old girl,

280
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:08,432
with another baby on the way,

281
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:10,865
he had volunteered to serve in Vietnam

282
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:16,099
and became a flight surgeon
with the 1st Air Cavalry.

283
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,900
KUSHNER: And I was supposed to give

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,865
a lecture on the dangers of
night flying, ironically.

285
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:21,965
And I did.

286
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,465
We had terrible weather that night.

287
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:29,365
And it was dark and it was
rainy and it was windy.

288
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:30,700
As we were flying

289
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,133
I saw that we had drifted
west of the highway.

290
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:37,432
And I knew that was wrong.

291
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:39,432
NARRATOR: In the fog and rain,

292
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:43,432
Kushner's helicopter
slammed into a mountain.

293
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:48,099
KUSHNER: And the next thing I knew

294
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,165
I was hanging upside down
in a burning helicopter.

295
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:54,165
Major Porcella was dead.

296
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,865
I just jumped away from the helicopter,

297
00:18:56,965 --> 00:19:01,133
and it just went whoosh,
and it just burned up.

298
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:04,099
There was an M60 machine
gun on the helicopter

299
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,333
and the rounds had... cooking
off and it was exploding.

300
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:12,266
And one or several of the rounds
went through my shoulder,

301
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:13,532
my left shoulder.

302
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:18,799
On the ground I saw
Warrant Officer Bedworth.

303
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,965
And he was hurt very badly.

304
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:27,000
I took some branches and splinted his leg.

305
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:33,532
So the rule is you wait with the
aircraft until you get rescued.

306
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:35,099
And we just sat there.

307
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,732
So we waited one day.

308
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,599
We waited two days.

309
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,032
We had no food or water.

310
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:46,833
On the morning of the
third day, Bedworth died.

311
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:49,833
And he just slipped away.

312
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,432
It was very, very sad.

313
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:57,000
And I thought that my best
choice was to leave the aircraft

314
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,500
and try to go down the mountain.

315
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,333
NARRATOR: It took the
wounded Kushner four hours

316
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:05,099
to stagger down the hill.

317
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,665
When he finally reached level
ground, he looked back up

318
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:13,099
and saw two American helicopters
hovering above the crash site.

319
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:17,432
Their pilots did not see him.

320
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,640
KUSHNER: And I saw this peasant
working in a rice paddy.

321
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,766
And he saw me.

322
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:29,500
And I had captain's bars and a
Caduceus, a medical symbol,

323
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,400
on my collar.

324
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,266
And he said (speaking Vietnamese).

325
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:36,400
Captain, doctor.

326
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:42,400
He took me about another mile to
a little hooch, a little house,

327
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,400
and he sat me down on the front of it

328
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,732
and he brought out a can of condensed milk.

329
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,299
And as I was eating the stuff...

330
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,333
it was just the best stuff I've
ever eaten in my whole life...

331
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:59,266
I hear another person say,
"(repeating Vietnamese phrase).

332
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:01,799
"Surrender, no kill."

333
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,232
There was a squad of Viet Cong there.

334
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,932
And I put my one arm up.

335
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:11,900
And he shot me with an M2 carbine.

336
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I think he was more nervous than I was.

337
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,633
And he shot me right where
the M60 had shot me.

338
00:21:17,732 --> 00:21:20,833
And it went right through my
neck and came out the back.

339
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:25,400
And they tied my arms very
tightly in commo wire.

340
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,266
He went through my wallet and he
took my Geneva Convention card,

341
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,566
which was white with a red cross.

342
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,066
And he tore it up.

343
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:38,833
And he said, in English, "No P.O.W.

344
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:40,865
Criminal. Criminal."

345
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:44,432
So then they took my boots.

346
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:47,965
And we started marching.

347
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:50,400
And then we walked for a month.

348
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:57,099
30 days, almost always at night.

349
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,665
And my feet were just lacerated.

350
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:04,099
I didn't think I could possibly survive.

351
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:12,200
NGUYEN NGOC:

352
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:34,799
NARRATOR: By January 30,

353
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,932
an informal 36-hour truce
for Tet was in effect.

354
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:44,665
Thousands of ARVN troops had
gone home for the holiday.

355
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,000
The enemy had not.

356
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:53,465
NGUYEN VAN TONG:

357
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:19,766
NARRATOR: That same day,
Marine Corporal Roger Harris

358
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:23,165
was scheduled to fly out of Vietnam.

359
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:26,200
His 13-month tour was over.

360
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:29,532
But he and his unit were
still hunkered down

361
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:35,299
under constant shelling at Camp
Carroll, just south of the DMZ.

362
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,000
HARRIS: Well, once I had
my orders, you know,

363
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:41,365
I said goodbye to all my friends.

364
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:44,665
And then I went over to the landing zone.

365
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:47,700
So when the helicopters come in,

366
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,665
I put the body bags on the helicopter.

367
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:52,965
And I got on with the bodies.

368
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,665
We landed in Dong Ha, which
was division headquarters.

369
00:23:57,766 --> 00:24:01,200
And we got about 200
meters from the airstrip,

370
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,799
the airstrip started getting hit.

371
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:09,665
I'm just thinking personally
that God realizes

372
00:24:09,766 --> 00:24:12,400
that he made a mistake because
some of the guys that got killed

373
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,432
that were with me were good
Christians that never had sex,

374
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:17,333
didn't swear, you know.

375
00:24:17,432 --> 00:24:20,200
And, you know, I had been this sinner.

376
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,200
And I'm thinking God
realized he made a mistake.

377
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,365
He killed the Christians and I got away.

378
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,766
And so now Death is following me.

379
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,120
And they told us that in another hour or so

380
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,766
a plane was going to come in.

381
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:37,266
When it came in, then the
artillery started coming in.

382
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:40,066
And we jumped on and took off.

383
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:44,099
And it landed in Danang.

384
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,032
And then the sun came up and
we went to the airstrip

385
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,133
and we boarded airplanes.

386
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,932
And we were sitting there.

387
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,165
Everybody's giving each other
pounds and slapping five.

388
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:54,732
We made it.

389
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,365
And then all of a sudden...

390
00:24:56,465 --> 00:24:59,566
(imitates whistles and explosions)

391
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:05,633
Danang airstrip starts getting
hit, artillery's coming in.

392
00:25:05,732 --> 00:25:09,665
And I'm thinking, "It's
all coming after me."

393
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:12,465
It's all about me, you know.

394
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:15,266
God doesn't want me to make it out of here.

395
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,000
NARRATOR: In the early morning
hours of January 31, 1968,

396
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:26,665
84,000 Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese troops attacked

397
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:31,333
36 of South Vietnam's
44 provincial capitals,

398
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:34,633
dozens of American and ARVN military bases

399
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:37,833
and the six largest cities in the country,

400
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:41,165
including Hue, Danang, and Saigon.

401
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,766
(automatic gunfire)

402
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:45,165
Their goal, their commanders told them,

403
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:48,732
was to "crack the sky and shake the earth."

404
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,833
(shouting, explosions)

405
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,165
In Saigon, General Westmoreland
mistook the first explosions

406
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,932
as holiday firecrackers.

407
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,333
His deputy commander, General
Creighton W. Abrams,

408
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:18,833
was asleep, and his aides
did not bother to wake him.

409
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:23,266
Not a single top commander was
present at "Pentagon East,"

410
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:26,932
the sprawling MACV headquarters
at Tan Son Nhut Air Base

411
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:29,200
on the outskirts of Saigon,

412
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:33,232
when mortars and rockets
began cratering the runways.

413
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,266
It's moving.

414
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:18,333
NARRATOR: Viet Cong soldiers spread
out to attack specific targets

415
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:20,133
in and around the capital.

416
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:25,099
The war had come to the streets of Saigon.

417
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,165
Had General Weyand not
insisted on stationing troops

418
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:30,500
around the city,

419
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,633
Saigon itself would have
been in far greater danger.

420
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:40,432
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: We heard gunfire

421
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:44,400
and our first reaction was,
"Must be another coup d'Ã©tat."

422
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,865
(gunfire)

423
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:50,266
And then we heard that the
Viet Cong had attacked Saigon

424
00:27:50,365 --> 00:27:51,833
and were still attacking.

425
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:55,965
It came as a total shock
because we always thought

426
00:27:56,066 --> 00:28:01,066
Saigon was safe, the safest
place in all of South Vietnam.

427
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:08,532
NARRATOR: One Viet Cong squad made it

428
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,400
all the way to the Presidential Palace,

429
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,700
but was stopped by South Vietnamese tanks.

430
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,333
The survivors holed up in a
building across the street

431
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:24,665
and were shot by ARVN
troops and American MPs.

432
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:35,032
All over Saigon, nothing was
going according to plan.

433
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:39,599
Viet Cong units were taking
heavy losses from U.S. troops

434
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,833
and determined South Vietnamese forces.

435
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,633
(shouting)

436
00:28:57,732 --> 00:28:59,532
NGUYEN THANH TUNG:

437
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:27,133
(indistinct chatter on radio)

438
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,500
("The Blue Danube" playing on radio)

439
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,476
DON WEBSTER: This is the main
Vietnamese language radio station

440
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,766
in Saigon.

441
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:48,900
And right now there are an
undisclosed number of VC inside

442
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,133
occupying the station.

443
00:29:50,232 --> 00:29:52,833
NARRATOR: The Viet Cong managed to seize

444
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:55,665
South Vietnam's national radio station

445
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:59,732
and prepared to broadcast a
taped message from Ho Chi Minh

446
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,965
calling upon the people to rise up.

447
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:07,566
But a technician radioed
to the transmitting tower

448
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:11,400
to cut them off and
broadcast Viennese waltzes

449
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,865
and Beatles songs instead.

450
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:16,465
("Tomorrow Never Knows"
by the Beatles playing)

451
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:22,133
♪ Turn off your mind, relax,
and float downstream ♪

452
00:30:22,232 --> 00:30:25,532
♪ It is not dying

453
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:30,465
♪ It is not dying

454
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:37,333
♪ But listen to the
color of your dreams ♪

455
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:45,432
♪ It is not living, it is not living ♪

456
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:47,766
(song continues)

457
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,465
NARRATOR: The Saigon suburb of
Bien Hoa was under attack, too.

458
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:04,165
Enemy forces were assaulting
both the airbase there

459
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:05,799
and Long Binh,

460
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,000
the largest American
installation in Vietnam.

461
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:18,000
BRADY: There were VC moving on
the house, moving everywhere.

462
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:22,266
A lot of shooting, a lot
of confusion going on.

463
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:25,032
And we were shooting out the window.

464
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,900
And my wife was reloading.

465
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,500
When we ran out of ammunition, we'd sli...

466
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:34,266
slide the magazine down the tiles

467
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:36,165
and she was down there at the other end

468
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,865
filling 'em up and sliding 'em back.

469
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,700
NARRATOR: Viet Cong commandos
managed to slip through the wire

470
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:48,133
at Long Binh and blow up
a huge ammunition dump.

471
00:31:48,232 --> 00:31:51,865
A mushroom cloud rose above the airfield,

472
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:54,566
so vast that some of the
Americans thought there had been

473
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,700
a nuclear explosion.

474
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,266
The blast blew off the
door of Brady's building.

475
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:07,000
BRADY: They went up against
the wire in Long Binh

476
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,865
and paid a frightful price.

477
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,799
There were just layers of bodies.

478
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,432
The Americans just cut them down.

479
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:19,200
Hi, this is Johnny Carson.

480
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:20,809
As you know, this is the
usual starting time

481
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,133
for theTonight Show.

482
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:25,900
But because of the critical
war situation in Vietnam,

483
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,099
especially around Saigon,
NBC, for the next 15 minutes,

484
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,165
is going to bring you a special
news program via satellite.

485
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,133
Just after midnight their time,

486
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:37,000
a band of Viet Cong raiders
blew up a power installation

487
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:39,299
and attacked two police stations in Saigon.

488
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,032
It all amounts to the most ambitious series

489
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,965
of communist attacks yet mounted,

490
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,732
spreading violence into at
least ten provincial capitals,

491
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,633
plus American air bases and
civilian installations

492
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:51,799
stretching the entire
length of the country.

493
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,766
None had greater psychological impact

494
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:57,465
than the assault on the
American embassy in Saigon.

495
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:03,066
NARRATOR: In the first few
hours of the fighting,

496
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:07,099
19 specially trained commandos
had blasted their way

497
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,732
into the sprawling compound
of the United States embassy.

498
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,465
DON NORTH: There's a... there's a
rush, they're rushing the embassy.

499
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:19,865
That's fire coming from the
other side of the street now,

500
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,200
outside the embassy.

501
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,865
They're exchanging across the street.

502
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:24,766
You can see the tracer bullets going past.

503
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:27,000
(explosions, gunfire, shouting)

504
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:29,299
That's outside the embassy.

505
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,732
MAN (on radio): Uh, this is Waco, roger.

506
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:37,365
Uh, can you get in the gates now?

507
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:39,341
Are the gates open and can
you take a force in there

508
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,333
and clean out that embassy right now?

509
00:33:41,432 --> 00:33:43,400
(shouting)

510
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:59,566
NORTH: Apparently the Viet Cong
are trapped in the basement

511
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:03,900
of this side building,
an incredible situation.

512
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,065
Heavy firing, incoming and outgoing.

513
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:17,233
Don North, ABC News, at the U.S.
embassy, in Saigon.

514
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:22,532
NARRATOR: All of the intruders were
eventually killed or captured.

515
00:34:23,932 --> 00:34:26,132
NORTH: What a sight.

516
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:30,400
A small frog hopping
through a pool of blood

517
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,865
that's issuing from the
head of a Viet Cong,

518
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:40,965
lying on the green grassy
lawn of the U.S. embassy.

519
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:48,266
NGUYEN VAN TONG:

520
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:08,032
NARRATOR: An American Marine
and four Army MPs were killed

521
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:09,666
at the embassy.

522
00:35:11,365 --> 00:35:13,800
REPORTER: General, how would you assess

523
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,432
yesterday's activities and today's?

524
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,492
What is the enemy doing?
Are these major attacks?

525
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,166
Or... (explosion)

526
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:26,833
That's E.O.D. setting off a
couple of M-79 duds, I believe.

527
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:30,699
The enemy, very deceitfully,

528
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,166
has taken advantage of the Tet truce,

529
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:41,132
in order to, uh... create
maximum consternation.

530
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:43,599
In my opinion, this is diversionary...

531
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:47,532
NARRATOR: Early wire service
dispatches reported incorrectly

532
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:52,199
that the Viet Cong had made
it inside the embassy itself.

533
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,365
REPORTER: Embassy ID cards were
found on some of the Viet Cong.

534
00:35:55,465 --> 00:35:57,932
NARRATOR: And the first
television footage did little

535
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:02,065
to reassure the American public.

536
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,608
REPORTER: Is Saigon secure right now?

537
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:06,632
Saigon's secure as far as I know.

538
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,075
There's no more fighting in the streets?

539
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,376
There may be some in the outskirts still.

540
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,233
I'm not sure, don't know.

541
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,699
I'm not sure about that, no.

542
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,365
NARRATOR: Saigon was far from secure.

543
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,365
(shouting)

544
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,833
(no voice)

545
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:47,833
(distant, echoing gunfire)

546
00:36:47,932 --> 00:36:48,932
(screaming)

547
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,932
Viet Cong assassination squads,

548
00:36:51,032 --> 00:36:55,032
some guided by North Vietnamese spies,

549
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:59,099
moved through the streets with
orders to kill what they called

550
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,065
"blood" enemies of the people...

551
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,266
(gunfire, screaming)

552
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:09,132
bureaucrats, intelligence
officers, ARVN commanders,

553
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:13,599
and ordinary soldiers home on
leave, and their families.

554
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:17,965
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: I went
home to visit my parents

555
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:21,833
and I found them kind of huddled
in their house, the doors shut,

556
00:37:21,932 --> 00:37:24,132
the windows shut, very dark.

557
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:27,333
They were very afraid because
our house was located

558
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:29,099
near a slum.

559
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,932
And we always assumed that there
were a lot of Viet Cong agents

560
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:37,699
living among the poor where
they could hide very easily,

561
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,766
and that they were going to come out

562
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:43,766
and look for government officials,

563
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:46,932
military personnel to kill.

564
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:50,099
So my parents were very afraid.

565
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,400
NGUYEN TAI:

566
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:15,900
(gunfight)

567
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,908
NARRATOR: On the second
day of the fighting,

568
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,599
a Viet Cong agent named Nguyen Van Lem

569
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:36,666
was brought before Nguyen Ngoc Loan,

570
00:38:36,766 --> 00:38:39,965
the head of the South
Vietnamese National Police.

571
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:44,532
As an AP photographer and
an NBC cameraman watched,

572
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:48,500
Loan ordered another officer
to shoot the captive.

573
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,465
When he hesitated, Loan
did the job himself.

574
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:10,365
HOWARD TUCKNER: The Chief of South
Vietnam's National Police Force,

575
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:14,166
Brigadier General Nguyen Ngoc
Loan, was waiting for him.

576
00:39:34,865 --> 00:39:36,965
JACK HORNER: Good morning, Mr. President.

577
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,699
JOHNSON: Hi, Jack.

578
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,666
Uh, we need guidance this morning, sir.

579
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:43,333
Guidance? Uh, is that all you want?

580
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:44,900
Yes, sir. No quotation?

581
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,465
That's right. No attribution.

582
00:39:46,565 --> 00:39:47,599
No connection.

583
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,099
Give it absolutely none.

584
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,666
Absolutely none.

585
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:53,300
Your press is lying like
drunken sailors every day.

586
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,766
Uh, first thing I wake up this
morning was trying to figure out

587
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:01,099
after seeing CBS, watching the networks,

588
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,465
reading the morning papers,
was how can we win...

589
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:07,032
possibly win... and survive as a nation

590
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:08,965
and have to fight the press's lies.

591
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:10,365
Yes, sir.

592
00:40:10,465 --> 00:40:11,742
I'm trying to protect my country,

593
00:40:11,766 --> 00:40:13,032
and they're all whipping me.

594
00:40:13,132 --> 00:40:15,833
Not a son of a bitch said
a word about Ho Chi Minh.

595
00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:18,833
They talk about us bombing,
yet these sons of bitches

596
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:22,199
come in and bomb our embassy and
19 of them try a raid on it.

597
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,532
All 19 get killed and yet
they blame the embassy.

598
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,699
(chuckles)

599
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,599
I don't understand it.

600
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:32,400
We think we've killed 20,000;
we think we lost 400.

601
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,266
We think that of course
it's bad to lose anybody,

602
00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:38,032
any one of the 400,

603
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:40,632
but we think that the Good
Lord has been so good to us

604
00:40:40,733 --> 00:40:44,266
that it is a major, dramatic victory.

605
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:46,000
And I think what would have happened

606
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:48,199
if I'd lost 20,000 and they'd lost 400?

607
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,166
I ask you that.

608
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:50,408
Oh, it would've been terrible.

609
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,565
(explosion)

610
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:55,599
It appears that a mortar
or a rocket shell came in

611
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:59,965
and, well, there's blood on my pants.

612
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:02,199
And I guess I'm... I'm hit.

613
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,000
Well, this is the streets of Saigon,

614
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,300
and that's where the war is now.

615
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,032
Howard Tuckner, NBC News.

616
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:17,233
NARRATOR: The American press
focused almost entirely

617
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,733
on the fighting in Saigon.

618
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:23,599
But the Tet Offensive was
happening almost everywhere.

619
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,932
Most assaults were being
quickly beaten back by ARVN

620
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:31,632
and American forces.

621
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:36,233
Everywhere the enemy was
suffering terrible losses.

622
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:50,500
(gunfire)

623
00:41:57,733 --> 00:42:00,365
LE VAN CHO:

624
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:29,532
NARRATOR: The Americans called in
massive air and artillery firepower

625
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:33,900
to dislodge a Viet Cong regiment
from the city of Ben Tre

626
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,300
in the Mekong Delta.

627
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,199
Afterwards, a reporter quoted an
American major as having said,

628
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:47,965
"It became necessary to
destroy the town to save it."

629
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:54,500
Right now, the Navy and the Army
boats that also bring supplies

630
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,300
up the Perfume River are having
to undergo heavy small arms

631
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,632
and mortar fire as they
turn the bend in the river

632
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:02,632
here around Hue itself.

633
00:43:02,733 --> 00:43:05,099
And the landing zone on this
the south side of the river

634
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,365
has been under almost constant
mortar and small arms fire.

635
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:11,733
And today, at any rate, Hue is cut off.

636
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:19,266
NARRATOR: The longest, bloodiest
battle of the Tet Offensive

637
00:43:19,365 --> 00:43:21,300
was being fought in the streets

638
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,166
of one of the country's loveliest cities,

639
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:27,965
the former imperial capital Hue.

640
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:30,266
(gunfire)

641
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,333
(shouting, gunfire)

642
00:43:44,065 --> 00:43:47,266
The Perfume River divided Hue in two.

643
00:43:47,365 --> 00:43:50,465
The enemy... North Vietnamese regulars

644
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:52,365
and Viet Cong guerrillas...

645
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:55,432
had taken over both sides of the city.

646
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:59,365
Only the American advisers'
compound on the south bank

647
00:43:59,465 --> 00:44:01,965
and the 1st ARVN division headquarters

648
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:05,300
within the thick-walled
Citadel on the north side

649
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,166
held out against them.

650
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,432
NGUYEN NGOC:

651
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,199
NARRATOR: Marine Corporal Bill
Ehrhart was at the end of his tour

652
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,532
and was preparing to go home.

653
00:44:50,632 --> 00:44:52,733
But when his company was ordered

654
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:56,465
to relieve the besieged
American compound in Hue,

655
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:59,733
he chose to go with his comrades.

656
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:03,800
EHRHART: I had spent 12 months in Vietnam
looking for somebody to shoot at

657
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,766
and there was nobody there.

658
00:45:06,865 --> 00:45:09,833
And then all of a sudden

659
00:45:09,932 --> 00:45:13,365
it seemed like here's
every NVA in the world

660
00:45:13,465 --> 00:45:16,032
trying to kill me and my pals.

661
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:20,099
It was an entirely different kind of fight.

662
00:45:29,965 --> 00:45:33,300
NARRATOR: Ehrhart and his
unit endured a bloody ambush,

663
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,032
finally fought their way
through to the MACV compound,

664
00:45:37,132 --> 00:45:41,500
and then began days of
brutal block-by-block battle

665
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,233
to retake the surrounding neighborhoods.

666
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,766
Every house became a battlefield.

667
00:45:58,233 --> 00:46:01,599
"It was exhilarating," Ehrhart remembered.

668
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:04,833
"I was scared utterly witless,

669
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:07,365
"but it was the greatest adrenaline high

670
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:10,032
I'd ever experienced."

671
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:14,565
EHRHART: It was ugly, ugly fighting.

672
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:17,932
You literally have to clear
houses a room at a time,

673
00:46:18,032 --> 00:46:20,800
a floor at a time, a house at a time.

674
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,932
And then you go to the next one.

675
00:46:25,465 --> 00:46:28,599
NGUYEN THI HOA:

676
00:46:54,532 --> 00:46:56,800
(gunfire)

677
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:10,632
(soldier yelling instructions
over deafening gunfight)

678
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:12,699
(gunfight grows louder)

679
00:47:16,932 --> 00:47:18,432
(explosion, then silence)

680
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,400
February 5, I was wounded by a B40 rocket.

681
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,932
I was utterly stone deaf.

682
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:36,199
Under any other circumstances
I would have been evacuated.

683
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,833
But I could see, I could
walk, and I could shoot.

684
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:42,132
So I stayed.

685
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,166
(distant, muffled gunfire)

686
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:02,099
(heartbeat grows louder over muted din)

687
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:04,500
(explosion, shouting)

688
00:48:11,132 --> 00:48:13,065
NARRATOR: The fighting continued.

689
00:48:15,632 --> 00:48:18,833
(gunshots whizzing, soldiers
cacophonously screaming in pain)

690
00:48:18,932 --> 00:48:23,599
"We had to blow our way through
every wall of every house,"

691
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:25,199
one Marine remembered.

692
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:30,666
"It's a shame we had to damage
such a beautiful city."

693
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:35,333
EHRHART: Of course, all these
civilians have been herded

694
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:37,266
into the university.

695
00:48:37,365 --> 00:48:40,500
They had all gone there
to get the hell away

696
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:42,575
from having grenades thrown
in their living rooms.

697
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:45,132
And one of the guys comes in and says,

698
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:51,666
"I found this-this girl who will
fuck us all for C rations."

699
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:53,300
And I'm thinking,

700
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,532
"Wait, we're in the
middle of this big battle

701
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,800
and I'm gonna go and..."

702
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:06,599
But I'm 19 years old and my
buddies are gonna, and I just...

703
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:11,233
I demonstrated to myself how
little courage I actually had.

704
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:16,099
I've lived with it ever
since, but I-I-I did it

705
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:17,666
because I wasn't gonna say,

706
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:21,266
"You guys, we shouldn't
do something like this."

707
00:49:21,365 --> 00:49:25,599
Even more than the killings,

708
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:28,833
the thing I think I'm most ashamed of

709
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:33,400
when I think back on the
time I spent there.

710
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:41,099
I think it's because my mother's
a woman, my wife's a woman,

711
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,065
my daughter's a woman.

712
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:45,800
(sighs)

713
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:54,599
Somebody gets shot, not a good thing.

714
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:57,333
You see somebody running away,

715
00:49:57,432 --> 00:50:00,900
I don't know, it could've been a VC.

716
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,666
But that woman?

717
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,666
Nah.

718
00:50:06,766 --> 00:50:09,465
I had every opportunity to say no.

719
00:50:09,565 --> 00:50:12,233
(gunfire)

720
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:16,565
NARRATOR: The next day, in the
midst of still another firefight,

721
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:20,065
a lieutenant in a jeep pulled
up in front of the building

722
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:23,599
from which Ehrhart and five
fellow Marines were firing

723
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:25,132
at the enemy.

724
00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:28,199
"Come on, Ehrhart!" he shouted.

725
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,166
"Chopper's on the LZ right now.

726
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:32,865
You want to go home or not?"

727
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,965
From the helicopter that
lifted him up and away

728
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:39,965
from the ruined, smoking city,

729
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:42,500
he could see a farmer and his water buffalo

730
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,965
working a flooded field

731
00:50:45,065 --> 00:50:48,900
and women in conical hats
carrying twin baskets

732
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
hurrying along between the
paddies as if there were no war.

733
00:50:57,699 --> 00:51:01,632
Back in Hue, the Viet Cong
and North Vietnamese troops

734
00:51:01,733 --> 00:51:05,865
now found themselves
trapped inside the city.

735
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:09,465
NGUYEN NGOC:

736
00:51:22,932 --> 00:51:23,932
(gunfire)

737
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:28,833
NARRATOR: It would take two weeks

738
00:51:28,932 --> 00:51:31,632
for the Marines to fight
their way across the river

739
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:34,365
to support the ARVN,

740
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:35,865
who had stubbornly kept the enemy

741
00:51:35,965 --> 00:51:40,365
from overwhelming their division
headquarters in the Citadel.

742
00:52:00,266 --> 00:52:03,233
DAVID BURRINGTON: What's
the hardest part of it?

743
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,766
Not knowing where they are,
that's the worst of it.

744
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:07,841
Riding around and running in
the sewers, in the gutters,

745
00:52:07,865 --> 00:52:08,932
anywhere.

746
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:10,599
Could be anywhere.

747
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:12,432
Just hoping to stay alive and day to day.

748
00:52:12,532 --> 00:52:14,476
Everybody just wants to go
back home and go to school.

749
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,733
That's about it.

750
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:16,841
Have you lost any friends?

751
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:18,000
Quite a few.

752
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:20,300
We lost one the other
day, good buddy of mine.

753
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,733
The whole thing stinks, really.

754
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,965
(gunfire, shouting)

755
00:52:36,932 --> 00:52:38,599
HO HUU LAN:

756
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,333
He's still alive.

757
00:52:58,865 --> 00:53:03,632
NGUYEN THI HOA:

758
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:25,532
NARRATOR: After 26 days of
bitter, bloody fighting,

759
00:53:25,632 --> 00:53:30,800
the flag of South Vietnam
flew again above the Citadel.

760
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,733
The surviving North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong

761
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:37,199
were finally permitted by their commanders

762
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,132
to pull out of the city.

763
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:43,900
Some 6,000 civilians had
died in the rubble.

764
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,733
Of the city's 135,000 citizens,
110,000 had lost their homes.

765
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,132
All that was left of
Hue, one reporter wrote,

766
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:01,333
was "ruins divided by a river."

767
00:54:03,632 --> 00:54:05,233
JOHNSON (on TV): The biggest fact is

768
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:09,233
that the stated purposes
of the General Uprising...

769
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:13,166
a military victory or a
psychological victory...

770
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,733
have failed.

771
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:17,841
DON WEBSTER: The attack
on the radio station

772
00:54:17,865 --> 00:54:19,766
started at 2:30 in the morning.

773
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:22,900
NARRATOR: Night after night for weeks,

774
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,800
American television screens
had been filled with images

775
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,699
of blood and violence and devastation

776
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,465
the public had rarely seen before.

777
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:35,465
GEORGE SYVERTSON: The enemy
was nowhere and everywhere.

778
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:39,266
NARRATOR: But it was one
photograph that for many people

779
00:54:39,365 --> 00:54:42,365
would come to define the Tet Offensive.

780
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:50,532
SAM HYNES: I remember he was
wearing a checked shirt.

781
00:54:50,632 --> 00:54:55,233
And the photographer had come up very close

782
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,766
and had pressed his shutter

783
00:54:56,865 --> 00:55:01,400
just as the officer pulled his trigger.

784
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,199
So camera and gun went off together

785
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,065
and you could see the man's
head bulging at the side

786
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:11,900
where the bullet was about to come out.

787
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,565
We were there, face-to-face
with this man who was dying,

788
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:16,932
right now, dead.

789
00:55:17,032 --> 00:55:20,632
JAMES WILLBANKS: It's a
devastating thing to see.

790
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:23,400
And I think many Americans
began to ask themselves,

791
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,432
"Are we supporting the wrong guys here?"

792
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:31,333
And it sort of brings home, I
think to, to the dinner table,

793
00:55:31,432 --> 00:55:33,666
or the breakfast table if
you see it in the papers,

794
00:55:33,766 --> 00:55:35,833
the brutality of this war

795
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:39,000
and the fact that it looks
like it's never going to end.

796
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:45,266
PHAN QUANG TUE: But what we know is the
price that we pay for that picture.

797
00:55:45,365 --> 00:55:47,333
It was the turning point.

798
00:55:47,432 --> 00:55:51,233
Because that put the gov...
Americans to position and say,

799
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,766
"Hey, look, we want to spend money

800
00:55:53,865 --> 00:55:55,365
"and the lives of our young people

801
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:57,400
to protect such a system?"

802
00:56:06,465 --> 00:56:09,900
NARRATOR: For a month, Hal Kushner's
captors had made him walk

803
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,099
deeper and deeper into
the Central Highlands,

804
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:14,800
always moving at night

805
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,465
so that they would not
be spotted from the air.

806
00:56:19,532 --> 00:56:23,900
KUSHNER: They took me to this place
that I assume was a hospital.

807
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,333
It was just a series of caves

808
00:56:25,432 --> 00:56:28,365
but there were a lot of
wounded lying around.

809
00:56:28,465 --> 00:56:36,000
And this female nurse came
out and inspected my wound.

810
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:40,400
And then she gave me a
bamboo stick to bite on.

811
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,865
She laid me down and she gave me
this bamboo stick to bite on.

812
00:56:43,965 --> 00:56:46,266
And then she took this rifle-cleaning rod

813
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:48,932
and she heated it up in a
fire until it was red hot.

814
00:56:50,932 --> 00:56:52,865
And she took it and put it through my wound

815
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:54,900
through and through.

816
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,632
And it really hurt.

817
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:59,632
It really, really, really hurt.

818
00:56:59,733 --> 00:57:02,365
And then she put
Mercurochrome on the wound.

819
00:57:02,465 --> 00:57:06,666
And she gave me an aspirin tablet.

820
00:57:06,766 --> 00:57:11,565
And I... I thought, what
else can they do to me?

821
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:16,132
NARRATOR: Kushner would eventually
arrive at a remote jungle camp,

822
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:20,432
joining a handful of other
American prisoners.

823
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:25,132
And this Vietnamese officer came
to me and he spoke English.

824
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,333
And that was the first real
English speaker that I had seen.

825
00:57:28,432 --> 00:57:30,833
And he had a little
reel-to-reel tape recorder,

826
00:57:30,932 --> 00:57:33,465
battery-powered tape recorder.

827
00:57:33,565 --> 00:57:36,333
And he asked me to make
a message to my family

828
00:57:36,432 --> 00:57:39,099
to let them know that I was safe.

829
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:41,465
And I could do that if I
would make a statement

830
00:57:41,565 --> 00:57:43,699
against the war.

831
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,233
And I told... I told him with great bravado

832
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,166
that I would rather die
than make a statement

833
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:50,766
against my country.

834
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:52,699
And he said to me,

835
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,733
"You will find dying is very easy.

836
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:01,199
"Living will be the difficult thing.

837
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,733
Living is the difficult thing."

838
00:58:07,132 --> 00:58:12,300
NARRATOR: In early March, two weeks
after Hue had finally been recaptured,

839
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,400
Second Lieutenant Phil Gioia
of the 82nd Airborne Division

840
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,000
led his platoon along the Perfume River,

841
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:22,233
looking for weapons that
might have been buried

842
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,400
by the retreating enemy.

843
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,400
Gioia's sergeant, Reuben Torres,

844
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,365
saw something sticking
up from the sandy soil.

845
00:58:31,465 --> 00:58:35,132
It was an elbow.

846
00:58:35,233 --> 00:58:39,333
So to us it seemed as though
this was going to be a grave

847
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,032
where the enemy had buried
some of his own people

848
00:58:42,132 --> 00:58:43,900
on the withdrawal from Hue.

849
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,965
Sergeant Torres said, "You know, sir,

850
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,065
I think we better start to dig here."

851
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:54,132
We found the first body and it was a woman.

852
00:58:54,233 --> 00:58:58,199
She was wearing a white
blouse and black trousers.

853
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,300
She had her hands tied behind her back

854
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,365
and she'd been shot in
the back of the head.

855
00:59:03,465 --> 00:59:06,965
Next to her was a child,
who'd also been shot.

856
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:12,199
The next person coming
up was another woman.

857
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,532
At that point it was clear
that this-this wasn't

858
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:17,632
enemy North Vietnamese or Viet Cong.

859
00:59:19,365 --> 00:59:22,465
NGUYEN NGOC:

860
00:59:39,632 --> 00:59:41,233
(gunfire)

861
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:44,932
NARRATOR: Before they abandoned the city,

862
00:59:45,032 --> 00:59:47,932
the communists had systematically executed

863
00:59:48,032 --> 00:59:52,465
at least 2,800 people
they called "hooligans"

864
00:59:52,565 --> 00:59:55,233
and "reactionaries."

865
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:56,932
Hanoi would always deny

866
00:59:57,032 --> 01:00:00,365
that any innocent civilians
had been killed.

867
01:00:00,465 --> 01:00:02,400
(woman sobbing)

868
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,865
NGUYEN NGOC:

869
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,833
(woman wailing in grief)

870
01:00:32,932 --> 01:00:37,400
HO HUU LAN:

871
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:10,266
NARRATOR: President Johnson insisted
that the Tet Offensive had been

872
01:01:10,365 --> 01:01:13,632
"a devastating defeat for the communists."

873
01:01:13,733 --> 01:01:16,500
Militarily, he was right.

874
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:20,632
The basic assumptions on which
the North Vietnamese mounted

875
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:24,199
their offensive had all proved to be wrong.

876
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:28,166
Hanoi's leaders had assumed
the ARVN would crumble,

877
01:01:28,266 --> 01:01:33,065
that South Vietnamese soldiers
would come over to their side.

878
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:37,000
Instead, not a single unit defected.

879
01:01:38,632 --> 01:01:42,599
The civilian populace
Hanoi expected to rise up

880
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,132
may have been unhappy
with their government,

881
01:01:45,233 --> 01:01:49,132
but they had little sympathy for communism,

882
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:53,400
and when the fighting began,
they had hidden in their homes

883
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,632
to escape the fury in the streets.

884
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,766
PHAM DUY TAT:

885
01:02:11,632 --> 01:02:16,132
NARRATOR: North Vietnamese
general Vo Nguyen Giap,

886
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,900
who had opposed the offensive
from the beginning,

887
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,900
later remembered that Tet
had been a "costly lesson,

888
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,233
paid for in blood and bone."

889
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,500
NARRATOR: Of the 84,000 enemy
troops who are estimated

890
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,000
to have taken part in the Tet
Offensive, more than half...

891
01:02:55,099 --> 01:03:00,733
as many as 58,000 men and
women, most of them Viet Cong...

892
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:05,199
are thought to have been
killed or wounded or captured.

893
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,400
JOHN LAURENCE: The American military
command celebrated the Tet Offensive

894
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,932
as a victory.

895
01:03:12,032 --> 01:03:15,132
You know, "They finally came
at us, and we blew them away,"

896
01:03:15,233 --> 01:03:17,632
which was basically true.

897
01:03:17,733 --> 01:03:21,132
But the administration had been
telling the American public

898
01:03:21,233 --> 01:03:25,865
for most of the end of '67 and
for the first month of 1968

899
01:03:25,965 --> 01:03:27,766
that the war was being won;

900
01:03:27,865 --> 01:03:32,865
that the NLF and the North
Vietnamese were ground down

901
01:03:32,965 --> 01:03:35,833
to such an extent that we
could see the end of the war,

902
01:03:35,932 --> 01:03:37,266
a victory.

903
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:40,865
The Tet Offensive has forced
our generals to re-evaluate...

904
01:03:40,965 --> 01:03:44,865
So when Tet hit, it contradicted everything

905
01:03:44,965 --> 01:03:47,865
that the administration and
the Saigon country team

906
01:03:47,965 --> 01:03:50,666
had been telling the American
public through its journalists

907
01:03:50,766 --> 01:03:52,865
for the previous four or five months.

908
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:55,766
John Laurence, CBS News, Saigon.

909
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,705
("White Rabbit" by Jefferson
Airplane playing)

910
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,833
BRADY: It broke the will of the
United States to fight that war.

911
01:04:02,932 --> 01:04:08,465
It was such a shock that it
stripped away the last vestiges

912
01:04:08,565 --> 01:04:12,300
of the fiction and fanciful interpretations

913
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,266
that had led us down this
primrose path into disaster.

914
01:04:16,365 --> 01:04:21,233
After that nobody could be convinced.

915
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:25,266
And then the most ferocious
possible argument erupted

916
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:26,699
inside the U.S. government

917
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:31,733
because the hawks on the war were saying,

918
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:37,166
"Tet was North Vietnam's last gasp.

919
01:04:37,266 --> 01:04:40,465
"It was their last shot at winning the war,

920
01:04:40,565 --> 01:04:42,300
"and they failed.

921
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,632
We beat them, and that's the end of them."

922
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:51,465
And we said, "After all these years of war,

923
01:04:51,565 --> 01:04:54,065
"if that's what they are able to do,

924
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:58,432
"we ought to learn some
lesson about their commitment

925
01:04:58,532 --> 01:05:01,233
to this war as well and the cost to us."

926
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:05,000
NARRATOR: On March 10,
theNew York Times reported

927
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:09,800
that the Army was requesting
206,000 additional troops

928
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,632
for Vietnam.

929
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:14,432
But if the United States
had been winning the war,

930
01:05:14,532 --> 01:05:18,699
many Americans asked, if Tet
had in fact been a disaster

931
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,865
for the enemy, why were
still more men needed?

932
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:26,465
More and more members of
the president's own party

933
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:30,065
now felt free to express their doubts.

934
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:34,132
"Our enemy has finally shattered
the mask of official illusion,"

935
01:05:34,233 --> 01:05:36,632
Senator Robert Kennedy said.

936
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:39,833
"Unable to defeat him or break his will,

937
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:43,865
we must actively seek a
peaceful settlement."

938
01:05:43,965 --> 01:05:45,666
...can cope with its problems.

939
01:05:45,766 --> 01:05:50,300
NARRATOR: Walter Cronkite, the respected
anchor of theCBS Evening News,

940
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,166
had come home from
covering the Tet Offensive

941
01:05:53,266 --> 01:05:57,333
convinced victory was no longer possible.

942
01:05:57,432 --> 01:06:00,000
We have been too often
disappointed by the optimism

943
01:06:00,099 --> 01:06:03,233
of the American leaders, both
in Vietnam and Washington,

944
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:06,666
to have faith any longer in
the silver linings they find

945
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:08,266
in the darkest clouds.

946
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:12,565
To say that we are closer to
victory today is to believe,

947
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,099
in the face of the evidence,

948
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:17,000
the optimists who have
been wrong in the past.

949
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:19,699
To suggest we are on the edge of defeat

950
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,833
is to yield to unreasonable pessimism.

951
01:06:22,932 --> 01:06:25,432
To say that we are mired in stalemate

952
01:06:25,532 --> 01:06:29,266
seems the only realistic if
unsatisfactory conclusion.

953
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:32,733
But it is increasingly
clear to this reporter

954
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:37,266
that the only rational way out
then will be to negotiate,

955
01:06:37,365 --> 01:06:41,666
not as victors, but as an
honorable people who lived up

956
01:06:41,766 --> 01:06:43,699
to their pledge to defend democracy

957
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,500
and did the best they could.

958
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:48,233
This is Walter Cronkite.

959
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:49,733
Goodnight.

960
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,500
EUGENE McCARTHY: In 1966, in '67,

961
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:54,632
and again in '68,

962
01:06:54,733 --> 01:06:57,699
most recently we hear the same
hollow claims of progress

963
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,065
and of advance toward victory.

964
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:04,333
The fact is, however, as we know
from events of recent weeks,

965
01:07:04,432 --> 01:07:07,900
events which one is almost
saddened to report,

966
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,365
that the enemy has become bolder than ever.

967
01:07:10,465 --> 01:07:13,965
NARRATOR: On the evening of March 12,

968
01:07:14,065 --> 01:07:16,666
President Johnson watched
the returns come in

969
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:20,300
from the New Hampshire
Democratic presidential primary,

970
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,199
where he was facing an
unexpected challenge.

971
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,365
The most recent poll had suggested

972
01:07:26,465 --> 01:07:29,733
he would beat Eugene McCarthy two to one.

973
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:34,532
But Johnson won just 49.6% of the vote

974
01:07:34,632 --> 01:07:38,266
against 41.9% for his opponent,

975
01:07:38,365 --> 01:07:42,565
even though most of those who
voted against the president

976
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:47,233
actually wanted him to prosecute
the war more vigorously.

977
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:50,465
Johnson knew he was in trouble.

978
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:52,642
ROBERT KENNEDY: ...for the
presidency of the United States...

979
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:54,699
NARRATOR: And there was more to come.

980
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,432
I do not run for the presidency
merely to oppose any man...

981
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:01,965
NARRATOR: Just four days after
the New Hampshire primary,

982
01:08:02,065 --> 01:08:07,565
Robert F. Kennedy declared his
candidacy for the presidency,

983
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:11,632
and polls suggested he was more
popular than Lyndon Johnson.

984
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:13,600
...about what must be done.

985
01:08:13,699 --> 01:08:17,300
I run because it is now unmistakably clear

986
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:22,699
that we can change these
disastrous, divisive policies

987
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,733
only by changing the men
who are now making them.

988
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:32,199
(din of large crowd)

989
01:08:35,132 --> 01:08:37,565
LYNDON JOHNSON: I think
what we've got to do, too,

990
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:42,033
is get out of the posture of
just being the war candidate

991
01:08:42,132 --> 01:08:45,166
that McCarthy has put us in,
and Bobby's putting us in,

992
01:08:45,265 --> 01:08:46,365
the kids are putting us in,

993
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:48,100
and the papers are putting us in.

994
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:50,632
We've got to come up with something.

995
01:08:50,733 --> 01:08:54,000
CLARK CLIFFORD: What it
is: we're out to win,

996
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,600
but we're not out to win the war.

997
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:57,832
We're out to win the peace.

998
01:08:57,932 --> 01:08:59,233
JOHNSON: That's right.

999
01:08:59,332 --> 01:09:00,642
CLIFFORD: And that's what we give them,

1000
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,142
and what our slogan could very well be...

1001
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:04,466
win the peace with honor.

1002
01:09:04,565 --> 01:09:08,765
JOHNSON: But we've got to have something
new and fresh that goes in there

1003
01:09:08,865 --> 01:09:10,966
along with the statement
that we're going to win.

1004
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:12,699
CLIFFORD: Right.

1005
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,699
But we have to be very careful

1006
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,500
what it is we say we're going to win.

1007
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,365
JOHNSON: That's right.

1008
01:09:18,466 --> 01:09:21,065
CLIFFORD: They think, well hell,
that means we're just going

1009
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:23,765
to keep pouring men in
until we win militarily.

1010
01:09:23,865 --> 01:09:25,932
And that isn't what we're after, really.

1011
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:29,000
JOHNSON: Uh, we're not
going to get these doves,

1012
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,233
but we can neutralize the country;

1013
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:32,442
that way it won't follow them,

1014
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:33,786
if we can come up with something.

1015
01:09:38,365 --> 01:09:43,699
NARRATOR: On March 26, the Wise Men,
a group of veteran cold warriors

1016
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,632
who had earlier urged the
president to hold steady

1017
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:50,765
in Vietnam, now advised
him to change course.

1018
01:09:50,865 --> 01:09:54,733
Dean Acheson, Harry Truman's
secretary of state,

1019
01:09:54,832 --> 01:09:56,565
spoke for the majority.

1020
01:09:56,666 --> 01:10:00,100
"We can no longer do the
job we set out to do

1021
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:02,565
in the time we have left," he said,

1022
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:06,800
"and we must begin to
take steps to disengage."

1023
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:13,265
The president agreed to send
just 13,500 more troops,

1024
01:10:13,365 --> 01:10:17,765
not the 206,000 the generals had requested,

1025
01:10:17,865 --> 01:10:21,432
and decided to recall William
Westmoreland to Washington

1026
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:23,699
as chief of staff of the Army,

1027
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:29,000
replacing him with his deputy,
General Creighton W. Abrams.

1028
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,500
NEIL SHEEHAN: His face was a... was
a mask of exhaustion and defeat.

1029
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,332
It was very sad to see the man.

1030
01:10:38,432 --> 01:10:41,765
He-he was broken by it.

1031
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:45,500
NARRATOR: On March 30, Gallup reported

1032
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,932
that 63% of the public disapproved

1033
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:51,733
of Johnson's handling of the war,

1034
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:55,800
the lowest point of his presidency.

1035
01:10:55,899 --> 01:11:00,832
The following evening, March 31, 1968,

1036
01:11:00,932 --> 01:11:05,500
the president asked for
time on all three networks.

1037
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:09,765
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

1038
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:12,932
Tonight, I want to speak to you

1039
01:11:13,033 --> 01:11:16,000
of peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

1040
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,899
NARRATOR: Johnson announced that
he had decided to stop bombing

1041
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,600
the densely populated areas
around Hanoi and Haiphong

1042
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:28,500
in the hope that North Vietnam
would finally be willing

1043
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,132
to come to the negotiating table.

1044
01:11:31,233 --> 01:11:33,899
Only the southern half of the country,

1045
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,533
the staging areas north of the DMZ,

1046
01:11:36,632 --> 01:11:40,500
would continue to be targeted.

1047
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,033
Then he stunned the country and the world.

1048
01:11:45,132 --> 01:11:50,466
I do not believe that I
should devote an hour

1049
01:11:50,565 --> 01:11:56,432
or a day of my time to any
personal partisan causes

1050
01:11:56,533 --> 01:12:04,533
or to any duties other than the
awesome duties of this office,

1051
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:08,865
the presidency of your country.

1052
01:12:08,966 --> 01:12:16,966
Accordingly, I shall not
seek, and I will not accept,

1053
01:12:17,865 --> 01:12:21,832
the nomination of my party for
another term as your president.

1054
01:12:25,565 --> 01:12:28,832
("Live Right Now" by Eddie Harris playing)

1055
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:36,699
ROGER HARRIS: I land in California and
take a plane from California to Boston.

1056
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,399
And I'm feeling good because I've survived

1057
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,199
and, you know, I fought for my country.

1058
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,166
I got off the plane at Logan
and I stepped out there

1059
01:12:46,265 --> 01:12:48,132
and I'm just happy to be home.

1060
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:55,033
And I had my uniform on and
walked out to the curb,

1061
01:12:55,132 --> 01:12:59,899
and the cabs just kept going
by me, kept going by me.

1062
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,865
And there was a state trooper
that was standing there.

1063
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:05,600
And I didn't realize what was happening.

1064
01:13:05,699 --> 01:13:09,065
And then he stepped in the
street and he stopped a cab

1065
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:11,100
and he says, "You have to take this man.

1066
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,432
You have to take this soldier."

1067
01:13:13,533 --> 01:13:15,565
And the driver looked
over at me and he said,

1068
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:18,199
"I don't want to go to Roxbury."

1069
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,666
They don't see me as a soldier.

1070
01:13:20,765 --> 01:13:23,565
You know, they see me as a
nigger coming home here

1071
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,365
and I live in Roxbury.

1072
01:13:25,466 --> 01:13:26,565
You know?

1073
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:28,399
I'm thinking, "I'm a Marine.

1074
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,865
I'm a Marine," you know.

1075
01:13:29,966 --> 01:13:33,300
"I just fought for my country
13 months in the combat zone.

1076
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:35,500
And I can't get a cab to get home."

1077
01:13:37,733 --> 01:13:40,533
ROBERT KENNEDY: I have some
very sad news for all of you,

1078
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:45,765
and, I think, sad news for
all of our fellow citizens,

1079
01:13:45,865 --> 01:13:49,832
and people who love peace
all over the world;

1080
01:13:49,932 --> 01:13:53,565
and that is that Martin
Luther King was shot

1081
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,308
and was killed tonight
in Memphis, Tennessee.

1082
01:13:55,332 --> 01:13:57,100
(crowd screaming in disbelief)

1083
01:13:59,332 --> 01:14:01,432
In this difficult day,

1084
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:05,132
in this difficult time
for the United States,

1085
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:09,800
it's perhaps well to ask
what kind of a nation we are

1086
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:12,300
and what direction we want to move in.

1087
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,300
NARRATOR: Over the next
week, African Americans...

1088
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:20,399
grieving, frustrated, angry...

1089
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:25,399
poured into the streets of more
than 100 towns and cities,

1090
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:30,065
including New York and
Oakland, Newark and Nashville,

1091
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:35,233
Chicago and Cincinnati and Baltimore,

1092
01:14:35,332 --> 01:14:37,800
and in Washington, D.C.,

1093
01:14:37,899 --> 01:14:41,233
where fires came within two
blocks of the White House.

1094
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,565
STOKELY CARMICHAEL: When they killed Dr.
King they just opened up the eyes

1095
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:49,466
of a lot of black people who
were afraid to pick up guns.

1096
01:14:49,565 --> 01:14:52,332
Now they will pick up those guns.

1097
01:14:52,432 --> 01:14:54,432
JESSE JACKSON: We're
living in a sick world.

1098
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:57,466
This racist society in which we live

1099
01:14:57,565 --> 01:14:59,199
is that that really pulled the trigger.

1100
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:05,065
ROBERT KENNEDY: Violence breeds violence,
repression breeds retaliation,

1101
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:09,632
and only a cleansing of our whole society

1102
01:15:09,733 --> 01:15:13,466
can remove this sickness from our souls.

1103
01:15:13,565 --> 01:15:16,966
NARRATOR: Tens of thousands
of National Guardsmen,

1104
01:15:17,065 --> 01:15:19,899
regular Army troops and the Marines,

1105
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,832
including Roger Harris's stateside unit,

1106
01:15:23,932 --> 01:15:26,800
were ordered to patrol American streets.

1107
01:15:28,632 --> 01:15:30,832
HARRIS: And I was ready to go.

1108
01:15:30,932 --> 01:15:34,100
Until I saw what they were giving out.

1109
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:36,166
I thought they were going
to give us billy clubs

1110
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,733
and I thought we were going to
stand in front of buildings,

1111
01:15:38,832 --> 01:15:42,100
you know, and protect,
you know, businesses.

1112
01:15:42,199 --> 01:15:45,800
And they were passing out
flak jackets, helmets,

1113
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:47,166
M-16s with live ammunition.

1114
01:15:47,265 --> 01:15:51,065
You know, same things we had in Vietnam.

1115
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:55,932
And when I saw that I said...
I said, "I'm not going.

1116
01:15:56,033 --> 01:15:57,199
I'm not going."

1117
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:01,100
I said, "I got family in Washington, D.C."

1118
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,832
And my company commander said,
"Get on the truck, Marine."

1119
01:16:07,632 --> 01:16:09,199
I said, "I'm not going."

1120
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,132
I didn't make sergeant
because I refused to go.

1121
01:16:16,733 --> 01:16:23,166
NARRATOR: Forty-six Americans
died, 2,600 were injured,

1122
01:16:23,265 --> 01:16:25,166
20,000 were arrested.

1123
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,033
Later that same month,

1124
01:16:31,132 --> 01:16:34,065
antiwar students seized several buildings

1125
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:37,699
at Columbia University in Manhattan.

1126
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,733
The occupation lasted a week,

1127
01:16:41,832 --> 01:16:44,800
the first time in American
history that students forced

1128
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:49,100
a major university to shut down.

1129
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,365
Policemen eventually
drove the demonstrators

1130
01:16:52,466 --> 01:16:53,899
out of the buildings

1131
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,800
and sent more than 100
students to the hospital.

1132
01:16:57,899 --> 01:17:02,166
The United States now
appeared to be more divided

1133
01:17:02,265 --> 01:17:05,500
than at any time since the Civil War.

1134
01:17:06,966 --> 01:17:12,000
That spring, protestors also
took to the streets of London,

1135
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,265
Paris...

1136
01:17:14,365 --> 01:17:16,199
Berlin...

1137
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,265
Prague...

1138
01:17:18,365 --> 01:17:20,000
Rio...

1139
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,332
Jakarta.

1140
01:17:22,432 --> 01:17:25,466
The world seemed to be coming apart.

1141
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:32,565
(shouting, sirens wailing)

1142
01:17:42,132 --> 01:17:44,065
(static)

1143
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:52,800
President Johnson's partial bombing halt

1144
01:17:52,899 --> 01:17:55,000
had had the desired effect.

1145
01:17:55,100 --> 01:18:01,432
Hanoi agreed, for the first
time, to talk with Washington.

1146
01:18:01,533 --> 01:18:06,932
Negotiators began meeting at
the Hotel Majestic in Paris.

1147
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:11,033
But the communists had now
adopted a new double policy.

1148
01:18:11,132 --> 01:18:12,565
They called it

1149
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:16,733
"talking while fighting,
fighting while talking."

1150
01:18:16,832 --> 01:18:20,132
MAN: Incoming!

1151
01:18:20,233 --> 01:18:23,865
NARRATOR: On May 5, they
launched another offensive

1152
01:18:23,966 --> 01:18:26,500
that Le Duan hoped would somehow achieve

1153
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,800
what the Tet Offensive had not.

1154
01:18:28,899 --> 01:18:35,100
The enemy hit 119 targets in
what came to be called Mini-Tet.

1155
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:41,365
There was new fighting in
the streets of Saigon.

1156
01:18:45,466 --> 01:18:48,432
Half the city was now leveled.

1157
01:18:57,365 --> 01:19:01,865
But the Viet Cong and the North
Vietnamese Army failed again.

1158
01:19:01,966 --> 01:19:03,966
They were still no closer

1159
01:19:04,065 --> 01:19:06,865
to overthrowing the South
Vietnamese government,

1160
01:19:06,966 --> 01:19:11,632
and they had suffered some
36,000 more casualties.

1161
01:19:15,932 --> 01:19:21,065
For the United States, May of
1968 proved the bloodiest month

1162
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:24,100
of the Vietnam War.

1163
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:29,365
2,416 Americans lost their lives

1164
01:19:29,466 --> 01:19:31,865
in places whose names Americans back home

1165
01:19:31,966 --> 01:19:35,565
would have a hard time remembering:

1166
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:40,100
Dai Do, Phu Lam, Kham Duc,

1167
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:44,565
Cholon, and the Plain of Reeds.

1168
01:19:46,932 --> 01:19:50,666
ROBERT KENNEDY: A total military
victory is not within sight

1169
01:19:50,765 --> 01:19:52,666
and is not around the corner;

1170
01:19:52,765 --> 01:19:56,332
that, in fact, it is
probably beyond our grasp.

1171
01:19:56,432 --> 01:19:58,533
NARRATOR: For a time that spring,

1172
01:19:58,632 --> 01:20:00,765
it looked as if Robert Kennedy might win

1173
01:20:00,865 --> 01:20:04,600
the Democratic nomination for president.

1174
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:09,565
He pledged to bring the war to
an end and seemed to embody

1175
01:20:09,666 --> 01:20:12,300
the hope of bridging the growing gulf

1176
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:15,332
between black and white Americans.

1177
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:17,832
(panicked shouting)

1178
01:20:17,932 --> 01:20:21,300
But in June, after
defeating Eugene McCarthy

1179
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:25,699
in the California primary,
he too was assassinated.

1180
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,265
MAN: Oh, God damn! Why?

1181
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,800
(Jacqueline Schwab performs
"We Shall Overcome")

1182
01:20:43,632 --> 01:20:46,800
CAROL CROCKER: People were
stunned, and people were scared.

1183
01:20:46,899 --> 01:20:53,166
The people we'd looked up to
were being taken away from us.

1184
01:20:57,332 --> 01:21:02,265
It definitely put those of us
who were heading off on our own

1185
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:06,233
on a path that felt uncertain.

1186
01:21:12,966 --> 01:21:14,966
KUSHNER: When Martin Luther
King was assassinated

1187
01:21:15,065 --> 01:21:17,632
and Bobby Kennedy was assassinated,

1188
01:21:17,733 --> 01:21:21,765
they made a big huge deal about that.

1189
01:21:21,865 --> 01:21:27,533
They said that was part of the
struggle of the American people

1190
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:29,399
against their government.

1191
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,500
And that there were riots in the streets.

1192
01:21:32,832 --> 01:21:34,966
And the camp commander actually told us,

1193
01:21:35,065 --> 01:21:37,632
"You can kill ten of us to one of you,

1194
01:21:37,733 --> 01:21:41,733
"but your people will turn against this.

1195
01:21:41,832 --> 01:21:45,966
"And we will be here for ten
years or 20 years or 30 years,

1196
01:21:46,065 --> 01:21:47,332
"as long as it takes.

1197
01:21:47,432 --> 01:21:49,500
"And unless you kill every one of us,

1198
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,132
we're gonna win this war."

1199
01:21:57,132 --> 01:21:58,466
And on July the Fourth,

1200
01:21:58,565 --> 01:22:02,233
we recognized it was July the Fourth.

1201
01:22:02,332 --> 01:22:05,365
And they would not let
us sing patriotic songs.

1202
01:22:05,466 --> 01:22:10,265
But sometimes we would
softly sing at night.

1203
01:22:10,365 --> 01:22:13,899
(voice breaking): And...

1204
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,332
(clears throat)

1205
01:22:15,432 --> 01:22:20,233
we understood that despite
different backgrounds

1206
01:22:20,332 --> 01:22:22,300
and different socioeconomic backgrounds,

1207
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:24,533
different races, different religions,

1208
01:22:24,632 --> 01:22:26,565
that we were Americans.

1209
01:22:29,765 --> 01:22:31,899
("A Whiter Shade of Pale"
by Procol Harum playing)

1210
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,966
NARRATOR: The American people
would be choosing new leadership

1211
01:22:35,065 --> 01:22:38,199
that fall, and everyone seemed to agree,

1212
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,199
a British correspondent wrote,

1213
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:43,832
"that whoever captures the
presidency this November

1214
01:22:43,932 --> 01:22:46,432
"will be obliged to end the conflict

1215
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:49,332
"within a matter of months.

1216
01:22:49,432 --> 01:22:53,132
"How this is to be done or what
concessions are to be made

1217
01:22:53,233 --> 01:22:56,699
is very much a matter of detail."

1218
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,565
Before those details
were finally worked out,

1219
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:04,199
almost seven more years would pass.

1220
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:07,832
And 27,184 more Americans,

1221
01:23:07,932 --> 01:23:12,233
and hundreds of thousands
more Laotians, Cambodians,

1222
01:23:12,332 --> 01:23:17,466
