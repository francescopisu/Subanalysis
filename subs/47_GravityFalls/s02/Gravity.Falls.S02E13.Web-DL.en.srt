2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,685
I just ate a bag of cheese boodles
without using my hands.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,606
Lazy Tuesday, you are
delivering in a big way.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,975
[chuckles] Yeah, it's
nice to finally have a day

5
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:21,979
where nothing interesting
happens whatsoever.

6
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:24,958
[muffled roar]

7
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:26,650
[screaming]

8
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,870
Everyone get down!
Don't let it taste human flesh.

9
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:33,791
- What is it?
- Can we keep it?

10
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,793
Kill it, kill it!

11
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,833
Patience.

12
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:46,637
[growling, screeching]
And... gotcha!

13
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:53,054
Great. Now get it outta here.

14
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:55,153
Smells like if death could barf.

15
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,814
Grunkle Ford, do you
need any help with that?

16
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,099
I've read all about these
creatures in your journal,

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,020
- and I think I know...
- No! I'm sorry, Dipper.

18
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:06,941
On the dark, weird road I travel,
I'm afraid you cannot follow.

19
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,736
Well, call me for dinner.
[beeps]

20
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,617
Maybe next time then?
Or not.

21
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:21,339
- Or never.
- Oh, Dipper, don't take it so hard.

22
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:24,592
No, do take it hard.
Take it hard and serious.

23
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,794
My brother is a
dangerous know-it-all

24
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:28,712
and the stuff he's
messing with is even worse.

25
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:31,048
Do yourself a favor and stay
away from him, you hear me?

26
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,050
But Grunkle Stan, all summer long,

27
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,019
I've wanted to know who the
author of the journal was.

28
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,722
Now the guy lives in our basement,
and I can't even talk to him.

29
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:40,774
Don't worry about
what's on the basement.

30
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,560
- You belong up here with me and Mabel.
- Yeah!

31
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:47,615
Besides, the season finale
of Duck-tective is airing this Friday.

32
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,817
That's all the mystery
you need this week.

33
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:53,570
Come on, quack with us, Dipper.
Quack, quack, quack.

34
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:54,989
[chuckles] Yeah.
Quack, quack, quack.

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,041
[both quacking]

36
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,746
[quacking continues]

37
00:02:02,797 --> 00:02:06,884
Quack, quack, quack!
Why isn't he quacking?

00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:10,199

<b>2x13 - Dungeons, Dungeons,

41
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:49,571
Dear Mom and Dad,

42
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:51,788
we've been in Gravity
Falls for a few months,

43
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:52,906
and so much has happened.

44
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:56,393
Just yesterday, gravity
reversed itself, almost destroyed

45
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:59,829
the universe, and totally
wrecking the whole town.

46
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:03,550
<i>Well, they say it was an earthquake,
but you know what I think?</i>

47
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,669
<i>I think I'm gonna have to start serving
pineapple right-side up cake.</i>

48
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:10,898
<i>[laughs] Am I right?
Am I right?</i>

49
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:13,843
<i>Let the rebuilding of the town begin.</i>

50
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,396
<i>Wrecking ball, start wrecking things.</i>

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,514
<i>[laughs]</i>

52
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,209
But the coolest part of
the summer was

53
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,853
Grunkle Stan's twin brother
came out of this portal thingy.

54
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,522
Now we have two grunkles
for the price of one.

55
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:29,779
<i>And they are adorable together.</i>

56
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:32,612
<i>"We love each other so much!"

57
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:35,615
Mabel, you'll never guess what
I found at the store today.

58
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,533
Dogs. Dogs with hats!

59
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:40,837
No. It's my favorite
fantasy-talking, level-counting,

60
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,790
statistics and graph-paper
involving game of all time:

61
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,676
Dungeons, Dungeons,
and More Dungeons!

62
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,713
- You wanna play it with me?
- Well, I do like unicorns,

63
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:52,632
and that hot elf looks promising.

64
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,717
- How do you play?
- The rules are simple.

65
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,662
First, you roll a 38-sided
die to determine the level

66
00:03:57,663 --> 00:04:00,556
of each player's statistical
analysis power orb.

67
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,609
These orbs relate
directly to the amount of

68
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,611
power quadrants that your
tem has dominion over,

69
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,614
which is inverse to the anti-quadrants
in your quadrant satchel.

70
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:10,817
- And then we ride unicorns?
- Yes! [gasps]

71
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:13,256
And no.

72
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,539
First, we make a graph.

73
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:19,575
[groans]
This is like Homework the Game.

74
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:21,878
Come on, Mabel. I need at
least two people to play.

75
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:27,310
Oh, wow, would you look at that?
Two people!

76
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:30,753
Hey, Soos, up for a little
game of D & D & More D?

77
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:34,590
Sorry, Dipper, I don't go in for
that pen-and-paper kinda stuff.

78
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:35,892
- I'm more of an FCLORP-er.
- A what?

79
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:37,760
FCLORP.

80
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:40,430
Foam & Cardboard Legitimate

81
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:42,515
It is where a passionate

82

bring their dreams to magical reality.

83
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:49,439
- Let yon priestess go, Elf Mage.
- Never, Paladin Radmaster.

84
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,774
Fireball, fireball, fireball.

85
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,577
I'm a fortress.

86
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,696
Well, thanks anyways, Soos.

87
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:59,699
Say, is this that game
that's mostly math and writing

88
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,784
and isn't anything like
the picture on the box?

89
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:04,620
Yes, it is! You wanna
play with me, Grunkle Stan?

90
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:08,675
Ha! Look, kid, I prefer to
do my dice rolling in Vegas.

91
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,677
Besides, only a game designed by nerds

92
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,546
would have "Charisma"
as a fantasy power.

93
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,766
Check this out:
"When facing yon adversaries,

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,804
- shield thyself under an elfan buttress."
- Ha ha, say it again.

95
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,806
Buttress.
[both laughing]

96
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,392
Hey, laugh all you want.

97
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:28,478
You guys just aren't smart
enough to understand it.

98
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,614
[chuckles]
Sorry, dude, but it is kinda nerdy.

99
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,816
Well, I'm off to lay
siege to a goblin fortress.

100
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:35,651
To my grandma's backyard!

101
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,487
[sighs]

102
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:41,842
Oh, nice, you rolled a 17.
[bleats]

103
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,876
And this is sad.

104
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,579
Maybe I should start
obsessing over Wendy again.

105
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,352
[crunching]

106
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:51,718
Hey, give it back.
Come on, Gompers. Let go.

107
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,502
Oh, man, my 38-sided die!

108
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:59,841
[screams]

109
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:15,575
- Dipper, stop!
- Great-uncle Ford.

110
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,361
What did I say about coming down here?

111
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,531
My work is far too dangerous
for a single living soul

112
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:25,752
to spend even one second...
Wait. Is that a 38-sided die

113
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,538
from Dungeons, Dungeons,
And More Dungeons?

114
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,790
Yeah.
You know that game?

115
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:34,460
With pen and paper, shield and sword...

116
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:37,597
<i>[both] ...our quest

117

[laughing]

118
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,802
This is my favorite game
in the whole multi-verse.

119
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,604
I can't believe they still make it.

120
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,807
They do, and I've been looking all day
for someone to play with me.

121
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:51,561
My boy, do you know what this means?

122
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:55,398
We must stop everything
I've been working on at once,

123
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,316
and play!

124
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,164
That's going to leave a mark.

125
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:06,789
Okay, I think we've got
everything we need to watch

126
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:08,905
the season finale of
Duck-tective tomorrow.

127
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:11,600
I even made mouth ramps
so we can pour food

128
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:14,244
into our mouths without taking
our eyes off the screen.

129
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:16,913
[chewing loudly]

130
00:07:16,964 --> 00:07:20,834

out of spare taxidermy parts.

133
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:31,083
- Dipper would love that.
- Yeah, where is the little squirt anyway?

134
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,084
I haven't seen him all afternoon.

135
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:36,266
Alright, you enter the chamber.

136
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:39,069
Princess Unattainabelle beckons you.

137
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:41,154

00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:45,242

Hmm, the old boy looks a bit
different the did back in my day.

Yeah, they change the

Yeesh. Sounds like a good time to
be stuck between dimensions.

156
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:34,040
Great-uncle Ford, I've
been meaning to ask you.

157
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:36,159
Where were you before you
came out of that machine,

158
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,961
and what have you been doing down here?

159
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:39,913
Are you working on something
behind that curtain?

160
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:44,250
Dipper, it's best if you and the family
stay away from that subject.

161
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:47,087
Honestly, I'm not sure any of
you could handle the real answer.

162
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:49,089
- But I could handle it.
- Ah-ah!

163
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:52,175
But I can show you a little something
I brought back with me.

164
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:59,983
- An infinity-sided die.
- Whoa!

165
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:03,069
That's so cool... and impossible.

166
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:05,905
These things are outlawed
in 9,000 dimensions.

167

You wanna know why?
Look at those symbols.

<i>Infinite sides means infinite outcomes.</i>

169
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,199
If I rolled it, anything could happen.
Our faces could melt into jelly.

170
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,034
The world could turn into an egg.

171
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:20,787
Or you could just roll an eight.
Who knows?

172
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:24,124
That's why I have to keep it in
this protective cheap plastic case.

173
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:28,011
Now, back to the game.
You've got Probabilitor on the ropes.

174
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:34,050
<i>[Dipper] Oh, man.</i>

175
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:37,187
<i>Then if I have a Dragon here,
and then a plus-three fire...</i>

176
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:41,808
Dipper, are you gonna go to sleep?
You've been saying dork words for hours.

177
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:44,227
Sorry, Mabel.
I gotta finish this dungeon.

178
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:46,196
It's gonna totally stump
Great-uncle Ford tomorrow.

179
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,231
I can't wait to see
the look on his face!

180
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:52,285
You're, uh, spending a lot of
time with old Fordsie lately, huh?

181
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:55,989
You have no idea.
I knew the author must be cool,

182
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,824
but he's better than I imagined!

183
00:09:57,826 --> 00:09:59,826
And he doesn't make
fun of me all the time,

184
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:03,213
- the way you and Grunkle Stan do.
- Give him time.

185
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,915
Hi-oh!
[chuckles]

186
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,600
Nah, you got me.

187
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:11,838
You got me.

188
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:15,842
Thanks for coming
over to watch tonight's

189
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:17,844
Duck-tective finale, Grenda.

190
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:21,147
Of course. I'm so invested in
the life of these characters.

191
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:25,068
Hey, hey, look at you.
Someone's all dressed up.

192
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:27,687
It's a big night. I think
we all remember where

193
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:30,273
we were when we learned
Duck-tective was shot.

194
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:34,861
[clock strikes]
[gasps] Viewing positions, everyone!

195
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,630
[all gasp]

196
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:40,166
Ahh! Graph paper.
Kill it, kill it!

197
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:43,119
Dipper, could you maybe
move this to another room?

198
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,089
No dice.
We ran out of room in the basement

199
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:49,175
and we're going for a world record.
Now dice!

200
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,960
<i>Thirty-two!</i>

201
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:54,180
- Yes! 7,000 points damage.
- You got me.

202
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:56,182
Ohh! Why with this?

203
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:58,101
Wanna break a record, Ford?

204
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,270
You already got it for
world's nerdiest old man.

205
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:03,189
Hey, at least I'm not all
keyed up to watch a kids' show.

206
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:06,226
I'll have you know that
Duck-tective has a big mystery

207
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:09,229
element, and a lot of humor
that goes over kids' heads.

208
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,066
I don't get a lot of it, but I
like animals in human situation.

209
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:15,068
Grunkle Stan, it
starts in a few minutes.

210
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:19,989
Move that and pay the price.

211
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,242
Oh, what, 50 magical dwarf dollars?

212
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:25,044
Don't mock our fantastical
monetary system!

213
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,046
I'll mock all I want.
It's my TV room.

214
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:28,832
It's my house! You...

215
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:31,885
[sighs] Listen, Stanley,
did it ever occur to you

216
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,254
that if you joined us, you
might actually have fun?

217
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:36,089
What? Now you listen to me.

218
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,224
As long as I live, I will never...

219
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:39,976
- Grunkle Stan, wait!
- ever...

220
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,662
- Stanley!
- play your smarty-pants nerd game.

221
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:44,479
No!

222
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:55,024
Mortals of Dimension
46 Apostrophe Backflash.

223
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:56,965
Kneel before me and...

224
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:01,197
Snivel.

225
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:06,119
I am Probabilitor,
the greatest wizard in all mathology,

226
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,123
- give or take an error of 0.4.
- Uh. Is this normal?

227
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,959
Have you come to send us
on the quest of a lifetime,

228
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,794
because we're the smartest
players you've ever met?

229
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:17,931
You are the smartest
players I've ever met.

230
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:21,100
That's why I'm going to eat your
brains, to gain your intelligence.

231
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:22,185
It's what I do.

232
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:24,971
- It's his thing.
- What?!

233
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:27,140
Seize them!

234
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:30,026
Your math is no match
for my gun, you idiot.

235
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,918
Math ray!

236
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:37,061
I'm not here to play games.

237
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:41,212
<i>Now to the forest for the ultimate game.</i>

238
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:48,649
So the room's free now.

239
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,628
Who wants to watch Duck-tective?
[squeaks]

240
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:55,113
Nobody?
More couch for Grenda.

241
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,334
Oh, no.
That crazy wizard is gonna eat

242
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:02,021
our brother's brain.
We have to stop him!

243
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,824
Maybe let him get a couple of
bites in Ford's brain first.

244
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,859
Even things out, smartness-wise.

245
00:13:06,861 --> 00:13:09,195
- Grunkle Stan!
- All right, all right.

246
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:12,998
I guess if we have no other choice,
we'll go on a... [sighs]

247
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,867
epic wizard quest.

248
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:16,377
[cheering]

249
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,643
Everyone grab a weapon.

250
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:22,925
Nice.

251
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:28,848
We're coming for you, Dipper.
And Great-uncle Ford.

252
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:32,560
And possibly that hot elf,
if he's got anything to do with this.

253
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:37,890
[laughing]

254
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:43,229
With each brain I eat,
I shall increase my enchant-elligence.

255
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,116
If my hands were free,
I'd break every part of your face.

256
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,871
The time has come.
Hot elf, ready the brain-cooking pot.

257
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:54,936
Uh, yes, Probabilitor.

258
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:07,373
[slap]
We must be getting close.

259
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,291
These fairy bites are
getting more frequent.

260
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:11,960
<i>Hey, look, listen.</i>

261
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:16,181
Halt!
You interlopers are trespassing

262
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:18,967
on the ancient forest
of Probabilitor the Wizard.

263
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,219
If ye wish to pass,

264
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,023
first ye must complete
seven unworldly quests,

265
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:27,416
- each more difficult than the last...
- No!

266
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:30,396
Is he... dead?

267
00:14:30,398 --> 00:14:33,232
He's magic, sweetie.
I'm sure he's fine.

268
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:37,777
There's no cops in the forest.
We take this to our graves.

269
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,405
[laughing]

270
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:41,957
- What do we do, what do we do?
- Stop thinking, Dipper.

271
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:45,210
The more wrinkled your brain gets,
the more he'll wanna eat it.

272
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:47,413
And now, a little math problem.

273
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:50,416
When I subtract your
brain from your skull,

274
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:54,420
add salt and divide your family,
what's the remainder?

275
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:56,388
<i>[Mabel] Your butt!</i>

276
00:14:56,423 --> 00:15:00,059
What? My butt isn't part
of this particular equation.

277
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:01,343
[all roaring]

278
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:04,769
Drat! How did you make
it past my one guard?!

279
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:09,318
Very well. There's only one
way your family can save you.

280
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:12,187
<i>You must defeat me</i>

281
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:15,107
in Dungeons, Dungeons,
And More Dungeons,

282
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:17,242
<i>[echoing] real life edition!</i>

283
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,946
[maniacal laughter]

284
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:25,951
- What? Oh, come on.
- I choose my characters versus...

285
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:29,254
[gasping]
yours.

286
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:33,125
Oh, my ears.
They're so pointy.

287
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:36,153
There better be something
protective under this tunic.

288
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:39,264
- Oh, no, there isn't.
- Seriously?

289
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:41,266
Can't we just, like,
arm wrestle or something?

290
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,302
Come on, this game is a lot of fun.

291
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:45,971
I had my mom pack me a lunch.

292
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:48,273
Ew, apple slices?
I'll eat you last.

293
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:51,636
Just make with the rules, ugly.

294
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:54,146
The game is a battle royale.

295
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:57,366
We help our characters by casting spells
determined by rolls of the dice.

296
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,452
<i>If you win, I go back
to my own dimension.</i>

297
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:04,239
But if I win, I eat their brains.

298
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,958
Hey, I'm not sure this is such a good...

299
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:07,326
- Deal!
- Oh, boy.

300
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:10,329
Let the game begin!

301
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,592
Attack!
[war cry]

302
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:21,306
What do we do?
What are our moves?

303
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:23,770
There are no moves.
You make them up.

304
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:27,095
- What? Really?
- Yes. I tried to tell you.

305
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:30,933
<i>This game involves math, but
also risk and imagination.</i>

306
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:33,068
- Risk!
- Imagination?!

307
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:36,680
Grunkle Stan, make something up.
It's just like lying.

308
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,024
I cast... uh...

309
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,025
[groans]

310
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,875
shield of shielding.

311
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:50,002
- Ha! We're doin' it.
- Shield of shielding reversal spell.

312
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:55,090
I cast giggle time bouncy boots.

313
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,546
[laughing]

314
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:00,963
Fat flame-y sword.

315
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:03,131
Super-hot flame-y sword!

316
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:09,104
[gasps]
No!

317
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,356
Drat you. You'll never outrun my...

318
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:17,169
<i>Ogre-nado.
It is what it sounds like!</i>

319
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:24,525
I cast Centaur-taur!
Yah!

320
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,041
[neighs]

321
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:32,127
Mabel, I am so confused
and so proud right now.

322
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,300
[cheering]

323
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:48,609
- Yes!
- Ha ha! Yes!

324
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:58,655
Ha ha ha, yes!
I was saving the worst for last.

325
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:02,209
- Oh, no.
- The Impossi-beast.

326
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:03,660
Hey, I thought they
banned this character.

327
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:06,296
Think again.
I'm playing the controversial

328
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:09,324
1991-1992 edition.

329
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:13,420
- I'll think of some weapons.
- You don't understand.

330
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,172
This is the most powerful
monster in the game.

331
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:17,591
He can only be defeated
by rolling a perfect 38.

332
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:19,226
But the odds of that are...

333
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,595
Hey, long odds are what you want

334
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:23,513
when you're a world-class gambler.

335
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:26,233
All right, Stan, you can do this.

336
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:29,519
Papa needs a new pair of...
twins!

337
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:41,248
- No!!
- Sorry, nerd wizard.

338
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:44,534
All of your smarts are
no match for dumb luck.

339
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:47,055
I cast Death Muffins!

340
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:55,379
<i>[both] Yes!</i>

341
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:58,212
[laughs]

342
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:02,099
The game is, like, over.
Excelsi-whatever.

343
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:05,052
No!
I'm returning to my own realm.

344
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:10,859
<i>I'm turning into pure math.
What are the odds?!</i>

345
00:19:13,394 --> 00:19:15,229
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing.

346
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,064
How did you know that you would win?

347
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,233
Hey, a gambler never
reveals his secrets.

348
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,988
Man, that was fun for ages eight to 80.

349
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,374
Or a million or however
old you guys are.

350
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:31,161
You know, I'm sorry for
making fun of your game, kiddo.

351
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,814
Sure, it might be too
nerdy for me, but it's just

352
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:36,416
the right amount of nerdy
for you and my brother.

353
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:40,003
And if you two wanna hang out
sometimes, I won't get in your way.

354
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,257
Actually, after all that,
I could use a little mindless fun.

355
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,010
Guys, we can watch the second
showing of Duck-tective!

356
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,662
It's not too late.
[squeaks]

357
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:55,477
<i>_</i>

358
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:58,105
<i>I just don't understand who shot you.</i>

359
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,357
<i>The only person clever
enough to defeat Duck-tective</i>

360
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,495
<i>is... [gasps]
Duck-tective. Ugh.</i>

361
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:08,443
_

362
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:10,630
_

363
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,868
He had a twin brother all along?

364
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,037
That's the big twist
we were waiting for?

365
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:20,714
- What a rip-off!
- I predicted that, like, a year ago.

366
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:28,131
- This will be here if you ever need it.
- Really?

367
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,884
Even though I got us into
the whole game-playing mess?

368
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:32,936
Ah, we both got carried away.

369
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:36,273
I guess we'd both gone for
a while without a friend.

370
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,976
Dipper, can I tell you something?

371
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:43,113
You asked me earlier
what I was working on.

372
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:44,898
Well...

373
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:47,067
<i>I dismantled the portal.</i>

374
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:49,203
<i>An inter-dimensional
gateway is too dangerous</i>

375
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:50,988
<i>for the world it feeds into.</i>

376
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,957
That's why I was mad
at Stan for using it.

377
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:55,876
He saved me, but as I feared,

378
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,996
the instability of the
machine created this.

379
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:01,396
<i>An inter-dimensional rift.</i>

380
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,461
<i>I've contained it for now,
but it's incredibly dangerous.</i>

381
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,427
Dipper, I don't want you
to tell anyone about this.

382
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:08,396
Not Stan, not even your sister.

383
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,482
- Do you understand?
- Oh, of course.

384
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,569
In my time, I've made
many powerful enemies.

385
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:17,438
But I trust you with this secret.

386
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,243
Now get yourself to bed.
I have much research to do.

387
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:25,363
- Good night, Great-uncle Ford.
- Good night, Dipper.

388
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,092
Guys, do you ever think
maybe we're doin' this

389
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:43,128
'cause our lives aren't special enough?

390
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,263
That we use fantasy
as an escape to avoid

391
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:46,965
the self-improvement we all need?

392
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:50,209
That maybe we should just go out
and grow with people?

393
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:56,548
- Fortresses can't speak, darling.
- I'm a fortress. [screams]

394
00:21:57,226 --> 00:21:59,194
Does anyone wanna rescue him?

395
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:00,973
- Ah, I'm tired.
- I'm fine. I'm good.

396
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,764
- Well, too bad for him.
- Long day...

397
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:07,265
