Requesting back-up.

Ah! Ah!

175
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,583
Oh! Ah! Oh, no.

176
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:43,020
- [chuckles] Laser Robbie.
- Dudes?

[Mabel clearing throat]

179
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,594
Oh, my stars.
Could it be my little, um...

180
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:53,797
Lolphy! It's me.

181
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:58,988

183
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,808
Gam-gam?

184
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,779
Yeah, neon green is good.
This is a good color for me.

185
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,814
It's fierce... Huh?
What? No!

186
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,684
You can't let them escape!
Stop there!

187
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,586
Gam-gam, how could you?

188
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,821
I ain't no one's Gam-gam, sucka!

189
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,740

<i>- [distorted] No!
- No!</i>

191

Hurry! Back to Soos' birthday.

192
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,730
Okay. I think I've got it.

193
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:32,569
[screaming]

194
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:37,040
- Uhh. Are we back?
- Oh, no! Look!

195
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,610
Mable, the laser place
is a mattress store.

196
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,979
- We went too far in the past.
- Time travel.

197
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:46,917
Man, why you gotta be
so complicated? Huh?!

198
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:49,886
<i>Looks like they overshot
their destination by 10 years.</i>

199
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,689
I don't see them.
You better find those kids!

200
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,591
You'll get your justice, Blendin.

201
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,760
I'm gonna keep stammering
until you find them.

<i>I-I-I-I...</i>

203
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:02,032

- Let's move.

00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,704
<i>Yeah!</i>

205
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Okay, we just got to
go forward 10 years.

206
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,709
We can be back before Soos
even realizes we were gone.

207
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,912
Oh, no! The timey thing.
It's busted.

208
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,049
- Can you fix it?
- Maybe. I'll need some tools.

209
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:22,886
And I think I know where to get some.

210
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:27,808
Let's try to lay low. We don't
want to change the future.

211
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,978
Or cause the future.
I forget how this works exactly.

212
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:33,597
Wow, 10 years in the past.

213
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,016
Everything is samey but also differenty.

My friend thinks you're cute.

- Ow! Hey!

221
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,989
[chuckles] Thank you.

222
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:02,693
I mean you're super
young, so this is weird.

Now you know how she feels, creep.

224
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,898
[chuckles] Yeah, I... Huh.
Wow.

225
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,833
Wow.

<i>Boy: Aw, come on, candy.

Allow me.

You just need to know
a guy on the inside.

Thanks, dawg.
You must be some kind of genius.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,034
All right, I think I've
got this thing working.

239

Dipper, Dipper, look.

240
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:47,938
No way.

241
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,743
Mi precioso, you keep wandering off.

242
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,644
You don't want to be
late for your big day.

243
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,713
Sorry, abuelita.

244
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,949
Big day?
This could be the birthday

245
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,951
where that personal biz went down.

246
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,887
We could finally find out
why Soos hates his birthday.

247
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:05,889
All right, but let's be quick.

248

Who's a handsome birthday boy?

251
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,765
[sing-song] It's you!

252
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,000
[giggles] Soos, you
are such a ladies' man.

253
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,035
They're my cousins, grandma.
Gross.

254
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,605
I got you a race car cake.

255
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,039
Man, I don't know why
Soos hates his birthdays.

256
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,040
This looks great.

257
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,978
Sorry, dude, but could you move seats?

258
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,847
- That's the seat of honor.
- Uh, who's it for?

259
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,784
Oh. Heh.
It's for my dad, actually.

260
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,887
I haven't seen him in, like,
8 years, but he's coming today.

261
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,922
[door bell rings]
That must be him!

00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:49,065
[inhales, exhales] All right,
Soos, today's the big day.

263
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,067
Be cool. Be cool.

Hey, don't sweat it, cuz.
You'll see him next year.

268

Ha. Yeah, next year.

00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,830
I'm gonna go lay down.
You party without me, dudes.

So that's why Soos hates his birthday.

273

It's the day he realized
his dad wasn't coming back.

274
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,777
So how much partying can fix that?

275

Young Robbie.

276

Soos, I made you cookies
shaped like dinosaurs.

280
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,990
I don't want cookies.
I want to see dad again.

281
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:56,194
And he wants to see you.
He's just... busy.

282
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:59,163
- Busy in New Orleans?
- Ay. Yes.

283
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,200
Trust me, you will feel better one day.

284
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:08,039
- Ohh, this is awful.
- We promised Soos a happy birthday,

285
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:09,974
but how can we give him that now?

286
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,043
This goes beyond anything
we know how to fix.

the sooner I can win my time wish.

more time with the kids.

If we defeat Blendin
in that space battle...

302
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,215
Then we can wish

that Soos' dad came
to his 12th birthday.

304
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,786

we can win Globnar?

It's the only chance we have.

Besides, it's for Soos.
He would do the same for us.

Here we are, Blendin.
We surrender.

Careful, they're from the past.

They might have powder
muskets or slap bracelets.

Get ready, kids.
When I get that time wish,

you'll wish you were never born.

336
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:25,209
Or rather, you'll wish you were born,

337
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:27,128
because I'm gonna wish
you were never born!

00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:43,844
[crowd cheers]

344
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:44,962
[buzzer]

345
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:50,101
[roars]

346
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:52,803
[grunting]

347
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:07,051
Yeah!

348
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,924
[roaring]

349
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:21,132
<i>Globnar!</i>

350
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:27,071
Very good.
You have escaped the Cyclocks.

351
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:29,874
Yes!
Blendin for the almost-win!

352
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:34,729
There is only one final
challenge for Globnar.

353
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:37,815
An ancient game, thousands of years old,

354
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,018
chosen for its exemplification
of pure strategy.

355
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:44,822
The ancient art of Laser Tag!

356
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:50,795
The one who touches the
victory orb first will win.

357
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,230
Laser Tag? Seriously?

358
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:55,900
Oh, I know it doesn't
seem that challenging now,

359
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:58,169
but just wait until they
turn on that fog machine.

360
00:17:58,204 --> 00:17:59,837
You'll be done for.

361
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,906
- You just wait until you...
- Machine: Hit.

362
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:03,891
<i>Hit, hit, hit, hit.</i>

363
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:06,110
- Oh, man.
- Mabel, grab the orb!

364
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:07,745
Got it.

365
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,767
It is finished!

366
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:15,986
[burps]

367
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:17,721
[cheering]

368
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:20,057
[buzzer] No!

369
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:22,059
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

370
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:24,995
You have made victory in Globnar.

371
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:26,947
Before I give you your time wish,

372
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:30,868
tell us what fate do
you decide for the loser?

373
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,738
- Oh, jeez.
- Death!

374
00:18:34,774 --> 00:18:37,174
- Mabel.
- Sorry. Got carried away.

375
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,961
So Blendin did try to
wish us out of existence,

376
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:43,747
but it was kind of our
fault for ruining his life.

377
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:46,984
Yeah, and he's kind of too
sad to be a real bad guy.

378
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:48,986
Maybe if we treat him
right in the present,

379
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:50,888
he'll turn out better in the future.

380
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,990
Okay, as long as you keep an eye on him,

381
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:56,026
we'd like to set Blendin
free and restore his position

382
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:57,928
at the time anomaly correction unit.

383
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:01,765
- And give him pretty hair.
- So be it.

384
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:05,803
What? You'd do that for me?

385
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:09,006
I got my job back!
I feel like hugging somebody.

386
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,809
- I can kill you in eight different ways.
- Yes, sir.

387
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:16,831
Now, children, what is it that
you want for your time wish?

388
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:20,117
Thank you, but the wish isn't for us.

389
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:23,187
Not you?
But then who?

390
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:26,857
Who is worthy to receive such power?

391
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:29,860
Dipper? Mabel?

392
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:32,163
Ah, who am I kidding?
I'm not up for this.

393
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:35,099
Heads, I stay.

394
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:37,868
Tails, I go make myself
some dinosaur shaped cookies.

395
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,805
[laughter slows down]

396
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:47,745
Huh. That's unconventional.

397
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:52,116
<i>- Both: Soos!
- Guys!</i>

398
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,752
We're so sorry we
left you hanging, dude.

399
00:19:54,787 --> 00:19:56,854
We got caught up in
this time travel junk.

400
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,155
And there was a time cyclops.

401
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:59,156
And don't forget about the

402
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:00,791
- time race.
- Time race.

403
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,159
But the point is, Soos,

404
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:04,762
we think we know how
to fix your birthday.

405
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:05,996
Whoa. Really?

406
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:09,066
Wait, you guys did all of that for me?

407
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:13,053
And that's not all.
Behold your time wish,

408
00:20:13,105 --> 00:20:17,241
<i>the power to alter time,
paradox-free, in any way you choose.</i>

409
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:19,594
We think the only thing
that can make you happy

410
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,912
- is meeting your dad.
- But the choice is yours.

411
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:24,782
You mean, I can finally see
my dad by touching this thing?

412
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:26,817
And you guys battled
through time and space

413
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:27,985
just to get this for me?

414
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:32,156
What are you waiting for, Soos?

415
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,859
All right. Here goes nothing.

416
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:40,881
[gasps]

417
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:41,882
- Wait, what?
- What the...

418
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:44,134
Bam! Fixed you up.
Enjoy, dudes.

419
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,170
But, Soos,
what about meeting your dad?

420
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:48,272
Well, birthdays are supposed to be spent

421
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:50,074
with the people who care about you.

422
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:51,275
But you know what?

423
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,844
That dude didn't care about
me enough to visit me once,

424
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,247
let alone fight monsters through
time and space like you dudes.

425
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:59,183
<i>I mean, you had a gladiator
fight just to make me happy.</i>

426
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,185
I've been being
ridiculous this whole time.

427
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
Whoever my dad was,
he could take a hike.

428
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:06,857
I know who my family is
now, and it's you dudes.

429
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:09,059
Thanks for giving me
the best birthday ever.

430
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:10,961
Are you kidding me?!

431
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:13,063
Do you have any idea
what you've just wasted?

432
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:15,766
Do you know how many have
died to get a time wish?

433
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,234
The wars that were started?

434
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,802
Oh, that's not all, dudes.

435
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:20,170
I also wished for the
slice of infinite pizza.

436
00:21:20,206 --> 00:21:21,205
Watch.

437
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:25,209
And it can do that for, like, infinity.

438
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,910
[indistinct]

439
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:28,212
Phew! That's a good time wish.

440
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,781
There's still 10 minutes
before Laser Tag closes.

441
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:32,850
- You dudes want to play?
- Yeah.

442
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:34,051
[giggling]

443
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:36,153
<i>Dipper & Mabel: Happy birthday, Soos.</i>

444
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:38,255
Whoa.
Thought I heard an explosion.

445
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,790
Whoa, what's this?

446
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,699
<i>Mystery Shack?</i>

447
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:45,779
That is it!
You are single-handedly

448
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:48,114
the worst handyman
I've ever seen.

449
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:49,999
Uh, hey, excuse me, sir.

450
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:52,919
Hey you, gumdrop, think
you can fix a golf cart?

451
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:55,789
- Well, I don't know if I...
- Boom, you're hired.

452
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,257
<i>One size fits all.</i>

453
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,175
<i>Step right up to the
Mystery Shack, folks.</i>

454
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,776
<i>Step right up.</i>
