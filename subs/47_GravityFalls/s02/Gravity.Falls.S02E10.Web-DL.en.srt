<b>2x10 - "Northwest Mansion Noir"</b>

2
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:08,956
Preston, I must say,

3
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:12,660
the guest list for this year's party
has so much diversity.

4
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:15,796
Yes, a nice mix of
millionaires and billionaires.

5
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:19,717
Put the oyster fork at an angle!
We're not animals, man.

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:23,588
Now where the devil is...
Pacifica!

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,556
What did I tell you about that dress?

8
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,892
The theme is "sea foam green,"
not lake foam green.

9
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:30,011
- Go change!
- But I-I kind of like it.

10
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:33,598
- Mind your mother, Pacifica.
- But... [bell clangs]

11
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,600
Yes, Father.

12
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:36,901
[loud rumbling]

13
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:38,653
[gasping]

14
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:43,608
Oh, no, it's...
happening.

15
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:52,583
Yes, you are my possessions!
Obey me! [yells]

16
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:55,786
This is a disaster.
The party's in just 24 hours.

17
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:59,040
Surely there's someone who could
handle this sort of nonsense.

18
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:02,009
<i>And I think I know just the person.</i>

19
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:08,573

<i>You asked for it, you got it.</i>

22
00:01:24,526 --> 00:01:26,978
<i> An entire 48-hour
marathon of Ghost Harassers.</i>

24
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:33,584
Be strong, bladder.
We're not gonna move till sunset.

25
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,954
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.</i>

26
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,756
- Oh, what?
- It's starting!

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,792
- Turn it up!
- Make room for Grenda. [all grunt]

28
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:44,929
<i>Well tonight's the night, but
I've been out here for days.</i>

29
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,847
<i>The Northwest family's annual</i>

30
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:49,884
<i>high-society shindig
ball soiree is here.</i>

31
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:51,886
<i>And even though common
folk aren't let in,</i>

32
00:01:51,937 --> 00:01:55,606
<i>that won't stop us from camping out
for a peek at the fanciness.</i>

33
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:58,526
<i>[all] Ooh!</i>

34
00:01:58,615 --> 00:02:01,917
Okay, can someone please explain
why people care about this?

35
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:03,869
Um, it's pretty much the
best party of all time.

36
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,622
Rich food, richer boys.

37
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:09,759
They say each gift basket
has a live quail inside.

38
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:12,545
Give me your life, Pacifica.

39
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:16,716
Guys, in case you've already forgotten,
Pacifica Northwest is the worst.

40
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:17,967
[knocking on door]

41
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:20,636
And that's not just jealousy talking.

42
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,555
I'd say that to her face.

43
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:25,608
- I need your help.
- You're the worst.

44
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:26,609
[all gasping]

45
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:28,978
See?
[knocking]

46
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:31,731
Look, you think it's
easy for me to come here?

47
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:33,616
I don't wanna be seen in this hovel.

48
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,818
But there's something
haunting Northwest Manor.

49
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:38,904
If you don't help me,
the party could be ruined.

50
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:40,823
And why should I trust you?

51
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:42,908
All you've ever done is try
to humiliate me and Mabel.

52
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,744
Just name your price, okay?

53
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:45,995
I'll give you anything.

54
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:49,665
Hi, Pacifica. Excuse us.

55
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:51,917
Dipper, don't you see what this means?

56
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,919
If you help Pacifica,
you could get us invites

57
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:56,756
to the greatest party of all time.

58
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,642
What? Mabel, this is
Pacifica we're talking about.

59
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,811
But it's Candy and Grenda's dream.

60
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:04,680
<i>[both] Dream!</i>

61
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,650
[sighs]
Fine. I'll bust your ghost.

62
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:10,736
But, in exchange, I'll need
three tickets to the party.

63
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:14,774
[growls]
You're just lucky I'm desperate.

64
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:18,661
<i>[all] Whoo!
Desperate, desperate, desperate!</i>

65
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,446
Grenda, get the glue gun.
We're making dresses.

66
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:34,844
Welcome to Northwest Manor, dorks.

67
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:36,962
<i>Try not to touch anything.</i>

68
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:39,682
[all exclaiming]

69
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:43,686
Everything's so fancy.
Fancy floors, fancy plants.

70
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,857
- [gasps] Fancy man.
- Yes. Very good, miss.

71
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,809
The rumors were true.

72
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,815
Ah, if it isn't the man of the hour.

73
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:58,651
Hopefully, you can help us
with our little... situation

74
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:01,904
- before the guests arrive in an hour.
- I'll do my best.

75
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:05,991
Splendid. Pacifica, take our
guests to the problem room,

76
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:08,544
and, uh... he's not
wearing that, is he?

77
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:09,912
[teeth squeaking]

78
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:11,497
I'm on it.

79
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,668
Ugh. It's like this
collar is strangling me.

80
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,720
Who do you guys think you're
impressing with this stuff?

81
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:21,841
Um, everyone.
You wouldn't understand.

82
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:24,510
High standards are what make
the Northwest family great.

83
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:26,762
Funny, I thought it was
lying about founding the town.

84
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:28,681
<i>Don't touch that.</i>

85
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,902
Oh, wow, guys, it's the guest list.

86
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:34,603
Whoa!

87
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:38,023
- Check out this hottie.
- Marius von Fundshauser.

88
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:40,025
He's a baron from Austria.

89
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:42,862
Forget the quail. I'm putting
him in my guest basket.

90
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:45,865
Hold up, ladies. I can't
believe I'm gonna say this,

91
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,783
but I think this boy
is out of our league.

92
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,835
Grenda's right.
He's a white whale.

93
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,787
Hunting him will destroy us.

94
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:54,623
There are tons of cute boys coming.

95
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:58,698
Let's swear a sisters' truce
not to waste time on Marius.

96
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,679
<i>Deal.</i>

97
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:01,680
<i>- Deal.
- Deal.</i>

98
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:04,934
[all laughing]

99
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,604
Whoa.

100
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:14,727
<i>[Pacifica] This is the main
room where it's been happening.</i>

101
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:16,863
Yep, this looks like the
kind of room that would be

102
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:18,948
haunted, all right. I
wouldn't be worried, though.

103
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,900
<i>Ghosts fall under a ten-category scale.</i>

104
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:23,819
<i>Falling plates sound
like a category one.</i>

105
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,622
So what? Are you going to bore
him back into the afterlife

106
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:29,725
- by reading from this book?
- Just gotta splash this sucker

107
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,302
with some anointed water,
and he should be

108
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:32,878
out of your
probably-fake blonde hair.

109
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:34,747
What was that about my hair?

110
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,582
Sh. I'm picking something up.

111
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,928
Come on, stupid thing.
There we go.

112
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:53,682
Uh, Pacifica?
[screams]

113
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:04,627
<i>Ancient sins.
Ancient sins.</i>

114
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:09,498
<i>Ancient sins. Ancient sins.</i>

115
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,950
[chanting continues]

116
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:15,621
- Dipper, what is this?
- It's a category ten.

117
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:17,665
[both screaming]

118
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:22,536
<i>Ancient blood and blackened skies. </i>

119
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:25,706
<i>The forest dark shall once more rise.</i>

120
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,758
What do we do, what do we do?

121
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,793
Don't worry. It can't
get worse than this.

122
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:33,783
[gasping]

123
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:47,645
<i>I smell a Northwest.</i>

124
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:52,483
<i>Come out.</i>

125
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:55,536
<i>Come out, wherever you are.</i>

126
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,788
Hurry. Read through
your dumb book already.

127
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,790
I'm looking,
and it's not dumb, okay?

128
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:01,825
This book is gonna save our lives.

129
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:03,544
All right, here we go. Advice.

130
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:04,828
_

131
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:06,747
Oh, seriously?

132
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,502
<i>You shouldn't have come here.</i>

133
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:12,803
This way. Hurry!

134
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:18,509
Welcome, dukes and duchesses.

135
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,762
- Sultans and sportsmen.
- Yo, what up, Presto?

136
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:25,599
And reclusive 102-year-old
mayor of Gravity Falls,

137
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,434
Mayor Befufftlefumpter.

138
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:28,769
[birds cawing]

139
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:30,688
It's okay. They're with me.

140
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:33,524
Tonight, we will enjoy
only the finest of tastes

141
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:35,693
and only the snootiest of laughter.

142
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:37,861
[fawning laughter]

143
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:40,831
- That's the ticket.
- Cheese, chocolate.

144
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:45,452
- Cheese, chocolate.
- Candy, listen to me carefully.

145
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:48,756
You're caught in a sweet-savory loop.
Put the fondue fork down.

146
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,793
I want to, but I can't.
[tapping sound]

147
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:55,879
Introducing Baron
Marius von Fundshauser.

148
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,715
[fanfare plays]

149
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,439
<i>- Guten tag.
- Guten take me now!</i>

150
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:09,810
- Mabel, we had a truce.
- Yes, yes, yes, a truce.

151
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:12,780
Grenda, can you go fetch
us some fancy napkins?

152
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,782
Wow. Okay.

153
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:17,568
Listen, Mabel, I don't know
if I can follow this truce.

154
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:20,454
- He is too adorable.
- Oh. Me, too, Candy.

155
00:08:20,488 --> 00:08:22,740
But what do we do?
He's unattainable.

156
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,492
What if we flirt with him as a team?

157
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:28,495
With our cuteness combined,
one of us might have a chance.

158
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:31,832
It is the perfect plan.
But what about Grenda?

159
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:34,885
I love Grenda, Mabel,
but these boys are fancy.

160
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,588
Her aggressive flirting
style might scare them away.

161
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:40,507
<i>Hey, what's on your shirt?</i>

162
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:42,643
<i>Ha!
Gullible! Loser!</i>

163
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,734
Hurry. Through the garden.

164
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:52,486
Watch out for peacocks.

165
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,491
Come on, come on. I got it.

166
00:08:57,525 --> 00:09:00,494
A haunted painting can only
be trapped in a silver mirror.

167
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:02,446
Look, there's a silver
mirror right there.

168
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:05,699
Wait! Don't go in there!

169
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,368
This room has my parents'
favorite carpet pattern.

170
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,703
They'll lose it if
we track mud in there.

171
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:11,705
What? Are you serious?

172
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:14,708
We'll find another way.
[ghost wailing]

173
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,461
Pacifica, we don't have time
for this. Let me through!

174
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:21,598
- No. My parents will kill me.
- Why are you so afraid of your parents?

175
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:22,883
You wouldn't understand.

176
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,855
[ghost laughing]

177
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:33,503
- What is this place?
- That's weird.

178
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,329
I don't even
know where this room is.

179
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,249
- Hopefully, the ghost doesn't either.
- Yeah. Maybe we're safe.

180
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:45,506
Pacifica! Watch out!
[shrieks]

181
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:47,675
<i>Your fate is sealed!</i>

182
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,595
A silver mirror.

183
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,264
[ghost growling]

184
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:57,518
<i>Prepare to die, Northwest!</i>

185
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:01,634
[grunting]

186
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:05,693
Did you get him?

187
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:10,614
<i>Oh, free me!</i>

188
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:12,700
<i>[both] Yes!</i>

189
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,242
We did it!

190
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:18,622
[clears throat]

191
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:22,292
Can I pay you to pretend
that never happened?

192
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:26,380
Well, Pacifica, you really
found the right man for the job.

193
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,349
We can't thank you enough.

194
00:10:28,383 --> 00:10:32,553
- That's enough.
- He-hey, just holdin' up my end of the deal.

195
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:36,523
Wait. Leaving already?
You're at the world's best party, dummy.

196
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:38,308
[chuckles]
I'd love to stay,

197
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,446
but I've got a category
ten ghost to dispose of.

198
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,648
Ugh.
[chuckles] Category ten.

199
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,567
[both laughing]

200
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:50,788
Call me crazy, but maybe
she's not that bad after all.

201
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:54,491
[ghost laughing]

202
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,493
What are you laughing
about, man? I defeated you.

203
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:58,412
<i>You've been had, boy.</i>

204
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:02,833
<i>- You remind me of me 150 years ago.
- What do you mean?</i>

205
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:05,669
<i>One hundred and fifty
years ago this day,</i>

206
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,507
<i>the Northwests asked us lumber folk
to build them a mansion atop the hill.</i>

207
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:13,343
<i>We were told it would be
a service to the town,</i>

208
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:14,762
<i>that once a year, they would throw</i>

209
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:18,732
<i>a grand party, and all
would share in the bounty.</i>

210
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:23,687
<i>It took years of back-breaking
labor and sacrifice,</i>

211
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:26,440
<i>but when it was time
for the grand party</i>

212
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,326
<i>they promised the
common folk of the town,</i>

213
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,612
<i>they refused to let us in.
[laughing]</i>

214
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:43,674
You promised, Northwest!

215
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,710
<i>With the trees gone,
the mudslides began.</i>

216
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,712
<i>While they partied and laughed,</i>

217
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:51,598
<i>I was swept away by the storm.</i>

218
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:57,387
<i>And so I said with final breath,</i>

219
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:00,441
<i>150 years I'll return from death.</i>

220
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:02,443
<i>And if the gate still closed to town,</i>

221
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:05,562
<i>wealthy blood will stain the ground.</i>

222
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:09,399
<i>A curse passed down until this day.</i>

223
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:12,402
So wait a minute.

224
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:15,372
The Northwests knew
this haunting was coming,

225
00:12:15,406 --> 00:12:16,740
and they tricked me into helping them

226
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,576
to avoid ghostly justice?
I'll be right back.

227
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:22,296
Thank you so much for coming, mayor.

228
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,026
As a sign of our respect,
please take this chimp servant.

229
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,131
- Okay.
- Keep him away from bright lights.

230
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,385
He gets grabby.

231
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,387
<i>[Dipper] Northwests!</i>

232
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,473
You've got some explaining to do.

233
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:35,676
Dipper, you came back.

234
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:38,645
You lied to me!
All of you did.

235
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,315
All you had to do was let
the townsfolk into the party,

236
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:42,683
and you could've broken the curse.

237
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:45,629
But you made me do
your dirty work instead.

238
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,690
Look at who you're talking to, boy.

239
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:52,743
I'm hosting a party for the most
powerful people in the world.

240
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:55,445
You think they'd come here
if they had to rub elbows

241
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:58,365
- with your kind?
- My kind?

242
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,450
I was right about you all along.

243
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:01,752
You're just as bad as your parents.

244
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:06,540
- Another link in the world's worst chain.
- I'm sorry. They made me.

245
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:09,343
I should've told you, but...
[bell clangs]

246
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:14,464
Enjoy the party. It's the
last time you and your kind

247
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:17,351
will ever come.
[chittering]

248
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:19,409
No, no!
Those aren't for him.

249
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,543
Stupid Northwests.

250
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:24,578
Making me do their exorcism for them.

251
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:27,281
Exodus demonus, spookus scarus,

252
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:29,383
- aintafraidus noghostus.
- Dipper.

253
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:33,453
<i>Dipper, please let me get my
vengeance on the Northwests.</i>

254
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,389
<i>You hate them as much as I.</i>

255
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:38,458
Hey, I feel you.
It's just, my sister's in there,

256
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:41,378
and you seem a little unstable, man.

257
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:46,633
<i>Very well, boy.
Then before you banish my soul,</i>

258
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:49,386
<i>may these tired old lumber eyes</i>

259
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:53,307
<i>gaze upon the trees one final time?</i>

260
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:55,526
Uh... I guess.

261
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,628
Go nuts, man.

262
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,479
[evil laughter]

263
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:02,399
What? [screams]

264
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:14,232
<i>Yes! Vengeance!</i>

265
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:16,463
Oh, no. Mabel!

266
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:24,555
Hi. I'm Mabel.
So, Australia, huh?

267
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,673
Do you guys eat
kangaroo meat over there,

268
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:30,727
- or are they strictly pets?
- I am from Austria.

269
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:34,565
- [nervous laughter] Tag, tag.
- I am Candy.

270
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,650
I love the tiny hats you
wear on your shoulders.

271
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:39,403
Hi! If you were a boat,
do you know what kind you'd be?

272
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:41,649
A dreamboat. That's what kind.

273
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,739
- You're tagged out.
- Tagged back in.

274
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:45,622
- You can't do that.
- I can tag myself. It's allowed.

275
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:46,577
[arguing]

276
00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:48,528
<i>[Grenda] Ahem!</i>

277
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,581
What exactly was all that?

278
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:52,749
You were flirting
with Marius without me.

279
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:55,452
We're sorry, Grenda. It's just...

280
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:59,339
Your flirting style can
come off as a bit... intense.

281
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:02,709
Oh, I see.
You think I shouldn't be myself

282
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,262
just because I'm in this
stupid mansion.

283
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,380
I thought you liked my style.

284
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:08,632
We do, but these boys might not.

285
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:11,551
Oh. Then I guess they
wouldn't like this either.

286
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:14,304
- Hey, Marius.
- Yeah?

287
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:18,969
You've got something...
on your shirt.

288
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:22,613
[both gasping]

289
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:25,232
[all huffing]

290
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:31,288
Thank you all for coming.

291
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:34,574
I think we can all say
this party was a rousing success.

292
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:37,244
I guess you could say it
was a slam dunk, Preston.

293
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:38,578
Yes, yes, I guess, sure.

294
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,171
A toast... to our family name.

295
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:44,585
[ghost laughing]
What?!

296
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:49,423
<i>Generations locked away.</i>

297
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:52,509
<i>My revenge shall have its day.</i>

298
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,428
Oh, the Grim Reaper.

299
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,596
I've been wondering
when you would arrive.

300
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:09,095
[ferocious growling]
[screaming]

301
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:18,251
- Preston, what are we going to do?
- Prepare the panic room.

302
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:19,336
[screaming]

303
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:28,679
Please... help me.

304
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:31,515
Whoa!
That is messed up!

305
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:34,913
<i>[laughs]
Just one way to change your fates.</i>

306
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:38,305
<i>A Northwest must open the party gates.</i>

307
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:40,673
A Northwest?
Pacifica!

308
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:45,645
Pacifica. There you are.

309
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:48,365
The ghost is turning everyone to wood,

310
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,650
and he just started
rhyming for some reason.

311
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:52,319
I need your help!

312
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,653
Pacifica?

313
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:55,655
You wanna know why
this room was locked up?

314
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:57,657
This is what I found in here.

315
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:01,661
A painted record of every horrible
thing that my family's ever done.

316
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:04,214
Lying, cheating, and then, there's me.

317
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:07,584
I lied to you just because
I'm too scared to talk back

318
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:12,305
to my stupid parents.
You were right about me.

319
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,959
I am just another link in
the world's worst chain.

320
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:18,645
[sighs] Pacifica, I'm sorry
about what I said earlier,

321
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:20,597
but just because you're
your parents' daughter

322
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,349
doesn't mean
you have to be like them.

323
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,506
It's not too late.

324
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,438
<i>- [ghost] It's too late!
- Oh, no!</i>

325
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:31,653
<i>You are all wood!
[screaming]</i>

326
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:41,266
Dipper, wait!

327
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:46,339
All right, ghost.
Prepare to get...

328
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:47,541
No, wait!

329
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,626
No, no, no, no!

330
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:54,158
No, someone help.
Someone he... !

331
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,625
[gasps]

332
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:59,636
<i>A forest of death, a lesson learned.</i>

333
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:04,308
<i>And now, the Northwest manor will burn!</i>

334
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:09,479
Hey, ugly.
Over here.

335
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,281
You want me to let in the townsfolk?

336
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,700
'Cause I'll do it.
Just change everyone back.

337
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:16,570
<i>You wish to prove yourself?</i>

338
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:20,373
<i>Pull that lever and open
the grand gate to the town.</i>

339
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:23,376
<i>Fulfill your ancestors' promise.</i>

340
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:27,547
Pacifica Elise Northwest,
stop this instant!

341
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:30,300
We can't let the town
see us like this.

342
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:33,637
We have a reputation to uphold.
Now come into the panic room.

343
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:35,422
There's enough mini
sandwiches and oxygen

344
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:37,307
to last you, me, and
a butler for a week.

345
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:40,342
<i>[whispers] We'll eat the butler.</i>

346
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:46,566
You dare disobey us?
[bell clangs]

347
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,358
Dingly, dingly.
Is this bell broken?

348
00:18:55,409 --> 00:19:00,125
Our family name is broken,
and I'm gonna fix it. [gasps]

349
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:04,451
Get it, get it.

350
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,671
[crowd clamoring]

351
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:10,457
<i>Yes, yes, it's happening.</i>

352
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:13,293
<i>My heart, once as hard as oak,</i>

353
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:17,490
<i>now grows soft like more
of a birch or something.</i>

354
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:23,687
[gasps]

355
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:28,275
<i>Pacifica, you are not like
the other Northwests.</i>

356
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:33,446
<i>I feel lumber justice.</i>

357
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,540
Oh, yes! Yeah!

358
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:47,661
Good Lord, the riff-raff.
They're everywhere!

359
00:19:47,712 --> 00:19:50,330
Ooh. Ha ha!

360
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:52,716
That's not how the
fork should be placed.

361
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,419
- Ugh, man, what happened?
- Ahem!

362
00:19:57,588 --> 00:20:00,507
Grenda, we are so sorry.

363
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:03,343
- We shouldn't have left you behind.
- It's okay.

364
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,512
Maybe I do need to work on my flirting.

365
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:08,348
Come on, let's go dunk our
heads into cheese and chocolate.

366
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,433
- Friends.
- Friends.

367
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:13,570
Wait! Don't go.

368
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:16,323
Grenda, was it?
I must speak with you.

369
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:19,359
There's something about you.
I can't get you out of my head.

370
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,744
You're so bold and confident.

371
00:20:20,778 --> 00:20:22,529
I know you're probably out of my league,

372
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,326
but might I give you
mein phone number?

373
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:28,501
I don't have a phone!
Write it on my face!

374
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:30,620
Whoa! Go, Grenda.

375
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:32,756
I guess we shouldn't
have sold her short.

376
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,376
- I call bridesmaid.
- What? I call co-bridesmaids.

377
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:40,380
Man, if your family hates you for this,
they're idiots. This is great.

378
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:42,382
Enjoy it while it lasts.

379
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,551
Next year, I'm sure they're just
gonna lock everyone out again.

380
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:47,643
Hey, guess what we're standing on.

381
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:48,471
[gasps]

382
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:54,780
[laughs]
Take that!

383
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:59,616
But seriously, I'd better go
find someone to clean this up.

384
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,570
Whoo! Scoobiddy doo!
Hornswaggle my goat knees!

385
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:06,406
Well, ho-ho,
what's up, McGucket?

386
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:11,661
Dipper, I been lookin' for you.
I fixed the laptop.

387
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:14,308
I've been doin' calculations,
and I think something

388
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:17,290
terrible is comin'.
The apocalypse. The end times!

389
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,181
[sighs]
You know what, McGucket.

390
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:21,471
How about we talk about
this stuff tomorrow?

391
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:24,257
It's a party.
Let's have some fun for once, huh?

392
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:30,347
<i>Oh, this is bad!</i>

393
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:33,388
Somethin's comin'.
Somethin' big.

394
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:39,439
- Quick, in here, my darling.
- A moment alone at last.

395
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:42,057
You can drop the act, Trigger.

396
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:46,448
They're seeing activity on the machine.

397
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:48,390
- It's go time.
- Roger that.

398
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:50,006
- Where's my phone?
- I don't have it.

399
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:51,988
Yes, you do. It was in your purse.

400
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,670
[chuckles] So I'm just supposed
to hold on everything for you?

401
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:56,783
I asked you and we were in the car!

402
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:58,956
Why do we always have
to fight at parties?

403
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,335
Not even gonna ask.

404
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:06,460
