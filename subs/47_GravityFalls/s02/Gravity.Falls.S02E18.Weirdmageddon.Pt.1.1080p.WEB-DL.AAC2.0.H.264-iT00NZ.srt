00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,607
( maniacal laughter )
Oh, it's happening!

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,676
It's finally,
finally happening.

00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,478
( laughing )

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,547
Physical form?
Don't mind if I do!

6
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,120
Oh! What just happened?

7
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,456
Oh! Oh, man.
This is bad.

8
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,960
This is real bad.

9
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,295
Guys, we've got
a situation.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,668
( all exclaiming )

( laughter )

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,640
All right, listen up,
you one-life-spanned,

13
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,042
three-dimensional,

14
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,676
five-sensed
skin puppets.

15
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,478
For a trillion years,
I've been trapped

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,047
in my own decaying
dimension,

17
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,516
waiting for a new universe
to call my own.

18
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,484
Name's Bill, but you
can call me

19
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,754
your new lord and master
for all eternity.

20
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,692
Now meet the gang of
interdimensional criminals

21
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,995
and nightmares
I call my friends.

22
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,264
8 Ball,
Kryptos,

23
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:08,067
The Being Whose Name
Must Never Be Said.

24
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,835
Ah, what the heck.

25
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,737
It's Zanthar.
Then of course,

26
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,605
there's also Teeth,
Keyhole, Hectorgon,

27
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,241
Amorphous Shape,
Aronica Pacifier and these guys.

28
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,011
This is our town
now, boys.

29
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,683
Now see here,
you unholy triangle fella.

30
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:29,588
As mayor, I strongly urge you
to get on outta here.

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,024
Yeah. Things with
one eye are weird.

32
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,592
We don't like
out-of-towners.

33
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,228
We punch what
we don't understand.

34
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,297
I would just like to say
that as a rich capitalist,

35
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,099
I welcome your
tyrannical rule.

36
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,800
Perhaps I can be
one of your, uh,

37
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,869
horsemen of
the apocalypse.

38
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,472
- Dad!
- Not now, sweetie.
The grownups are talking.

39
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,373
Oh, wow,
that's a great offer.

40
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,808
How about instead,
I shuffle the functions

41
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,677
of every hole
in your face?

42
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,550
( evil laughter )

43
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:03,122
Durland!
My precious Deputy Durland!

44
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:05,724
It's time we do
a little redecorating.

45
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,560
I could really use
a castle of some kind.

46
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,733
And how about some bubbles
of pure madness?

47
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,503
( screaming )

48
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,304
This party never stops.

49
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,307
Time is dead,
and meaning has no meaning.

50
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,176
Existence
is upside down,

51
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,612
and I reign supreme.

52
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:30,082
Welcome, one and all,
to Weirdmageddon.

53
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,019
( shrieking )

54
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,293
So this is how
the world ends.

55
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,728
Not with a bang,
but with a... cuckoo.

56
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,765
- Weirdmageddon.
- ( both screaming )

57
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,036
Move it, stretch!

58
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,205
Hey, we're
scampering here.

59
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,973
The rift is shattered.

60
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,875
Bill's world
is spilling into ours.

61
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,511
Every minute,
his powers grow stronger.

62
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,247
Mabel... the rift must
have cracked inside
her backpack.

63
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,516
She must be in danger.
I have to go find her.

64
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,884
Mabel. Come in, Mabel.

65
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,686
Mabel!

66
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,521
Dipper, listen to me.

67
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:43,755
We can find
your sister soon,

68
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,591
but first, we have
to stop Bill.

69
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,659
If we can blast him back
through the rip he came out of,

70
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,428
we just might
be able to stop him

71
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,930
before his weirdness
spreads across the entire globe.

72
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,866
Are you sure
defeating Bill
is even possible?

73
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,268
No, I'm not sure.

74
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,437
But being a hero
means fighting back

75
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,372
even when it seems
impossible.

76
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:03,408
- Will you follow me?
- To the ends of the earth.

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,744
Good, because
that's where we're heading.

78
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,280
You also might
want to step inside.

79
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,782
Weirdness wave!

80
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,426
Ah! Abuelita,
a tidal wave of madness

81
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,128
just went over us.

82
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,430
Oh, Soos,
such an imagination.

83
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,798
Ah!

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,533
You turned into
a chair!

85
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,302
Why don't you have
a seat and relax?

86
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,471
What about you,
and my friends?

87
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,573
I'll be fine.
You go help the others.

88
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,375
When the universe
is broken,

89
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,744
only one handyman
can fix it.

90
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm coming for you,
friends.

91
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,383
Time for a nap.

92
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,885
Hey!

93
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,654
That's it, goat.

94
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:51,390
It's time I threw you
off this property for good!

95
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,764
On second thought,
I'm gonna run like
a coward now.

96
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,533
( loud bleating )

97
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,439
Freedom, freedom!

98
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,341
Okay, inmates,

99
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,243
it's time to review
your finger paintings.

100
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,646
Good. Nice.

101
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,948
Gideon, does this look like
someone who's ready

102
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,350
to re-enter society?

103
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,619
Gideon's unappreciated
in his time.

104
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,921
Oh, Ghost Eyes,
you're making me blush.

105
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,090
Gideon makes prison
life worth living.

106
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,591
ALL: Gideon, Gideon...

107
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,793
- ( loud rumbling )
- ( all gasping )

108
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,228
( bleating )

109
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,374
( raucous screech )

110
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,976
Oh, my,
Bill came through.

111
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,779
BILL: Ready to cause
some havoc, boys?

112
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,889
Ah, my quantum
destabilizer.

113
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,825
Been waiting a long time
to use this.

114
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,894
We're only gonna have
one chance to take this shot.

115
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,399
Steady. Steady.

116
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,701
And...

117
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,670
( goofy laughter )

118
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:12,904
I'm alive now.

119
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,442
Oh, no!

120
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,381
Well, well, well.

121
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,150
And here I thought today
couldn't get any better.

122
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,490
Great-uncle Ford!

123
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,725
Dipper, take my journals.

124
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,196
Listen. I know of
one other way to defeat Bill.

125
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,831
It's...

126
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,933
Oh, no, Dipper, run!
Get down!

127
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,835
Good old Six Fingers.

128
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,837
I've been waiting
an eternity

129
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,841
- to have a chat
face to face.
- ( yells )

130
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,911
Everyone, this Armageddon
wouldn't be possible

131
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,579
without help from
our friend here.

132
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,381
Give him
a six-fingered hand.

133
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,017
This brainiac is the one
who built the portal

134
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,886
in the first place.

135
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,021
Don't look
so sour, Fordsie.

136
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,689
It's not too late
to join me.

137
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,224
With that extra finger,

138
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,727
you'd fit right in
with my freaks.

139
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,062
I'll die before
I join you.

140
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,864
I know your weakness, Bill.

141
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,900
Oh, yeah?
And I know a riddle.

142
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,602
- Why did the old man
do this?
- This?

143
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,143
Because I needed
a new back scratcher.

144
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,779
( laughter )

145
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,650
That's enough!

146
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,719
Hand over my uncle,
or else!

147
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,289
Now isn't this...

148
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,257
interesting?

149
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,960
My old puppet
is back for an encore.

150
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,895
You think
you can stop me?

151
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,131
Go ahead, Pine Tree,
show me what you got.

152
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,632
I...

153
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,067
Uh...

154
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,936
"I, um, I..."
Do it, kid.

155
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,271
Do some brilliant thing
that takes me down right now.

156
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,106
What do you got,
Pine Tree?

157
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,975
Everyone's waiting.
Do it!

158
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,710
Bill!!

159
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,621
That's right.
Don't be a hero, kid.

160
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,224
This is what happens
to heroes in my world.

161
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,429
No! The journals!

162
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,297
Not much of
a threat now,
are you?

163
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,701
Now can anyone remind me
why we came here?

164
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,803
To get weird!

165
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,539
That's right.
VIP party at the Fearamid.

166
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,441
Oh, and 8 Ball, Teeth,
you've earned a treat.

167
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,042
- Have the kid for a snack.
- Huh?

168
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,081
Hench maniacs,
roll out!

169
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,059
( Bill cackling )

170
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,297
( panting )

171
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,534
So you wanna eat him
or something?

172
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,136
Oh, definitely.
Let's eat him.

173
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,938
( screaming )

174
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,078
<i>We're day three in</i>
<i>this strange cataclysmic event</i>

175
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,147
<i>which some are calling</i>
<i>Weirdmageddon,</i>

176
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,082
<i>or the Odd-pocalypse.</i>

177
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,851
<i>Weather today calls for</i>
<i>black clouds, blood rain,</i>

178
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:15,020
<i>and frequent showers</i>
<i>of eyeball bats</i>

179
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,155
<i>turning people</i>
<i>into stone.</i>

180
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,025
<i>I'm Shondra Jiminez,</i>
<i>and I ate a rat for dinner.</i>

181
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,394
Mabel, it's me.

182
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,062
So far,
I've eluded capture,

183
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,998
but I haven't been able
to find you or Stan anywhere.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,900
I don't know if
you can hear me,

185
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,669
but wherever you are,
whatever happens,

186
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,305
- I'm going to find you.
- ( animal shrieking )

187
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,109
The mall! Maybe they're
hiding in there.

188
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,053
- Oh, no.
- Hey. Hey, you.

189
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,021
Hey, I wanna
talk to you.

190
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,557
I wanna talk to you about
going inside my mouth.

191
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,025
I think you wanna
get in here.

192
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,595
Hey, you! Hey,
I'm talkin' to you!

193
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,630
You don't have to make
a big deal outta this.

194
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,432
Hello. Hello!

195
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,368
Why are you
just ignoring me?

196
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,803
That's seriously rude

197
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,972
to just ignore
someone like that.

198
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,679
Stan! Mabel!

199
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,984
Maybe at least I can
get something to eat.

200
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,786
The last nachos
on Earth.

201
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,990
Help! The nachos
tricked me!

202
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,324
Dipper?

203
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,326
Wendy? Oh, no.

204
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,395
You've been transformed into
some sort of tree monster.

205
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,564
It's just camouflage.

206
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,833
My dad made me and my brothers
do apocalypse training

207
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,401
every year instead of
Christmas.

208
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,470
Guess it's sort of cool
their paranoia paid off.

209
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,907
Nice! Bat meat.
Let me get that for you.

210
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,911
Wendy, I'm so glad
to find you.

211
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,247
I thought everyone
I knew was gone.

212
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,849
Hey, hey, it's okay.

213
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,118
We have each other now.

214
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,920
And Toby Determined,
who I accidentally
mistook for a monster.

215
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,257
This just in:
This arrow in my shoulder.

216
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,259
We shouldn't stay
out in the open
for too long.

217
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,527
Let me show you
my hideout.

218
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,301
We were playing
Truth Or Dare
in the cemetery

219
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,137
when it happened.

220
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,639
The eyeballs froze
Nate, Lee, Tambry
and Thompson.

221
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,541
( cash register jingles )

222
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,044
Robbie almost got away,
but had to pause
to take a selfie.

223
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,478
What about you?

224
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,781
I was in a fight
with Mabel when
it happened.

225
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,716
Uncle Ford asked me
to be his apprentice

226
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,518
after the summer was over.

227
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,687
But that would mean
I wouldn't go back home.

228
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,989
It would mean growing up
without Mabel.

229
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,691
Oh, dude.

230
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,325
Mabel didn't
take it well,

231
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,027
and she ran off
into the forest.

232
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,463
She couldn't even
look me in the eye.

233
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,032
Come on, let's get
some fresh air.

234
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,300
Toby, you watch the camp.

235
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,235
Don't call me Toby
anymore.

236
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,971
Call me Bodacious T.

237
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,740
No one will ever
call you that.

238
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,775
( whining groan )

239
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,914
End of the world.
Man.

240
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,415
Those death metal
album covers

241
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,651
got it shockingly right.

242
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,087
You know, I used to think
I could get out of anything.

243
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,089
But this?
The journals are destroyed,

244
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,590
Ford is captured,

245
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,726
and I can't find
my family anywhere.

246
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,327
Bill said it himself.

247
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,196
There's no room
for heroes out here.

248
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,031
We lost.

249
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,833
Look, dude,
it's not over yet.

250
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,601
You've beaten Bill
twice before.

251
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,369
Why is this time
any different?

252
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,271
'Cause then,
I had Mabel.

253
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,207
Then you need to get
Mabel back.

254
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,375
Look, this summer,
I've seen some amazing things,

255
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,378
but nothing as amazing
as you and your sister.

256
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,047
I don't know if
it's dumb luck,

257
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,849
or yin and yang
or whatever,

258
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,584
but when you two
work together,

259
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,953
there's nothing you two
can't accomplish.

260
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,188
You just need
to make up
and team up,

261
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,757
and save the universe.

262
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,258
But how will
I ever find her?

263
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,359
( loud rumbling )

264
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,199
The shooting star
from Mabel's sweater.

265
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,235
She's in there.
I know it.

266
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,303
Whoa, is that like
twin ESP?

267
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,738
No, we don't have that.

268
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,273
But we do have this thing
where our allergies

269
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,208
totally act up
at the same time.

270
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,610
( sneezes )

271
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,211
Mabel needs us.

272
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,616
How are we gonna get out there
without being caught?

273
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,151
I have an idea.

274
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,592
( dance music plays )

275
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,228
Spin that person,
spin that person.

276
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,863
Spin that person.

277
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,269
( raucous laughter )

278
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,237
Go nuts, guys.

279
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,606
When we're done partying,
I unveil phase two.

280
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,675
Open up.
This is the police.

281
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,277
Time police.

282
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,412
Just play it cool.
Ditch the time punch.

283
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,713
Let me do the talking.

284
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,019
Bill Cipher, you are
in violation

285
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,921
of the rules
of Spacetime,

286
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,823
and possessing the body
of a time officer.

287
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,425
My body is a temple.
How dare you?

288
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,360
Hear this, Cipher.

289
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,429
Ugh, Time Baby.

290
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,998
If your rip in this dimension
continues,

291
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,801
it could destroy
the very fabric of existence.

292
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,971
Surrender now
or face my tantrum.

293
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,539
Oh, no, a tantrum.

294
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,274
Whatever will I do
about that?

295
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,376
How about this?

296
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,449
- ( all gasping )
- Aw, snap!

297
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,852
He just killed
Time Baby.

298
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,287
( all cheering )

299
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,489
Oh, man, this has gone
from bad to worse.

300
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,191
I gotta get out of
Time Dodge.

301
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,696
Boss, the pine tree kid
got away before we could
eat him.

302
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,332
Are you worried he might
try to cause some trouble?

303
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,701
Yeah, trouble with
Mabel's bubble?

304
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,502
Ha! I'm not worried.

305
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,939
I've got someone
on the case.

306
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,312
The abandoned auto mart.

307
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,082
Free cars,
ripe for the hot wiring.

308
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,484
We have found
our ride to Mabel.

309
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,186
Wonder if they
have a tank.

310
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,154
I always wanted
to drive a tank.

311
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,323
I can't believe
this place is
just abandoned.

312
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,659
Oh, an air freshener.

313
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,328
Finally, I'll smell like
a person.

314
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,497
Stealy, stealy. Ah!

315
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,033
Huh, it's gonna take more
than one dart

316
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,269
to keep me...

317
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,438
Oh, no. Tony!

318
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,408
Was it Tony?
I can never
remember his name.

319
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,347
Well, well, looks like
we got ourselves

320
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,782
a pair of
ground walkers.

321
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,417
Ha ha, ground walkers.

322
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,552
Ain't got no wheels.

323
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,421
( raucous laughter )

324
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,390
Listen, discount
auto warriors.

325
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,225
We just wanna make it
to that bubble out east.

326
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,227
We have no quarrel
with you.

327
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,562
Oh, but that's
where you're wrong.

328
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,298
Hands where I can see 'em.

329
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,900
Y'all fellers ain't
goin' nowhere.

330
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,402
Y'all?

331
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,904
Fellers? Wait.
Gideon?

332
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,472
That's Sheriff Gideon.

333
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,374
Under the authority of
Bill Cipher,

334
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,910
I place you two
under arrest.

335
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,880
Hi, Wendy.
Have we formally met?

336
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,918
( both grunting )

337
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,420
Ooh-wee.

338
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,955
Look who the apocalypse
dragged in.

339
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,589
Y'all are in
a 12-piece bucket

340
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,558
of deep fried
trouble now.

341
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,328
Ghost Eyes, spittoon.

342
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,396
It's Gideon.

343
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,464
And he's gotten
folksier.

344
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,599
My old pal Bill
figured you might try

345
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,001
to rescue Mabel,

346
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:13,404
so he appointed me
master of these wastelands,

347
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,673
and keeper of the bubble.

348
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,608
My sweet, precious Mabel's
trapped inside,

349
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,978
and I have the only key
wrapped around my...

350
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,447
well, I wouldn't
call it a neck exactly.

351
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,015
Wrapped around this little
pocket of fat under my head.

352
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,417
Gideon, you have no right
to keep her in there.

353
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,987
Bill explained it to me
nice and simple.

354
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,122
She was always
destined to be mine,

355
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,590
and now that I have her
in a cage,

356
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,624
she'll learn to love me.

357
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,194
I have an eternity to wait.

358
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:40,198
Ghost Eyes, ready to escort
our friends to Bill's dungeon?

359
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,866
No. Hey!

360
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,368
This isn't gonna
work, Gideon.

361
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,036
Oh? And why's that?

362
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,038
Because after I break
Ghost Eyes' arm,

363
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,873
and steal that key
from your neck,

364
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,808
I'm gonna wear your butt
on my foot

365
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,378
- like a rhinestone slipper.
- ( laughter )

366
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,880
And what makes you think
you can do all that?

367
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,616
'Cause I'm a flippin'
Corduroy!

368
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,690
Ghost Eyes,
my hench angel.

369
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,325
( screams )

370
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,360
Get back!

371
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,563
Get back, or I will
drop-kick him, I swear.

372
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,466
You'll never
get away with this,
you hear me?

373
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,969
Guess what?
We already did.

374
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,906
Wendy, you're
the coolest person I know.

375
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,908
I know, dude.
Tell me about it later.

376
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,180
After them!

377
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,116
- You want your baby seat?
- Yes, please.

378
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,654
We are not letting them
get Mabel.

379
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,590
Discount Auto Mart warriors,
roll out!

380
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,501
Okay, all we have to do
is outrace Gideon's henchmen,

381
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,871
unlock the bubble,
save Mabel, save the world.

382
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,940
Quick question:
did you ever get
your driver's license?

383
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,742
Definitely not.
Arm!

384
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,753
I can't let 'em
free Mabel.

385
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,556
Remind me why you're
keeping your girlfriend
in a prison bubble again.

386
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,592
Have we, the prisoners,
become the wardens?

387
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,128
She loves me.
She just doesn't
know it yet.

388
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,964
- Now quit the philosophy.
- Sorry. It was my major.

389
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,303
Ha! Weirdness bubble
blockin' the path.

390
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,605
Ooh-wee!
We got 'em now.

391
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,540
Watch it. Go around
that bubble field.

392
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,243
No way around.
Hold on! We're goin' through.

393
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,644
What's even in there?

394
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,546
( both screaming )

395
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,427
( coughing )
That was horrible.

396
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,063
Here comes another one, dude.
Brace yourself!

397
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,651
( screams )

398
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,852
Wendy, we're
almost there.

399
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,421
We just have
to make that jump.

400
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,324
Total lack of driver's training,
don't fail me now.

401
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,814
So close.

402
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,684
Mabel... I'm...

403
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,586
almost there.

404
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,625
Hey, Dipper.
How's it hangin'?

405
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,827
- Soos!
- Soos?

406
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,163
Handyman of the apocalypse,
at your service.

407
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,365
Soos, how'd you...
where'd you...

408
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,701
I've been wandering
the plains like a desperado,

409
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,069
helping strangers.

410
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,004
I guess there are
some folk songs about me now.

411
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,472
Let me see
what the damage is here.

412
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,741
The good news is,
your arm is okay.

413
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,043
What's the bad news?

414
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,611
Bad news is,
we're surrounded, dudes.

415
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,648
Ooh-wee!

416
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,517
I daresay you almost
had a jump on me

417
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,085
there for a second.

418
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,421
But this ain't
your Gravity Falls anymore.

419
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,922
Out here, I win.

420
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,093
( blows low note )

421
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,830
Bill's hench bats
will be here any minute

422
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,733
to retrieve y'all.
Mabel's mine now!

423
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,571
Is she?

424
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,773
Well, yeah.
I have her trapped.

425
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,175
Ergo, Mabel is mine.

426
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,743
Gideon, listen to me.

427
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,012
If I've learned
anything this summer,

428
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:51,249
it's that you can't
force someone to love you.

429
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,618
The best you can do
is strive to be

430
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,286
someone worthy of loving.

431
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,255
Oh, I'm worthy
of lovin'.

432
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,690
These prisoners love me.

433
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,693
But Mabel doesn't,
because you're selfish.

434
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,629
But you can change.

435
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,730
Bill thinks there's
no heroes in this world,

436
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,633
but if we work together
and fight back,

437
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:09,900
we can defeat him.

438
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,936
You wanna be
Mabel's hero?

439
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,639
Stand up to Bill
and let us save her.

440
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,540
That's crazy.

441
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,142
You know what Bill
would do to me if
that happens?

442
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,878
- You scared of Bill?
- No, I...

443
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
It's a complicated
situation.

444
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,249
Look inside, Gideon.

445
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,751
If all this
is for Mabel,

446
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,120
then ask yourself what Mabel
would want you to do.

447
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,430
Dipper, will you tell her
what I did?

448
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,931
Of course.

449
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,833
I hope you're right
about this.

450
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,336
Guys, new plan.

451
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,305
Bill's minions are gonna
be on us in seconds.

452
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,106
But I'm not gonna let
that dumb triangle

453
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,675
be the warden of me.

454
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,843
Y'all ready for a good,
old-fashioned prison brawl?

455
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,679
We're behind you
for life, brother.

456
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,013
Fighting children
is boring.

457
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,815
Fighting a chaos god
sounds fun.

458
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,185
Let's do this!
Henchmen, roll out!

459
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,860
Whew! And I thought
I was gonna have
to throw down.

460
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,763
Okay. Remember, guys,
this is a prison bubble

461
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,999
designed by Bill.

462
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,935
We've gotta prepare ourselves
for what we find in here.

463
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,537
Whatever it is,
we'll do it together.

464
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,339
- For Mabel.
- For Mabel.

465
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,874
For Mabel.

466
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,723
Anybody wanna
get in my mouth?

467
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,191
I'm a big, hungry monster.

468
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,360
I'm a big, hungry
monster here.

469
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,295
I would really appreciate it
if someone...

470
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:46,130
You, ma'am,
you, ma'am,

471
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,366
- how would you
like to get in--
- ( woman screams )

472
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,134
Anybod... hello!

473
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,736
Hey, sir, sir.

474
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,871
False alarm.
It's just a bird.

475
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,406
Not one person.

476
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:58,142
Not one person
has gotten in my mouth.

477
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,711
I don't care anymore.
I just...

478
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,280
( sighs )
I gotta call my mother.
