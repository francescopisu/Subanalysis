Oh, quit playing dumb IQ.
You knew I'd be back.

14
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:04,036
You think shutting down that portal
can stop what I have planned?

15
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:07,123

Get out of here!
You have no dominion in our world.

No. I can assure you,

if there's an owl in this bag,
he's long dead.

43

- Bill.
- You... You know him?

46
00:02:56,873 --> 00:03:00,009
Know him? He's been
terrorizing us all summer!

47
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:02,127
I have so many questions and theories.

48
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:03,879
Dipper's been pretty paranoid

49
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,048
since Bill turned him
into a living sock puppet.

50
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,217
The important thing is,
we defeated him twice.

51
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,886
Once with kittens,
and once with tickles.

52
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,888
It was a lot more heroic than it sounds.

53
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,941
The fact that you've dealt with Bill
is gravely serious.

54
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:18,060
So how do you know Bill?

55
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:21,280
I have encountered many dark
beings in my time, Dipper.

56
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:23,816
What matters is, his
powers are growing stronger,

57
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,200
and if he pulls off his plans,

58
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:27,953
no one in this family will be safe.

59
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:30,122
Fortunately, there should
be a way to shield us

63
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,248
I always forget the last ingredient.

Ugh.
Unicorn hair.

- That's not, like, rare, is it?
- It's hopeless.

66
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:49,091
Unicorns reside deep
within an enchanted glade,

67
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:50,843
and their hairs can only be obtained

68
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:52,895

Grunkle Ford, can I
please go on this quest?

72
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:02,855
I am literally obsessed with unicorns.
My first word was unicorn,

73
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:05,157
I once made my own unicorn
by taping a traffic cone

74
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:07,443
to a horse's head.

75
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:11,113
Are you even looking at the
sweater I'm wearing right now?

76
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:13,683
Not to mention that I'm probably

77
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:16,251
the most pure-of-heart
person in this room.

78
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:18,170
- That's true. She has a point.
- I can't argue there.

79
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:20,255
So can I go on a
mission to get that hair?

80
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,092
Please, please, please.
I'll give you my blood!

81
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:25,127
Very well, but it won't be easy.

82
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,880
- Take this, and this.
- Ooh.

83
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:29,965
I haven't been in this
dimension for a while.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,051
It's okay to give
children weapons, right?

85
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,752

89

So what are the odds she gets that hair?

90
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:46,982
Unlikely. I've dealt
with unicorns before,

91
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,901
and if I had to describe
them in one word,

92
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,819
it would be "frustrating."

93
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:53,939
- So what are we gonna do about Bill?
- Follow me.

94
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,137

<i>Dipper, come along.</i>

99
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,132
If we can't Bill-proof the shack,

we're gonna have to
do the next best thing.

101
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:25,771
We're gonna have to
Bill-proof our minds.

102
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:27,106
[gasps]

103
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,027
It's nice to finally
be out on a mission.

104
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:35,064
- Just us gals.
- Forget the gal talk.

105
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:38,067
I'm here to meet, touch,
and/or become a unicorn.

106
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:40,986
I hear, if you lick a unicorn's neck,

107
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:44,038
it tastes like your
favorite flavor in the world.

108
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,959
Candy, I will make sure you
lick that unicorn's neck,

109
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,161
because I care about my friends.

110
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:51,797
Honestly, I stopped
believing in unicorns

111
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:53,165
when I was, like, five years old.

112
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,050
I'm just coming along to keep you kids

113
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:57,279
- from walking into a bear trap.
- Stop!

114
00:05:57,314 --> 00:06:00,756

Ugh.

145

And you have done wrong.
Wrong, I say!

I guess I do make fun of Dipper a lot.

147
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:03,184

Hey, Mabel, don't let her get to you.

155
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:31,379
Yeah, I wouldn't trust a
horse that wears makeup.

No, girls, she's right.

157

00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:42,223
Well, today, we're gonna fix it.
From this moment forth,

161
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:43,558
I'm gonna do so many good deeds,

162
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,227
I'll have the purest
heart in Gravity Falls!

That's why he wants this.

171
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,140
I dismantled the portal,
but with this tear,

172
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:17,342
Bill still has a way into our reality.

173
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:21,096
To get his hands on this rift,
he would trick or possess anyone.

174
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:25,233
- So how do we keep Bill out of our minds?
- Well, there's a number of ways.

175
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:27,519
I personally had a metal
plate installed in my head.

176
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,437
[chuckles] Good one.

177
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:32,490
[clanging]
[coughs]

178
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:35,410
But this machine is safer.
It will scan your mind,

179
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,278
bio-electrically
encrypting your thoughts

180
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,332
so Bill can't read them.
Now say hello to your thoughts.

181
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:42,117
<i>Oh, man, I can't believe
I'm with the author.</i>

182
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:45,120
<i>Is my fly down?
# Disco girl, coming through #</i>

<i>Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.</i>

184
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:49,174
You might wanna ignore that last one.

185
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,426
By the way, you never told me
what your history with Bill was.

186
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,461
Dipper, do you trust me?

187
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:56,264
- Well, yeah, but...
- Then you'll trust that that's not important.

188
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:58,383
Now focus. It's time
to strengthen your mind.

189
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,356
All right, Mabel, it's time to
strengthen your heart. [music]

Boom! A 1,000 good deeds.
[cheering]

195
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:31,249
When that unicorn scans my heart,
she's gonna say I'm absolutely,

196
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,502
- 100%, bona fide...
- Not pure of heart.

197
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:38,306
- Boo-ya! Wait, what?
- How is that even possible?

198
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,176
Mabel's a straight-up saint,
you judgmental hoof bag.

199
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,561
Please tell me what I'm doing wrong.

200
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:46,181
Doing good days to make
yourself look better

201
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:48,684
isn't good at all. Not to mention you're

202
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:51,186
crushing, like, ten
dandelions right now.

203
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:53,521
<i>Those are basically children's dreams.

204
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:56,491
I'm sorry, Mabel. It's not
my fault you're a bad person.

205
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,901
[all gasping]

206
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,413
[sobbing]
Mabel, wait. Come back.

207
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,581
Now if you'll excuse
me, I have a 3:00 posing

208
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:06,167
in front of a rainbow.

Come on, Mabel.
Don't beat yourself up over this.

211
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:15,343
Let's forget about getting
that dumb unicorn hair.

212
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:17,545
It's not about the hair anymore, guys.

213
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,380
It's about me.

214
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:21,516
Being kind and sweet is
what makes me who I am.

215
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,302
If I'm not a good person, who am I?

216
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:26,387
I'm not leaving this spot
until I think of a deed

217
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,140
that makes me as good as
Celestabellabethabelle.

218
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:32,193
- But Mabel...
- Just leave me be.

219
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:34,956
Psst.

220
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:38,566
Guys, if you ask me, this
whole thing is a serious load.

221
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:41,236
Mabel's, like, the best
person I've ever met.

222
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:43,238
We tried getting that hair the good way.

223
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,490
Now it's time we try
the Wendy way.

224
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,293
Are you suggesting violence?
Sabotage?

225
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:52,464
- Mabel's not going to like that.
- Mabel doesn't need to know.

226
00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:55,333
Look, it's time we stopped
trying to be so "perfect,"

227
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:57,252
and be who we really are.

228
00:11:57,254 --> 00:12:00,255
We're crazed, angry, sweaty animals!

229
00:12:00,257 --> 00:12:03,174
We're not unicorns.
We're women!

230
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:04,425
And we take what we want!

231
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:07,197
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yes!

232
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:12,100
- [grunts] Too much?
- Here's what we're gonna do.

234
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:20,427
Get me a flagon of your
daintiest honeysuckle, please.

235
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:23,280
I'm gonna need to see some I.D.

236
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:26,550
[all gasp]
The cops! Hit the deck!

237
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:29,587
I'm lookin' for someone who
knows how to take down a unicorn.

238
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,255
No tricks or games.

239
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:33,540
We are human.
We take what we want.

240
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:36,629
- Yeah!
- Fairy dust.

241
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:41,382
A whole magic bag's
enough to put a unicorn out cold,

242
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:45,386
but if I do you a favor,
you gotta do something for me.

243
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,371
Just spill it, half-pint.

244
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:50,486
Butterfly trafficking is illegal
in this part of the forest.

245
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:54,890
But I like butterflies.
They tickle my face, make me laugh.

246
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:57,263
Bring me a bag of
butterflies, and we got a deal.

247
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:10,476
<i>Two bags of fairy dust,
just like we agreed.</i>

248
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,562
Where do you get this stuff?

249
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:15,531
Everyone likes sausage, but no
one likes to know how it's made.

250
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:19,402
- You disgust me.
- You've got your poison, I've got mine.

251
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:22,572
- We made a deal.
- Yeah, well, the deal is off.

252
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:25,458
Freeze! You're under arrest!
Get down, get down.

253
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:28,461
These butterflies aren't mine.
I swear. I've been framed.

254
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:31,547
Tell it to the adorable owl
we've dressed as a judge.

255
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:34,334
My cut.

256
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:35,635
Good deeds, good deeds.

257
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,553
Oh, that's not good enough!

258
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,131
Come on, Mabel, you
can do better than that.

259
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:47,313
Oh, sure, sure. I wish I could travel,

260
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,876
but it's just not
feasible in this economy.

261
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,787
What the hay?

262
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:58,270
<i>Sleep now. Sleep.</i>

263
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:07,195
- No, wait! Stop!
- Mabel, sh!

264
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,615
- You'll wake her up.
- But this is wrong, guys.

265
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,450
But protecting the shack is good.

266
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,622
What?
Doth my eyes deceive me?

267
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:20,626
No way!
You shall never be pure of heart!

268
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:26,465
No, you don't understand.
I just wanna be good like you.

269
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:29,468
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa, you gotta
be kiddin' me. - Huh?</i>

270
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,606
Yo, C-Beth, are you seriously pullin'
this "pure of heart" scam again?

271
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:38,360
- That is messed up, man.
- Wait. Scam?

272
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,479
Kid, unicorns can't see into your heart.

273
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,615
All our dumb horns can do is glow,
point toward the nearest rainbow,

274
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,400
and play rave music.

[rave music playing]

276
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:51,490
Yeah, the whole "pure of heart" racket

277
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:54,326
is just a line we use to
get humans to leave us alone.

278
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:59,247
- Guys, shut up.
- All this time.

279
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,667
All this time, I thought
I was a bad person.

280
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,304
But you're even worse than I am!
[all gasping]

281
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,559
Okay, fine, so you learned our secret.
We're jerks, okay.

282
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,427
We have more hair than
we know what to do with,

283
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:14,347
and we keep it to ourselves
just to tick humans off.

284
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:16,399
What are you gonna
do about it, huh? Huh?

285
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:19,023
What are you gonna do?
Ow.

286
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:20,236

287
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,523
- Whoo! Go, Mabel.
- Join the dark side.

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,660
Fight, fight, fight!

289
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:31,364
Oh. So it's a fight you want.

290
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:33,416
Well, then it's a
fight you're gonna get.

291
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,593
Uh, this is taking forever.

292
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:46,212
How long have I been doing this for?

293
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:49,215
[snoring]

294
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:51,964
Why does he have to be
so mysterious about Bill?

295
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,269
I can handle the truth.

Ford is thinking.</i>

298
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,441
I shouldn't.

299
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:01,611
<i>He won't know.
He's going to tell you eventually.</i>

300
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:04,397
<i>The more you know about Bill,
the more you can help.</i>

301
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:06,449
Man, I am really good at rationalizing.

302
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,200
<i>Yes, you are.
Yes, you are... [echoing]</i>

303
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:14,353
Just a little peek.
What are you hiding about Bill?

304
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,410
[evil laughter]

305
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:21,247
<i>Where are these ideas comin' from?
Who are you working with?</i>

306
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:22,581
<i>My brother's a
dangerous know-it-all.</i>

307
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,583
<i>He would trick or possess anyone.</i>

308
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:27,420
<i>Then it's a deal. From
now until the end of time.</i>

309
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:32,591
<i>- Just plug me into your mind, Stanford.
- Please, call me a friend.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

311
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:39,465
Ford and Bill?
[gasps]

312
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,890
You shouldn't have done that.

313
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,468
Why... Why were you
shaking hands with Bill?

314
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:57,124
You said Bill could possess
anyone so he could get this.

315
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,768
- Aah!
- Careful! Hand me the rift. Now, boy.

316
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,770
Why were you really
scanning my thoughts?

317
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,690
- Are you Bill right now?
- Now just calm down.

318
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:07,776
Pine Tree. Is that what
you were going to call me?

319
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,695
I was gonna say please, kid.

320
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:11,780
Great-uncle Ford told
me to protect the rift.

321
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:14,500
Get one step closer and I'll shoot.

322
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,701
I'll erase you right out of Ford's head.

323
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:19,455
- It's me, Dipper. It's your uncle.
- Trust no one, trust no one.

324
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,187
- Trust...
- Hand it to me!

325
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,718
- Let go of me.
- Now just calm down.

326
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,637
Calm down. Look into my eyes.

327
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:38,390
Look at my pupils.
It's me, Dipper. It's me.

328
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:41,477
[sighs]
I tried to erase your mind.

329
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:45,475
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay, Dipper. Besides,

330
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,783
my mind can't be erased
anyway, remember? [clanging]

331
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,320
If that really was Bill, though,
you would've done great.

332
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,372
I should've been more
like you when I was young.

333
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,492
Dipper, I was a fool
to try to hide all this.

334
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,494
<i>The reason I've been
trying to prepare you</i>

335
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,663
<i>for Bill's tricks is
because Bill tricked me.</i>

336
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,332
It's the biggest regret of my life.

337
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:04,667
Bill wasn't always my enemy, Dipper.

338
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:09,305
I used to think he was my friend,
long, long ago.

339
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,558
<i>I had hit a roadblock in my
investigation of Gravity Falls,</i>

340
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,512
<i>until I found some
mysterious writing in a cave.</i>

341
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,348
<i>Ancient incantations
about a being with answers.</i>

342
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,768
<i>It warned me not to read them,
but I was desperate.</i>

343
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:25,771
<i>I read the inscription
aloud, but nothing happened,</i>

344
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:27,690
<i>until later that afternoon,</i>

345
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:30,359
<i>when I had the most peculiar dream.</i>

346
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,338
Hiya, smart guy. [voice echoing]

347
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,457
Whoa, don't have a heart attack.
You're not 92 yet.

348
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:47,509
[gasps] Who are you?

349
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,678
Name's Bill, and your
name's Stanford Pines,

350
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,430
the man who changed the world.

351
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,128
But I'm getting ahead of ourselves.
Let's relax.

352
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:56,602
Care for a game
of interdimensional chess?

353
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,605
Have a cup of tea. [voice echoing]

354
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,607
<i>He told me he was a muse,</i>

355
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,443
<i>that he chose one brilliant
mind a century to inspire.</i>

356
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:09,565
<i>What a fool I was.
Blinded by his flattery and games.</i>

357
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,567
<i>He became my research assistant.</i>

358
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:13,569
<i>He was free to move
in and out of my mind</i>

359
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:16,322
<i>as he pleased; we were partners.</i>

360
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,745
<i>When he told me that I
could complete my research</i>

361
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:26,582
<i>by building a gateway to other worlds,
I trusted him.</i>

362
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:29,418
<i>He said this was the
way genius happened...</i>

363
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,719
<i>with a little help from a friend.</i>

364
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:34,423
<i>It seemed that I was on the verge
of my greatest achievement.</i>

365
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,478
<i>Until my partner got a glimpse
of Bill's true plans.</i>

366
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,766
Bill, you lied to me!
Where does that portal really lead?

367
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:47,436
[laughs] Looks like Mr. Brainiac
finally got smart.

368
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:49,438
Let's just say that
when that portal finishes

369
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
charging up, your
dimension is gonna learn

370
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:55,192
how to party, right, guys?
[echoing laughter]

371
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:59,242
- No. I'll stop you. I'll shut it down!
- A deal's a deal, sixer.

372
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:02,334
You can't stop the bridge
between our worlds from coming.

373
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,315
But it would be fun to watch you try.
Cute even.

374
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,458
<i>I'd been betrayed.
I shut the portal down,</i>

375
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,677
<i>severing the link between
Bill's world and ours.</i>

376
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,681
<i>I had to hide my instructions so no
one could ever finish Bill's work.</i>

377
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,634
Bill's been waiting for the
gateway to reopen ever since.

378
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:21,637
All he needs to do is get
his hands on this rift.

379
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,555
<i>To Bill, it's just a game.</i>

380
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:27,359
<i>But to us, it would mean
the end of our world.</i>

381
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,399
- Oh, man.
- "Oh, man" indeed.

382
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:38,570
I'm so embarrassed about earlier.
I'm such an idiot.

383
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:40,706
From now on, no more secrets between us.

384
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,659
We're not the first two idiots
to be tricked by Bill, boy,

385
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,745
but if we work together,
we could be the last.

386
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:51,660
But what about Bill?
I broke the machine.

387
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:54,390
Now we have no way to protect the shack.

388
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:59,445
- Did someone say unicorn hair?
- Uh, no, actually.

389
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:01,480
Oh. That would've been perfect.

390
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:02,815
Either way, we got some unicorn hair.

391
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:06,318
Also some unicorn tears,
unicorn eyelashes.

392
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:08,787
They finally gave us this
treasure chest to get rid of us.

393
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:13,492
It can't be!
This is a great day, girls.

394
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:16,103
With this unicorn hair,
we'll be able to completely

395
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:18,664
shield the shack from
Bill's mind-reading tricks.

396
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:22,551
- Is it okay?
- Better than okay. It's perfect.

397
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:27,062
You've protected your family.
You're a good person, Mabel.

398
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:29,391
Thanks, Grunkle Ford,

399
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:32,645
but today I learned that
morality is relative.

400
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:34,346
Money!

401
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:46,692
Perfect.
This will protect us from Bill.

402
00:21:46,694 --> 00:21:49,578
As long as we're inside,
our minds are safe.

403
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:53,866
I guess I can't possess
anyone inside the shack,

404
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:59,538
so I 'll just have to find
my next pawn on the outside.

405
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,164
