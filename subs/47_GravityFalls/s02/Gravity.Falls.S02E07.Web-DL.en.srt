174
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,692
<i>Robed men: Into the
hall of the forgotten.</i>

175
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,694
<i>Into the hall of the forgotten.</i>

176
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,197
Good chanting, boys.
Have you been practicing?

177
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,066
[All gasping]

178
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,834
Meeting adjourned.

179
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,536
<i>- Unsee you later.
- Oh. Unsee you later.</i>

180
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,539
<i>- Unsee you later.
- Unsee you later.</i>

181
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,180
Amazing.
A secret society of evil mind erasers.

182
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,183
I'll bet they erased your
memory a long time ago.

183
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,352
If we could find where your
memories have been hidden,

184
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:51,156
it could be the key to unlocking
all the mysteries of Gravity Falls.

185
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,358
All right, Mabel,
Wendy, you two stay here

186
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,193
<i>and make sure those robe
guys don't come back.</i>

187
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,796
- Whooo! Girls club.
- Soos, you, me, and McGucket

188
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,798
are gonna go find the
hall of the forgotten.

189
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,366
[Sucking sound]
Whoa!

190
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,867
Follow that hat!

191
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,208
[Music]

192
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,407
<i>Robed man: Halt! Is someone there?</i>

193
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,377
Aah! What do we do?
Where do we go?

194
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,491
Man, these are really poorly made.

195
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,159
I could've sworn I heard someone.

196
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,396
Probably just the janitor
kissing that wax settler woman again.

197
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,165
<i>Woof! Remind me to erase
that from my memory.</i>

198
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:38,570
- Whew!
- There it is. Hurry!

199
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,452
<i>All: Whoa!</i>

200
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,789
Honey fogelin', salt
lickin' skullduggery.

201
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,326
Man, you have got to teach me
some of those old-man swear words.

202
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,294
[Sighs]

203
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,729
I just don't get it, Wendy.

204
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,499
I hug a lot, I can burp the alphabet,

205
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,434
I have scratch and sniff clothing.

206
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:13,238
- Why does every boy leave me?
- Pfft, who cares? Boys are the worst.

207
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,439
You shouldn't get hung up, man.

208
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,741
Maybe I come on too strong, you know?

209
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,644
Well, what's your opener?
Pretend I'm a boy.

210
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,480
Mmm, testosterone.
[Spits]

211
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,969
[Loudly] Hi. I'm Mabel!
I'm 12 and own a pig!

212
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:27,405
Wanna get married?!

213
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,422
[Laughs]
Honestly? That was perfect.

214
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,457
You should just forget about guys, man.

215
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,561
Wendy, that's it.
"Forget about guys."

216
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,297
I just need to type "summer
romances" into this thing,

217
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,800
and I won't feel bad about them anymore.

218
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,703
Whoa, hold up, Mabel. We don't
even know what that thing does.

219
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,371
You could accidentally erase, like,

220
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,606
learning to read or breathe or...

221
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:53,411
Or one of those terrible summer songs
you can't get out of your head?

222
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,413
Look at all these tubes.

223
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,816
People must've been getting their
memories erased all over town.

224
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:01,553
Whoa, look at this.

225
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,926
<i>Yes, Robbie, what is
it that you have seen?</i>

226
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,328
<i>So I was attacked by
this magic kung fu guy</i>

227
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,697
<i>that was throwing, like,
balls of fire at me.</i>

228
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,934
<i>- I kicked his butt, though.
- Robbie, speak honestly.</i>

229
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,469
<i>I was saved by a 12-year-old.</i>

230
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,371
Why are they erasing people's memories?
I still don't get it.

231
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,775
Looky, fellers.
It's those words what people call me.

232
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,611
Oh, dude, your memories.
We did it.

233
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,346
Grabby grabby.

234
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,315
[Beeping]

235
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,317
[Chuckles]
I got it!

236
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,390
I don't know, Mabel. Are you
really sure this is a good idea?

237
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,326
All ideas are good ideas.

238
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,595
[Loud beeping]
Do you hear that?

239
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,466
The alarm in my brain
is a-aingin' again. Ah!

240
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,469
Halt! Who's there?

241
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,567
- Oh, no!
- Run.

242
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:55,507
<i>This way!
Get back here!</i>

243
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,543
Oh, you've really tarred
it up now, fiddleford.

244
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,512
This is all your fault.

245
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:04,516
Why does my beard have a bandage?
Does that even make sense?

246
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,684
Why has no one pointed that out?

247
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,756
Okay, I think we're safe.

248
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:15,560
We playing "guess who"?
Dude, I know it's you, Dipper.

249
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,495
Such big, strong hands.

250
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,702
[Chanting]

251
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,071
You shouldn't have come here.

252
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,741
We do not give up our secrets lightly.

253
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:33,678
- Who are you bathrobe-wearing freaks?
- Why are you doing this?

254
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,513
What's with your creepy British accent?

255
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:40,051
Well, I suppose we are going
to erase your minds anyway.

256
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,953
<i>Mabel: Toby Determined?</i>

257
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,089
<i>- Dipper: Bud Gleeful?
- Wendy: That farmer guy?</i>

258
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,325
Creepy dude who married a woodpecker?

259
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,969
You, too? How's that
marriage goin', by the way?

260
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:51,029
Oh, great, great.

261
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,964
[Whispering] Not great.

262
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,400
And you've never met me before.

263
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,336
And if you had, you wouldn't remember.

264
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,904
I am Blind Ivan,

265
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:04,709
and we are
 the Society of the blind eye.

266
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,478
Formed many years ago by our founder...

267
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,515
our founder... does
anyone remember who he was?

268
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,352
We've been usin' that ray on
our own brains an awful lot.

269
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,921
Why would you do all this?
What do you have to gain?

270
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,857
As you have no doubt discovered,

271
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,658
<i>Gravity Falls is a town plagued</i>

272
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,794
<i>with supernatural strangeness.</i>

273
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,763
<i>No one knew how to stop the
things that went bump in the night,</i>

274
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:29,467
so our founder invented
the next best thing...

275
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,469
<i>a way for us to forget.</i>

276
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:35,106
<i>We took it upon ourselves to
help the troubled townsfolk</i>

277
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,443
<i>by erasing the memories of the
strange things they've seen.</i>

278
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,478
<i>Now the people of Gravity Falls</i>

279
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,515
<i>go about their lives ignorant
and happy, thanks to us.</i>

280
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:48,119
And as a perk, we help ourselves
forget things that trouble us.

281
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,521
Everyone has something
they'd rather forget.

282
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:54,559
In fact, your own sister was
about to use that ray on herself.

283
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,526
Isn't that right?

284
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:59,931
- Mabel? Seriously?
- [laughs] Maybe...

285
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,566
Don't you see? This is ruining lives.

286
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,568
What about old man McGucket?

287
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,604
He lives in a hut and talks
to animals, thanks to you.

288
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,705
Don't you feel bad about that?

289
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,841
Mmm, maybe a little.

290
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,844
But not anymore.

291
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,680
<i>You won't be telling anyone
else what you've learned here.</i>

292
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,750
Say good-bye to your summer.

293
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,952
Huh. Guys, if we're
gonna forget everything,

294
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,054
I got some stuff I
wanna get off my chest.

295
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,523
Mabel, for half the summer,
I thought your name was Maple,

296
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,759
like the syrup. 
No one corrected me.

297
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,161
I only love some of my stuffed animals,

298
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,563
and the guilt is killing me!

299
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,667
Sometimes I use big words and I
don't actually know what they mean.

300
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,735
I mean, I'm supposed
to be the smart guy.

301
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,537
If I'm not the smart guy, who am I?

302
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,007
Okay, I'm not actually laid back.
I'm stressed, like, 24/7.

303
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,542
Have you met my family?

304
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,811
[All talking at once]

305
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,982
Oh, stop being a bunch of babies.

306
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,618
Owie!
[All gasping]

307
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,787
<i>All: McGucket?!</i>

308
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,222
I raided the mining display for weapons.

309
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,525
Now fight like a hillbilly, fellers.

310
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,963
Nobody better mess.

311
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,466
They know too much.
Don't let them escape!

312
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,969
Get this song outta your head.

313
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,738
Dysentery's gonna get you, dawg.

314
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,507
I gotta get the memory tube.

315
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,475
Oh, no, you don't.

316
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,110
[Shrieks]

317
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,428
Mabel, catch.

318
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,249
I'll take that, thank you.

319
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,951
Give it up, boy.

320
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:30,174
You're no match for the
unstoppable power of... Ah!

321
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,157
That's right, I don't
wear nothin' under my robe.

322
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,159
Not gonna apologize for that.

323
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,562
Maybe y'all should apologize
for bein' a bunch of prudes.

324
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,696
<i>All: Eww!!</i>

325
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,865
Well, time to erase that forever.

326
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,234
- Give me that tube.
- Never!

327
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,107
That memory belongs to McGucket.

328
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,509
The society's secrets belong to us.

329
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,683
[gun cocks]
End of the line.

330
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,319
By tomorrow, this will
all seem like a bad dream.

331
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:05,289
Say good-bye to your precious memories.

332
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,527
No!!

333
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,198
McGucket, you took a bullet for me.

334
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,701
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

335
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,569
Okay as I'll ever be. 
[Laughs]

336
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,771
What?

337
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:24,242
Why... isn't... this... working?

338
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,844
Hit me with your best shot, baldy.

339
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,547
My mind's been gone for 30-odd years.

340
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,283
You can't break what's already broken.

341
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:35,573
[insane laugh]

342

Say good night, Sally.

Unhand us!

344
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,667
It isn't so fun being tied up, is it?

345
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,836
- Hey, wanna draw on their faces?
- What?

346
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,572
- Tra-la-la...
- Hey, stop that!

347
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,841
That's not funny.

348
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:00,011
- It's pretty funny.
- It's, like, objectively funny.

349
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:04,649
We'll have our revenge.
We'll never forget what you've done.

350
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,985
Oh, I think you just might.
Say cheese.

[All protesting]

352
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,593
Thanks for visiting the museum
for gold miner appreciation night.

353
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,096
Be sure to tip the gold
miner on your way out.

354
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:22,166
I'm sorry, but what's my name?
Where am I?

355
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,669
Oh, might have overdone that one.

356
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,305
Your name is Toot-toot McBumbersnazzle.

357
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:31,342
You're a traveling banjo minstrel,
with a song in your heart

358

and funny tattoos on your head.

359

All right, McGucket.
Are you ready to see your memories?

362
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,022
Find out who you really are?

363
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:48,993
I'm not so sure.
What if I don't like what I see?

364
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,395
We've come all this way. Go on.

<i>Very disturbing.
I would like to forget seeing this.</i>

Aw, hush. You kids helped me get my

memories back, just like you said.

396
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:26,324
But did you want those memories back?

397
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,460
After all these years,
I finally know who I am.

398
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,430
Maybe I messed up in the
past, but now that I seen

399

what happened, I can begin
to put myself together again.

Still don't know what that means.

So, wait, you weren't the
author, but you worked with him.

403
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,841
Do you remember who he was?

404
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,178
It's beginning to come back,
but I need more time.

405
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,314
And reading glasses. Heck!

406
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,516
[Spits]
I got some rememberin' to do.

407
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,785
So, Mabel, you still wanna erase

408
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,455
those failed summer romances?

409
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,263
You know, no one likes
having bad memories,

410
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:09,267
but maybe it's better to remember
the bad things and learn from them

411
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,136
than to go all denial
crazy trying to forget.

412
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,338
That's some mature
junk right there, Mabel.

413
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,407
Yep. Miss mature. 
That's me.

414
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,276

vandalize this picture

Hey, you know what?

418
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:29,553
Going on this big adventure
actually made me get

419
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,290
- that stupid song out of my head.
- Soos: Nice.

420
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:36,260
<i>- # Am I blanchin', girl, we blanchin' #
- Oh, come on!</i>

It's all so familiar.

422
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,499
It's almost like I can remember.

423
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,202
All right, you're getting closer.

424
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,874
Every day, it's getting stronger.

425
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,211
[laughs] Yes! Ah!

426
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,381
I don't care if it's dangerous.

427
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,916
I don't care how long it takes.

428
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:03,087
I'm gonna pull this off, and
no one's gonna get in my way.
