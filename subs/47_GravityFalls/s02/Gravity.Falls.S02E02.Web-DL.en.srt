1
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,607
( groaning )

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,242
What do we do,
Chadley?

3
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,643
I thought
they were dead.

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,245
Far worse,
Trixandra.

5
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,882
They're nearly almost
dead but not quite!

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,520
<i>( screams )</i>

7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,722
Man, these movies
are a lot less scary

8
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,257
when you've actually
fought real zombies.

9
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,291
They're slow.

10
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,260
Just power-walk
away from them.

11
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,762
How much you want
to bet that guy dies first?

12
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,163
( chomping )

13
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,665
<i>Aah! My face</i>
<i>is being eaten a lot.</i>

14
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,169
Chadley ain't
pretty no more.

15
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,303
( phone buzzing )

16
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,905
One second.

17
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,074
Ugh, another text
from Robbie.

18
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,575
Oh, yeah, Robbie.

19
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,578
How's, uh,
how's all that going?

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,713
Ugh, I'm over him.

21
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,281
I just wish
he was over me.

22
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,816
Just look
at these texts.

23
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:51,884
Winky frown?

24
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,185
What does
that even mean?

25
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,720
And you're not...

26
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,756
not like, seeing
any other guys or...

27
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,591
Of course I am.

28
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,759
Meet my new
boyfriend, dude.

29
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,595
Right, right.

30
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,064
So...

31
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,966
So, you know, I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to,

32
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,269
I mean, if--if you
and me would ever,

33
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,971
I mean,
if maybe you...

34
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,576
Hmm, wanted to join me and Mabel
on this mystery hunt tomorrow.

35
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,811
Conspiracy stuff
and all that.

36
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:19,845
That's all.

37
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,080
Yeah, dude.

38
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,581
I love doing junk
with friends.

39
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,749
Yo, Chadley,
watch out!

40
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,917
<i>( screams )</i>

41
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,219
Yeah.
'Cause that's what we are.

42
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,620
It's all we'll ever be...

43
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,027
Friends.

44
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,229
Dude, you're
lying on my bra.

45
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,730
( screaming )

46
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,639
Hey, easy with that.

47
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,940
It's genuine plastic.

48
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,275
And re-pave
the cracks

49
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,943
in the parking lot
while you're at it.

50
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,345
I don't want my car
falling into China.

51
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:30,182
Mr. Pines, what exactly
caused all this damage?

52
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,683
I need to write
a report.

53
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,252
Uh, a big woodpecker.

54
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,421
Keep the change.

55
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,393
I'm winking under
my eye patch.

56
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,661
Works for me.

57
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,365
Now where'd
those kids run off to?

58
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,703
Thank you all
for coming.

59
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,172
Hey, when there's
a mystery,

60
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,141
you can count
on your sister-ee.

61
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,342
That's an amazing rhyme.

62
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,311
"When you want
some good--

63
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,446
When, when
you need a Soos..."

64
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,949
You've-- Oh, gosh.
I don't know.

65
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:07,319
We're here to solve the number
one mystery in Gravity Falls.

66
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,988
Who wrote this journal?

67
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,058
Thirty years ago the author
vanished without a trace,

68
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,993
but according
to this new clue,

69
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,696
we may have found
his secret hiding place.

70
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,133
We find that author, we learn
the answers to everything.

71
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,936
We just need to figure out
a way to get down there...

72
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,370
Chop it down,
dudes.

73
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,438
Wendy.

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,207
Oh, hey.
You came.

75
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,242
Dude,
I'm so stoked about this.

76
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,411
I've been wanting to go
adventuring with you guys.

77
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,446
Sure beats picking up
after my dad at home.

78
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,714
Ow!

79
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,015
Ow!
Ow!

80
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,016
Who put that wall there?

81
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,084
Ow!

82
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,320
Thanks
for the invite, man.

83
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:46,491
Any time you want to--
I'm-- We're always-- Us.

84
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,493
Uh-oh.

85
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,329
Inviting Wendy
on our mission?

86
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,497
Me thinks
there's romance afoot.

87
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,166
No, look Mabel.

88
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,335
I've thought this through,
and I'm over Wendy.

89
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,070
I've looked at it
from every angle,

90
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,471
and that thing
was going nowhere.

91
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,106
I know what matters
to me now,

92
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,175
and it's finding
the author of this journal.

93
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,843
Ha!
You're over Wendy?

94
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,146
Allow me to put
on my skepticles.

95
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,147
Bwoop.

96
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,315
I've moved on, Mabel.

97
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,817
You should, too.

98
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,986
Skepticles.

99
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,454
Hey, is it just me

100
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,389
or does that branch
kind of look like a lever?

101
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,957
DIPPER: Huh.
Yeah.

102
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,792
But how do we
get up there?

103
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,961
Seems like
we'd need, like, a ladder.

104
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,130
Or, like,
ladder shoes?

105
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,865
Yeah, ladder shoes.

106
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,400
I'll get Soos
to draw up a prototype.

107
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,469
( grunting )

108
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,403
Boosh.

109
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,005
Whoa!

110
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,172
Oh, yeah.

111
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,975
in these lumberjack games
when I was a kid.

112
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,443
Guess I kind
of ruled at it.

113
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,312
( trembling )

114
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,313
Whoa, whoa.
What is that?

115
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,314
( screaming )

116
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,416
( grunting )

117
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,350
Whoa.

118
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,952
Hey, hey.
Oh, no!

119
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,296
All right, guys.
This is it.

120
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,166
Remember, whatever happens
down there, we tell no one.

121
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,006
Now, who wants
to go first?

122
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,946
ALL: Whoa.

123
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,181
SOOS: Dude!

124
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,817
WENDY: This is
so stupid cool.

125
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,119
It's like a fallout
shelter or something.

126
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,588
It must have belonged
to the author.

127
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,457
This is going
over my bed.

128
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,858
( chuckling )

129
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,393
My face feels fuzzy.

130
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,028
This is incredible.

131
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,331
It's like he was
preparing for a disaster.

132
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,932
But what
kind of disaster

133
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,435
would need supplies
for over sixty years?

134
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,036
( gasping )

135
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,938
Oh, my gosh.

136
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,473
A Shmez dispenser.

137
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,908
I remember these things.

138
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,309
What's that?

139
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,346
Yes, I will have some
of your old-timey face food.

140
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,413
( chomping )

141
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,415
Ew. Dusty.

142
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,617
( chomping )

143
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,186
Wait, guys.

144
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,388
I think this can
was opened recently.

145
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,291
The author might
still be alive, down here.

146
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,525
Wait a minute.

147
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,068
I think I know where
he might have gone.

148
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,203
TOGETHER: Whoa.

149
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,440
Whoa!

150
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,642
Oh, man.

151
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,078
Was this place built
in the past or the future.

152
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,214
Yeah.
This room is way creepy.

153
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,483
Not as creepy as Dipper's
Internet history.

154
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,384
Hey-oh!

155
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,456
( groaning )

156
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,993
What's going on, dudes?

157
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,162
( screaming )

158
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,367
It's hard to be scared
with caterpillars on your face.

159
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,338
Wall things.

160
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,273
Crazy wall things
happening right now.

161
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,175
Ugh.
It won't stop.

162
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,510
( grunting )

163
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,345
Dipper, what do we do?

164
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:54,579
Uh. Uh.

165
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,181
Come on, come on.

166
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,551
Find these four symbols.
Quick.

167
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,719
Everybody step on one.

168
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,021
One!

169
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,390
Two!

170
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,491
Three!

171
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,361
( panting )

172
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,429
Four!

173
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,201
Run for it!

174
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,072
( laughing and cheering )

175
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,574
Yes! Yes!

176
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,476
That was...

177
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,211
That was nuts.

178
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,712
You ruled
back there, man.

179
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,247
Thanks.

180
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,516
Get a load of this
crazy surveillance room.

181
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,517
Check it out, dudes.

182
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,186
( blubbering )

183
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,654
Soos.
Soos.

184
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,322
That is hilarious.

185
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,324
Hey, Bro,
you forgot your vest.

186
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,325
( humming )

187
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,359
( grunting )

188
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,461
What the--

189
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,697
"Dear Wendy.

190
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,532
I've always had
a crush on--"

191
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,034
( gasping )

192
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,368
Oh, my gosh.

193
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,503
Hey, Dipper!

194
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,605
Look what I found.

195
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,706
( gasping )

196
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,074
What are you--
Give me that.

197
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,409
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew it!

198
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,377
You're not over
Wendy at all.

199
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,545
( gasping )

200
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,347
And you were going
to tell her today?

201
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,216
No.
I changed my mind.

202
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,451
It's a bad idea,
I'd just embarrass myself,

203
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,320
and then I'd be another guy
she hates, like Robbie.

204
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,455
Dipper, you should
just tell her already.

205
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,291
One way or another,
you'll feel better afterwards.

206
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,461
Look, Mabel, I can't tell her
no matter how much I want to.

207
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,562
So just drop it, okay.

208
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,264
Dude.

209
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,399
Dipper, you got to check out
this weird metal closet.

210
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,469
I am a robot.
I have a metal closet.

211
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,470
Coming.

212
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,138
This never happened.

213
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,342
<i>He wants to tell her</i>
<i>but he's scared.</i>

214
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,444
<i>Maybe he needs</i>
<i>a little push.</i>

215
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,480
<i>Good idea, Mabel.</i>
<i>Thanks, Mabel.</i>

216
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,216
Brother,
whatever happens,

217
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,485
I just want you
to know something.

218
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,087
This is
for your own good.

219
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,455
What?
Aah.

220
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,057
What the--

221
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,459
Mabel!
Let us out!

222
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,127
Oh, I'll let you out,
Dipper.

223
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,529
As soon as
you tell Wendy

224
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,697
that thing you've been
wanting to tell her!

225
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,499
You'll thank me
for this later.

226
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,433
What is she
talking about?

227
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,035
Nothing.

228
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,237
Mabel's just been eating
raw sugar packets again.

229
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,739
( chomping )

230
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,374
That's besides the point.

231
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,242
Let me out right now!

232
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,545
Ugh,
where are the lights?

233
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,179
( screaming )

234
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,149
( grunting )

235
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,319
( beeping )

236
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,659
Whoa.

237
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,327
A hidden lab.

238
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,696
Maybe the author did
experiments down here.

239
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,334
Uh, what do you think
dug all these tunnels?

240
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,368
Let's hope
we don't find out.

241
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,369
( gasping )

242
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,339
( growling )

243
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,308
( screaming )

244
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,542
Mabel!
Open up for real!

245
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,477
There's a monster in here!

246
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:43,381
The only monsters are
your own inner demons, Dipper.

247
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,183
That is so wise.

248
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,484
Dipper.

249
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,286
Just say whatever
Mabel wants you to say

250
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,421
so she'll let us
out of here.

251
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,624
Come on, Dipper.
Now is the time, Bro!

252
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,227
Wendy, I-- I...

253
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,497
I'm gonna find
another way out.

254
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,565
Wait, what?

255
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,867
Dude,
where are we going?

256
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,672
( panting )

257
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,740
Whoa.

258
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,178
What do we do?
I don't know.

259
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,748
( roaring )

260
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,485
Back!

261
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,654
Back, you heinous beast!

262
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,263
Well, I just ripped out
a monster's tongue.

263
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,732
( gasping )

264
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,766
It's you.

265
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,267
Hurry now.

266
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,404
I scared it off,
but it will regenerate.

267
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,406
I wasn't
expecting guests.

268
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,808
I've been down here
for a very long time.

269
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,877
Years.
Weeks maybe.

270
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,479
I miss orange juice.

271
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,780
You don't understand.

272
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,281
You're the guy
I've been looking for!

273
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,349
He's the guy?

274
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,417
Wendy,
it's the guy!

275
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,585
The guy?

276
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,687
I've got, like,
a jillion questions.

277
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,355
Why did you write
the journals?

278
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,591
Who was after you?
Why did you build this bunker?

279
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,661
My boy, I'd love
to discuss this in time.

280
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,496
But we have more
pressing matters.

281
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,897
It's one
of my experiments.

282
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,465
A shapeshifter.

283
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,768
Able to take the form
of anyone or anything it sees.

284
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,271
It broke free
from a cage of solid steel.

285
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,908
I've gone half-crazy trying
to catch the creature alone.

286
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,210
But now you're here.

287
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,812
Will you help me catch it?

288
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,781
( gasping )

289
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,617
Sure are taking
their time in there.

290
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,553
Hey, do I look smarter
with this coat and briefcase?

291
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,355
I feel like
I look smarter.

292
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,356
( gasping )

293
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,424
Razzle dazzle!

294
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,225
Look at this tubey thing.

295
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,728
Frozen.

296
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,862
Unfrozen.

297
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,930
Frozen.

298
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,198
Unfrozen.

299
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,533
What's this biz?

300
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,436
"Experiment number two-ten:
The Shapeshifter."

301
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,670
Shapeshifter?

302
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,505
Uh, dude,
didn't Dipper say

303
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,574
there was a monster
in there with them?

304
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,376
I thought
he was just joking.

305
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,778
You know, Dipper's
jokes are terrible!

306
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,879
Dipper!

307
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,316
Come in.
Come in.

308
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,784
I apologize
for the state of things.

309
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:03,321
I don't get many
non-mole people visitors.

310
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,391
Now the beast must have some
weakness that we can exploit.

311
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,625
I used to have
my research on him,

312
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,895
but alas, I lost my journals
so many years ago.

313
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,363
Did you say journals?

314
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,465
Dude, I found
one of them.

315
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:14,833
It's how I tracked
you down here.

316
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,902
What?
Could it be?

317
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,473
My boy, I can't
express my gratitude.

318
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,241
Oh, yes.

319
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,643
After all these years.

320
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,480
( panting )

321
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:29,447
Wendy!

322
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,949
Oh, it's so dark.

323
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,517
How will we
ever find them?

324
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,885
Leave that to Mabel.

325
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,522
Whoa!
Rad!

326
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,990
Although,
isn't electric clothing

327
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,525
kind of like
a fire hazard?

328
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,526
No.

329
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,594
It's a fun hazard.

330
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,529
Now let me light the way!

331
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,765
We're coming
for you dudes.

332
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,835
Yes, yes.

333
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,437
It's all here.

334
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,872
Wendy,
isn't it amazing

335
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,440
we're actually meeting
the real author?

336
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,841
( gasping )

337
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,476
Dipper.
Look.

338
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,416
Uh, you know what?

339
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,485
We should probably
get going.

340
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,420
Can I have my
journal back?

341
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,527
You're not
going anywhere.

342
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,398
( roaring )

343
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,834
( screaming )

344
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,706
How do you like
my true form?

345
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,442
Go on, admit it,
you like it.

346
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,544
You!

347
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,678
What did you do
to the real author?

348
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,380
You'll likely
never find him.

349
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,683
That six-fingered nerd hasn't
been himself in thirty years.

350
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,052
But I do thank you
for bringing me his journal.

351
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,488
He used to write while
I was in my cage.

352
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,357
So many wonderful
forms to take.

353
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,425
( slurping )

354
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,627
( chuckling )

355
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,931
We've got to get
that journal back.

356
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,500
Hey, body-snatcher.
Snatch this.

357
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,469
( growling )

358
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,139
( grunting )

359
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,574
( groaning )

360
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,109
Run! Run! Run!

361
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,949
( screeching )

362
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,488
( screaming )

363
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,690
( panting )

364
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,726
( grunting )

365
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,901
( panting )

366
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,604
( groaning )

367
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,472
Oh, dudes.
Dipper! Wendy!

368
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,573
Mabel! Soos!

369
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,408
Wait. Careful.

370
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,411
How do we know they're
not the shapeshifter?

371
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,448
Maybe I am.
Mabel, inspect my shape.

372
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,482
Poke.

373
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,683
( chuckling )

374
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,051
Do that again.
Poke.

375
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,553
( laughing )

376
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,621
Even better
the second time.

377
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,055
It's definitely them.

378
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,490
( gasping )

379
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,691
Oh, my gosh, Wendy,
you're bleeding.

380
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,460
It's cool.
It's cool.

381
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,461
It's just blood, man.

382
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,395
Don't freak out.

383
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,696
What happened?

384
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,098
We got attacked
by the shapeshifter.

385
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,634
He broke out of his cage,
pretended to the author,

386
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,935
and wants
Dipper's journal.

387
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,871
Imagine if he escapes
into town.

388
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,673
He could transform
into anything.

389
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,075
We could never trust
anyone ever again.

390
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,110
What do we do?

391
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,444
Well.

392
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,979
He took us into his home,
tricked us,

393
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,582
and tried
to destroy us.

394
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,584
I say we return
the favor.

395
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,088
Dipper, my boy.

396
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,725
Come out.

397
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,727
I must speak with you!

398
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,462
( growling )

399
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:35,433
Reveal yourself, you
single-formed human weakling.

400
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,935
Oh, boy, Dipper.

401
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,505
That book sure is full
of some great monsters.

402
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,606
There you are.

403
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,875
Ooh!
And a new one.

404
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,813
Should I be one?

405
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,214
Or the other.

406
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,582
How about both?

407
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,718
( roaring )

408
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,653
( screaming )

409
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,759
Guys, he's coming!
He's coming!

410
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,761
Now! Now!
Now! Now! Now!

411
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,996
It's not working,
dude.

412
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,467
Hey.
Let go.

413
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,601
You leave him alone.

414
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,636
( screaming )

415
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,804
Wendy!

416
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,873
( grunting )

417
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,978
( screaming )

418
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,781
( screaming )

419
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:24,949
( yelling )

420
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,785
Aah.

421
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,494
( groaning )

422
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,165
Wendy!

423
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,840
Wendy?

424
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,842
No, no, no, no, no!

425
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,076
Can you hear me?
Oh.

426
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,244
Please be okay.
Please be okay!

427
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,749
( gasping )

428
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,217
Oh, no, oh, no!
This is all my fault!

429
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,119
If I had told you when
we were in the closet

430
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,720
we wouldn't be
in this mess.

431
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,590
But I was too scared and now
you could be hurt or worse

432
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,191
and I never even got
a chance to tell you

433
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,528
I'm, like, in love
with you Wendy.

434
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,796
( sighing )

435
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,701
Uh...

436
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,536
Dipper?

437
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,271
Wendy?

438
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,572
Wait.

439
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,875
Then who is--
Look out!

440
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,309
Give me back
that journal!

441
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,811
Never!

442
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,548
Get off me.

443
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,316
( grunting )

444
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,555
Give it back.

445
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,956
It belongs to Dipper.

446
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,091
Hit her with the axe!

447
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,325
Don't listen
to her, Dipper!

448
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,293
She's the shapeshifter!

449
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,561
Ugh!

450
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,196
I don't know who's who!

451
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,297
Give me a sign!

452
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,736
( gasping )

453
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,604
( grunting )

454
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,140
( screaming )

455
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:59,110
( snarling )

456
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,681
Push him in!

457
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,583
( grunting )

458
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,320
Huh?

459
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,355
Frozen!

460
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,590
Boosh!
Boom!

461
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:18,129
No. No!
Let me out!

462
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,198
( screeching )

463
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,368
Let's get out
of here, dudes.

464
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,371
( laughing )

465
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,840
( gasping )

466
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,676
You think you're so clever,
don't you, Dipper?

467
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,112
But you have no idea
what you're up against.

468
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,347
You'll never
find the author.

469
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,084
you'll meet a fate worse
than you can imagine.

470
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:43,688
And this will be
the last form you ever take!

471
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,324
( screaming )

472
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,030
Good luck
sleeping tonight.

473
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,703
Dude, I think
I'm kind of

474
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,171
adventured out
for a little while.

475
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:03,207
My face hurts
from doing this all day.

476
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,811
Yeah, but you got to admit
we're all total heroes.

477
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,413
Hey, who wants to go get
some heroes breakfast, huh?

478
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,282
Syrup on cereal!

479
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,351
Mabel,
you're a visionary.

480
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,356
Look, Wendy,
about earlier,

481
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,724
In the heat
of the moment

482
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,193
I might have said
some dumb things and--

483
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,996
Can't we just pretend
none of that ever happened?

484
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,131
Please.

485
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,400
Dude. Dude.
It's okay.

486
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,236
I always kind of knew.

487
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,804
Wait.
You did?

488
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,206
Yeah, man.

489
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,807
I mean, you think
I can't hear that stuff

490
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,943
you're constantly
whispering under your breath?

491
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,344
( groaning )

492
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,079
Oh, man.

493
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,247
Listen, Dipper.

494
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:46,050
I'm, like,
super flattered.

495
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,753
But, I'm too old for you.

496
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,688
I mean, you know
that, right?

497
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,123
Ugh.

498
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,759
Mabel said confessing
would make me feel better.

499
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,294
Well, how do you feel?

500
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:00,431
Anxious. Scared.
Kind of itchy.

501
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,899
Dude.

502
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,234
Don't be itchy, man.

503
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:07,371
this summer was super
boring until you showed up.

504
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,741
I have more fun with you than,
like, practically anybody else.

505
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,312
And if you ever stop being
my friend, I would, like,

506
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,981
throw myself
into the bottomless pit.

507
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,317
So, things won't
be too awkward now?

508
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,319
I just wrestled
myself, dude.

509
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,087
That was awkward.

510
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,388
If you can handle
that monster,

511
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,424
you can handle
a little awkwardness.

512
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,392
( chuckling )

513
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,460
Friends?

514
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,761
Yeah, dude.
Friends.

515
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:31,762
( grunting )

516
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,364
( chuckling )

517
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,302
Oh, and hey, Dipper.

518
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,137
See you for movie
night tomorrow.

519
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,739
Your place
this time, okay?

520
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,515
So, how did it go?

521
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,817
( gasping )

522
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,951
What did you hear?

523
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,786
Everything.
All the time.

524
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,089
I'm not here.

525
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,491
Mabel, how can everything
be so amazing

526
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:03,394
and so terrible
all at the same time?

527
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,030
I'm sorry for being
so pushy, Dipper.

528
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,265
If it's any consolation,

529
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,366
I'm already
working on a list

530
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,468
of your potential
rebound crushes.

531
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,003
Thanks, Mabel.

532
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,405
( grunting )

533
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,940
I'm still bummed

534
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,508
we're no closer
to finding the author guy.

535
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,911
At least I got his sciency coat
and briefcase.

536
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,446
Whoa.
What the--

537
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,182
Soos, that's not a briefcase.
That's a laptop.

538
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,285
And a really
busted up one, too.

539
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,287
I bet I could get this thing
fixed up in a few days.

540
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,122
It's gonna take
a lot of duct tape.

541
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,490
This could be
our next clue.

542
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,995
Is it just me,

543
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,797
or does Gravity Falls TV
only have the worst movies?

544
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,967
<i>You're watching the Gravity</i>
<i>Falls Bargain Movie Showcase.</i>

545
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,335
<i>Coming up next,</i>

546
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,904
The Widdlest Wampire.

547
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,573
The Planet People
Of Planet Planet!

548
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,176
Help!
My Mummy's A Werewolf!

549
