Only way to salvation

5
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:20,152
Any object with more than

That's it. That's probably

Oh, sorry.
Touchy subject.

13

Anyways, it's been fun
turning Gravity Falls

inside out, rounding up
all its terrified citizens

All right, boys,
to the corners of the earth.

25
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,376
Set the world aflame

Ah, global domination.

00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,416

Okay, guys, Bill has
taken over the town,

and if
this weirdness spreads,

36
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,564
he's gonna take over
the whole world.

37
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,600
Our first step to
stopping him is rescuing Mabel,

38
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,736

this strange prison bubble.

Don't forget, this world

That punch

And that glitter rain
is probably ground-up
bones or babies or something.

89

Bill's using Mabel's
own fantasies

- Uh, guys.

111
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,288
Don't worry, Mabel.
We'll get you out of this.

112
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,524
But Dipper...

113
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,000
Mabel, what are
you doing?

114
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,135
We're trying
to save you
from this prison.

115
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,970
This isn't a prison.

116
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,472
I made this world.

117
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,441
Well, I sorta woke up here.

118
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:45,143
- It's complicated.
- What are you saying?

119
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,646
I'm saying this is
my home now,

120
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,514
and I don't wanna
be saved.

121
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,785
- Sorry, Mabel.
- No worries, bubble bear.

122
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,358
- You did what?!
- Look, after you said

123
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,660
you wouldn't come back home with
me at the end of the summer

124
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,228
for your "apprenticeship,"

125
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,664
I wanted to hide
in my sweater forever.

126
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,833
But then I woke up
in a place that gives me

127
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,701
exactly what I wanted--

128
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,137
an endless summer where
we'll never have to grow up.

129
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,639
Here, the sun shines all day,
the party never ends,

130
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,709
and now that you guys are here,
it's finally perfect.

131
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,077
Listen, Mabel,
we're not here to party.

132
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,012
All of this is crazy.

133
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,850
Ugh! I figured <i>you</i> might say
something like that, Dipper.

134
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,918
That's why I've prepared
a backup Dipper

135
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,553
with a more supportive
attitude.

136
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,922

I like skateboarding,
supporting my sister,

141
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,834
and punctuating every
third sentence with a high five.

142
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,836
Oh, don't mind if I...

143
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,705
Ahem!

144
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,540
I'm sorry. I can't
leave him hanging.

145
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,876
- Yes.
- You're dead
to me, Soos.

146
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,678
Trust me. You guys
are gonna love it here.

before you do.

149
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,852
Apparently I wanted
a chinchilla.

150
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,687
Right again, Mabeland.

151
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,756
Mabel, listen to yourself.
This is crazy.

152
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,291
I'm sorry about our fight,

153
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,560
and I'm sorry
things aren't great right now,

154
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,363
but that doesn't mean
you can just stay
in here forever.

155
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,132
Hey, take a chill pill.
Those grow on trees here.

156
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,367
You stay out of this,
Dippy Fresh!

157
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,102
Dude, calm down.

158
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,703
Dippy Fresh didn't do
anything to you, dawg.

159
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,138
( growling )

160
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,740
I know it seems
too good to be true,

161
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,942
but just give
this place a chance.

162
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,911
Mabeland knows
just what you want,

163
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,446
and always provides.

164
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,484
Pudding center.
Nice.

165
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,719
Actually, Mabel,
I'm with Dipper on this.

166
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,589
Gravity Falls

and I really think--

167
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,291
( horn honking )

168
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,762
ALL: Wendy!

169
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,764
Guys? You're safe.

170
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,300
We've got a monster truck
full of fireworks, fake ID's,

171
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,168
and pranking supplies.

172
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,070
Wanna drive this truck
to the high school

173
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,105
and glue this plunger
to the principal's head?

174
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,808
Yes. Yes, I do.

175
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,610
Sorry, guys. I've always
wanted to do that.

176
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,645
I'll be back
in just a few minutes.

177
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,782
ALL: Whoo-hoo!

178
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,450
- Wendy?
- Don't worry, dude.

179
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,619
There's nothing in this world
that could break me

180
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,788
from our mission.

181
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,958
Soos <i>mi hijo.</i>
<i>I have returned.</i>

182
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,660
Holy... whoa, whoa.
Dad?

183
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,162
You don't remember
what I look like,

184
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,964
so I have the body
of a pro wrestler,

185
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,366
and a face you once saw
on a hot sauce bottle.

186
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,202
I was never there for you,
but in this world, I can be.

187
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,204
- You're perfect.
- It's a trap.

188
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,974
Don't go with him, Soos,
no matter what he offers you.

189
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,942
Want to play catch?

190
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,477
I'm sorry, dude.

191
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,379
Even if it is
all a dream,

192
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,981
I've gotta play
just one game.

193
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,849
Come on, Dad.

194
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,851
Okay, this has
gone too far.

195
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,687
You can't honestly think
these fantasies are good
for anyone.

196
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,689
You can't argue with
the results.

197
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,291
People are happy here.

198
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,827
Does it really matter
if it's real or not?

199
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,229
For once, stop listening
to your head,

200
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,365
and listen to your heart.

201
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,468
Mabeland has something
for everyone, even you.

202
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,470
In fact...

203
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,807
Nope. Not looking.
Not looking.

204
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,080
( all groaning )

205
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,683
All right, can anybody
explain to me why,

206
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,819
even with our newfound
infinite power...

207
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,157
none of us can escape
the borders

208
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,360
of this stupid
hick town?!

209
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,829
There's some kind of
force field keeping us in.

210
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,399
But who would know
how to fix it?

211
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:32,537
Hmm. Maybe someone needs
to come out of retirement.

212
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,039
Bill. Sorry, boss,

213
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,875
but Gideon let
the Pines family escape.

214
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,743
They're inside Mabel's
bubble as we speak.

215
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,279
( evil laughter )

216
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,548
Mabel's bubble is
the most diabolical trap

217
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,250
I've ever created.

218
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,918
It would take
a will of titanium

219
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
not to give into
its temptations.

220
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,423
Fetch me Gideon, and take
the rest of the day off.

221
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,992
Things just got
a little more interesting.

222
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,431
♪ Bo-ba-do-do,
I'm a stuffed animal tree ♪

223
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,300
♪ He's a stuffed
animal tree ♪

224
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,072
( all giggling )

225
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,808
Even my stone skips
are perfect.

226
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,743
Who am I kidding?

227
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,912
Maybe Mabel's right.

228
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,747
It's a horror show
out there.

229
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,916
At least the air here
is breathable.

230
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,718
Dude, you're talking
to a river.

231
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,920
Oh, hey, Wendy.
What's up?

232
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,456
I thought you were busy
wrecking the school
or whatever.

233
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,291
Yeah, that got
old quick.

234
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,059
And this music
is really starting
to get on my nerves.

235
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,662
I think that stuff
you said about
this place is right.

236
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,498
Really? Well, now
we just need a plan.

237
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,734
Don't worry. You always
think of something.

238
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,736
( giggling )

239
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,842
You know, you're so much
smarter than, like,
everyone else.

240
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,910
( chuckles )
It's kinda funny.

241
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,647
If you were older,
you'd be, like,
my dream guy.

242
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,849
Wait. Do you
really mean that?

243
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,317
Wait a minute.

244
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,619
In this place, you can be
any age you want.

245
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,455
If we were the same age,
maybe you and me could...

246
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,524
I don't know...
actually be together.

247
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,926
Wait. Really?

248
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,062
I bet if we asked Mabel,
she could do it right now.

249
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,865
In this place,
it could finally be
just you and me.

250
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:10,135
Come on, man.
Just take my hand.

251
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:13,038
Wait. ( screams )
This isn't real!

252
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,208
( shrieks )

253
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,782
You shouldn't have
done that, Dipper!

254
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,817
We're watching you.

255
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,687
TOYS: There are
eyes everywhere.

256
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,321
- Hi, Dipper.
- Hey, Dipper.

257
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,956
- Hey, Dipper.
- Hey, Dipper.

258
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,060
♪ Bo-ba-do-do,
I'm a stuffed animal tree ♪

259
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,561
Oh, my gosh.

260
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,363
This is crazy.

261
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,331
I'm losing my mind.

262
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,966
We have to get
out of here.

263
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,803
We have to go back...
to the real world!

264
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,138
( voice echoing )

265
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,175
Hey!

266
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,977
Under Article Smiley Face
of Exhibit Squeaky Duck,

267
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,480
you are hereby accused of
breaking our one rule--

268
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,515
mentioning reality.

269
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,150
( all exclaiming )

270
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:04,022
Prepare to be banished
from this land forever!

271
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,157
Mabel, you're
smarter than this.

272
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,760
Bill has you hypnotized
or something.

273
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,428
Are you really gonna
let them banish me?

274
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,030
No. Of course not.

275
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,598
That's my brother, guys.

276
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,567
There's gotta be
another way.

277
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,368
Very well.

278
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,404
If Dipper wishes to stay,
he must plead his case

279
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:24,142
in the ultimate trial
of   <i>Fantasy vs. Reality.</i>

280
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,079
Hey. Seriously?

281
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,082
( muffled chewing )
It was him.

282
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,026
Oh!

283
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,095
( quacking )

284
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,697
Seriously, Mabel?

285
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,133
You're letting them
take our argument to court?

286
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,135
Hey, I didn't make
the rules of Mabeland.

287
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,938
Yes, you did.
There's a tapestry
of you making the rules.

288
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,042
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Kitty Kitty Meow
Meow Face Schwartzstein.

289
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,213
- Order, order.
- ( gavel squeaking )

290
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,016
This trial begins
right meow.

291
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,087
Oh! Ha ha!

292
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,188
Ahem. Judge?

293
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,291
Sorry, sorry.
( clears throat )

294
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,460
We are here to try
Dipper Pines

295
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:20,131
in the case of
<i>Fantasy vs. Reality.</i>

296
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,267
If Dipper wins,
Mabel will return with him

297
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,902
to the real world.

298
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,071
But if he loses,
he will be banished forever,

299
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,274
and replaced with
town darling Dippy Fresh.

300
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,276
Dippy, come on out.

301
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,945
Flip-a-dip-dip.

302
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,248
I hate him so much.

303
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,616
The final decision
will be made by

304
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,251
a jury of your peers.

305
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,156
Hi there.
I love your headband.

306
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,492
Shut your mouth.
I love your headband.

307
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,494
We're all wearing
the same headband.

308
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,329
ALL: Ha ha!
Headband!

309
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,032
Look, Mabel,
this whole thing
is ridiculous.

310
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,301
But if winning a trial
is what it takes to get you
to come home with us,

311
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,670
then so be it.

312
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,473
I'm sorry, Dipper, but
I can only speak through
my legal team now.

313
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,310
We have a doctorate degree
in hunkiness.

314
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,178
Also criminal
and international law.

315
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,314
Let's hear
opening statements.

316
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,882
Your Honor,
townsfolk,

317
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,483
lovely ladies
of the jury.

318
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,352
Oh, he's talking
about us.

319
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,187
That's lovely.

320
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,189
My case is simple.

321
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,125
This very unrighteous
dude thinks that reality
is better than fantasy.

322
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:25,330
But reality is bogus,
lame, and whack.

323
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,532
Objection, Your Honor.
That's conjecture.

324
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,000
Meow-verruled!

325
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,135
I'd like to show you
this "reality"

326
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,004
that Dipper loves so much.

327
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,306
Show you how it has
wronged my client, and Dipper,

328
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,175
their entire lives.

329
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,676
Exhibit "A."

330
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,346
Mabel's scrapbook.

331
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,315
Second grade,
October 10.

332
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,318
Photo day.

333
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,222
( sniffling )
Darn allergies.

334
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,025
Boom! A million
slap bracelets.

335
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,194
I'm gonna have
the best photo ever.

336
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:59,597
And how do you like
my new pigtails?

337
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,532
Have fun, brat.

338
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,335
( gasps )
You ruined my hair!

339
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,404
Dipper, what do I do?

340
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,040
Um, I... well...
I don't...

341
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,075
- ( sobbing )
- Mabel!

342
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,282
Mabel's fantasy was
having a great school photo,

343
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,251
but reality
had other plans.

344
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,020
Look, that was
one bad day.

345
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:25,089
One of many.
February 14,
fourth grade.

346
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,326
- Valentine's Day.
- Oh, come on, man.
You can't...

347
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,463
How many Valentines
did you get, Dipper?

348
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,568
Oh, hey,
Dipper didn't get any.

349
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,804
Oh, man, I thought
I was the class loser.

350
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,639
Hey, everyone,
Dipstick didn't get any.

351
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:45,176
( laughter )

352
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,181
I can't believe
that kid's your brother.

353
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,153
Hey, what's the point
of all this?

354
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,421
That was in the past.

355
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,656
Is your life
any better now, bro?

356
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:02,660
Heartbreak, disaster,
broken promises.

357
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,362
That's reality for you.

358
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,664
Out there,
it's nothing but heartbreak.

359
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,167
But in here,
who wants pug sundaes?

360
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,906
Hand me a microphone,
Xyler.

361
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,276
Totally
righteous, bro.

362
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,011
- Are we brothers?
- I don't know.

363
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,447
I think we're ready
for a verdict.

364
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,615
Wait! I haven't even
presented my case.

365
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,718
Do you even
have a case?

366
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,288
Yes, I do,
Your Honor.

367
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,624
I call as a witness
Mabel Pines.

368
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,859
( all gasping )

369
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,661
Uh, objection?

370
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,296
I'll allow it.

371
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,298
Us cats are famously
curious, meow meow.

372
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,733
( spectators murmuring )

373
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,304
Mabel, listen.

374
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,806
I might not have
all the answers.

375
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,943
I'm not stylish,
and I'm not cool,

376
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,278
and I can't make
pugs appear out of thin air.

377
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,614
- Boo!
- Guilty!

378
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,283
But I know one thing well,
and that's you,

379
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,886
and I know that even though
you might act like it,

380
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,322
you don't wanna be
in this fantasy world.

381
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,991
Uh... pssshh!
Yeah, right.

382
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,160
You're scared
of growing up.

383
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,828
And who could
blame you?

384
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,530
I'm scared, too.

385
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,366
Uh... la la la la la la la!
I'm not listening.

386
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,803
Guards, the fingers.

387
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,371
Look, real life
stinks sometimes, okay?

388
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,373
I'm not gonna lie.

389
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,575
There's a better way
to get through it than denial,

390
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,211
and that's with help from
people who care about you.

391
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,213
It's how we've gotten
through our whole lives.

392
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,215
Just look.

393
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,018
Mabel, I figured out a way
to fix your photo.

394
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,920
What? You have a wig?

395
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,156
No, but I have a razor.

396
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,326
( laughs )
You're crazy.

397
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,579
We've always been there
for each other.

398
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,686
Mabel, I thought you were
living a fantasy,

399
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,088
but look at me.

400
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,789
I actually thought I was
gonna stay here

401
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,558
and be Ford's apprentice.

402
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,893
Spend my entire teens
cooped up in a basement

403
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,129
with a lab coat.
How ridiculous is that?

404
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,466
I don't know what's
gonna happen in the future,

405
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,634
but whatever it is,
you don't have to fear,

406
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,436
because we'll
do it together.

407
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,039
I'm not taking
Ford's apprenticeship.

408
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,374
We've traveled
to heck and back to get you,

409
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,243
and we're going back
together.

410
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,611
Leave this fantasy world.

411
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,314
Let's beat Bill
and grow up together.

412
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,252
Order. Order in the court!

413
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,621
Dang it, why is this hammer
squeaking?!

414
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,223
You mean it?

415
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,624
You're really
coming home with me?

416
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,159
Yes. Definitely.

417
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,161
Absolutely.

418
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,762
Awkward sibling hug?

419
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,066
- ( frightened exclamations )
- Don't do it!

420
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,968
You do this,
and it's all over.

421
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,471
Sincere sibling hug.

422
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,074
Don't do the pats!

423
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,376
Pat, pat.

424
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,519
Oh, man.

425
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:17,421
I never noticed
how bright this place is.

426
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,124
Ugh! Have I actually been
listening to the same song

427
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,860
- for an entire week?
- ( anguished yowl )

428
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,929
Whoa, time to calm you down.

429
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,767
Uh, why isn't
this working?

430
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,570
Because your reign over
this land is over!

431
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,844
We gotta get outta here.

432
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,280
Soos, Wendy,
Paradise is cancelled.

433
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,523
Everyone get on.

434
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,631
Take us to freedom,
Giant Waddles. Yeah!

435
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,339
All right, guys,
are you ready for this?

436
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,807
Sorry, Mabeland.

437
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,144
It's time to burst
your bubble.

438
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,550
Whoa.

439
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,552
You all good?
Everyone good?

440
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,255
- ( all laughing )
- We've missed you, Mabel.

441
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:27,658
Hey, Dipper, I appreciate
what you said back there.

442
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,827
But if you wanna take
Ford's apprenticeship,

443
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,529
I won't get
in your way.

444
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,664
Pfft. Miss out on
your awkward teen years?

445
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,399
You wish.

446
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,437
Man, I went nuts
back there.

447
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,673
I mean, come on,
the real world can't
be that bad, right?

448
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,411
Oh, boy.

449
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,415
Where is everyone?
The town's deserted.

450
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,618
Did Bill already win?

451
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,487
Come on, guys.
Let's see if we can
go hide out in the shack.

452
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,726
Yes! It's in shambles
just like we left it.

453
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,729
Oh, man, this is
the first time I've
ever felt happy going to work.

454
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,597
Hello, house.
Hello, porch.

455
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,433
Hello, wads of gum
I left stuck to the couch.

456
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,302
( muffled noises )

457
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,304
Wait. What was that?

458
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,339
Sh!

459
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,613
Let's get 'em, dudes.

460
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,649
ALL: Yah!!

461
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,951
( screaming )

462
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,487
- Stan?
- Kids?

463
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,289
( toilet flushes )

464
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,392
Just so everyone knows,
we're out of toilet paper.

465
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,061
Did I miss something?

466
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,033
Whoa, we survived.

467
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,636
But where are we?

468
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,407
Are we real?

469
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,975
Is this reality?

470
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,110
Jean-Paul Sartre
postulated that

471
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,413
every existing thing
is born without reason,

472
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,481
prolongs itself
out of weakness,

473
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,949
and dies by chance.

474
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,085
Totally righteous,
bro.

475
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,054
I know!

476
