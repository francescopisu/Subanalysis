Mysterious, boarded-up cave.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,910
It might be filled with

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,190
I've got the other thing.

13

Oh, right, punching.

Ow!
What the heck was that for?

25
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,030
This was an insanely risky move,
restarting the portal.

26
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,180
- Didn't you read my warnings?
- Warnings, schmarnings.

27
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,530
How's about maybe a thanks for
saving you from what appears

28
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:03,850
to be, I don't know, some
kinda sci-fi sideburn dimension.

29
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,980
Thank you? You really
think I'm gonna thank you

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,080

Why, you ungrateful...

Don't expect me to go easy on you

Hey, hi. Mabel here.

35
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,140
Quick question.
What the heck is going on here?

36
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,810
Stan, you didn't tell me
there were children down here.

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,080
- And some sort of large, hairless gopher.
- [chuckles] I get that a lot.

38
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,880
They're your family, Poindexter.
Shermy's grandkids.

39
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,880
I-I have a niece, and a nephew?

40
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,150
Greetings.
Do kids still say greetings?

41
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,080
I haven't been in this
dimension for a really long time.

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,160
Whoa, six-fingered handshake.

43
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,230
It's a full finger
friendlier than normal.

44
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,000
[chuckles] I like this kid.
She's weird.

45
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,230
I... I can't believe it.
You're the author of the journals!

46
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,230
You've read my journals?

47
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,040
I-I haven't just read them.
I've lived them.

48
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,940
I've been waiting for
so long to meet you.

49
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,910
I don't know what to say.
I have so many questions. I...

50
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,080
[hyperventilating]

51
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,010
I think I'm gonna throw up.

52
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,850
No, no, false alarm.
Just gotta ride it out.

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,020
Listen, there'll be time
for introductions later.

54
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,210
But first, tell me, Stan.
Are there any security breaches?

55
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,920
Does anyone else know about this portal?

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,830
No. Just us.

57
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,900
- Also, maybe the entire U.S. government.
- The what?!

58
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,830
<i>Fan out.
We're not going anywhere</i>

59
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,890

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,830
[sigs]
Okay. It's all right.

61
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,970
We've got a while before
they find this room.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,230
We just need to lay
low and think of a plan.

63
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,230
Well, it looks like we're stuck
down here for a while.

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,180
Who wants to tell us their
entire mysterious backstory?

65
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,910
Yes, I have some questions
about all this myself, Stanley.

66
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,250
- Stanley?
- But your name is Stanford.

67
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,820
Wait, you took my name?

68
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,830
What have you been doing all
these years, you knucklehead?

69
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,030
Yeah, Grunkle Stan, no more lies.
You owe us some answers.

70
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,970
What's the deal with this portal?
Why did you keep this a secret?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,030
And what happened between
you and your brother?

72
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,900
I'm hoping all this aligns
exactly with my fan-fic, Stan.

73
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,110
If not, I will be very disappointed.

74
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,780
Okay. Okay, okay.
I know I have a lot of explaining to do.

75
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,190
It all started a lifetime ago.

<i>Tough as a cinder block,

81
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,900
I'm not impressed.

82
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,840
<i>Mom was a pathological liar,</i>

83
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,200
<i>which served her well
as a phone psychic.</i>

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,100
That'll be 99 cents an hour.
No, you're overpriced!

85
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,010
Yeah, I predicted you
were gonna hang up.

86
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,080
<i>And then, there was my
nerdy twin brother Stanford.</i>

87
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,850
<i>As if his abnormally
high IQ wasn't enough,</i>

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,180
<i>he also had a rare birth defect...</i>

89
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,010
<i>six fingers on each hand,</i>

90
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,280
<i>which might've explained his obsession
with sci-fi mystery weirdness.</i>

91
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,060
<i>As for me, I had what Mom
liked to call personality.</i>

92
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,230
<i>[laughing]
But as different as we were,</i>

93
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,300
<i>we were the perfect team,</i>

94
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,130
<i>and every day, we'd wander the beach,</i>

95
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,920

96
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,340
Whoa!

97
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,810
A shipwrecked sailboat.
Possibly haunted by pirate ghosts.

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,880
This is the greatest
thing I've ever seen.

99
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,010
And I once saw a dead
rat floating in a bucket.

100
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,950
[laughing]
Ew. What's wrong with you?

101
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,220
Huh.
You know what this thing's missing?

102
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,090
Flags.

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,990

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,960
<i>I dub thee the Stan O' War.</i>

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,270
Ow! What the heck?

107
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,840
Well, well, if it ain't the loser twins.

108
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,200
Nice boat.
You get it at the dump? [giggles]

109
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,010
You would know, Crampelter.
Get lost!

110
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,870
Listen, dorks, and listen good.
You're a six-fingered freak,

111
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,280
and you're just a dumber,
sweatier version of him.

112
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,140
And you're lucky you have each other,

113
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,250
because neither of you
will ever make any friends.

114
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,320
[laughing]

115
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,310
<i>Dorks and losers.</i>

116
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,220
- Hey, don't let those idiots get to you.
- But I am a freak.

117
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,870
I just wonder if there's
anywhere in the world

118
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,170
- where weirdos like me fit in.
- Hey, chin up, buddy. Look.

119
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
One of these days,
you and me are gonna

120
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,040
sail away from this dumb town.

121
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,110
We'll hunt for treasure,
get all the girls,

122
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,280
and be an unstoppable
team of adventurers.

123
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,050
You really mean it?

124
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,320
- High six?
- High six.

125
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,050
<i>Those were the good times.</i>

126
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,010
<i>Those bullies may have
been right about us</i>

<i>not making many friends,

128
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,120
<i>you only really need one.</i>

129
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,970
<i>Ford's brain seemed to get
more impressive every year.</i>

130

<i>So did our pet project.</i>

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,940
<i>Sure, I got in more than

<i>[Woman over P.A.] Pines twins

<i>Pines twins to the principal's office.</i>

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,060
Ah, great. What is it this time?

139
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,990
Not you. Him.

140
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,240
Now, Mr. Pines, I'd like to speak
with you very frankly, if I may.

141
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,010
Very frankly is the only way I speak.

142
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,177
You have two sons.
One of them is incredibly gifted.

143
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:25,840
The other one is standing outside
this room, and his name's Stanley.

144
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
What are you saying?

145
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm saying your son
Stanford is a genius!

146
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,250
All of his teachers are going bananas
over his science fair experiment.

147
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,960
You ever heard of West Coast Tech?
Best college in the country.

148
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,930
<i>Their graduates turn science fiction
into science fact.</i>

149
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,090
<i>The admissions team is visiting tomorrow</i>

150
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,030
<i>to check out Stanford's experiment.</i>

151
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,000
<i>Your son may be a future
millionaire, Mr. Pines.</i>

152
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,170
I'm impressed.

153
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,970
But what about our little
free spirit Stanley?

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,830
<i>That clown? At this rate, he'll
be lucky to graduate high school.</i>

155
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,200
<i>Look, there's a saltwater
taffy store on the dock,</i>

156
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,050
<i>and somebody's gotta get paid to
scrape the barnacles off of it.</i>

157
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,180
<i>Stanford's going places,
but hey, look on the bright side.</i>

158
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,840
<i>At least you'll have one son
here in New Jersey forever.</i>

159
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,390
[chuckles] Joke's on them if they
think you wanna go to some

160
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:12,890
stuffy college on the
other side of the country.

161
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,050
Once we get the Stan O' War complete,

162
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,800
it's gonna be beaches, babes,

163
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,260
and international
treasure hunting for us.

164
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,930
Look, Stan, I can't pass
up a chance like this.

165
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,120
This school has cutting-edge
programs and multi-dimensional

166
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:28,270
- paradigm theory.
- Be-boop. I am a nerd robot.

167
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,180
That's you.
That's what you sound like.

168
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,065
[chuckles] Ah, well, if the college
board isn't impressed with my

169
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:37,920
experiment tomorrow, then okay,
I'll do the treasure hunting thing.

170
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,955
- And if they are?
- Well, then I guess you better come

171
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:43,960
visit me on the other side
of the country. [chuckles]

172
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,880
<i>Without Ford, I was just
half of a dynamic duo.</i>

173
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,060
<i>I couldn't make it
out there without him.</i>

174
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,930
<i>And now, thanks to that dumb college,</i>

175
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,260
<i>I was gonna lose my brother forever.</i>

176
00:08:58,263 --> 00:09:01,970
This is all your
fault, you dumb machine!

177
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,130
Oh, no. No, no, no.
What did I do?

178
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,780
There. All right.
Good as new. Probably.

179
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,210
All right, kid, show us what you got.

180
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,530
Okay. Well, what would
you say if I told you

181
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:24,800
the future of technology
was beneath this sheet?

182
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,800
- I'd say we wasted a car trip.
- What?

183
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,970
But... it was stable yesterday.

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,940
A fuse must've blown or something.

185
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,040
<i>Kid, a perpetual motion machine
has one job... to not stop.</i>

186
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,830
I don't think you're
West Coast Tech material.

187
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,110
No, wait. Don't go!
I worked so hard!

188
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,090
One paddle paddle paddle,
two paddle paddle.

189
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,060
Man, that Jackie O.
What a fox.

190
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,660
- Hey, what's the word, sixer?
- Can you explain

191
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,230
what this was doing next
to my broken project?

192
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,020
Okay. I might've accidentally
been... horsing around.

193
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,000
This was no accident, Stan.
You did this!

194
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,960
You did this because
you couldn't handle me

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,970
- going to college on my own.
- Look, it was a mistake.

196
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,080
Although, if you think about it,
maybe there's a silver lining.

197
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,910
- Huh? Treasure hunting?
- Are you kidding me?

198
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,850
Why would I wanna do
anything with the person

199
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,950
- who sabotaged my entire future?
- You did what, you knucklehead?

200
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,160
[baby cries]
Stanley, what's going on in here?

201
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,190
Wait, no. I can explain.
It was a mistake.

202
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,060
You ignoramus.

203
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,850
Your brother was gonna be
our ticket outta this dump.

204
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,870
All you ever do is lie and cheat,

205
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,000
and ride on your brother's coattails.

206
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,940
Well, this time, you cost
our family potential millions.

207
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,270
And until you make us a fortune,
you're not welcome in this household.

208
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,880
What?! Stanford, tell
him he's being crazy.

209
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,190
Stanford? Don't leave
me hanging. High six?

210
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,010
Fine!
I can make it on my own.

211
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,030
I don't need you, I don't need anyone!

212
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,330
I'll make millions,
and you'll rue the day

213
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,000
you turned your back on me.

214
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,030
<i>Thanks to one dumb mistake,
I had no brother,</i>

215
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,060
<i>no home, no nothing.
But I had a plan to fix everything.</i>

216
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,640
Oh, this story's so sad.

217
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,610
I know what you two
little broken teacups need.

218
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,610
To hug it out!

219
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,980
Hug it out.
Hug train comin' in the station.

220
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,720
- Hugapalooza 2000!
- Kid, will you knock that off?

221
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,990
I'm trying to tell my life story here.

222
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,790
<i>I had decided I wasn't
gonna show my face at home</i>

223
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,890
<i>till I proved I could
make something of myself.</i>

224
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,880
<i>Unfortunately, the
treasure hunting business</i>

225
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,790
<i>was slow going.</i>

226
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,900
<i>Apparently, gold is
some kind of rare metal.</i>

227
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,600
<i>Luckily, I struck another kind of gold.</i>

228
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,700
<i>In sales.</i>

229
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,740
Hi there. I'm Stan Pines
of Stanco Enterprises.

230
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,980
Are you sick of this
always happening to you?

231
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,740
Then you need the chamois of the future.

232
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,580
Made with the same
material astronauts use

233
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,740
to clean up cranberry
stains on the moon.

234
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,790
That's the Sham Total.
It's a total sham.

235
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,690
<i>I had made my mark, all right.</i>

236
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,520
<i>Unfortunately, so did the chamois.</i>

237
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,830
<i>Apparently, the cheap
dye I used to color them</i>

238
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,760
<i>only made stains worse.</i>

239
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,790
<i>Customers weren't crazy about that.</i>

240
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,530
<i>Luckily, they were chasing me
with Stanco-brand pitchforks.</i>

241
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,860
Suckers!

242
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,570
<i>I was officially
banned from New Jersey.</i>

243
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,530
<i>But with a quick name change,</i>

244
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,830
<i>Steve Pinington was ready
to take on Pennsylvania.</i>

245
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,770
Hi. I'm Steve Pinington.

246
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,510
Are you sick of bandages
that are hard to remove?

247
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,820
Then what you need is the Rip Off.

248
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,820
The Rip Off won't give you rashes.

249
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,520
I repeat, it won't give you rashes.

250
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,590
<i>It gave you rashes.</i>

251
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,690
<i>I traveled the whole country,
sometimes outside of it,</i>

252
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,630
<i>always one step ahead of the law,</i>

253
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,000
<i>looking for something
that would be my big break.</i>

254
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,640
Whoa. So that explains
all the fake ID's.

255
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,940
But wait, what about you?

256
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,940
Did you end up going
to your dream school?

257
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,580
Not exactly.

258
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,480
All right, I know Backupsmore
wasn't anyone's first choice,

259
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,680
but what we lack in prestige

260
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,680
we make up for in
mostly bug-free dorms.

261
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,890
I'm sure your families are proud.
More or less.

262
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,790
<i>In a place like that,
I had to work twice as hard.</i>

263
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,690
<i>Luckily, that's what I do best.</i>

264
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
<i>I went from undergrad to PhD
three years ahead of schedule,</i>

265
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,085
<i>wrote a thesis that was
nationally ranked, and was</i>

266
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,570
<i>awarded an enormous grant for
my own scientific research.</i>

267
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,940
<i>But what to study?</i>

268
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,510
<i>My whole life, I'd been teased
for my six fingers.</i>

269
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,840
<i>But that got me thinking
about anomalies.</i>

270
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,950
<i>Things that were odd, unusual,
statistically improbable.</i>

271
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,880
<i>And according to my investigations,</i>

272
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,840
<i>there was one place with
a higher concentration</i>

273
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,510
<i>of these things than anywhere else.</i>

274
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,620
<i>A small lumber town in
Roadkill County, Oregon.</i>

275
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,590
<i>Gravity Falls.</i>

276
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,900
<i>Meanwhile, your old
Uncle Stan was doing great.</i>

277
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,820
<i>I'd come up with a sophisticated
new business strategy.</i>

278
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,840
Come on. Owl, owl...

279
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,770
Football player with an omelet?!
Gah!

280
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,640
<i>I was in great shape, living on my own,</i>

281
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,780
<i>and the best part was,
I didn't need help from nobody.</i>

282
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,750
[line ringing]

283
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,620
<i>Hello. This is Stanford Pines.</i>

284
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,530
<i>I was heading out on my own, as well.</i>

285
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,600
<i>I set to work using my grant money</i>

286
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,630
<i>to investigate the strange
properties of this town.</i>

287
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,530
<i>But what would I find here?</i>

288
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,940
<i>Bingo.
I began to investigate at once.</i>

289
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,970
<i>I knew I'd have to record my findings.</i>

290
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,260
<i>I began to keep a journal.
[shrieking]</i>

291
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,660
The journals!

292
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,830
Sorry, sorry. Just...
[clearing throat] got excited there

293
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,730
about the journals. Keep talking.

294
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I began to keep a journal.
[shrieking]

295
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,640
[clearing throat]
I'm going to ignore that.

296
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,700
<i>There were anomalies everywhere.</i>

297
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,470
<i>And the more I looked, the more I saw.</i>

298
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,860
Fascinating.
What did you say your name was?

299
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,630
Shmebulock... senior.

300
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,900
<i>It was finally a place
where I felt at home,</i>

301
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,670
<i>but something nagged at me.</i>

302
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,930
<i>Where did it all come from?</i>

303
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,500
<i>It seemed to me the answer
must lie outside of our world,</i>

304
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,710
<i>a dimension of weirdness
leaking into ours.</i>

305
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,910
<i>I realized the only way
to understand Gravity Falls</i>

306
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,640
<i>would be to build a gateway, a portal
to the source of its weirdness.</i>

307
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,950
<i>But I couldn't make it alone.</i>

308
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
<i>I decided to call up
my old college buddy,</i>

309
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,720
<i>Fiddleford McGucket,
a young but brilliant mechanic</i>

310
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,105
<i>who was wasting his
talent trying to make</i>

311
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:07,830
<i>personal computers in some
garage in Palo Alto. [ringing]</i>

312
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,590
Hello.
Fiddleford Computermajigs.

313
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,930
You say you're trying to build

314
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,900
a trans-universal
poly-dimensional meta vortex?

315
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,870
Well, that's mathematically feasible,
I reckon. [spits]

316
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,570
<i>Many long nights were spent
perfecting the machine.</i>

317
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,655
<i>It would be the crowning
achievement of my studies,</i>

318
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:26,710
<i>an answer to the source
of this town's anomalies.</i>

319
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,670
Get out, get out, get out!

320
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,541
<i>The time had come to test it.</i>

321
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,890
Ready? And...

322
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,463
[yells]
What?

323
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,660
I got you, buddy!

324
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,600
[gasps]
What is it? Is it working?

325
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,810
What did you see?

326
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,910
[speaking gibberish]

327
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,680
Fiddleford?

328
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,710
When Gravity Falls
and Earth becomes sky,

329
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,680
fear the beast with just one eye.

330
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,820
Fiddleford, get a hold of yourself.
You're not making any sense.

331
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,620
This machine is dangerous.

332
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,490
You'll bring about the
end of the world with this.

333
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,860
Destroy it before it destroys us all!

334
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,590
I can't destroy this.
It's my life's work.

335
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,500
I fear we've unleashed a
great danger on the world.

336
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,900
One I'd just as soon forget.
I quit.

337
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,770
Fine! I'll do it without you!

338
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,700
I don't need you, I don't need anyone.

339
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,940
[eerie whispering]

340
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,680
What? Who said that?

341
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,740
<i>I was in over my head,
and feared I was losing my sanity.</i>

342
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,520
<i>I needed help.
Someone I could trust.</i>

343
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,850
[pounding on door]

344
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,510
Just give me a few more days, Rico.

345
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,820
I'll pay your goons back, I swear.

346
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,630
You haven't seen your
brother in over ten years.

347
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,643
It's okay. He's family.
He won't bite.

348
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,620
Who is it?!
Have you come to steal my eyes?!

349
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,720
Well, I can always count on you
for a warm welcome.

350
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,660
Stanley, did anyone
follow you, anyone at all?

351
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,800
Hello to you, too, pal.

352
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,860
Hey, what is this?

353
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,740
Sorry. I just had to
make sure you weren't...

354
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,480
uh, it's nothing.
Come in, come in.

355
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,650
Look. Are you gonna explain
what's going on here?

356
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
You're acting like Mom after
her tenth cup of coffee.

357
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,920
Listen, there isn't much time.
I've made huge mistakes,

358
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,820
and I don't know who
I can trust anymore.

359
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,960
Hey, easy there. Let's
talk this through, okay?

360
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,730
I have something to show you.
Something you won't believe.

361
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,530
Loo, I've been around the world, okay?

362
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,670
Whatever it is, I'll understand.

363
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,500
There is nothing about
this I understand.

364
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,530
It's a trans-universal gateway,

365
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,770
a punched hole through
a weak spot in our dimension.

366
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,480
I created it to unlock the
mysteries of the universe.

367
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,770
But it could just as easily be
harnessed for terrible destruction!

368
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,780
That's why I shut it
down and hid my journals

369
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,670
which explain how to operate it.

370
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,590
There's only one journal left.

371
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,590
And you are the only person
I can trust to take it.

372
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,920
I have something to ask of you.

373
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,460
Remember our plans to sail
around the world on a boat?

374
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,900
Take this book, get on a boat,

375
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,770
and sail as far away as you can.
To the edge of the earth.

376
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,640
Bury it where no one can find it.

377
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,930
That's it? You finally
wanna see me after ten years,

378
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,810
and it's to tell me to get as
far away from you as possible?

379
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,470
Stanley, you don't understand
what I'm up against.

380
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,840
What I've been through!

381
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,720
No, no, you don't understand
what I've been through!

382
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,820
I've been to prison in
three different countries.

383
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,790
I once had to chew my way
out of the trunk of a car.

384
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,590
You think you've got problems?
I've got a mullet, Stanford.

385
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,700
Meanwhile, where have you been?

386
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,760
Living it up in your
fancy house in the woods,

387
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
selfishly hoarding your college money,

388
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,700
because you only care about yourself.

389
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,760
I'm selfish?
I'm selfish?

390
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,740
Stanley, how can you say that
after costing me my dream school?

391
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,150
I'm giving you a chance to do the

392
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,530
first worthwhile thing in your life,

393
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,640
- and you won't even listen.
- Well, listen to this.

394
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,950
You want me to get rid of this book?

395
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,950
- Fine, I'll get rid of it right now.
- No! You don't understand.

396
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
You said you wanted me to have it,

397
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,990
- so I'll do what I want with it.
- My research!

398
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,846
Stanley, give it back!

399
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,770
You want it back, you're gonna
have to try harder than that.

400
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,830
You left me behind, you jerk.

401
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,800
It was supposed to be us forever!

402
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,670
- You ruined my life!
- You ruined your own life!

403
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,850
Stanley. Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

404
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,840
Some brother you turned out to be.

405
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,820
You care more about your dumb
mysteries than your family.

406
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,890
Well then you can have 'em.

407
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,720
Whoa, whoa, hey.
What's going on?

408
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,530
- Hey, Stanford...
- Stanley! Stanley, help me!

409
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
- Oh no! What do I do?
- Stanley!

410
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,740
Stanley, do something!

411
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,640
<i>[screaming] Stanleeey!</i>

412
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,810
Stanford?

413
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,241
Stanford, come back!
I didn't mean it!

414
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,620
I just got him back.
I can't lose him again.

415
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,650
Come on!

416
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,520
[echoing] Stanford!

417
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,990
<i>I lost him.</i>

418
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,930
<i>I didn't know if he was dead
or alive in some distant galaxy,</i>

419
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,830
<i>but I knew his journal
must have the answer</i>

420
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,970
<i>to getting him back... somehow.</i>

421
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,540
<i>I didn't get much sleep that night.</i>

422
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,610
<i>Or the night after that.</i>

423
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,870
<i>I tried for weeks to turn
that dumb machine back on.</i>

424
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,750
<i>But without the other two journals,
it was hopeless.</i>

425
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,920
<i>Finally, I ran out of food.
I had no choice but to go into town.</i>

426
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,590
Just the bread then, stranger?
That'll be 99 cents.

427
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,870
<i>Hey, that's no stranger.</i>

428
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,570
That must be the mysterious
science guy that lives in the woods.

429
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,830
No, no, you got the wrong guy.

430
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,930
I've heard strange stories
about that old shack.

431
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,810
Yeah, mysterious lights
and spooky experiments.

432
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,320
Gosh, I'd pay anything to see what kind

433
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:41,790
of shenanigans you get up to in there.

434
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,690
Oh, me, too.
Do you ever give tours?

435
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,920
No, really, I...

436
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,800
[sighs]
Yes, I do give tours.

437
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,900
Ten... no, no, 15 bucks a person.

438
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,930
[cheering excitedly]

439
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,570
So what did you say your name was,
you man of mystery?

440
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,480
Oh, Stan... ford.

441
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,810
Stanford Pines.

442
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,580
Step right up, folks, to a
world of enchantment or whatever.

443
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,490
Behold the nerdy science box.
[electricity zaps]

444
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Ah! My eye!

445
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,860
Uh, I can assure you, that
is in no way permanent.

446
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,600
I paid $15 for this?
[people grumbling]

447
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,570
Uh, you're lucky you weren't
part of the last tour group.

448
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,970
They never made it out alive.

449
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,500
[chuckles nervously]
Right?

450
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,510
[laughter]

451
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,710
Funny.

452
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,600
<i>So I came up with a plan.</i>

453
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,510
<i>I couldn't leave my brother's house</i>

454
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,850
<i>until I figured out how to save him.</i>

455
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,720
<i>But I needed to pay
his mortgage somehow.</i>

456
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,560
<i>For once in my life,</i>

457
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,590
<i>people were actually
buying what I was selling.</i>

458
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,560
<i>And so, the Murder Hut was born.</i>

459
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,920
<i>Later renamed the Mystery Shack.</i>

460
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,870
<i>Finally, I'd found
something I was good at.</i>

461
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,640
<i>For once, being a liar
and a cheat paid off.</i>

462
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,640
<i>The old me was dead.
And I faked a car crash to prove it.</i>

463
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,800
<i>By day, I was Stanford Pines,
Mr. Mystery.</i>

464
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,850
<i>But by night, I was
down in the basement,</i>

465
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,997
<i>trying to bring the real Stanford back.</i>

466
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,490
<i>I couldn't risk anyone learning
the truth and sabotaging my mission.</i>

467
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,820
So I lied to everyone.

468
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,630
The town, my family, your parents.
Even you kids.

469
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,860
So all this time, you were just
trying to save your brother.

470
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,970
Grunkle Stan, I'm so
sorry I didn't believe you.

471
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,870
That's okay, kid. I probably
wouldn't have believed me either.

472
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,760
<i>[man] I heard talking. It
was coming from downstairs.</i>

473
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,910
Oh no, we're too late.
The agents are coming for us!

474
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,710
What'll we do?

475
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,950
Oh, man, I was so spellbound
by your dramatic tale,

476
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,720
- I forgot all about those dudes.
- Wait. "Forget." That's it.

477
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,790
I think I know a way we might
be able to defeat those agents.

478
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,620
Of course.

479
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,880
I don't know how you got
a hold of one of these,

480
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,860
but this is perfect.

481
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,552
If I can just amplify the signal
to a radio headset frequency.

482
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,670
There.
Now everyone, plug your ears!

483
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,740
Get down now!

484
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,840
Sir, looks like there's a hidden door
behind the vending machines.

485
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,710
Excellent. Get me
Washington on line one.

486
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,740
I've been practicing making sounds
of excitement for this very occasion.

487
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,521
Hey, do you hear that?

488
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,910
What? Where am I?

489
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Why am I standing in some sort
of goofy, fun knick-knack house?

490
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,820
Stand down, gentlemen.

491
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,590
I've been sent with the
latest intel from Washington.

492
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,860
According to this very real report,
the power surges in Gravity Falls

493
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,710
were actually due to radiation
from an unreported meteor shower.

494
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,780
A total embarrassment
for your whole department.

495
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,550
Luckily, I'm here to take
this mess off your hands.

496
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,640
And I'll need all of your floppy disks,
and, uh, eight tracks. Right?

497
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,490
Uh, everything about this case
is contained on this drive.

498
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,690
Well, what are you waiting for?
A kiss on the cheek?

499
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,780
Get outta here before I have
your butts court-martialed.

500
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,800
Uh, yes, sir.
Apologies, sir.

501
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,900
[whistles] False alarm, everyone.
Whoa.

502
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,480
Great-uncle Stanford, that was amazing.

503
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,520
Let's not go crazy.
It was serviceable.

504
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,620
[chuckles] Thank you, kids.
But please, call me Ford.

505
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,950
Sure.
Thanks, great-uncle Ford.

506
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,890
So, uh, would you mind if I asked you

507
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,620
a couple billion questions
about Gravity Falls?

508
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,830
- Um, well, I, uh...
- All right, kids, it's been a long day.

509
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,930
Me and my brother have
a lot to talk about.

510
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,890
- So why don't you hit the hay, huh?
- But it's the author.

511
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,770
I've been waiting so long
to ask questions about...

512
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,070
I said, hit the hay!

513
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,810
I'll just let myself out.

514
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,850
<i>[phone dialing] Wendy, I've got
something amazing to tell you.</i>

515
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,720
<i>Clear the next 14 hours.</i>

516
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,490
Look at us.
When did we become old men?

517
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,880
- You look like Dad.
- Ah. Don't say that. [both laughing]

518
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,620
[sighs]
Okay, Stanley, here's the deal.

519
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,530
You can stay here for the
Summer to watch the kids.

520
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,900
I'll stay down in the basement

521
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,900
and try to contain any remaining damage.

522
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,530
When the Summer's over,
you give me my house back,

523
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,870
you give me my name back,

524
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,710
and this Mystery Shack junk
is over forever. You got it?

525
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,383
You really aren't
gonna thank me, are you?

526
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,650
Fine. On one condition.
You stay away from the kids.

527
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,520
I don't want them in danger.

528
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,960
'Cause as far as I'm concerned,
they're the only family I have left.

529
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,550
Did you hear what they said?

530
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,200
I think Uncle Ford said
they're gonna buy us puppies

531
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:57,800
made of ice cream.
Might be wishful thinking, though.

532
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,660
I don't know if this is good or bad.

533
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,770
I wanted to meet the author, but...

534
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Yeah. I liked the way
things were here before.

535
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,840
Just us and Stan,
and the occasional goblin monster.

536
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,620
I'm sure they'll work things out.

537
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:15,520
Dipper, you don't think we'll turn out
like Stan and Ford, do you?

538
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,920
- W-What do you mean?
- I mean, they used to be best friends,

539
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,860
but then, they got all stupid.
Can you promise me you won't get stupid?

540
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,920
Not stupider than you, dum-dum.

541
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,800
- [giggles] Good night, stupid.
- Good night, stupid.

542
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,670
<i>[Soos] Okay, okay, so it
turns out the second Stan,</i>

543
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,470
<i>the Stan that we know,
was actually Stanley,</i>

544
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,710
<i>but the first Stan was Stanford,</i>

545
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,450
<i>but we didn't know until that
Stanford came out of the portal,</i>

546
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,350
<i>which was built by Stanford,</i>

547
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,480
<i>but then Stanley
pretending to be Stanford,</i>

548
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,390
<i>he did the portal 'cause he's Stan,
but he's not Stan.</i>

549
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,690
- Soos, it's 3:00 in the morning.
- Okay, okay, I understand.

550
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,430
<i>- Anyway, act two, Stan started...
- Aaaah!</i>
