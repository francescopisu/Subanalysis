1
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:05,695
Wait.

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,297
Grunkle Stan!

3
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:10,600
Kids! I can't believe it!

4
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,569
I thought I lost you two.

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,538
- Ahh!
- Mr. Pines, it's really you!

6
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,440
I've been hugging strangers
to practice for this moment.

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,409
We missed you, you old codger.

8
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:21,628
I've missed you knuckleheads too.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,413
It's good to have you back.

10
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,749
So... what's everyone doing here?

11
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:28,585
Yeah, there's, like,
monsters and gnomes.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,720
And is Pacifica wearing a potato sack?

13
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:33,590
Hey! Even in a sack
I still look better than you.

14
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:36,293
It's... It's a long story.

15
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,727
Hey, is anyone gonna feed me?

16
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:41,431
Larry King's disembodied
wax head wants num-nums.

17
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,700
We're trying to ration
our food, remember?

18
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:47,537
- Mmm... mmm...
- Uhh, it's happening again!

19
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,739
Hey, everyone!

20
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,325
Eye bat!

21
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:54,744
Evasive maneuvers!

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,614
- Shh! Keep it down!
- Get the lights!

2x20 - Weirdmageddon, Part III

25
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:49,394
Welcome to what's left
of normal around here...

26
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:50,428
home base.

27
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:53,482
Ow!

28
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:56,601
We have...
# Several injuries #

29
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:59,287
- Ooh! - Ow!
- My liver, girl!

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,473
Rumble McSkirmish?

31
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:04,376
Do not be afraid.
Weirdmaggedon has taught me

32
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:09,214
there are some battles I cannot win.
I am now Humble McSkirmish.

33
00:02:09,249 --> 00:02:11,416
Grunkle Stan, how'd this all happen?

34
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:13,301
So I was hammering signs out back

35
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:15,420
when the sky started
vomiting nightmares.

36
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:17,355
I listen to a lot of AM radio,

37
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,158
so I knew what this meant...
the end of the world.

38
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:23,562
What I didn't expect
was what happened next.

39
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:34,290
Turns out whatever you and my brother

40
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,324
did to the Shack with
your unicorn voodoo

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,094
made the crazy place
invincible to weirdness.

42
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,133
Of course... the unicorn spell!

43
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:48,336
That's why this is the only
place Bill's magic can't touch.

44
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,439
That's when Possum
Breath over here shows up

45
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:53,175
leading a bunch of injured
stragglers through the forest.

46
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,376
They needed a place to stay,

47
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:58,480
and since the Mayor got captured,
I elected myself de facto chief.

48
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:02,084
The plan's to stay in here and
eat brown meat until we run out.

49
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:05,420
- Then I vote we eat the gnomes.
- Hey, I'm short, not deaf!

50
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:08,223
Shh! Shh!
Stress will make you chewy.

51
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:11,259
Grunkle Stan, we can't all
just hide inside the Shack.

52
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:13,161
There's a town in need of saving!

53
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:16,364
Me and Ford tried to do it,
but he got captured by Bill.

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,168
Serves that jerk right!
My brother's had some stupid plans,

55
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,438
but going up against an all-powerful
space demon was his worst one yet.

56
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:26,441
Trust me, we have everything
we need right here.

57
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:30,178
It's not the Ritz, but at least the
monsters inside know how to massage.

58
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:33,281
- You know Shiatsu?
- Yes, I've taken some classes.

59
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:35,450
So, you're really just
gonna let Bill win?

60
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:37,452
Look, kiddo.
We got a good deal here.

61
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:41,123
Besides, I'm sure wherever
the rest of the townsfolk are,

62
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:43,483
they're fine.

63
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,260
This is Shandra Jimenez

64
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:47,112
reporting live from the
inside of Bill's castle.

65
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:48,806
Here for the first time are images of

66
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,449
what's happened to
the captured townsfolk.

67
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,200
Viewers are advised to look away

68
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,502
if they don't want to see their friends

69
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:56,404
turned into a twisted
throne of human agony.

70
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,174
- Mom and Dad?
- My family!

71
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,375
Deputy Durland!

72
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,111
Is there no one who will
save the people of this town?

73
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:04,481
I'm Shandra Jimenez,

74
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:07,149
and I'm being turned into
stone by a flying eyeball.

75
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:14,055
Oh, no. My parents are bad,

76
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:17,125
but even they don't
deserve to be turned to stone.

77
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:21,263
Curse you, Bill! Why must
you take everything we love?!

78
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,151
Guys, don't you see?
Our friends need us,

79
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:28,436
but we only save them if we fight back!

80
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:32,073
Mabel is right.
Bill wants us to run and hide.

81
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:34,109
He wants us to think he's invincible.

82
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:36,044
But Ford told me before he was captured

83
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,313
that he knows Bill's secret weakness.

84
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,451
- Weakness?
- Now, if we band together,

85
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:47,222
if we combine all of
our strength, our smarts,

86
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:51,359
- our... whatever Toby has...
- Aureus rashes!

87
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:54,029
...then we just might
be able to rescue Ford,

88
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:57,199
learn Bill's weakness,
and save Gravity Falls!

89
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:02,070
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

90
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,072
Have you all forgotten
who's in charge here?

91
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,107
Besides, we're only safe inside!

92
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,343
It's not like we can take
the Mystery Shack to Bill.

93
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,245
Wha... Whoa!

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,181
Holy hootenanny!
Flapjack and fiddlebanjos!

95
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:15,083
Sorry. Sorry.
Got a little excited.

96
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,986
What I meant to say is,

97
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:21,022
I think I figured out a way
to fight Bill and rescue Ford.

98
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:23,191
But we're all gonna
have to work together!

99
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:27,062
Now...
if you just...

100
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:32,017
Don't worry, Ford.
We're coming for you!

101
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:39,074
Let me go!
You insane three-sided...

102
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:41,219
Wha... What is this place?

103
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,347
♪ We'll meet again ♪

104
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:49,050
♪ Don't know where, don't know when ♪

105
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:54,122
♪ Oh, I know we'll meet
again some sunny day ♪

106
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,257
Wh... Where am I?

107
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,225
You're in the penthouse suite, kid!

108
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:59,394
The tip of the pyramid! Have a drink.

109
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:02,097
Make yourself comfortable.

110
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:05,400
You know that couch is
made from living human skin?

111
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:09,371
Quit the games, Cipher!

112
00:06:09,406 --> 00:06:12,207
If I'm still alive, you
must want something from me.

113
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:16,177
Ah, sharp as ever, Fordsy.
As you may have noticed...

114
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:19,114
I've recently had a
multi-dimensional makeover!

115
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:21,182
I control space and matter,

116
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:23,268
and now that that dumb
baby's out of the way,

117
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,020
time itself!

118
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:27,355
- But I wasn't always this way.
- Oof!

119
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,274
You think those chains are tight?

120
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:31,443
Imagine living in the
second dimension...

121
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:34,362
flat minds in a flat
world with flat dreams.

122
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:38,199
I liberated my dimension, Stanford,
and I'm here to liberate yours.

123
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:41,136
There's just one hitch.
As it turns out,

124
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:45,040
my weirdness can't escape the
magical confines of this town!

125
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:47,208
There's something keeping me in.

126
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:51,379
Incredible! Gravity Falls' Natural Law
of Weirdness Magnetism.

127
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:53,248
I studied this years ago!

128
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:56,051
- And did you find a way to undo it?
- Of course!

129
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:58,253
There's a simple equation that
could collapse the barrier.

130
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:00,055
But I'd never tell you!

131
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,991
Listen, Ford, if you just
tell me that equation,

132
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,293
finally your dimension will be free!

133
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:09,130
Anything will be possible!

134
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:18,974
I'll remake a fun world...
a better world!

135
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,293
A party that never ends
with a host that never dies!

136
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:25,413
No more restrictions!
No more laws!

137
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,316
You'd be one of us.
All-powerful!

138
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:31,052
Greater than anything you've imagined!

139
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:33,154
And all I need is your help.

140
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,156
You're insane if you
think I'll help you.

141
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:38,093
Ha ha ha!
I'm insane either way, brainiac!

142
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:40,396
But have it your way.
I'll just fish around

143
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:43,999
and get that equation
directly out of your mind!

144
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:46,434
Not so fast!
You know the rules, Bill.

145
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:51,306
You may be able to haunt
my dreams, but you can't

146
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:54,342
enter my mind unless I shake
your hand and let you in.

147
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:59,030
You're making this so
much harder than it needs to be.

148
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,999
Everyone has a weakness, tough guy!

149
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:05,153
I'll make you talk!
It's only a matter of time.

150
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:14,988
All right. I've made some thingamadiculous
robomajigs in my day,

151
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,891
but this is the first one
that won't be used for evil!

152
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:20,727
Whoa! These blueprints
are incredible, McGucket.

153
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:22,996
This is your most
amazing invention yet.

154
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:26,967
Question: Does it have any gun-swords?
I watch a lot of anime and, uh,

155
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,770
trust me, you're gonna
want some gun-swords.

156
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:31,104
What's an "anime"?

157
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,708
- We have much to discuss.
- Discuss, nothing!

158
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:37,778
These scribbles are a bunch
of cockamamie balderdash!

159
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:38,945
Excuse my French.

160
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,148
_

161
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:43,884
And where would you even find a bunch
of idiots crazy enough to build it?

162
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,887
Grunkle Stan, you're
lookin' at those idiots.

163
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,756
Idiots!

164
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,860
_

165
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,116
Whoa... What...
What are you...

166
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:02,936
Hey... Hey, now.
Hey! Don't touch that.

167
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,004
Hey...

168
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:10,744
Uhh! Uhh!

169
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:33,749
_

170
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:37,204
Thanks for these
apocalypse sweaters, Mabel.

171
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,706
The end of the world has
never been so comfortable.

172
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:40,941
Mm-hmm!

173
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:47,948
Uhh! Fine, I'll wear it.
But I'm not gonna like it.

174
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:50,784
Admit it. This is the best
day of the end of the world.

175
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,819
I think we actually have
a chance to beat Bill

176
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:56,631
- and win back our future.
- Yeah. Getting to actually live to see our

177
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,160
13th birthday party is the only
birthday present I want right now.

178
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:02,839
Hey, if we're lucky enough
to get there, I guarantee

179
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,483
this whole town is gonna
throw you the best birthday

180
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:08,068
- party you've ever seen.
- Thanks, Soos.

181
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,203
Hey, has anyone seen Grunkle Stan?

182
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,072
This whole plan is bonkers.

183
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:14,808
But of course, no one asked
the Chief what he thinks.

184
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:18,144
- After all I've done for everyone!
- Schmebulock.

185
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,114
Yeah, exactly... it's a
total load of schmebulock.

186
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:26,086
Is something wrong, Grunkle Stan?
You're acting grunklier than usual.

187
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:29,973
It's this darn plan to save my brother.
If you didn't notice, I already

188
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:32,926
saved him once from that portal,
and he never thanked me!

189
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:35,996
He causes the end of the world,
and somehow it's still always

190
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:38,832
"Stan's the screw-up, Ford's the hero."

191
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,834
Well, maybe people think he's a hero

192
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:43,003
because he didn't want to
hide in the Mystery Shack!

193
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:46,172
Well, maybe if he hid in the Mystery
Shack he wouldn't have been captured!

194
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,976
Guys! Guys! Trust me,
tomorrow's gonna be great!

195
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:52,779
- I believe in us.
- Help! Leader Mabel!

196
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:55,181
I keep accidentally
flexing through my sweater!

197
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,250
It happened again!

198
00:10:57,286 --> 00:11:01,988
Those weird cow-monsters
are delightful! Coming!

199
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,929
All right, fellas!

200
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:12,098
Let's hope this turns out
better than my other inventions!

201
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:15,001
Everybody ready?
Dipper, now!

202
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:28,098
Huh?! Whoa!

203
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:39,025
Forgive me, boy. Your
hyper-flammable merchandise

204
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,027
is the only thing keeping me goin'.

205
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:44,164
What in blazes?!

206
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:50,203
No! No! Nooo!

207
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,873
Ready to talk now?

208
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:57,961
I won't.
I won't let you into my mind!

209
00:11:57,996 --> 00:12:01,164
What do you think, pals?
Another 500 volts?

210
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:02,749
Hey, do you hear that?

211
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,924
What?!
I just fixed that door!

212
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:24,070
It's the Shacktron, dude!

213
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:27,907
They made the house into a robot.
Fascinating!

214
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:32,112
So the mortals are trying
to fight back, huh? Adorable!

215
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:37,851
Henchmaniacs, you know
what to do! Take them out!

216
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:48,995
This was a bad idea.

217
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,513
Uh, hey, dudes. Is this thing on?

218
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:56,349
Tes...

219
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,617
Heh. Uh, I just wanted you monster dudes

220
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,254
to hand over Ford, or we'll
have to, like, fight and junk?

221
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,390
Hey, you're a little cutie.

222
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:08,227
I have butchered millions
on countless moons!

223
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:10,396
Whoa. I liked you
better before you talked.

224
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:12,381
Real... real bring-down, this guy.

225
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,333
Attack!

226
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:16,402
All right, dudes!

227
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,337
Everyone! Like we planned!

228
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:20,506
Three, two, one. Go!

229
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,720
Ha ha ha! Good pig.

230
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,359
Get 'em, Gobblewonker!

231
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,280
Hyah! Hyah!

232
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:46,365
Oh, no, you don't!

233
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,775
Everyone! Incoming!

234
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,276
Does this thing have an escape hatch?

235
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:11,257
Everybody! Maximum power!

236
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:14,643
And... now!

237
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:27,606
Guys, seriously?
You had, like, one job to do here.

238
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:29,708
Bravo, Dipper and Mabel!

239
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,412
Well, would ya look at that?
Those kids really care about you.

240
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:34,713
And you care about them.

241
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,582
Don't you?

242
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:38,717
What are you... Oh. Oh, no.

243
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,620
Perhaps torturing
those kids will make you talk!

244
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:44,490
No. No! Not the kids! You ca...

245
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,259
Lets get this over with.

246
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:02,408
What the... No!
No! No! No! No!

247
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,212
Attack!

248
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,353
My eye!
Do you have any idea

249
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:16,355
how long it takes to regenerate that?

250
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,357
We've got him distracted!
Now's our chance!

251
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:21,416
Rescue team, move out!

252
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,470
OK, everyone!
We get in, rescue Ford,

253
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,940
get out, save the world.
Piece of cake.

254
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:36,575
Just so we're clear,
if I die, I'm suing all of you.

255
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:39,545
Hey, on second thought,
maybe we could come up with a plan

256
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,647
that doesn't involve us
plummeting to our certain death.

257
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,249
- Now!
- Ahh!

258
00:15:49,457 --> 00:15:53,118
- Oh, man, oh, man...
- Whoo-hoo!

259
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:15,581
Oh, man.
It looks even worse up close.

260
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,389
I found Great-uncle Ford!

261
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:27,226
He's golden!
But not in the good way!

262
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,562
Great. Grab him
and let's get out of here.

263
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:33,432
- But how are we going to unfreeze them?
- I know!

264
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:40,239
Gideon! What happened to you?

265
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,274
Bill captured me.
He's been forcing me

266
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,411
to do cute dances in this
cage for all eternity.

267
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:48,447
I'm so tired of being cute!

268
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,282
How do we undo this?

269
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:52,651
Mayor Tyler.
He's the load-bearing human.

270
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:55,314
Pull him out, and the
whole thing goes down.

271
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,482
Ah. My mouth tastes like nightmares!

272
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:10,603
I think I'm dark and
tortured for reals now.

273
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:13,606
This experience will
forever scar Tad Strange.

274
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:17,755
No more sailor suits!

275
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,412
- Wendy!
- Guys!

276
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:23,582
- Mom! Dad!
- Durland!

277
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,453
My Blubs!

278
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:31,256
Don't you ever scare
me like that again!

279
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,596
Kids! Ah, you did it!

280
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:40,615
I knew I could count on you two.

281
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:44,503
Fiddldeford! I... I haven't
seen you since we parted ways.

282
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,438
You must hate me.

283
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:51,610
I've tried forgettin'.
Maybe I should try forgiving.

284
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:55,532
- Come here, old friend.
- Hey, good to see you too, bro.

285
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,316
Now let's get out of here, huh?

286
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:59,518
Listen, Uncle Ford, we
don't have a lot of time.

287
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,520
Remember how you told me
right before you were frozen

288
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:03,422
that you knew Bill's weakness?

289
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,292
- Yeah, a secret way to defeat him?
- I... I do!

290
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:10,295
Now, does anyone have a pen?
Pencil? Anything?

291
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:11,363
Ah.

292
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,532
Perfect!

293
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:17,469
Uh, we've got Bill outside,

294
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:19,638
but I don't know how long
we can keep him occupied.

295
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,473
Yes, yes. Good, good.

296
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:24,576
Drawing a circle on the floor.
Well, he's lost his mind.

297
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:28,313
My mind is fine. And there is
a way to beat him... with this!

298
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,352
The world's most confusing
game of hopscotch?

299
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:34,653
No, a prophecy.

300
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:37,573
Although it would be
a pretty fun game of hopscotch.

301
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,659
Many years ago,
I found ten symbols in a cave.

302
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,530
Some I recognized then.
Some I only recognize now.

303
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:48,217
The native people of Gravity Falls
prophesized that these symbols

304
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,636
could create a force strong
enough to vanquish Bill.

305
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,047
With Bill defeated,
his weirdness would be

306
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,424
reversed and the town could be saved.

307
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:58,277
This whole time I thought
it was just superstition.

308
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:01,480
But seeing you all here now
I finally understand that it's destiny!

309
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,450
Dipper, the pine tree.

310
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:06,552
Mabel, the shooting star.

311
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:10,522
The question mark.
This one's unsolvable.

312
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:12,524
That one's easy.

313
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,461
You've been rockin' that dumb
hoodie since the seventh grade.

314
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:18,297
Whoa. Destiny hoodie!

315
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,632
The tent of telepathy sign!
That must be Gideon.

316
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:23,402
Whoo!
An excuse to stand next to Mabel!

317
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:27,239
- Don't turn this into a big deal.
- Oh, I won't.

318
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:28,640
I will.

319
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,314
What the...

320
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,634
Hey, Achilles!

321
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:41,620
Nice work with the heel!

322
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:44,389
Fore!

323
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,697
Hold hands, everyone! This is
a mystical human energy circuit.

324
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,333
Ice? Who's Ice?

325
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:56,435
They symbol's needn't
all be literal, Dipper.

326
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,271
It just has to be someone
cool in the face of danger.

327
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,706
Wendy! Wendy!

328
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,609
Shut up, you guys.

329
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:07,579
Much like the spectacles
need to be someone scholarly.

330
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:10,649
- Heh heh!
- This is freaky.

331
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:12,618
Now hold hands, everyone.

332
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:14,670
Ew! I'm not touching that.

333
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:17,674
Do it, sweetie. Do the
one thing no one in our

334
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,626
family has ever done...
touch the hillbilly.

335
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:33,438
Great-uncle Ford, I think it's working!

336
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,741
Yes, this is it!

337
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,377
The rest of you get out!
It's too dangerous!

338
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:42,314
We just need one more person...

339
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:47,553
Stanley! Stanley, get over here!
You're the only one left.

340
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:49,488
You realize this is
a bunch of hogwash, right?

341
00:20:49,523 --> 00:20:52,658
You really think some caveman graffiti
is gonna stop that monster?

342
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:54,760
Dang it, old man, now's not the time!

343
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,953
- Come on!
- What are you doing? You're gonna ruin this!

344
00:20:57,954 --> 00:21:00,265
I've never held hands this
long, and I very uncomfortable!

345
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,334
Whoa. Hey, I'm not
the enemy here, people.

346
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,703
Don't forget who literally
created the end of the world.

347
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm sorry, Stanley. I know.
Just help me fix it! Please!

348
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:11,610
Fine. Just do one thing.
Say "thank you."

349
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,579
- What?
- I spent thirty years

350
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,447
trying to bring you
back into this dimension,

351
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,416
and you still haven't thanked me!

352
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:21,420
You want me to shake your hand?
Say "thank you"!

353
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:24,723
- Fine. Thank you.
- Now, see?

354
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:27,659
Between me and him, I'm
not always the bad twin.

355
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:30,262
Between "him and me."

356
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:32,531
Grammar, Stanley.

357
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:35,701
I'll "Grammar, Stanley"  you,
you stuck-up son-of-a...

358
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,502
Don't jeopardize this, you idiot!

359
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:39,721
- Everything's on the line!
- Stop it!

360
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,475
Join hands!

361
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,611
Oh, no, it's Bill!

362
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:48,597
Right? Isn't that what
you're all thinking?

363
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:52,517
Hey, Gideon, why aren't you dancing?
Chop chop, huh?

364
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,457
Ha ha ha ho!
This is just too perfect!

365
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:03,227
Didn't you brainiacs know
the zodiac doesn't work

366
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:06,430
if you don't all hold hands?
And what's better,

367
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:08,999
you've brought every
threat to my power together

368
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:11,001
in one easy-to-destroy circle!

369
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:13,303
Oh, no!

370
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:17,274
- My hair!
- My hair also!

371
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,278
You guys want to see what
happens to your friends

372
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:23,113
when you can't get along?

373
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:26,383
- Hey! You give them back!
- You've gone too far, Cipher!

374
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:29,804
Yeah! We're not scared of you!

375
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:32,089
Oh, but you should be.

376
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:39,163
Oh, no!

377
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:44,068
You know, this castle could
really use some decoration!

378
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:52,309
Looks like it's too late
for your friends, Stanford!

379
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:54,478
Kids!

380
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:57,081
But you can still save your family!

381
00:22:57,116 --> 00:23:00,150
Last chance: Tell me how
to take Weirdmageddon global

382
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:01,285
and I'll spare the kids!

383
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,105
- No! Don't do it!
- Yeah! Bill makes bad deals!

384
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:10,194
Don't you toy with me, shooting star!
I see everything!

385
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:13,363
Ow! Not again!
Why?! Every time!

386
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:15,232
Nice shot, pumpkin!

387
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:17,367
I just regenerated that eye!

388
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:21,238
I know that hurts, because I've
accidentally done it to myself...

389
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:23,240
multiple times!

390
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:31,014
Save yourselves!
Run! We'll take care of Bill!

391
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,717
What?! That's a suicide mission!

392
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:36,470
- Trust us. We've beat him before...
- and we'll beat him again!

393
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:42,309
Hey, Bill!
Come and get us, you pointy jerk!

394
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,331
What? No! It's too dangerous!

395
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:52,152
Not so fast! You two wait here!

396
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:56,340
I've got some children
I need to make into corpses!

397
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,442
See ya real soon!

398
00:23:58,477 --> 00:24:00,896
Bill, no!

399
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:06,049
- Oh! What do we do? What do we do?
- Kids!

400
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:11,421
When I get my hands on you kids,

401
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:14,458
I'm gonna disassemble your molecules!

402
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:20,330
You've tricked me for the last time!

403
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,004
Ohh! I can't believe this!

404
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,106
The kids are gonna die,
and it's all my fault...

405
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:32,122
because I couldn't
shake your stupid hand!

406
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:36,013
Ahh, Dad was right about me.
I am a screw-up.

407
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:39,233
Ah, don't blame yourself. I'm
the one who made a deal with

408
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:42,419
Bill in the first place. I
fell for all his easy flattery.

409
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:45,389
You would have seen him
for the scam artist he is.

410
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:48,358
How did things get so
messed up between us?

411
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:50,327
We used to be like Dipper and Mabel.

412
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:52,329
The world's about to end
and they still work together.

413
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:55,098
- How do they do it?
- Easy. They're kids.

414
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:57,301
They don't know any better.

415
00:24:57,336 --> 00:24:58,435
Whoa, where you goin'?

416
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,304
I'm gonna play the
only card we have left.

417
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,239
Let Bill into my mind.

418
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:05,442
He'll be able to take over the
galaxy, and maybe even worse,

419
00:25:05,477 --> 00:25:07,978
but at least he might
let the kids free.

420
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:09,346
What?! Are you kiddin' me?!

421
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:12,082
Are you honestly telling me
there's nothing else we can do?!

422
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:13,450
Bill's only weak in the mind space.

423
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,452
If I didn't have this
darn plate in my head,

424
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:18,121
we could just erase
him with the memory gun

425
00:25:18,157 --> 00:25:20,090
when he steps inside my mind.

426
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,458
What if he goes into my mind?

427
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:24,194
My brain isn't good for anything.

428
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,197
There's nothing in your mind
he wants. It has to be me.

429
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,082
We need to take his deal.

430
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:31,301
It's the only way he'll agree
to save you and the kids.

431
00:25:31,337 --> 00:25:34,037
Do you really think he's
gonna make good on that deal?

432
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,139
What other choice do we have?

433
00:25:39,345 --> 00:25:42,279
I'm starting to think
there's no way out of here.

434
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:46,116
Like Grunkle Stan always says,
when one door closes,

435
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:49,286
choose a nearby wall and
bash it in with brute force!

436
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:55,225
Ha! Now let's round up the townsfolk,

437
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:58,295
and together we can defeat...
Oh, no!

438
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:05,369
- You'll never take us alive, monsters!
- That's fine with us!

439
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:10,140
- Oh, no!
- Peek-a-boo!

440
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,813
All right, Ford, time's up!

441
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:20,117
I've got the kids!

442
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:23,353
I think I'm gonna kill one of
'em now, just for the heck of it!

443
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:28,358
Eeenie-meenie...
minee...

444
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:30,776
Wait!

445
00:26:31,497 --> 00:26:32,996
I surrender!

446
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:35,332
Good choice.

447
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:38,335
Don't do it, Ford!
It'll destroy the universe!

448
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,405
It's the only way!

449
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:45,976
Even when you're about to die, you
Pines twins just can't get along!

450
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:51,164
My only condition is that you
let my brother and the kids go.

451
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:52,332
Fine.

452
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:54,318
No, Grunkle Ford!
Don't trust him!

453
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,090
It's a.... deal!

454
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:20,344
Oh, I'm here. I'm finally here!

455
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:24,314
Look at this place...
a perfect, calm, orderly void.

456
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,249
Gotta hand it to you, Ford,

457
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:29,252
you really know how to clear your...

458
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:32,022
What?!

459
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:35,158
Ha ha! Do a pretty good
impression of my brother, don't I?

460
00:27:35,194 --> 00:27:37,260
Switch clothes and no
one can tell us apart.

461
00:27:37,296 --> 00:27:41,054
Welcome to my mind.
Surprised you didn't recognize it.

462
00:27:49,308 --> 00:27:52,084
What?! The deal's off!

463
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:55,345
What the... No, no, no, no!

464
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:57,447
Oh, yeah.
You're goin' down, Bill.

465
00:27:57,483 --> 00:27:59,232
You're gettin' erased.

466
00:27:59,284 --> 00:28:01,368
Memory gun. Pretty clever, huh?

467
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:06,356
Y-You idiot! Don't you realize
you're destroying your own mind too?

468
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:09,376
Eh. It's not like I was using
this space for much anyway.

469
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:11,161
Let me out of here! Let me...

470
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,997
Oh... Why isn't this working?!

471
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:17,300
Hey, look at me. Turn around and
look at me, you one-eyed demon!

472
00:28:17,336 --> 00:28:20,337
You're a real wiseguy, but
you made one fatal mistake.

473
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:22,305
You messed with my family.

474
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:24,091
You're making a mistake!

475
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:26,343
I'll give you anything...
money, fame, riches,

476
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:30,313
infinite power, your own galaxy!
Please! No!

477
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,983
What's happening to me?!

478
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:42,025
Staaanleeey!

479
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:56,832
Heh. Guess I was good
for something after all.

480
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:20,297
Hey! Hey!

481
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,067
- Oh...
- Ohh!

482
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:44,421
Whoa. Huh.

483
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:07,010
Oh, my gosh!
Grunkle Stan, you did it!

484
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:11,381
Oh, uh, hey there... kiddo.
What's your name?

485
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:15,452
- Grunkle Stan?
- Heh. Who ya talkin' to?

486
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:20,090
C-Come on. It's me.
It's me, Grunkle Stan!

487
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,425
Grunkle Stan, it's me!

488
00:30:22,461 --> 00:30:27,063
We had to erase his mind to
defeat Bill. It's all gone.

489
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:29,199
Stan has no idea, but he did it.

490
00:30:29,234 --> 00:30:32,302
He saved the world.
He saved me.

491
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:37,474
You're our hero, Stanley.

492
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:10,073
Hey, this is a real
nice place ya got here.

493
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:13,143
It's your place, Grunkle Stan.

494
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:15,278
Don't you remember?
Even a little?

495
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:18,148
Nope, but this chair hugs
my butt like it remembers.

496
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:20,050
Ah.

497
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:23,486
Hey, why the long faces?

498
00:31:23,522 --> 00:31:25,488
You guys look like
it's someone's funeral.

499
00:31:25,524 --> 00:31:29,259
Who's that big guy crying
in the corner?

500
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:31,494
We saved the world,
but what's the point?

501
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,130
Grunkle Stan's not himself anymore.

502
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,133
There's gotta be something
we can do to jog his memory!

503
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:40,103
There isn't.
I'm sorry. Stan's gone.

504
00:31:40,138 --> 00:31:42,405
I know my Grunkle
is in there somewhere!

505
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:46,766
There's gotta be something around
here that can help bring him back!

506
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:51,147
This'll work! This has to work!

507
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,700
Here's the first day we came
to Gravity Falls, Grunkle Stan.

508
00:31:53,735 --> 00:31:57,420
And here's a macaroni
interpretation of my emotions.

509
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:05,145
That time we went fishing.
That Summerween we spent together.

510
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,546
Don't you remember anything?

511
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:09,149
I'm sorry.
I don't know what this is

512
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:12,152
or who you are or...
Gah! Quit it, Waddles!

513
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:13,386
I'm trying to remember my life story!

514
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:15,112
What did you say?

515
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:16,456
I said get Waddles off of me!

516
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:18,625
It's working! Keep reading!

517
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,260
Skip to my page!

518
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:22,429
He needs to remember our
boss-employee relationship.

519
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:24,197
Hey! Just cause I have amnesia,

520
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:25,598
don't go tryin' to give
yourself a raise, Soos.

521
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:28,501
- It's happening! Keep going!
- OK. OK!

522
00:32:28,537 --> 00:32:33,173
"Day Two. Grunkle Stan smells
weird but we're starting to bond.

523
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,575
He told us a lot about being
a businessman in the '80s

524
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,161
and seemed happy when
we pretended to listen.

525
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:41,498
He also gave me a grappling hook
which everyone is impressed by.

526
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,168
And in more important news,
I've met some neighborhood hotties!"

527
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:54,572
_

528
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,142
Good Morning, Gravity Falls!

529
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,245
It's another beautiful day,
but every day is beautiful

530
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,982
now that the...
unpleasantness is over.

531
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,052
Get outta here, you ornery critters!

532
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,057
Ah, good as new.

533
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,061
Oh! Looks like you've got a friend!

534
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,231
Robbie, would you be a dear and
get us the sawed off shotgun?

535
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:24,267
Ugh. Fine, whatever.

536
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:28,905
- Brains and so forth!
- Nope! None of that, thank you.

537
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,308
None of us really understand
what just happened,

538
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,077
and none of us want to.

539
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,247
That's why I'm passing
the "Never Mind All That" Act.

540
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:40,284
If anyone goes asking
around about the "events"

541
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,286
of the last few days, what do we say?

542
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,955
Never Mind All That!

543
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,191
And if you break the rules,
we're gonna zap ya!

544
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,928
Zap! Zap!
We're mad with power!

545
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,329
And love.

546
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,933
In other news,
the Northwest family has gone broke.

547
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,201
After pledging his allegiance to Bill

548
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,904
and then placing all his
savings in weirdness bonds,

549
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,072
Preston Northwest had
to sell his mansion

550
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,275
to preserve his family fortune.

551
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,659
You're only going to have one pony now!

552
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:16,185
But fortunes have also turned for
local maniac Fiddleford McGucket

553
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,254
who, after regaining his sanity,

554
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,356
has made millions overnight
submitting his patents

555
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,925
to the US government.

556
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,029
I'm gonna buy me a bigger shed!
Hey, that one's for sale!

557
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,932
In other good news,
town hero Stanley Pines

558
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,901
has fully recovered his memory
and will be throwing a party

559
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,203
to celebrate his niece and
nephew's thirteenth birthday

560
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,005
and final day in town.

561
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,941
But other than that, I can safely say

562
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,209
our beloved Gravity
Falls is back to normal.

563
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:45,381
- And now, Bodacious T, with sports.
- It's called Death Ball!

564
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,017
♪ ...to you ♪

565
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,225
I can't believe you all got together
just to throw a party for us!

566
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,962
After all the Pines family
has done for the town,

567
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:02,265
it's the least we could do!
You've helped everyone here.

568
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,868
Thanks to y'all savin' us, I
learned to open my heart to kindness.

569
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,270
No more evil-doin'.

570
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:12,141
From now on, I'm gonna try to
be Li'l Gideon, regular ol' kid.

571
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,178
Oh... Ha ha! Whoo!

572
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,114
I am bustin' a move
on this skatin' board.

573
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:22,218
More like busting your pants, loser!

574
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,126
Hee hee hee!

575
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,363
- Dude, make a wish, dawg!
- Ya know, on my first day here,

576
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,032
if you had asked me what
I wanted, I would have said

577
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,968
adventure, mystery, true friends.

578
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,169
But looking here at all of you,

579
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:42,238
I realize that every wish came true...

580
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,042
- I have everything I wanted.
- If I had only one wish,

581
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,977
it would be to shrink all
of you with a shrink ray

582
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,345
and bring you home with us in my pocket.

583
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:53,082
But since that's impossible...
Is that impossible?

584
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,318
Since that's probably impossible,

585
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,187
my only wish is for everyone
to sign my scrapbook.

586
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:02,025
I'll never forget you guys.
Wait.

587
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,130
Now I'll never forget you guys!

588
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:15,338
I now officially declare you:
technically teenagers.

589
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,974
Welcome to Angst and Acne Forever.

590
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:19,909
One of us! One of us!

591
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,211
- Whoo-hee!
- Whoopee!

592
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:25,915
- So how do you feel?
- Samey, but differenty.

593
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,083
Hey, you two.

594
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,985
When are you gonna open
your presents already?

595
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,843
- I broke a nail wrapping them.
- Ha ha! Pacifica.

596
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,927
Stanley, I need to talk to you.

597
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,996
I didn't want to say anything
with everyone listening,

598
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,931
but we've got a problem.

599
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,534
Weirdmageddon has been
contained, but I'm detecting

600
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,103
some strange new anomalies
near the Arctic Ocean.

601
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,337
I want to go investigate it,

602
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,174
but I think I might be
too old to go it alone.

603
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,342
Are you sayin' you
need someone to help you

604
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,212
sail around the world on
the adventure of a lifetime?

605
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,916
I don't just want someone
to come with me, Stanley.

606
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,084
I want it to be you.

607
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,086
Will you give me a second chance?

608
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,189
You think we'll find treasure?
And babes?

609
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,025
Heh!
I'd say there's a high probability!

610
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,993
But what should we do
with the Mystery Shack?

611
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,930
I think the town's
had enough mystery for one lifetime.

612
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,082
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

613
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,138
Everyone, I have an
announcement to make.

614
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,941
Me and my... Heh!...
nerdy bro over here

615
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,276
have some catchin' up to do,
we're gonna be away for a while.

616
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:30,980
That's why I'm shutting down
the Mystery Shack for good!

617
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,839
You shut down your mouth for good!

618
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,188
I'm sorry, Mr. Pineses,

619
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,958
it's just that this shack is
the most magical place on Earth.

620
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:45,094
Sure, the attractions are all fake,
but dreams aren't fake.

621
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,081
Like this mermaid:
It's not just a dead fish butt

622
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:51,033
sewn to a monkey carcass,
it's a marvelous creature

623
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,236
that makes us believe
that anything is possible.

624
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,639
You shut down this shack,
and you shut down our dreams!

625
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,942
At least... my dreams.

626
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,177
Aw.

627
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:07,183
I'm sorry, Soos, it's just
there's no one around to run it.

628
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,285
At least there wouldn't be

629
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,188
if I hadn't just found
the perfect replacement.

630
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,928
Ladies and gentlemen, the Mystery Shack
is under new management!

631
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,298
You... You mean it, Mister Mystery?

632
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:26,936
You're Mister Mystery now, Soos.
Try not to burn the place down.

633
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:30,072
I'll move in immediately.

634
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,094
Do you really have to go?

635
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,096
There is still so much
we haven't done together.

636
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:58,100
Summer's over, Candy.
It's time for us to grow up.

637
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,869
But not too much.

638
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,072
I hate my dumb heart
for making me feel things!

639
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:07,176
- Cut. It. Out. Heart!
- Hey, can you punch my heart too?

640
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:10,146
No, mine!
Punch my feelings away!

641
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,918
Candy and Grenda,
thank you for being my people.

642
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,287
You'll always be my best friends.

643
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:21,857
Grunkle Stan, thanks for
wearing my Goodbye sweater.

644
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,093
Ah, it's cold out. I had to.

645
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,295
What? But it's, like,
eighty-something degrees out today.

646
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,238
Can it, Soos!

647
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:37,907
- Hey. You mean a lot to me, man.
- You too.

648
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:45,214
Something to remember me by.
Oh, and this.

649
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,177
Read it the next time
you miss Gravity Falls.

650
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:56,359
Last bus leaving Gravity Falls.
All aboard.

651
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:01,197
Guess we said goodbye to
everyone except... Waddles.

652
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,334
I... don't know how to
explain this, but...

653
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,338
Mom and Dad won't let me bring
a pig home to California, so...

654
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:12,074
you have to stay here!

655
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,915
Come on, come on!
I have to go.

656
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,951
I'm... I'm sorry, Waddles!

657
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,154
Ah! You know what?
Forget it!

658
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:29,058
I lived with this pig all summer,
now your parents are gonna have to!

659
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,395
Hey, bus guy!
This pig is coming with the kids!

660
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,998
Now, hold on a second. Bringing
animals aboard a moving vehicle

661
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,037
is strictly prohibited by...

662
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,205
Wah... W-Welcome aboard.

663
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,727
You can sit in the front row, pig.

664
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:51,113
Kids, you knuckleheads
were nothin' but a nuisance

665
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,513
and I'm glad to be rid of ya.

666
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,421
We'll miss you too, Grunkle Stan.

667
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:08,297
- Ready to head into the unknown?
- Nope.

668
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,266
Let's do it.

669
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,166
- Bye! Bye, everybody!
- I'll miss you guys too!

670
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:30,119
Bye, dudes! Bye!

671
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:42,264
If you've ever taken a road
trip through the Pacific Northwest,

672
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,069
you've probably seen a bumper sticker
for a place called Gravity Falls.

673
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,173
Well, I've moved in.

674
