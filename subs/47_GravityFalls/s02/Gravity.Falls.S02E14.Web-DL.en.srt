All right, Stan.

Another day,
another random body pain.

Uhh!

Whoa, let's not take this line.

15
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:44,815
- There's an old person in it.
- Pshht!

16
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,150
Yeah, he's probably gonna pay with,

17
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,819
like, pennies and war bonds.

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,039
Hey! For your information, I
was gonna shoplift most of this!

19
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:54,158
Security!

20
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:56,160

Aw, seriously?

Ahh. Rough start to a day,
but it's all gonna be worth it

- And we're done.

00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:14,094
Does everyone see this?

26
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:16,763
This is what a hero
looks like right here.

27
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,765
I thought we were out of light bulbs.

28
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,901
Oh, we were.
So I invented my own.

29
00:01:20,935 --> 00:01:22,186
It will last a thousand years,

30
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:24,771
and the light it emits
makes your skin softer.

31
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:27,908
- Oh!
- Never have I known such softness.

32
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:29,026
Anyway, where were you?

33
00:01:32,113 --> 00:01:35,165
Well, TV, at least you appreciate me.
Give me the good news.

All right, order, order everyone!
[banging gavel]

54
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:35,986
[laughing]
Calm down, now.

55
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:39,823
We're here to choose a mayor for
the first time in almost a century.

56
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:42,918
According to the town
charter, a worthy candidate

57
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,963
is defined as anyone
who can cast a shadow,

58
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:49,382
count to ten, and throw their
hat into the provided ring.

59
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:55,005
Well, now, I do believe I
fulfill all the requirements.

60
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:57,140
- Wait. Bud Gleeful?
- He looks good,

61
00:02:57,175 --> 00:03:00,927
- considering we threw his son in jail.
- That was a good day.

62
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,896
Now, folks, I know our family's had

63
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,931
its fair share of
whoopsie-daisies in the past,

64
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:07,934
but I'd like to make up for
it by formally announcing

65
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:10,854
my candidacy for the
Mayor of Gravity Falls!

66
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,022
Any questions?

67
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:15,826
Yes. Are you still in
contact with Little Gideon?

68
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,194
That's a great question!

69
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:19,946
I'm giving you fifty
percent off a used car.

70
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:23,166
Fifty percent?
Fifty percent?!

71
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,788
In fact, everyone look under your seats.
You get half off a used car,

72
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,040
<i>- you get half off a used car...
- Better than cash!</i>

73
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:34,761
Wow! A colorful piece of paper!
He's got my vote.

74
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:38,015
Guys, I've got a really bad feeling
about Bud Gleeful as mayor.

75
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,883
I don't know, dude,
it's not like we have

76
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,802
a lot of good mayor options.

77
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:45,806
Everyone in this town is a tad strange,
except, ironically, Tad Strange.

78
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,109
Hi, guys. Tad's the name,
and being normal's my game.

79
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,978
- Loving you, Tad!
- And I love bread.

80
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,064
It's a shame Ford isn't here.

81
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:58,151
He'd run and win
and be a great mayor.

82
00:03:58,202 --> 00:04:00,037
So, since everyone's happy,

83
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:03,240
I'll just take the oath of office now,
sound good? Gavel up.

84
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,742
[all gasp]
Hold it right there, Bud!

85
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:07,828
I'm taking you on!
[gasp]

86
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,963
Stanford? No offense,

87
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:12,049
but you're just some
two-bit carnival barker,

88
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,835
and your head is more ears than face!

89
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:19,973
Oh, yeah? Well, your face
is more fat than... not fat!

90
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,224
[all gasp]

91
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,893
Oh, snap.

92
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:25,896
What do you say, folks?
Are we just gonna let Bud win?

93
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,015
- How about a real election?
- Get in there, hat!

94
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:32,018
[spectators cheering]

95
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,905
Well, looks like we got
some competition here, folks.

96
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,857
Which I'm fine with, totally fine with.

97
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:40,077
I was gonna let bygones
be bygones, Stan,

98
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:42,245
but you just made a powerful enemy.

99
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,781
I'll win either way, and when I do,

100
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:48,221
you might not like the
Gravity Falls you wake up in.

101
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:49,786
[both gasp]

102
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:53,957
<i>ALL: Election! Election! Election!</i>

103
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:58,011
- Hee hee hee hee!
- Let the madness begin!

104
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:04,050
- Grunkle Stan, what are you doing?!
- Running for mayor.

105
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:05,969
Did I... Did I not make that clear?

106
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:08,855
Grunkle Stan, it's not that
we think you can't do it,

107
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,140
it's just... No, no, it's okay, Mabel.

108
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:13,424
- We don't think you can do it.
- Look, kids,

109
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,729
the mayor kicking
the bucket got me thinking.

110
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,948
I'm an old man and I'm
not getting any younger.

111
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:20,509
My dumb brother's research
is probably gonna make

112
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,036
him famous, and what do I
have to show for my life?

113
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,822
Do I really want "crooked
grifter" on my tombstone?

114
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:29,960
- How about "crooked mayor"?
- Psst. Mabel, let's talk.

115
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:31,962
I know Stan isn't the best candidate...

116
00:05:31,996 --> 00:05:34,164
heck, he's committing
voter fraud right now...

117
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,968
but Bud's definitely up to something,

118
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:39,803
and we're the only
ones who can stop him.

119
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:40,921
You're right, Dipper.

120
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:43,757
Besides, Stan has a kind of charisma.

121
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:45,892
How hard could getting him elected be?

122
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,984
- Spread the word, pig.
- All right, everybody, eyes up here.

123
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:58,021
Okay, Gravity Falls elections
are based on two events:

124
00:05:58,072 --> 00:06:01,908
<i>the Wednesday Stump Speech,
held on an actual stump,</i>

125
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:04,194
<i>and the Friday Debate, wherein
townsfolk throw bird seed</i>

126
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:06,079
<i>at the candidate they like most.</i>

127
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:08,949
<i>At the end, they
release a Freedom Eagle,</i>

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,001
<i>who will fly to the
candidate covered in more seed</i>

129
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:13,753
<i>and bestow a birdly kiss upon him,</i>

130
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:16,073
<i>anointing him mayor.</i>

131
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:18,792
I couldn't make this up
if I wanted to.

132
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:20,794
[phone rings]
Okay, Grunkle Stan,

133
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,929
are you ready for your
first radio interview?

134
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:27,133
- I got my mouth, don't I?
- Okay, you're on with the candidate.

135
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,935
<i>ANNOUNCER: You're

139
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:40,197
<i>How do you feel about
the American flag?</i>

140
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:44,117
<i>STAN: Eh. I can take it or leave it.
Too many stripes. Next question?</i>

141
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:46,152
[all grumbling]
I don't know about that.

142
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:49,739
<i>What would you do to
help educate our kids?</i>

143
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,909
Heh! Simple. Put 'em on an island
and make 'em fight for dominance.

144
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,130
<i>STAN: Also teach kids swears.
That'll bring 'em into the real world.</i>

145
00:06:57,164 --> 00:07:00,217
<i>What would you do about
the crime in Gravity Falls?</i>

146
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:02,752
Wait.
Do you mean crime in general,

147
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:04,971
or just the specific
crimes committed by m...

148
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,757
[dial tone]
Okay, interview's over.

149
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:11,061
- Candy, what's the damage?
- Your approval rating started at zero.

150
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,096
Now it's a number lower than zero.

151
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:16,733
You're meme-ing fast,
and none of them are good.

152
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:19,769
Look, Grunkle Stan, people
are like smell markers,

153
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,822
and you're black licorice.
It's not that you're unsniffable,

154
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:25,775
you just need to learn
when to keep the cap on.

155
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:29,162
From now on, maybe you should
just read our prepared remarks.

156
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:31,759
[chuckles] Sorry, kids.

157
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:34,075
I only say words
that come out of my brain.

158
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,627
If my head says,
"That lady's got an ugly baby,"

159
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:40,227
my mouth says, "Whoa, lady!
You got one ugly baby!"

160
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:46,129
- And he's insisting on speaking his mind!
- So this is an emergency.

161
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,098
The Stump Speech is in a couple of days,

162
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:51,184
and if he continues like this,
we'll lose to Bud for sure.

163
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,186
Hmm. It's a shame
there isn't some device

164
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,805
that would allow you
to control someone else.

165
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:58,141
Oh, wait. Of course.
Yes. There is.

166
00:07:58,192 --> 00:08:01,945
A long time ago I designed a prototype
for Ronald Reagan's masters.

167
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,113
