1
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:06,637
Do you have this t-shirt
in my size?

2
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:08,479
I have something
even better.

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:10,041
Behold! my butt!

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,143
( Both laugh )

5
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:14,285
(Whispers) I could
play this game
forever.

6
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:16,647
What'd you say?
Coughing! I was coughing!

7
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:18,649
Those weren't words!
Ha ha ha ha!

8
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,021
This if fun,
what you two have.

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,224
Mabel! how long have you
been standing there?

10
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,625
Don't worry about that.

11
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,498
Let's talk about why
I'm doing this dance!

12
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:29,230
( Sings melody )

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,332
Oh no! She got into
the smile dip again!

14
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,563
Wrong one thousand!

15
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:36,207
It's because today is
the greatest day of my life!

16
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:38,109
Waa!
ow!

17
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:42,473
Sev'ral timez is playing at
the gravity falls civic center
and buffet!

18
00:00:42,473 --> 00:00:44,515
Ahh. sev'ral timez?

19
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:46,777
Aren't they that boy band
that came a decade too late?

20
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:48,549
В™є oh, oh в™є

21
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,582
в™є girl, you got me actin'
so cray cray в™є

22
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:55,686
в™є cray cray! В™є
в™є you tell me that you won't
be my baby в™є

23
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:57,788
we're not threatening!

24
00:00:57,788 --> 00:01:01,832
Mabel, you know
all those boy bands
are fake, right?

25
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:04,395
Dipper's right. They're just
a manufactured product

26
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:06,397
of the bloated corporate
music industry.

27
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:08,639
You're making my dance sad!

28
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:11,402
(Snickers)
there's probably a machine
that mass produces them.

29
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:13,544
Or maybe the boys
are grown from pods.

30
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:15,406
Yeah! pods, totally!

31
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:17,608
You guys can't
ruin this for me.

32
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:19,280
Mabel's got backup!

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,152
Hey, guys!
Whoo whoo!

34
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,514
I'm ready for the greatest
night of our lives!

35
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:26,117
В™є how many times
am I gonna love ya? В™є

36
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:27,788
в™є sev'ral timez! В™є

37
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:32,663
uhh. girls.
I know, right?

38
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:34,525
( Giggling )

39
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:35,866
I'm okay.

40
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:40,371
В™єв™є

41
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:23,774
ooh. should I got with lip balm
or lip salve?

42
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:26,377
Go wild!
Tonight's our night!

43
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:28,449
I can't wait, guys.
Tonight we're gonna meet

44
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,251
creggy g, greggy c,

45
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:33,424
leggy p, chubby z,
and deep Chris!

46
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:34,585
He's the fat one.

47
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:36,927
And those boys will
fall in love with us.

48
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:38,589
Why wouldn't they?

49
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:43,194
Hey, this is
the fingerless glove store?

50
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:44,795
I like things that are dumb.
I'm Robbie.

51
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,737
Come on, man!

52
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:49,400
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Laugh it up, chief.

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,873
So, Wendy, Nate and his
girlfriend are going to
lookout point this weekend.

54
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,207
Maybe we should go, too.
Are you kidding me?!

55
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,878
First you stand me up
last night,

56
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,911
and instead of apologizing,
you want me to go to
lookout point?

57
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,314
I'll just be...Over here.

58
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:08,359
Look, Robbie. I'm not sure
this relationship's working.

59
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:09,690
Maybe I should
see other people.

60
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:12,963
Yes!

61
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,797
Whoa. whoa. Hey. Hey.
Before you do anything crazy,

62
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,230
I, uh, I want you
to hear this.

63
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,373
(Low) hope this works.

64
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:28,309
I wrote this song
just for you.

65
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,481
( Backing track plays )
в™є when I think about you в™є

66
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,743
в™є I feel feelings so deep в™є

67
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:34,285
в™є I'm tossin' and turnin' в™є

68
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:35,886
в™є and you know
I'm losing sleep в™є

69
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:38,649
yeesh!
в™є and I know I'm goin' crazy в™є

70
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:40,751
в™є when I look
into your eyes в™є

71
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,923
в™є just listen to this song в™є

72
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:48,329
в™є and you'll be
hypnoti-yi-yized в™єв™є

73
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,362
you know, maybe I was being
a little hasty.

74
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:52,863
I'll give you
another chance.

75
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:54,505
Yes! all right!

76
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:55,936
Mwah.

77
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,268
Let me go
grab my coat.

78
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,812
All right, Robbie,
i saw that weird cd.

79
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,444
What the heck
are you up to?

80
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,916
It's called romance, kid.
Something you'd never
understand.

81
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,018
Wendy: you ready?

82
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:10,851
I can't believe you
wrote that for me.
I know.

83
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,324
I'm just so insanely talented.

84
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,427
Hm.

85
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:18,429
Hmm...

86
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:19,660
( Sniffs )

87
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,432
Mabel:
what are you doing?

88
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:23,464
Guys, the weirdest thing
just happened.

89
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:26,036
I think Robbie might be
hypnotizing Wendy
with his music.

90
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:28,769
Oh, Dipper! Girls
just like musicians.

91
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,702
You'll understand
when you're older.
We're the same age!

92
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:34,044
Girls mature
faster than guys.
Right, grenda?

93
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:36,907
Mmm...this is
grenda time!

94
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:39,510
Mmm...mmm...mmm....

95
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,783
Okay, girls,
have you all practiced

96
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,755
your obsessed boy band scream?

97
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:45,916
Aaaah!

98
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,688
Aaaah!

99
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,720
Aaaaah!

100
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,722
Just gonna
ignore that.

101
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:53,524
Tickets, please!

102
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:56,767
Too late, girls!
The show is sold out.

103
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:58,399
( All gasp )

104
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:03,604
This night is ruined!

105
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,776
I welcome you,
death.

106
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:09,510
( Grunting )

107
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,644
No! I said we're going to
meet sev'ral timez tonight,
and I meant it!

108
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,587
And I'm not gonna let
a "keep out" sign
keep us out!

109
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:20,821
В™є stockin' meat
for the apocalypse,
doodla-doo в™є

110
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,322
в™є we're all gonna die-- в™є

111
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,794
what's with
the pacing, kid?

112
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:25,496
You look even more
freaked out than usual.

113
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:27,828
Ah, I don't know.
You wouldn't understand.

114
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,361
Ah, come on, kid.
Try me.

115
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:32,463
Okay. this is gonna sound weird,

116
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:35,366
but I think Robbie might be
brainwashing Wendy with music.

117
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:38,469
I've seen this before.

118
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:40,811
Really?
her name was
Carla mccorkle.

119
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:43,914
Carla "hot pants" mccorkle...

120
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:46,817
( '50s rock plays )

121
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:50,881
Stan: me and Carla baby
would cut a rug together
at the juke joint,

122
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:54,555
our favorite '50s-themed
1970s diner.

123
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,887
Then one day,
this new age tree-hugger

124
00:05:56,887 --> 00:06:00,691
starts playing this
transcendental hippie music.

125
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:03,464
Ahh...

126
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,796
Carla's hot pants
turned into bell-bottoms

127
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:07,938
before I even
knew what happened.

128
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:14,845
My memories get
a little hallucination-y
at the end,

129
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:16,046
but you get the gist.

130
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:18,979
So, wait. You actually
believe my theory?

131
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,853
You're darn right I do,
and we're gonna get to
the bottom of it.

132
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:25,416
Right after I get
to the bottom of
this brown meat.

133
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,918
It's apoca-licious!

134
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:29,590
В™єв™є

135
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,762
в™є sev'ral timez в™єв™є

136
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,924
( delighted screams )

137
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:35,796
Hey, girl, I just want to
get real for a moment

138
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,768
and say that while
we love being superstars,

139
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:40,631
the real reason we do this is
for you, for you specifically,

140
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:42,573
not the girl
sitting next to you, but you.

141
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,475
I love you, deep Chris!

142
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:46,406
He was talking
to me!

143
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,541
Git 'em! Git 'em!

144
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,513
Thank you! Good night!

145
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,646
( Girls screaming )

146
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:57,748
Grenda: hello?
Sev'ral timez?

147
00:06:57,748 --> 00:07:00,190
We want to give you
several kisses!

148
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,592
Look!

149
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:05,756
This is it, girls.

150
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:06,857
You're finally going to meet

151
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:09,500
the five cutest boys
in the world!

152
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,834
Dipper's gonna eat his words
that boy bands are fake.

153
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,906
( Inhales, exhales )

154
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:29,980
This is fun!

155
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:35,185
Yo! we're clones, dawg!

156
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:37,958
O...
m...
g!

157
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:44,194
That is one big
hamster tube.

158
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:46,036
Someone's coming!

159
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,900
Terrible show!

160
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,872
What is wrong
with you boys?!

161
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,004
You barely even
sold out the arena!

162
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:56,176
And deep Chris,
you call that a pout?

163
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,508
( Whimpering )

164
00:07:57,508 --> 00:08:00,651
Every one of you should be
ashamed of yourselves!

165
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:03,053
Except for you, leggy p, you
were really on point tonight.

166
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:04,915
Here ya go, gorgeous.

167
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:10,060
As for the rest of you,
remember:

168
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,824
You can always be replaced
by your brothers.

169
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:16,727
Dance for me, child, dance!!!

170
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:23,033
( Laughs, coughs )

171
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,935
My throat is killin' me!

172
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:27,578
Can someone get me
a lemon and water?

173
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,710
Ooh!
who goes there?

174
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,042
Prepared to be danced at!

175
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,916
Step off, deep Chris!

176
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,719
She's a lady.
Don't disrespect her, bro!

177
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,521
Don't disrespect!
Mah bad. (Kisses)

178
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,853
( Squeals )

179
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:46,697
Chubby z, let's calm this boo
by posin' for her, poster-style!

180
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:51,231
Whoo! trying hard not to
let my brain explode!

181
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,303
I've always wanted
to meet you guys!

182
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:56,837
But what was the deal with
that scary chub-chub man?

183
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,639
Mr. bratzman's
our producer, yo.

184
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,742
He genetically engineered us
to be the perfect boy band, g!

185
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:02,973
But he keeps us
in cages!

186
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:04,975
That junk is straight
brutal, girl!

187
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,618
That is straight brutal,
chubby z!

188
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:10,981
Our one dream is to escape
into the real world, for real.

189
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,223
Yo, I heard tell about
these things called trees?

190
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:15,656
I don't know what they are,
but I want to kiss one!

191
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,858
But we can't disobey
Mr. bratzman!

192
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,059
He says he loves us!

193
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,161
If he loved you,
he'd set you free!

194
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,763
All: true dat.

195
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:23,934
That's a valid
perspective!

196
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:26,967
Let's go right now.

197
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,869
Me and my friends
can help you escape.

198
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,971
We're masters of stealth!

199
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,043
Yo! you'd really
do that for us, beef?

200
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:34,645
You can count on me!

201
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,947
I'm sorry, did you
just call me "beef"?

202
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,614
You see, Dipper, music has
subliminal mind control
hidden in it all the time.

203
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:45,716
If you listen closely,
even the music I play

204
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:48,258
in the gift shop has
subtle hidden messages.

205
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:50,961
Store pa:
В™єв™є... buy more keychains!

206
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:53,964
Buy more keychains!

207
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:55,966
If you want to hear
the mind-controlling messages,

208
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,297
you gotta slow down
the record.

209
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,629
Gimme that l.P.!

210
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:02,602
( Needle scratching )

211
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,904
Oh. right.

212
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,706
We're doing something
wrong here,

213
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,708
but I can't put
my finger on it.

214
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,109
( Grunting )

215
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,942
Hey, guys!
How was the concert?
And what's in the bag?

216
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,714
Uh, money. Money we stole.

217
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,716
We are criminals.
We will cut you!

218
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,988
Let's go away from here now!

219
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:19,990
Band member: Ooh! Ow!

220
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,722
Dang, girl!

221
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,200
Your tour bus is
really strange,
Mabel girl.

222
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,261
Where the feeding tubes at?

223
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:34,835
Yo, what up, girl?

224
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,066
( All giggling )

225
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,038
So when do we get
to go outside?

226
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,771
I want to cavort like
a woodland creature!

227
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,212
( Tires squeal outside )

228
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,044
(Gasps) it's your producer!

229
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,946
( Panicky chatter )

230
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,722
Hyahh!

231
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:54,124
Can't believe those boys
escaped from their cage!

232
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:56,857
You there! I found this trail
of frosted tips

233
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,829
leading to this
very location!

234
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:01,131
Have you seen any perfect boys
around here?

235
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:02,793
Only when I look
in the mirror.

236
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:03,934
Ha ha! Up top!

237
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,997
They must be
around here somewhere.

238
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:10,040
I'll find those boys
if I have to turn this town
upside-down!

239
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,241
( Goat bleating )

240
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,043
Shoo! shoo!

241
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,676
Grrr!

242
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,309
Good boy.

243
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,911
Guys, it's not safe
out there.

244
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:22,312
Ergman's still
looking for you!

245
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:24,915
What do we do?
Oh, dang!
I'm scared, Mabel!

246
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:27,217
Don't worry, guys,
he has to give up eventually.

247
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:29,990
Hey, in the meantime,
you can stay here with us!

248
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,922
( Enthused chatter )
2013!

249
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:34,965
Girls, do you realize
what's happening here?

250
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:37,167
We have our very own
pet boy band

251
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,269
that we can do
whatever we want with!

252
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,902
Remember, eventually
we have to let them go.

253
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,905
We have to promise not to get
too attached to them.

254
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,037
Right, Mabel? Mabel?

255
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:48,839
All aboard the braid train!

256
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,081
Braid, braid!

257
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:53,914
What?

258
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,787
В™є come on, baby, won't you
fly away with me в™є

259
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:59,189
в™є take my hand, it's destiny в™є

260
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:01,952
в™є we don't need nobody
if we stay together в™є

261
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:04,054
в™є girl, just take my hand,
it can be forever в™є

262
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:06,997
в™є up into the sky,
girl, we're gonna fly в™є

263
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:09,429
в™є look into my big blue eyes в™є

264
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,062
в™є girl, you know it's destiny в™є

265
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:14,865
в™є take my hand
and you're gonna see в™є

266
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,967
в™є let's escape,
runnin' from reality в™є

267
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:21,071
в™є it'll be this way
forever в™єв™є

268
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:23,874
just a--
just a few more minutes.
But--

269
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:24,945
( hissing )

270
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:29,279
All right.

271
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,922
Took all day,
but I converted it
to a record.

272
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:35,425
Now we can slow it down
to see if the mind control
message theory is correct.

273
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:37,287
Prepare to have
your mind blown.

274
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:39,129
Spit take, here I come.

275
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,933
Robbie:
в™є when I think about you в™є

276
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:46,296
в™є ( slowed down ) I feel
feelings so deep в™є

277
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:49,269
в™є I'm tossing and turning в™є
hmm.

278
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,102
В™є (continues)
That's now spit-worthy.
What gives?

279
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:53,974
What? is that it?

280
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,847
( Changing record speed)

281
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:58,778
Ohh! this was so stupid!

282
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,011
Of course there's no
hidden mind control messages!

283
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,383
Mabel was right.
Wendy just likes the song.

284
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,386
She just likes Robbie.
(Door opens)
Wendy: Hey, dip.

285
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,188
Forgot my keys.

286
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,060
What's up, junior?
What are you doing,

287
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,461
trying to come up
with an equation

288
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:13,523
to make girls like you?
Ha ha ha!

289
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:15,295
Ready to go
to lookout point?

290
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,027
Am I. Later, dorks.

291
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:18,969
Catch you on
the rewind.

292
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,030
I made that up.

293
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,471
I'll rewind
your face!

294
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:24,474
Wait a minute.
Stan, rewind!

295
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:29,079
( Playing backwards )
в™є you are now under
my control в™є

296
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,011
в™є your mind is mine в™є

297
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:35,445
holy mackerel!
Now there's your
spit take!

298
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:39,189
Ha ha! I knew it!
It's mind control after all.

299
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:41,051
Oh, no! I gotta
save Wendy!

300
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:44,354
Finally, a good reason
to punch a teenager
in the face! Let's roll!

301
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:49,029
How'd it go up there?

302
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,962
Ohh. I finally
got them to sleep.

303
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:55,165
Poor greggy c.
He tried to eat
a tape dispenser.

304
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:57,237
I think this is food, dawg!

305
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,472
Yo, you gonna share that?

306
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:04,514
Ah, memories.

307
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:06,416
The music industry
was shaken today

308
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,920
at the news that
boy band king ergman bratzman
has been arrested.

309
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,221
He was pulled over tonight

310
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:13,323
for not having
a rear license plate.

311
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:16,286
I'm telling ya,
the goat took it!

312
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:18,258
That's what
they all say.

313
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:21,061
He is now in county jail
awaiting trial.

314
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,294
Yes!
we have to tell the boys
they are free now!

315
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:26,236
( Nervous laughter )

316
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:28,068
Let's go!

317
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:30,901
Not so fast!

318
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:32,572
They're not going anywhere.

319
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,974
( Both gasp )

320
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:39,449
What the dealio, Mabel?

321
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:42,212
That evil producer is gone.
We have to tell the boys!

322
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:45,115
Wait, girls, let's not
be so hasty. I mean,

323
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:47,587
think about it:
If we don't tell the boys,

324
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,159
then they can
stay here with me.

325
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,560
I mean with us.

326
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,562
Mabel, we can't keep
them here forever.

327
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:54,024
But I love them!

328
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:56,166
If you love them,
you'd set them free.

329
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,929
Never! every boy I loved
this summer has left me,

330
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:00,530
and I'm not gonna
let it happen again!

331
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,034
Candy, we gotta
get past mable!
She's gone boy-crazy!

332
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:06,506
Uhh! boys!!!

333
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,907
( Growls )

334
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,180
Candy...attack!

335
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:13,183
Whoa!
dang!

336
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:15,685
You guys! Ergman bratzman
is in jail!

337
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:17,287
You're free!
Just go!

338
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:19,449
Whoa! is that true,
Mabel dawg?

339
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:21,551
Uh, no. Your producer's
still out there.

340
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,624
You're gonna
have to stay here--
probably forever!

341
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,456
What?! you can't
listen to her!

342
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:28,158
Mabel's our girl, girl.

343
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:30,230
She puts pizza
in our food trough.

344
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,003
She changes my newspaper,
yo. She's a'ight.

345
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:35,605
She is not a'ight,
chubby z!

346
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,437
Sev'ral timez!

347
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,668
All:
yes, Mabel dawg?

348
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:42,172
Remove these two
from the premises,
please.

349
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:44,374
В™єв™є

350
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:47,547
oh, no! They're
aggressively
dancing at us!

351
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,949
Mabel's gone mad
with power!

352
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,681
Save yourselves,
sev'ral timez!

353
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:54,024
You were better off
with your producer!

354
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:55,185
Word!

355
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:57,187
Call me, deep Chris!

356
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,628
2013!

357
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:01,161
( Deep sigh )
thanks, you boys.

358
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,593
Now let's get aboard
the braid train.

359
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:05,365
Things just got
pretty heavy, Mabel.

360
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,537
Maybe we should all just like
chill for a minute, and--

361
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:10,540
I said, let's get aboard
the braid train!!!

362
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,202
Ohh.
hmm.

363
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:17,077
We gotta warn Wendy
about that song before
she gets brainwashed!

364
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,749
Road safety laws,
prepare to be ignored!

365
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:23,413
( Collision sounds )

366
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:28,688
Huh. weird.
Nate didn't show up.

367
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,291
So i-i guess
it's just you and me.

368
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,563
This isn't what
i was planning at all.

369
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,467
Stan: whoa! Ooh!

370
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:40,530
Wendy! stop!
Robbie's been lying to you!

371
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,672
Dipper?
kid? Mr. pines?

372
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:44,604
That's Mr. pines to you!

373
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,376
What? that's what
i just said.

374
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:48,638
Look, Wendy.
You've gotta
hear this.

375
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,612
Mabel, you've gotta hear this.

376
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,045
It's a song we wrote
to say thank you.

377
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:56,616
Hit it!

378
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,088
В™єв™є

379
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:01,491
oh boy! Songs are like hugs
that mouths give to ears!

380
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:05,395
В™є here comes
young Mabel girl в™є

381
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:08,027
в™є we've dreamed of bein' free в™є

382
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,331
в™є but now we know
that can never be в™є

383
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,633
в™є you know what friends
are all about в™є

384
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,705
в™є you kicked those lyin'
shorties out в™є

385
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:18,438
в™є kick 'em out, y'all в™є
I'm starting to
feel guilty here.

386
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,809
В™є break it down! В™є

387
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,711
в™є who's the girl
who's so a'ight в™є

388
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:23,613
в™є tucks us into bed at night в™є

389
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:25,515
в™є holds the fan up
while we sing в™є

390
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:27,517
в™є keeps me entertained
with string в™є

391
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:29,679
в™є my shirt was wrinkled
till she pressed it в™є

392
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,681
в™є chews our food
so we can digest it в™є

393
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,683
в™є he was evil,
mean and reckless в™є

394
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:36,055
в™є you gave me
this candied necklace в™є

395
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,687
в™є what's up, girl? В™є

396
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:40,330
в™є other folks
we could never trust в™є

397
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,661
в™є but we know в™є

398
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,134
в™є that you'd never
lie to us в™є

399
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:46,096
в™є Mabel, girl в™є

400
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:49,369
в™є we know you
love us so в™є

401
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:54,504
and that's why I've got
to let you go. (Sighs)

402
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:57,147
В™є when I think about you в™є
uh...

403
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,179
There's a message
in there, I swear!

404
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,780
Let me just
close the window.

405
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,353
Wait! wait! Here.

406
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:05,685
В™є you are now
under my control в™є

407
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,617
в™є your mind is mine в™є

408
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:09,659
ohh!

409
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:12,162
Robbie, what's that
doing in our song?

410
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:14,624
Baby, I promise.
I don't know anything
about those messages.

411
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,796
In fact, I didn't
even write that song.

412
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,598
I ripped it off
some other band.

413
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,729
So we're all good,
right?

414
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,701
No! we're not all good.

415
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,574
I don't care about the messages.
You said you wrote that song
for me,

416
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:27,477
and I actually
thought it was sweet,
you big liar!

417
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:29,839
I know, I know,
i lie about a lot of stuff.

418
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,542
Like using your makeup
and fighting a bear.
Although--

419
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:35,615
no. you know what?
It's over, Robbie.
We're through.

420
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,716
What?! Wendy!

421
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:37,787
Good-bye.

422
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:40,890
Ha ha! We won!

423
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,553
Kid, this is a victory
for every guy whose hands

424
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:45,895
are too weak or fat to
play a musical instrument.

425
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:48,198
I couldn't have done it
without you, grunkle Stan.

426
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:49,599
Ha!
ha!

427
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,602
Um, hey! Now that
your night is free,

428
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:55,565
me and grunkle Stan
were thinkin' maybe
bowling or something?

429
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:57,607
Are you serious?
Right now?

430
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:00,270
Uhh! what is wrong with guys?!

431
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,841
You only think
about yourselves!

432
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,644
All of you should just
leave me alone!

433
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:08,718
Ohh, man.
Look, if it makes you
feel any better,

434
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:10,750
the apocalypse
is coming soon.

435
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,623
Bury your gold.
You've been buying
gold, right?

436
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:18,558
We've gotta
save the boys.

437
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,590
I'm prepared to
defend myself.

438
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,594
Hi, guys. I'm sorry
i went bonkers.

439
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:27,367
A catchy song made me realize
that you were right.

440
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,568
Can you ever forgive me?

441
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,169
Of course!

442
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,671
Friendship repaired.

443
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,503
What's goin' on,
Mabel girl?

444
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,745
You said you had something
you wanted to show us
or some deal?

445
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:38,278
Yep, this!

446
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,280
Oh! huh? Yo, dawg,

447
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,452
who is this big,
round, bright fool?!

448
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:44,584
That, chubby z,
is the sun!

449
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,557
That fool's making my eyes
burn straight painful!

450
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:49,389
I'm gonna stare
that fool down.

451
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,690
Hrrrrgg...

452
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,223
Aaaah!!!

453
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:55,725
Yo, yo, hold up.
What this big
green mess?

454
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:57,567
That's nature, deep Chris.

455
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,499
Bratzman won't
bother you anymore.

456
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,231
You can do anything
you want to do,

457
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:03,503
go anywhere
you want to go.
You're free!

458
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,605
Fuh-ree?

459
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,577
Free!
you're free!

460
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:09,439
It means you can
skedaddle!

461
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,381
( Crying )
now, go! Go!

462
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:17,747
Get out of here
before I change my mind!

463
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:27,857
В™є good-bye, girl в™єв™є

464
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,730
they won't last a week.

465
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:34,764
Women! they're the real
mystery, dip!

466
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:38,408
You ruin your date,
drop their hippie boyfriend's
Van into a ravine,

467
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:39,969
and somehow you're
the bad guy.

468
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:41,571
No, it's my fault.

469
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,613
I shouldn't have meddled
in Wendy's personal life.

470
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:44,974
She probably hates me now.

471
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:47,747
Ah, chin up, kid.
You were trying
to do the right thing.

472
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,750
Even though you destroyed
her relationship
and part of my car.

473
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,422
You think
she'll ever forgive me?

474
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:53,683
I bet she will.

475
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:56,456
And until then,
you can always
go bowling with me.

476
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,827
Thanks, grunkle Stan.

477
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,689
Don't mention it, kid.
( Growling, clatter outside )

478
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:01,761
Wait a second.
Is something rooting
through our trash?

479
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,363
Hey! hey!

480
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,364
Get outta here!

481
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,995
( Panting )

482
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:07,767
Darn beautiful men!

483
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,340
Always eating
out of my trash.

484
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,501
Wait. what?

485
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,845
В™є girl, you got me acting
so cray cray в™є

486
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:17,377
в™є cray cray в™є

487
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:20,450
в™є you tell me that
you won't be my baby в™є

488
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,012
в™є we're non-threatening, girl в™є
в™є yeah в™є

489
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:33,723
dang, girl.

490
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:39,799
2013.
