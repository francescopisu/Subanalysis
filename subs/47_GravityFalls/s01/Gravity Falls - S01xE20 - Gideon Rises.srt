1
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:15,286
( Screams )

2
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:16,547
( Sighs )

3
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:18,389
I just had a horrible dream

4
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:20,621
that Gideon stole the deed
to the mystery shack

5
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,323
and kicked us out

6
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:25,025
and we all had to move in
with Soos's grandma.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,397
That was no dream, dude.

8
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:28,499
( Screams )

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,462
Shh! por favor.

10
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:33,534
Uh, sorry, abuelita.

11
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,507
Oh! Soos, your grandma
is so adorable!

12
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:39,670
And her skin
is old lady soft.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,042
( Sighing )

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,545
Mabel, quit being creepy!
The news is finally on!

15
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,747
In a move that has
all of gravity falls buzzing,

16
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,379
child psychic Gideon gleeful

17
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:51,051
has taken surprise ownership
of the mystery shack,

18
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,625
previously belonging to area
shyster Stanford pines.

19
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,627
That picture's
taken out of context.

20
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:58,259
Now that you have the shack,

21
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,561
what exactly are you
planning to do with it?

22
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,563
I have a big announcement
to make today,

23
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,135
and I'd like
to cordially invite

24
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:06,597
all the good people
of gravity falls to join me.

25
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:09,570
Free admission to everyone
who wears their Gideon pins!

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,272
It's my face!

27
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,304
I just can't believe
Gideon beat us!

28
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:15,276
Normally I'm able
to save the day.

29
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,178
This is all my fault.

30
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,509
Don't worry, Dipper.

31
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,112
Looks like Mabel's gonna
have to be the hero
of the family now!

32
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:25,386
I'll defeat Gideon
with my grappling hook!

33
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,118
Mabel, no offense,
but that grappling hook

34
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,360
has literally
never helped us once.

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,392
Oh, yeah? Jelly grab!

36
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:36,096
I vacuum the walls now.

37
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,630
So you lost the shack.
Look on the bright side, dudes.

38
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,771
Now you get to live
here with me.

39
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:42,203
Soos!

40
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,634
Hey, anyone wanna
play racecars?

41
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:45,306
They're out of batteries
but we can make pretend.

42
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,479
( Gags and coughs )
would it be a new low
if I ate that?

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,611
( Chuckles )
I'm just kidding.
I'm totally eating it.

44
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,814
We've gotta
get the shack back.

45
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,161
Hello, gravity falls!

46
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,235
( Spectators cheering )

47
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:46,297
Gideon is
the psychic-est!

48
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:49,670
He guessed
the secret ingredient
to my coffee omelet!

49
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,474
Somehow he knew
about my horrifying
secret birthmark.

50
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,906
I love that
child psychic so much!

51
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:57,478
( Grunts )
you're choking me!

52
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,310
Grandma, is that you?

53
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,681
We're in.

54
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,182
Just wanna say,
don't know what
we're doing here,

55
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,256
but I am loving these
fake moustaches!

56
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:08,259
If anyone asks,
I'm not Soos.

57
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:10,291
Ladies and gentlemen!

58
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,394
Today I am delighted
to announce my new plans

59
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,226
for the former mystery shack.

60
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:18,629
I give you gideonland!

61
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:19,730
What?!!
dude!

62
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,532
We're gonna turn
this dirty old shack

63
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:26,206
into three square miles
of Gideon-tertainment!

64
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,709
And, introducing
our new mascot,

65
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,381
li'l Gideon junior!

66
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:32,713
Boom! he's a pig!

67
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,985
Waddles! you monster!

68
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,847
All right, that's it!

69
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:38,519
Hey! hey!

70
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,951
( Grunting and panting )

71
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:43,223
Listen up, people!
Gideon's a fraud!

72
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,556
This kid broke in
and stole my property!

73
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:47,858
Arrest him, officers!
Yeah!

74
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:49,730
Such accusations!

75
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,733
Mr. pines, I recall
you gave the property to me.

76
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,705
Look, here's the deed
right here!

77
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:56,667
Well, that's all the proof
i need to see.

78
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:59,970
I love you, li'l Gideon!
Sing them funny songs!

79
00:04:01,272 --> 00:04:02,373
Hey!

80
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:04,645
( Gasping )

81
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,318
Now get off my property,
old man.

82
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,949
I'll show you
who's the old ma--

83
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,981
ow! aah! My hearing aid!
Aah! ( Grunting )

84
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:13,324
Thanks for visiting
gideonland, friends!

85
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:16,827
( Chuckles ) don't come back.
I don't care for y'all.

86
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,630
( All sigh )

87
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,332
( Grunts with exertion )

88
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:23,364
Don't worry, guys,
we'll get the shack
back somehow.

89
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,565
We better.

90
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:25,766
Wendy!

91
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,338
If I can't work
at the shack,

92
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:28,639
my dad's gonna force me
to work upstate

93
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,541
at my cousin's
logging camp.

94
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,344
What? you're leaving town?
But we need you here!

95
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:37,348
Yeah, especially Dipper,
because of his giant
crush on...

96
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:40,481
You. calyptus trees!

97
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,613
( Nervous chuckle )
the kids loves
eucalyptus trees.

98
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:45,586
( Chuckling )
saved it!

99
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,058
Oh, man, guys,
don't look now.

100
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:49,660
Take me back, Wendy!

101
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,593
My arms are too skinny
to keep holding this
boom box forever!

102
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,325
I was never here.
Have you been
getting my texts?

103
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:57,828
Do I need to send you
more texts? Wendy!

104
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,503
This is not good.
I cannot feed such
a big family.

105
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,375
Where will we stay, Dipper?

106
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,677
Where will I put
all my sweaters?

107
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,779
And what's Stan
gonna tell mom and dad?

108
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:12,943
Ah, Mr. pines will
figure something out.
He always does!

109
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:15,546
Don't worry, your son
and daughter are fine.

110
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:16,947
Where are we staying?

111
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:21,392
Uh, I put 'em up at this
amazing 4-star hotel!

112
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:26,026
What? uh, sure, we got...
Plenty to eat.

113
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,359
Uh, relax.
If I thought I couldn't
take care of these kids,

114
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:32,032
I'd send 'em back right away.
Uh-huh. You, too.

115
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,735
Grunkle Stan,
can we order pizza?

116
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,769
( Sighs )

117
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,017
( Laughs )

118
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:49,550
( Blows whistle )
back to your corner!

119
00:05:54,124 --> 00:05:56,026
I've been meanin'
to ask you, boy.

120
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,728
Shouldn't you be
celebratin' gideonland

121
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:00,130
instead of sticking your head
in that there book all day?

122
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,064
Father, have I ever told you
the true nature of this book?

123
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:07,097
It was written many years ago
by a brilliant unknown author

124
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:09,970
who learned secrets
too powerful for one man.

125
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,143
He hid his journals
where he thought no one
would ever find 'em.

126
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:15,776
Because he knew
that if the journals
were ever brought together,

127
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:20,451
they would unleash a gateway
to unimaginable power!

128
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,082
Codes and maps
have led me to believe

129
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,455
the other book's
buried somewhere
on this very property.

130
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:26,787
And I intend to find it.

131
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,460
So that's why you
wanted the mystery shack.

132
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,661
That's right, father.

133
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:32,062
It's time to begin
the search...

134
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,464
For the other journal!

135
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,501
Go, red car!

136
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,002
Go, other red car!

137
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:45,135
This would be a lot
more fun with batteries.

138
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:47,137
( Grunts )

139
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:50,110
( Clears throat )
kids, we gotta talk.

140
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,444
Look, I've been thinking,
and I can't take care
of you anymore.

141
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:55,816
I don't have a house,
or-- or a job.

142
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,118
The plan is
you're going home.

143
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,521
Your bus leaves tomorrow.
Here are your tickets.

144
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,892
But, grunkle Stan,
you can't give up.

145
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:03,794
Yeah, dude.
Look at these faces!

146
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:06,026
Be cuter, Mabel!
Your summer depends on it!

147
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,498
Look, I lost, okay?

148
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:09,700
The best thing
is for you to be
with your parents.

149
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,101
I'm sorry, kids.
Gideon won.

150
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,734
Summer's over.

151
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,737
Mr. pines! Come back!
Reconsider!

152
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,540
Mabel, that's enough!

153
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,542
If Stan won't get
our home back from Gideon,

154
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,213
then we'll have
to do it ourselves!

155
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:25,215
Gideon may have
the upper hand,

156
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:27,678
but we have one thing
he doesn't.

157
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:29,019
A grappling hook!
The journal!

158
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:32,222
Oh, the journal.
Journal!

159
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:46,036
All right.
The bus to take us
out of gravity falls

160
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,868
comes at sundown.

161
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,100
If we wanna stay in town,
we've gotta get past
those guards,

162
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,502
make it through the fence,

163
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:53,874
and get Gideon
to hand over that deed.

164
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,977
Leave that to Mabel!
Wa-cha!

165
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,049
Aah! ( grunts )

166
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:01,752
Now will you admit
the grappling hook
is useless?

167
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:02,953
Nope!

168
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:05,155
Okay, what can we use
to defeat Gideon?

169
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:07,918
Let's see. Barf fairy?

170
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,220
Yeah!
nope.

171
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,893
Butternut squash
with a human face
and emotions?

172
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,765
Yeah!
nope.

173
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:16,767
Whoa! what's this?

174
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,068
I've stared at
this page for hours.

175
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:19,770
It seems like a blueprint
to build some kind

176
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,772
of strange futuristic
super weapon--

177
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:25,806
boring! to defeat
those guards, we need
some kind of army.

178
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:28,539
Wait a minute. An army!

179
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:31,912
Mabel, that's it!
The gnomes!

180
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,044
Uh...

181
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,918
I think this is
their hiding spot.

182
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,990
I wonder what gnomes
do out here all alone
in the forest.

183
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,191
Both: aah!

184
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,624
( Scatting ) aah!

185
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,796
This, this is normal.

186
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:48,959
This is normal for gnomes.
Scrub, scrub.

187
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,862
Well, well, well!
Look who came crawling back!

188
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:54,605
Take five, Chris.
You guys keep doin'
what you're doin'.

189
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:57,938
So, changed your mind
about marrying me,
did you, Mabel?

190
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:02,272
Ew! hardly!
We need your help.
And seriously, ew!

191
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:06,146
You want our help?
After you left me
at the altar? No dice!

192
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,918
Well, what if we
were able to get you
a new queen?

193
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:09,850
One even more
beautiful than me!

194
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,883
Her name's Gideon
and she has lovely
white hair.

195
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:17,057
Whoa! mature woman, huh?
Hey, shmebulock,
get my Cologne!

196
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,029
Shmebulock!

197
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,991
Is "shmebulock"
all you can say?

198
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,934
Shmebulock.

199
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:25,135
It's a deal!

200
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,800
Waiter, give me a glass
of the strongest,

201
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,072
most expired
apple cider you've got.

202
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,804
Sure thing, Mr. pines.

203
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,175
Soos? what are you
doing here?

204
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,576
Since the mystery shack
shut down,

205
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,978
I've had to take a bunch
of part-time jobs.

206
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,151
Grave digger, bus driver,
really awesome cook.

207
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:43,113
Hey, is the kitchen
supposed to have
that much fire in it?

208
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:45,115
( Woman screams )

209
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:49,690
( Sighs ) you're
a good man-child, Soos,

210
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,991
but it's not looking good.

211
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,163
This whole town loves
Gideon and hates me.

212
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:56,196
If only they knew
how evil he really was.

213
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,168
Hey, I'm here
for you, dude.

214
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:00,801
The entire lower half
of your body is on fire.

215
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,234
Shh. we're having
a moment.

216
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:08,008
Where are you, journal?

217
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,139
Where are you?

218
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,682
Boy, I hate
to interrupt you,
but you have some guests.

219
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:12,883
What?

220
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:15,716
Give us the deed
to the shack, Gideon!
Or else!

221
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,749
Am I supposed to say,
"or else what?"

222
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:21,852
Yes, you are supposed
to say that! Now!

223
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:22,953
( Both grunt )

224
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:24,154
( Gasps )

225
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:28,358
( Laughing )

226
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:30,861
( Gasping )

227
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:35,405
You're surrounded by
an unstoppable gnome army.

228
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:38,068
Now give us back our deed
and get off our property!

229
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:41,011
And let the marriage
ceremony begin!

230
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:45,175
( Sighs ) very well.
I suppose this deed
belongs to--

231
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:49,049
( shrill whistle )

232
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,182
Ha! what do you know?
Works on gnomes, too.

233
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:53,884
Stop! we'll do anything!

234
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,856
How can we serve you,
your majesty?

235
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,988
The most beautiful girl
we've ever seen!

236
00:10:57,988 --> 00:11:00,060
I am not a girl!

237
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,663
Really? but your
skin is so soft.
You moisturize or...

238
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,165
Subdue them!

239
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,938
( Overlapping grunting )

240
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:10,801
I have to admit,
kids, I am impressed
by your creativity.

241
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,202
How did you ever?
Let go!

242
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:13,403
Oh, no!

243
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:15,906
No! could it be? Is it?

244
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:18,078
( Gasps )
( Laughs ) of course!

245
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,810
It all makes sense!

246
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,411
The one place I'd
never think to look.

247
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:22,913
You had it the whole time!

248
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:25,786
And to think I actually
considered you a threat!

249
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,087
No! give it back!

250
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,060
Every victory you had
was because of your
precious book!

251
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,762
Give it back or I'll--
or you'll what, boy?

252
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:35,796
You'll what? Huh? Huh?
No muscles, no brains.

253
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,368
Face it. You're
nothing without this!

254
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:40,731
Bye-bye forever,
y'all.

255
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:41,932
( Whistles )

256
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:44,074
No!

257
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,945
Next time, do your
own dirty work!
Come on, boys!

258
00:11:57,247 --> 00:11:58,789
Well, that's it.

259
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,791
Guess the bus
should be here soon.

260
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,093
What? Dipper,
don't give up!

261
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:05,225
You always
have a plan!

262
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,257
No, the journal always
has the plan!

263
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:09,429
Think about it, Mabel.
Gideon was right.

264
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,862
The only courageous
or cool things
I've ever done

265
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,363
have been because
of that journal.

266
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:16,967
Without it,
i can't help you
or Stan or anyone.

267
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,970
There's gotta be
something we can do.

268
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,912
What can we do?

269
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,918
Man: bus fifty-two departing
gravity falls. All aboard.

270
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:35,155
Sorry, kids.
It's for the best.

271
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,032
Can't believe
this is happening.

272
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:55,205
( Giggles ) I've got it!
I've finally got it!

273
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:57,307
Get out!
( Exclaims )

274
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:58,809
It's finally mine!

275
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:01,781
At last, I have
journal number...

276
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,853
Three?

277
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:04,885
There are three of 'em?

278
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,517
But where is
journal number one?

279
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:10,790
I must have all three for
the power to be unlocked!

280
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,794
But where could i-- Dipper!
He must know where it is!

281
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,467
He gave me the third one
and kept the first
for himself!

282
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:20,871
I can't let him leave
gravity falls!

283
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:24,804
You there! Is it ready?

284
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,040
Only one way to find out!

285
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:49,559
( Grunts )

286
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:59,239
I got a good feelin'
about that kid!

287
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,612
Well, Stan, this is it.
Rock bottom.

288
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:04,614
No friends, no family,

289
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:07,517
stuck watching infomercials
for whatever that is.

290
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:10,550
Are you sick of
piles of owls constantly
blocking your driveway?

291
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,183
Well, then you've
gotta get owl trowel!

292
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:15,185
How did you do it, kid?

293
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:17,357
Why are you always
one step ahead?

294
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,559
Maybe he really is
psychic after--

295
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,891
( ringing sound )
aah! My hearing aid!

296
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,532
What keeps causing that?

297
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:25,865
Wait a minute. That's it!
I know Gideon's weakness!

298
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,637
Would Mr. pines like a--

299
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:29,039
mwah!

300
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,343
I go vacuum my face.

301
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,984
Hey, Dipper. Wanna play
bus seat treasure hunt?

302
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,255
I'm not in the mood.

303
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:46,456
Oh, come on.

304
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:47,517
We got Canadian coin,

305
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:49,889
gum that's shaped like
Ronald Reagan's head.

306
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,022
Ooh! miscellaneous
fluid stain.

307
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:55,525
Giant robot!
Yeah, giant robot.
Wait. What?

308
00:14:55,525 --> 00:15:00,200
Look!
halt! I command you
to halt!

309
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,671
( Both scream )

310
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:05,475
Mr. bus driver!
There's a giant gideonbot
coming towards us!

311
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:07,978
Oh, hey, dudes!
Both: Soos!

312
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:10,110
Don't worry, guys.
I've been a part-time
bus driver

313
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,942
for at least 40 minutes.

314
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,484
One of these things
is probably a clutch.

315
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:16,316
Hang on, dudes!

316
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,688
Aah!

317
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:21,421
Soos! look out!
Aah!

318
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:24,194
( All scream )

319
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,432
He already won!
What does he want from us?

320
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:36,436
I got you in my sights!

321
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,338
Soos! cliff!

322
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,110
( All scream )
( Grunt of exertion )

323
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,611
Soos: aah!

324
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,524
( All screaming )

325
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,628
Okay, what's closest
to our present situation?

326
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:01,461
"Raccoon in the engine"
or "angry grandparent
won't leave bus"?

327
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,493
Probably-- probably
the second one.

328
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,068
( Panting ) huh?

329
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:16,376
Tell me! Where is
journal number one?

330
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,208
Both:
journal number one?

331
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,251
Don't play games
with me, boy!

332
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:22,512
Oh!
aah! aah!

333
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:24,384
I don't know what
you're talking about!

334
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,356
You took the only
journal I ever had!

335
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:28,518
What do you even want
with these journals, anyway?

336
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,460
Both: aah! Aah!

337
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:34,024
( Audibly struggling )
let go of her!

338
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:37,367
Ha ha ha! You still think
you're some kind of hero?

339
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,499
Aaahhh! unh!

340
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,031
( Groans )

341
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:43,503
Once I find
the final journal,
I'll rule this town!

342
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,207
With you as my queen!
( Laughs )

343
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,709
Dipper, help me!
Help!

344
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,685
Gideon: face it, kid.
You're nothing without
that journal.

345
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:57,547
How you gonna fight back?

346
00:16:57,547 --> 00:16:59,689
No muscles, no brains.

347
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:03,453
What are you gonna do? Huh?
What are you gonna do?

348
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:12,402
( Yelling )

349
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:16,035
Let go of my sister!

350
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,140
Never! I finally
won this time!

351
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,641
( Fighting grunts )

352
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,214
Aah! aah! Get off!
Let go of me!

353
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,652
( Grunts )
( Grunts ) huh?

354
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,490
( Audible struggling )

355
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,763
( Screaming )

356
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,565
Careful in there!

357
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,600
( Screaming )

358
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,702
Dudes! no!

359
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,869
Grappling hook!
Told you it would
come in handy.

360
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,801
Mabel,
that was amazing!

361
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,774
Not as amazing as you
defeating that robot!

362
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:26,706
Hey, my journal!

363
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,708
Man: oh, there it is!
Man #2: Is this the thing
that exploded?

364
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,540
What's going on?
What is that?

365
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,212
It's over here.

366
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,144
Ohhh.

367
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,116
Gideon!

368
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,320
Oh, good heavens!
What on earth
happened here?

369
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,652
It was the pines twins.
They tried to attack me

370
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:45,495
and blew up my statue
with dynamite!

371
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:46,556
Arrest 'em!

372
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,559
Both: what?
Officers, he's lying!

373
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,361
Sorry, kids,
but we trust Gideon,

374
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:53,633
and nothing short
of a miracle could
ever change our--

375
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,306
( screaming )
aah!

376
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:59,709
Wait! wait! Stop everything!
I've got something to say!

377
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,212
Not this guy again.
Just wait! Look!

378
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:05,675
You guys all think Gideon
is so perfect and honest.

379
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:08,378
"Oh, I could never
tell a lie! I'm Gideon!"

380
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:09,719
He's more honest
than you!

381
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,621
Yeah!
and he's psychic too!

382
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:18,488
How's this for psychic?
Bam! Take a good look!

383
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:20,630
Wait a minute!
Is that me?

384
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,664
The secret ingredient
to my coffee omelet
is coffee!

385
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,165
And me!

386
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,498
I can verify
that that birthmark
is indeed disgusting.

387
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:29,869
Hooray!

388
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,572
Onlookers:
that's me!

389
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,604
That's right! These pins
are hidden cameras!

390
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:37,677
And my hearing aid was
picking up the feedback!

391
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,350
Who's the fraud now?

392
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:46,316
Gideon,
we gave you our trust.

393
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:48,318
You lied to us!

394
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,590
Please, i-- ( gasps )
it's not what it looks like.

395
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,592
What are you
gonna do with me?

396
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,264
Tyler?

397
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:57,827
Get him.

398
00:19:57,827 --> 00:19:59,599
( Sniffles )
get him.

399
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,272
( Gasps )
li'l Gideon,
you are under arrest...

400
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:05,605
For conspiracy, fraud,
and breaking our hearts.

401
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,607
Durland,
the tiny handcuffs.

402
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:10,640
Wha-- no!

403
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:14,514
Just one more thing.

404
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:17,687
Let go of me!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

405
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,690
I believe
this belongs to me.

406
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,922
No! no! Watch the hair!

407
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,295
You can't do this to me!
Y'all are sheep!

408
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:26,896
You need me!
I'll be back!

409
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:28,598
You'll hear
from my lawyers!

410
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:29,599
There you have it.

411
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,931
Local hero Stanford pines
has just exposed

412
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,733
li'l Gideon as a fraud.

413
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,235
Anything you have to say
to the town, Stanford?

414
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,709
The mystery shack
is back, baby!

415
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:42,342
( Laughing )

416
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,543
( Sighs )

417
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:55,325
( Laughs )
oh, thank you,
thank you!

418
00:20:56,826 --> 00:20:58,288
( Chomps )

419
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,464
( Mewing )
hey, grunkle Stan!

420
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,766
Uh, you kiddos
settling back in okay?

421
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,638
Yep! all of my
favorite moldy spots

422
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:10,700
on the ceiling
are still there!

423
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,873
Even you, Daryl!

424
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,346
Hey, grunkle Stan,
me and Mabel have
been talking,

425
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,378
and I think there's
something we should
finally tell you.

426
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,650
This is a journal
i found in the woods.

427
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,652
It talks about
all the crazy stuff that

428
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:24,654
goes on in gravity falls.

429
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:27,487
Gideon nearly
destroyed the whole town
trying to find it.

430
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,359
I don't know what it means,
or who wrote it,

431
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,990
but after all
we've been through,

432
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,022
maybe you should
finally know about it.

433
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:35,825
I'm glad you
showed me this, Dipper.

434
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:39,369
( Laughs )
now I know where you've
been getting it all from!

435
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:41,000
Spookums and monsters.

436
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,504
This kooky book
has been filling your head
with crazy conspiracies!

437
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,336
But it's all real!

438
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:49,709
( Laughs ) you gotta
quit readin' this fantasy
nonsense for your own good.

439
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,711
Although some of these
would make great attractions!

440
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:54,584
Can't come up with this stuff!
Mind if I borrow this?

441
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:55,985
Wait! no! Grunkle Stan!

442
00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:58,748
( Laughingly )
"magic book." Ridiculous!

443
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:01,821
Stan, I need it!
Dipper, you don't
need that book!

444
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,022
Don't you see?

445
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,355
On your own you
defeated a giant robot

446
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:07,357
with nothing
but your bare hands!

447
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:09,899
You're a hero
whether you've got
that journal or not!

448
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:14,364
Whoa. thanks, Mabel.
I still want it back though.

449
00:22:14,364 --> 00:22:15,665
I'm sure
you'll get it back.

450
00:22:15,665 --> 00:22:18,938
What would a boring
old man like Stan want
with that book anyway?

451
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,611
( Both gasp )
Soos'ed!

452
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:24,574
( Both laughing )

453
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:07,687
After all these years.

454
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,592
Finally, I have them all.

455
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:25,404
It's working!

456
00:23:28,938 --> 00:23:30,640
( Grunts with exertion )

457
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,689
Here we go.
