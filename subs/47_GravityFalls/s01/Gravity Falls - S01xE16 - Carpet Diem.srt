1
00:00:05,736 --> 00:00:08,579
Oh!
total domination!

2
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:11,642
I am the master
of attic-stuff mini-golf!

3
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:13,514
From the mighty Swiss alps

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,786
to the badlands
of Dipper's old laundry,

5
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:18,018
where man fears to tread.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,550
All right,
let a pro on the field.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,352
Er...floor.
whatever.

8
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:28,429
Stan: ow! My head!

9
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,431
It hit me right
in the head!

10
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,732
Yes!
Stan shot!

11
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,064
Is that legal?

12
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:35,706
The judges say
it's out of bounds.

13
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:36,537
You're out of bounds!

14
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,708
Hey!
stop it!

15
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,270
( Both laughing )

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,112
( Alarm rings )

17
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:43,714
Hey, Dipper, I gotta
go hang out with candy
and grenda tonight.

18
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:46,117
Aw, again?
You can't
leave mid-game!

19
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:48,179
Don't be silly,
I'm not leaving!

20
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,521
My friends
are coming to me!

21
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:51,582
Wait, what?

22
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:53,053
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

23
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,356
Sleeping bags?
Rom-coms?

24
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,428
Calling all boys
preteen edition?!

25
00:00:57,428 --> 00:00:59,290
You're not having a--

26
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,132
both:
sleep over!

27
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:03,694
Ahh!

28
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:48,108
Mabel: okay, so how much
do you like boys?

29
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,410
So much!

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,682
Boys make me think
about kissing.

31
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:52,883
Candy!
( giggling )

32
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:54,114
Oh my gosh!
Ow!

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,617
We are so crazy tonight!

34
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,848
Ohh!

35
00:01:57,848 --> 00:02:01,722
All:
ahh!

36
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,355
( Screaming continues )

37
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,627
Who wants to smear
make-up on my face?

38
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,160
Oh, you're already
so beautiful grenda,

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,431
what would
be the point?

40
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,603
Beautiful!
beautiful!

41
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:13,704
Beautiful!
( groaning )

42
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:14,835
Mabel!

43
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,407
Do you think you could
do this somewhere else?

44
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,739
You're laughing
at frequencies only
dogs should hear.

45
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,141
Come on,
it's not that bad.

46
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:21,842
You know what
your brother needs?

47
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,515
( Gasps )
a makeover?

48
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,618
( Dipper screaming )

49
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,520
( Bleats )

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,681
( Sighs )

51
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,883
Hey Soos, can I sleep
in your break room tonight?

52
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:34,225
Of course, dude.

53
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,257
You just gotta
make your body

54
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,158
go like a video game
puzzle block.

55
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,262
( Beeping )

56
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:42,893
The trick is to hold
perfectly still,

57
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:44,335
( sizzles )
oh! Wait, wait.

58
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:45,666
( Sizzles )
oh! Wait, wait.

59
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,867
( Sizzles )
oh! Wait, wait.
Ow, ow, ow--

60
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,869
I think I'll
sleep somewhere else.

61
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:49,900
( Sizzles )
actually felt good that time.

62
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,941
( Sizzles )
ow! Wait, wait.

63
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:52,943
Ah!

64
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:56,377
Sleeping under the stars...
Not bad.

65
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:58,178
( Growling )

66
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,480
Ah!
get off!

67
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,582
Ah! ah!
Get away!

68
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,755
( Screaming )

69
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:06,387
( Barking, growling )

70
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:09,189
This is still better.

71
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,825
Uhh...
what happened last night?

72
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,196
Whoa!

73
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,828
What's up,
party girl?

74
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,900
I don't know what
i was kissing in there,

75
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,832
but I have no regrets.

76
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:23,974
Candy falls down now!

77
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,638
That was awesome,
girls!

78
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:28,979
See you again
soon!

79
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:31,812
Hey brother!

80
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,914
You want any
of this leftover pizza?

81
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,946
It's got glitter on it!

82
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:38,989
Mabel, last night an owl
tried to eat my tongue.

83
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,591
( Chuckles )
that's great!

84
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:41,692
No, it's not great!

85
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:44,555
This is impossible
to live with!

86
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:46,927
What? I'm delightful
to live with!

87
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,000
Get ready to be poked
by the fun stick!

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,362
Boop.
ahh!

89
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:53,304
Mabel, I've had it
with the fun stick!

90
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:54,905
You've totally
wrecked our room.

91
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:56,467
And...
( gasps )
oh no!

92
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:57,708
Our mini golf course!

93
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,241
Yeah, grenda sure
loves breaking things.

94
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,943
Mabel, we need to lay
down some ground rules

95
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,645
if we're gonna be living
in this room together.

96
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,877
First of all,
no sleepovers.

97
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:07,878
What?!

98
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:09,950
Well if I can't
have sleepovers,

99
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,953
then you can't keep
me up every night with
your summer reading.

100
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,255
How does reading
keep you up?

101
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:17,758
( Gasps )

102
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,630
Oh...
( chuckles )

103
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,292
Interesting...

104
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:24,034
But who stole the capers?

105
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:25,296
( Pen clicking )

106
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,737
( Groaning )

107
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:28,969
Well, at least my braces
don't whistle when I breathe!

108
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,572
At least I wash
my clothes once in a while!

109
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,273
Washing clothes
is a waste of time!

110
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,305
I'm a busy guy!

111
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:35,546
( Meowing )

112
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:37,348
All right.
If you meow
one more time--

113
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:38,709
( meows louder )

114
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,581
Okay, that's it,
that's the final straw.

115
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,483
Maybe we shouldn't
share a room anymore.

116
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,814
Well, uh--

117
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:44,985
well, maybe
we shouldn't!

118
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,488
Fine by me!
Double fine by me!

119
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,020
Then we need to talk
to grunkle Stan
about moving rooms.

120
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,862
Yeah, he's
a reasonable guy.

121
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:54,294
( Grunting )

122
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,796
Fight! fight!
Fight!

123
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,331
Fight!
fight! fight!

124
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:02,002
( Cooing )

125
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,404
Fight! fight!
Fight!

126
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:07,077
Stan:
fight! fight! Fight!

127
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:09,540
TV, it knows what I want.

128
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,942
Grunkle Stan?
We want different rooms.

129
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:14,345
And I want a pair
of magic money pants!

130
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:15,446
It's not gonna happen.

131
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:16,687
Magic money pants?

132
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:17,848
Come on,
grunkle Stan!

133
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:19,390
Can't we work
something out?

134
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,991
Look, kid.
There's my room
and the attic.

135
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:22,393
That's it.
What do you think,

136
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:24,995
there's some kind
of secret hidden room
in the shack?

137
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:26,096
( Crash )

138
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:27,458
Soos: dudes!

139
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,999
I found some kind of secret
hidden room in the shack!

140
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:33,003
Okay, so I was cleaning
up behind this bookcase,

141
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:34,865
when boom!
Mystery door.

142
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:36,837
This old shack is full
of weird secrets.

143
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:43,944
Woah!

144
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,846
( Gasps )
classy!

145
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:50,120
( Coughing )

146
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:54,825
"Experiment 78."

147
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:56,356
Grunkle Stan,
what is this place?

148
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,528
I don't know.

149
00:05:57,528 --> 00:05:59,590
Just another room
i gotta clean up now.

150
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,832
The carpet it's amazing!

151
00:06:01,832 --> 00:06:04,034
Yeah, if you're into
things that are terrible.

152
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:08,368
Problem solved!
I'll move in here!

153
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,401
What? why do you
automatically
get the room?

154
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,042
We both saw it
at the same time!

155
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,073
Wait a second...

156
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,576
So you both
want this room, huh?

157
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,847
I guess I'll give it to

158
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:18,609
whichever one of you
i like more.

159
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,853
Uh oh.
Looks like my shoe's untied!

160
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:24,384
( Both grunting )
give it to me.

161
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,456
( Laughing )

162
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,387
To the kitchen!
Fight! Fight!

163
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,388
Fight! fight!

164
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,761
Whoa.
i don't know dudes.

165
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:32,993
This room gives me
major creep-o vibes.

166
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,665
Ya know, the attic
is a pretty good space.

167
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,697
Maybe you two should
appreciate what you got.

168
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:40,130
Grunkle Stan!
I gotta have that room!

169
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,603
Huh.
hey, what do I know?

170
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,875
Maybe there's nothing creepy
going on in this room.

171
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,407
( Ominous music )

172
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,939
( Zapping )

173
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,515
All right, kids,
here's how it's gonna go down.

174
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,147
Whoever sucks up the hardest,
gets the key to the new room.

175
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:59,089
Grunkle Stan, we're not
going to suck up to you

176
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,150
just to get the new room.

177
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,191
Yeah, we are!

178
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,593
Ten suck up points for Mabel!

179
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:04,825
I mean, uh,
yeah we are!
( Chuckles )

180
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,598
Trying too hard.
Minus 15 suck up points.

181
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:09,500
What?
good decision,
grunkle Stan!

182
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,903
Trying way too hard!
Plus 50 suck up points.

183
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,536
Now who wants
to re-tile the roof

184
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,668
in searing 105 degree heat!

185
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:18,839
Me! me!
I'll do it!

186
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,741
Me! no, Dipper!
Give it here!

187
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,844
Ahh, Stan,
you're a good uncle.

188
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:24,915
Mabel:
I'll kill you!

189
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,518
( Sighs )

190
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:30,681
Dipper!
you're phoning it in!

191
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:32,853
Ahh. man,
that's refreshing.

192
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,454
Ten suck up points
for this lemonade.

193
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,026
( In high pitched voice )
thank you, Stan.

194
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:38,458
Oh, ho! Ten more
for politeness.

195
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,491
Oh, and so sweet!

196
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:42,733
( Sighs )

197
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,465
All these chores will be
worth it when I get this room.

198
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,498
Shag carpeting...
Come on!

199
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:49,169
( Ominous music )

200
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,502
Hey, brother.
Don't get too
comfortable,

201
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:54,474
I just made Stan an omelet
shaped like his own face.

202
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,509
I have seen the face of beauty.

203
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,711
Face it.
I'm like a suck up ninja!

204
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,212
This room's
as good as mine!

205
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:03,654
You might as well give up now.

206
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:04,555
What do you say?

207
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:06,587
I say, I'm gonna win
this room somehow,

208
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,688
and when I do...

209
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,520
I'll finally
have my own space,

210
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,862
and we'll never have
to share anything ever again!

211
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:12,923
Both:
ahh!

212
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,799
( Dipper's voice )
ugh...What happened?

213
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,571
( Mabel's voice )
Dipper?

214
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:22,603
Why are you wearing
my clothes?

215
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,635
And my... face!?

216
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:26,506
Am I in my your body?

217
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,978
Am I in my your body?

218
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,581
Ahh!

219
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:31,612
Ahh!

220
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,883
Ahh!
ahh!

221
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:35,045
( Retching )

222
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:38,689
( Panting, screaming )

223
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,621
Get out!
Get out!

224
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,622
Get out!

225
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,953
This isn't happening.

226
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:43,994
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

227
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:45,525
Aahh!

228
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,630
( Still Dipper's voice )
great, just what we need.

229
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,161
More gravity
falls weirdness.

230
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:52,633
( Still Mabel's voice )
this is stupid!

231
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,534
Sharing a room
was bad enough.

232
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,667
Now we're sharing bodies?

233
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,308
Ugh, braces are horrible.

234
00:08:58,308 --> 00:08:59,910
It's like my
mouth hates me!

235
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,842
And what are
these things?

236
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,674
I wanna know why
you're so sweaty!

237
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:05,646
And awkward.
Hey, look!

238
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,648
Experiment 78!

239
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,020
Electron carpet.

240
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,822
Atoms can swap electrons.

241
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:13,724
This carpet must
build up a static charge

242
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:16,126
so powerful
it can swap minds.

243
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:17,688
It was the static
electricity.

244
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:18,759
Maybe, we could use
it to switch back!

245
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,631
( Pen clicking )
phew. Oh, oh!

246
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:21,832
Glad I'm switchin' back.

247
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:25,696
If I was you,
i would totally
lose the contest.

248
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:28,699
And if I was you,
which I am...

249
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:31,041
I could sabotage myself!

250
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,703
Then Mabel would
lose all her points

251
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:33,573
and the room
would go to Dipper!

252
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,605
Wait, what?

253
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:36,076
Oh, Stan!

254
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,248
I've always
hated you!

255
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,811
Ha ha! See who he
gives the room to now!

256
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:42,753
No! wait!

257
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:44,054
Tie your shoes!!

258
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,657
Mmm... those cannibals are
onto something,

259
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:47,758
I taste delicious!

260
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:48,689
Grunkle Stan!

261
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:49,820
What's the word,
Mabel?

262
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,592
That's right!
It's me, ugh, Mabel!

263
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,825
If you like that omelet,
you'll love this...

264
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:56,997
A sandwich made
out of rocks!

265
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,098
Candy rocks?

266
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,330
Regular rocks!

267
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,603
Keep that up, and I'll be
giving your brother this key.

268
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,736
Ha ha!
I mean... darn.

269
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:07,607
Mabel:
hey, grunkle Stan!

270
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,639
Your face looks
like a butt!

271
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,780
What?!

272
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,081
В™є breaking stuff is
so much fun! В™є

273
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:13,043
в™є I am Dipper and I stink! В™є

274
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:14,985
Mabel's gone bananas!

275
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:17,117
Bing! zow!
Ba-low!

276
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,348
( Laughing )

277
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:19,790
Well,
this is getting weird.

278
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,991
Wait!

279
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:22,192
Are you gonna
dock Mabel points?

280
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,754
Dipper should lose
all his points!

281
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:25,055
Ugh!
grunkle Stan!

282
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,700
Waddles, you got it good, bro.

283
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,801
You got no worries.

284
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:32,302
I mean, nobody
thinks it's cute

285
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:34,404
when I lie naked
on the living room floor.

286
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:36,066
I wish I could be a pig.

287
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,809
( Ominous music,
coos yells )

288
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,343
Yes!

289
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,045
I should do
out loud wishing more often.

290
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,347
Is that a corn cob I spy?

291
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:50,050
( Grunts )
i got little legs!

292
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:56,326
( Snorting, squealing )

293
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,141
Hey, Soos.
What's up?

294
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:12,372
Have you seen my--

295
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,673
( ominous music )

296
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,979
Uh... I'll come back later.

297
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,680
Grunkle Stan, come back!

298
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,112
I have more
terrible things to do!

299
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:23,353
You're toast, Mabel!

300
00:11:23,353 --> 00:11:24,755
That room's
as good as mine!

301
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:26,857
There you are Mabel!

302
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,759
Attack her
with love!
Yeah!

303
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,861
Both:
sleep over!

304
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,192
What!?
no no no!

305
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,294
Ahh!
Dipper?
hey, wait!

306
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,326
Wait, come back!

307
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:41,131
Hey! could i
talk to my, uh,
sister for a sec?

308
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:44,204
This is a sleepover buddy.
No boys allowed!

309
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:46,977
( Giggling )

310
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:50,741
Look guys, I'm not really
in a sleepover mood right now.

311
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:53,343
One of my irrational
girl mood swings, you know?

312
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:54,745
Right?
don't we have those?

313
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:57,717
Come on! My mom's
age-inappropriate romance novels

314
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,119
aren't going to read themselves!

315
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,152
Oh! "wolfman, barechest"!

316
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:03,854
Ohh!

317
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,255
Uh, really,
i should probably..

318
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:07,197
Come on!
You know you love it!!!

319
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:08,759
"My name is Gerard.

320
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,031
"I am a werewolf,
creature of the night,

321
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,933
but I am also
a creature of passion."

322
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,004
( Giggling )

323
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:15,205
( Groans )

324
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:17,067
Gerard is just so fierce.

325
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,168
What's goin' on,
Dipper?

326
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:19,770
( Gasps )

327
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,213
Ahh... you're at that creepy
age where you spy on girls, huh?

328
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,245
Guess it's time you and me
had a man-to-man talk

329
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,777
about the birds and the bees,
ya know.

330
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,051
I--i should
really be going--

331
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,252
no way out of it!

332
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,855
Look, it all begins
with this little fella,

333
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,056
the pituitary gland.

334
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,759
He may be little,
but he has big plans.

335
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,831
Ahh!

336
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,796
I wonder what rollicking
adventures I'll stumble into.

337
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:47,868
A mud puddle!

338
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,370
Do I dare live out
the cliche?

339
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,442
( Laughing )

340
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:54,544
( Jabbering )
wow!

341
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:57,007
I'm a pig!
Oink oink, right?
( Chuckles )

342
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:58,178
Free meal!

343
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,780
No! don't eat me!

344
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,182
I'm a man trapped
in a pig's body!

345
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,554
That's what they all say!

346
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:06,516
( Coos panting,
old man mcguckett laughing )

347
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:08,088
Soos:
help! police!

348
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:11,161
( Gasps )
a bearded witch
chasing a talking pig!

349
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,563
My horoscope came true.

350
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:14,895
Now read mine!

351
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,796
What are you,
gemini?
You knew?!

352
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,928
Yeah, of course,
i knew!

353
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:20,570
And now you know where
babies come from.

354
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,903
Goodbye, childhood.

355
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,375
You know, I find you more
likable today than usual.

356
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,937
Maybe you could still
win that game after all.

357
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:28,108
Huh?

358
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,040
I was gonna give that
new room to Mabel--

359
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,982
no, you should!
Give it to Mabel!

360
00:13:31,982 --> 00:13:33,483
You big jerk!

361
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:35,515
What did you say to me?

362
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,918
I said, uh,
shut up, old man!

363
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,190
You're fat and dumb,
and you're a dummy,

364
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,822
and take that!

365
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,996
Finally standing up to me, huh?

366
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:47,527
I love it!

367
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,829
You know,
I've made up my mind.

368
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,902
The room belongs to you,
Dipper.

369
00:13:51,902 --> 00:13:52,903
You can't!

370
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:54,004
You have to give
it to Mabel!

371
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:55,005
Shh.

372
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:57,167
You had me at
"shut up old man."

373
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,609
No!

374
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:00,840
The end.

375
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,841
Phew.

376
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,613
Now for the 38 sequels!

377
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:05,946
No!

378
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,348
I'm gonna make you
into bacon!

379
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,920
Oh, ho! That sounds
pretty good.

380
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,922
Wait, I mean,
no!

381
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,028
Three, four, five.

382
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:19,189
( Phone rings )

383
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:21,031
It's him!
My dream date!

384
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:22,162
Hello!?

385
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,094
( Automated voice)
Hello baby, this is Kevin.

386
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:26,236
My beach house has room...
For two.

387
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:28,338
Kevin has the voice
of a robot.

388
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:30,941
Don't ruin this
for me, candy!

389
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:32,903
It's your turn, Mabel.

390
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:35,105
( Panting )

391
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,246
I gotta win the room.

392
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:38,248
Stan! it's me, Mabel!

393
00:14:38,248 --> 00:14:40,110
I'm doing things you hate!

394
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,252
( Grunts )

395
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,016
( Sighs )
it's over, Dipper.

396
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,617
Stan gave you the room.

397
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:51,261
Ha ha! Yes!
All right!

398
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,293
( Clears throat )

399
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,966
Well let's switch bodies then,
and I can start moving in!

400
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:57,998
Wait a minute,
you can't have the room...

401
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,930
If you can never get in!

402
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,201
Hey, come back!

403
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:03,974
( Panting )

404
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:05,135
Come on!

405
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:07,207
Open the door, Dipper!

406
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,009
I mean... Mabel.

407
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,540
( Sighs )

408
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,613
How am I ever
gonna get in there?

409
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,085
Hmm...

410
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:18,218
Kevin for the last time,
I'm not interested!

411
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,020
How could you
say that to Kevin!

412
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,995
Hey girls, who wants
to give my brother a make-over!

413
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:26,326
( Both gasp )

414
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:30,160
( Oinking )

415
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,074
Oh, good, Soos.

416
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:46,146
( Squeals )
ya got a second?

417
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:51,221
Look, times are tough,
economy, or something, etc.

418
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:53,423
Basically...
i have to cut your pay.

419
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,687
Wh-- what are
you doing?

420
00:15:57,687 --> 00:16:01,091
( Snorting )

421
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:03,033
Is this some sort
of negotiating tactic?

422
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:04,034
'Cause it's not gonna to work.

423
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:09,299
Fine! I was lying.
I'll give you a raise!

424
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:11,101
Just never do that again.

425
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:13,273
Stan:
ugh. nightmare.

426
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:16,106
Can you help me?
I'm looking for directions--

427
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:17,377
( oinks )

428
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:22,712
Oh, you'll
show me the way?

429
00:16:22,712 --> 00:16:24,314
Such a gentleman!

430
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:27,687
( Knocking )

431
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,289
Candy and grenda:
It's candy and grenda!

432
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,420
Friends!

433
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,122
Hey guys!

434
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:33,593
What's up?

435
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,495
Dipper?! wait!
Don't let him in here!

436
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,696
Both:
make over!

437
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,229
No, no! Stop, stop!
Whoa, no!

438
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:40,630
We're gonna
make you so hot!

439
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,172
Wait, no!
Stop!

440
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:44,334
Guys, you have to
listen to me!

441
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,106
No!

442
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,307
Good job, ladies!

443
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:51,481
Now let me just add
one final touch!

444
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,645
( Groans )

445
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:57,047
( Dipper's voice )
my body!

446
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:59,489
I'm a genius!

447
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,251
Ugh... all right, Mabel.

448
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:02,392
The room is mine.

449
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:04,394
Wait! hold on here.
What just happened?

450
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:06,626
( Mabel's voice, sighs )
i barely understand it.

451
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,429
All I know, is if you shuffle
your feet on this carpet,

452
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,501
you can switch bodies
or whatever.

453
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,135
Zip zip!
No!

454
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:20,240
( Dipper's voice )
aw, come on!

455
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,371
( Candy's voice )
i am a boy now!

456
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:22,472
( Deepens voice )
what's up, brah?

457
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:23,813
Lets grow some
moustaches!

458
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:25,575
Dipper, give me
that key back!

459
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:26,746
( Both grunting )

460
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,518
Guys!
stop fighting!

461
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,481
( Dipper's voice )
oh, no!

462
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:32,822
Then again, I like
having muscles for once

463
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:34,053
( grenda's voice ) wow!

464
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,785
Now I have
tiny little doll hands!

465
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:37,157
( Mabel's voice )
everybody, look.

466
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:40,059
Swap back in three, two--

467
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,331
Soos: oh, dude!

468
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:43,533
Come back!
I wanna deep fry yer ears!

469
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:46,136
( Arguing over each other )

470
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,140
Announcer:
tonight on baby fights!

471
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,342
Tensions rise between
Madison and Avery

472
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:53,373
at baby fight headquarters.

473
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:57,807
Mabel:
give me my body back!

474
00:17:57,807 --> 00:17:59,709
( Groans )

475
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:04,254
( Grenda's voice )
cool! I'm Santa claus!

476
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:05,515
( Old man mcguckett )
whoo-ee! Ha ha!

477
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:06,856
I've regained my innocence!

478
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:09,489
(Dipper's voice, sighs )
well, I guess I'm a pig now.

479
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,520
So, that's a thing.

480
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,563
( Soos' voice )
this body's not
that different

481
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:14,724
from my old one.

482
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:17,197
We got some reports
of excessive giggling.

483
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,200
( Giggling )

484
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,572
( Blubs' voice )
my horoscope didn't
say anything about this!

485
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:24,474
( Durland's voice )
ahh! What's happening to me?!

486
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:28,278
Ow! ugh!
( Giggles )

487
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:29,579
( Candy's voice )
i am a police officer now!

488
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:30,840
( Giggles )

489
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,582
( Grenda's voice )
let's go get some perps, candy!

490
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:34,384
Give me that key, Mabel!
Never!

491
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:35,415
( Shouting )

492
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,324
( Dipper's voice )
Mabel, are you you?

493
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,156
( Mabel's voice )
yeah, I'm me.

494
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,427
Well, I've got the key!

495
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,604
Mabel!
the room is mine!

496
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:56,406
Give it to me!

497
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:57,867
( Both grunting )

498
00:18:57,867 --> 00:18:59,209
What's with you?

499
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:00,740
Why do you need
that room so bad?

500
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,772
I never even
wanted to move out!

501
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:03,873
Me either!

502
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:06,446
Wait, what?
Say that again!

503
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,449
I--i never
wanted to move out.

504
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,381
Then what was all this?

505
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:14,184
Everything was fine until
you started bringing

506
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:15,525
your friends
around every night.

507
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,687
I mean, hanging out with
you this summer's been fun.

508
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:20,490
But now, you're always
with candy and grenda.

509
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,793
And I'm... like,
just left behind.

510
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:26,466
Aw, Dipper.

511
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,637
It's okay.

512
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:29,269
I've been having
a hard time.

513
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,800
You wouldn't understand
what I'm going through.

514
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,574
You're probably feeling
awkward and sweaty, huh?

515
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,247
Yeah. how'd you know?

516
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:40,179
Here.
i won't fight you for it.

517
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,811
Thanks.

518
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:46,616
Well, it looks like
everyone's back to normal!

519
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:47,817
( Sighing )

520
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:51,521
Except for Soos,
who may be pig permanently?

521
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:53,523
Oh, no. I changed back.

522
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,625
At least I think I did.

523
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,196
I'll still eat ya.

524
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,668
Dipper: okay pal,
that's enough of that.

525
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:00,870
Mabel: move it along,
weird old man.

526
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,733
Huh, I guess being a pig
wasn't that great after all.

527
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,236
Hey, lemme get that spot
you can never reach...

528
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:07,577
( Doorbell rings )

529
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:10,580
Hey, I've been thinking
and the answer is...

530
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,612
Yes!
i will marry you!

531
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,384
Wait I don't remember
anything about a--

532
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,617
hmm. all right.

533
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,619
( Sighs )

534
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,750
Ah, there.

535
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,294
Ahh, a man
in his own space.

536
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:25,895
That's right!
Finally.

537
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:27,957
So what are you gonna
do with this old thing?

538
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:29,259
Get rid of it.

539
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:31,831
Ha ha!
You got it.

540
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,663
This carpet's ugly.

541
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:37,867
Ah, finally, my own room.

542
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,539
Goodnight, Mabel.

543
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:46,916
Goodnight, Dipper.

544
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:54,624
( Knocking )

545
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:58,588
Hey, um, you wanna
have a sleepover?

546
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,662
Fore!

547
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,535
( Laughing )

548
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:10,440
Stan: ah! Why am I even
out here at night?

549
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,541
( Mabel and Dipper laugh )

550
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,773
So, what are we gonna
do with that new room?

551
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,505
I gave it to Soos
to replace

552
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:17,006
that horrible
break room he has.

553
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:19,649
Hey, do you know what
the deal was with that lady?

554
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,353
I just don't think
i can do this anymore.

555
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:26,586
You just seem so...
Different.

556
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:29,589
Look, dude, uh, I'm playing
a little bit of catch up here.

557
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,461
I was in a pig's body
for most of the day.

558
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:32,522
What's going on?

559
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,326
Can we kiss again?

560
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:37,667
Is that an option?

561
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:40,870
( Sizzling )
Soos: Oh! Wait, wait.
