ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:09,240
we now return to...

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,543
Sponsored by...

4
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:15,386
They taste
just like chips!

5
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:18,689
( Game show music plays )

6
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:21,021
Congratulations!
you're taking a....

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,593
Cash shower!

8
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:24,155
Ha ha ha ha!

9
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,798
I like that guy's style.

10
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:30,361
Mr. pines!
We got tourists
at nine o'clock!

11
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,702
A whole busload of 'em!

12
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:34,505
( Goat bleats )

13
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:36,707
Hot tamales!
It's a jackpot!

14
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:39,110
Soos, make some new
attractions!

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,671
You got it, boss.

16
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:42,543
( Muttering )

17
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:46,577
Wendy, Mark up those prices!
The higher, the better!

18
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:49,180
Stan: higher!
Bleed 'em dry!

19
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,581
Sheesh, grunkle Stan,

20
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:51,682
it's like when you
look at tourists

21
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:53,684
all you see are
wallets with legs.

22
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:55,486
That's not true.

23
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,430
Thanks for taking me
to the mystery shack, daddy.

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,533
Ha ha! Now,
don't spend yourself
all in one place.

25
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:04,565
I'm feeling car sick.

26
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,098
Breahhh!

27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,371
Clean-up on the front lawn!

28
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,542
( Sighs )

29
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:16,477
В™єв™є

30
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,352
( ding )

31
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:02,623
( Sighs )

32
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,725
Stan:
ladies and gentletourists,

33
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:09,360
looking around my mystery shack,
you'll see many wondrous
roadside attractions.

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,732
Be amazed at
the only known photo

35
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,365
of a horse riding
another horse.

36
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:16,767
That's--that's pretty good.

37
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,239
Ooh!
wow!

38
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,140
Be astounded
by the horrible

39
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,672
pre-teen wolf boy!

40
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:24,475
Oh, look at him!
All that hair!

41
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:26,347
His body is changing!
Aaah!

42
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:29,220
Grunkle Stan,
this is demeaning.

43
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,353
What?! I don't know
"da meaning" of that word.

44
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,825
( All guffaw )

45
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:36,687
If you throw money at him
he dances.

46
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:38,729
All: whoo!

47
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,331
Ow! hey!

48
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:42,193
( Whimpering )

49
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:44,595
Ha ha ha! Ooh!
Ha ha! Thank you!

50
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:47,538
Behold! mystery shack
bumper stickers!

51
00:02:47,538 --> 00:02:49,800
You can stick 'em
on your bumper or...

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,742
Over your husband's mouth.

53
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:52,943
Am I right, ladies?

54
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:54,505
She knows what
I'm talkin' about.

55
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:55,776
Ha ha ha ha!

56
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,379
You arebad.
How much?

57
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,680
Hey, it's on the house.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,552
That's the Mabel difference.

59
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:04,815
Thanks for visiting!
What?!

60
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:07,388
What the heck do you
think you're doing?

61
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,320
Business!
ching, ching, ching!

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,463
Listen, kid,
you don't make money
by giving stuff away.

63
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:14,395
You're off of
register duty!
But--but--

64
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,497
no "buts" except
yours out the door!

65
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:18,499
Now shut your yap
and get to work!

66
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,532
Grunkle Stan,
whatever happened
to "please" and "thank you"?

67
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,574
Hmm? oh, wait.

68
00:03:23,574 --> 00:03:24,705
Here they are!

69
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,437
Lop lop!
Ha ha!

70
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:27,808
Huh!

71
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,411
"Please" never made me
any money, kid.

72
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:31,742
In fact,
just saying the word

73
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:34,585
is giving me
a burning sensation.

74
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:37,217
Grunkle Stan,
why do I have to
wear this wolf costume?

75
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,619
I think
I'm getting hookworm.

76
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:42,323
Ha ha! Yep, gluing
dog hair to your body
will do that.

77
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:44,625
You have all these
dumb fake exhibits
in the shack.

78
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:49,300
Meanwhile, I've seen
actual amazing things
in the forest every day.

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,931
What if you hunted down
arealattraction

80
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,463
instead of lying to people
for a living?

81
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:54,905
And you should be nicer
to your employees, too.

82
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:56,407
Yeah!

83
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:58,839
Look, you guys
got a problem with
how I run the shack,

84
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,911
take it up with
the complaints department.

85
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,543
Zing! ha ha ha!

86
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,746
I am going to write them
sucha letter!

87
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,526
And don't stop till
you've covered that sign
with glitter!

88
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:18,889
Glittery signs
attract tourists!
Also large birds.

89
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:20,531
( Cawing )
aaah! Aaah!

90
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,533
Ha ha! That's funny.

91
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:27,468
Okay, is it just me,
or is having grunkle Stan
as a boss seriously the worst?

92
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,570
I know, right?
Why do we even
put up with it?

93
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,902
I tried to give him
a suggestion to improve
the shack once.

94
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:34,545
I had this idea
where I could be, like,
the mystery shack mascot--

95
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:36,006
"questiony the question Mark."

96
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:37,508
I ask people questions,

97
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:39,350
you know,
do the question dance...

98
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,651
That sounds amazing!

99
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:42,012
Oh, cool!
Yeah, totally!

100
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:44,785
Yeah, well, Stan said
i couldn't handle it.

101
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,658
He saidwhat?!

102
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:48,689
And remember, folks,

103
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:51,592
we put the "fun"
in "no refunds"!

104
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,524
Ha ha! Suckers.

105
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:54,695
You!

106
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:58,569
Grunkle Stan, you've gone
too far this time!

107
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:02,373
Did you seriously
tell Soos not to follow
his hopes and dreams

108
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:04,635
because he
"couldn't handle it"?

109
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:06,737
Look, kid, let me
break it down for you.

110
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:08,979
Being a boss is about
commanding respect.

111
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,643
If you give people
everything they ask for,
they'll walk all over ya.

112
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:15,746
No way! I bet you'd make
way more money being nice

113
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:18,819
than being a big, grumpy grump
to everyone all the time.

114
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,422
Ha! you think you know
more about business
than I do?

115
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,723
You thinkyou
could wear this hat?

116
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,596
Yeah, because
i give people respect.

117
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:27,658
And glittery stickers.

118
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:31,101
Ha! I'd make more money
on vacation than you would
running this place!

119
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:33,404
Then why don't you
goon vacation?

120
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:37,608
Interesting. all right,
I'm a wagering man.

121
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,840
Three days. 72 hours.

122
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:43,714
You run the shack,
and I'll go on vacation.

123
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:45,416
If you make more money than me,

124
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,818
I guess it means you're right
about the way I run my business.

125
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:49,750
Butif you lose,

126
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,584
you gotta wear
this "loser" shirt
all summer. Ha ha!

127
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:58,058
Fine! but ifiwin,
i get to be the boss
for the rest of the summer!

128
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:02,833
Plus, you have to sing
an apologizing song
with lyrics by me, Mabel.

129
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,496
Oh ho! You got
yourself a deal, missy!

130
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:07,598
No, you got
yourselfa deal!

131
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:10,000
Deal! deal!
Deal! Deal!

132
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:13,604
Deal.

133
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:17,478
See you in 72 hours! Ha ha!

134
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:18,649
We'll see who makes
more money.

135
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,553
Uh!

136
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:24,384
( Stan laughing )

137
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,888
Mabel, did you just
make a bet with
a professional con man?

138
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,892
Oh, come on. Being
a better boss than Stan
will be a cinch.

139
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,925
Profits, here we come!

140
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,667
( Shatters )
you broke the jar.

141
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,899
We'll get a new one.
I guess I shouldn't
betooworried.

142
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,432
I mean, how much money could
Stan even make on vacation?

143
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:43,974
Can I help you, sir?

144
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,176
I'm here to take
all the cash from your wheel.

145
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,083
You wanted to see us,
Mr. pines?

146
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,949
Stan is no longer with us.

147
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,493
He's dead?! No!
It should have been me!

148
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:04,655
Whoa, Soos.
Stan's not dead.

149
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,597
He's on vacation
for three days.

150
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:08,829
We made a bet.

151
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,501
Thank you for
that clarification.

152
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:11,902
Mabel's in charge now!

153
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:13,764
Are those
shoulder pads?

154
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:15,706
Uh-huh!

155
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:18,108
It's just one of the many
up-to-date managerial tricks

156
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:22,172
I learned from this book
i found propping up
the kitchen table.

157
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:24,845
Why does your mug
say "#2"?

158
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:28,849
Because the real #1 isyou.

159
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,051
Yeah, I get it.
Morale!

160
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,853
Walk with me.

161
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,726
With me as boss,
you're gonna notice
a few changes around here.

162
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:39,760
My job is to help you be
your best "selves."

163
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,832
( Mabel reads list )

164
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,167
Great listening here
so far!

165
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,599
Ahh!
ahh!

166
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:49,970
Ho ho! Ha ha!

167
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,742
Waddles, hold my calls.

168
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:52,703
( Squeals )

169
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,207
All right, people,
now rap with me.

170
00:07:57,207 --> 00:08:00,981
Wendy, how can I make
your workspace more
Wendy-friendly?

171
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,585
Hmm. well, Stan never lets me
hang out with friends at work.

172
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,217
Stan ain't here, sister!
Door's open!

173
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:09,119
Sweet!
and Soos,

174
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:11,121
I believethisis yours.

175
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:13,123
Questiony the question Mark?

176
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:16,026
I wish this was
an exclamation point
to show how excited I am.

177
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,829
As for you, Dipper...

178
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:21,101
Die, wolf costume, die!

179
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,734
I want you to head into those
woods and don't come back

180
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,736
until you've found
an amazing attraction!

181
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:30,040
Finally! time to show Stan how
arealmystery hunter does it!

182
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,783
( Grunting )

183
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:34,514
Dipper out!

184
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,786
Ahh! ( crash )

185
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:40,020
Okay, guys, it's time to prove
that nice bosses finish first.

186
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,893
In the next 48 hours,
we're gonna fill up this jar

187
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,626
with six hundred
billion dollars!

188
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,757
Yeah!

189
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:49,129
Wait. do you know
how money works?

190
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,703
Of course. Waddles,

191
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:53,804

192
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:56,066

193
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,869
( Chatter )

194
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:01,171
Ahh. this line
is taking forever.

195
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:04,615
Time to use
my old man powers.

196
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:06,947
Aaah! I'm having
a heart attack!

197
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:10,050
And the only cure is to be

199
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:14,024
Oh! someone give me a part!

200
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:15,786
should we escort him
off the lot?

201
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:17,928
That man is a self-centered
attention hog

202
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:20,761
with no regard
for human decency.

203
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,232

213
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,752
Boss, boss, boss,

215
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:50,120

217
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:54,224

218
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:57,127

219
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:59,900
( Growling )
this is gonna blow
those tourists away!

220
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,331
Ha ha ha!--Aah!

221
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:03,874
Aah! aah!

222
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:06,176
Marvelous work,
valued employee.

223
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:08,338
Oh! who'sthat?

224
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:11,181
Is it questiony
the question Mark?

225
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:13,944
Ah, I'm starting
to have second thoughts
about this, Mabel.

226
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:15,285
I keep forgetting
my lines,

227
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:18,118
and this costume
is more, uh, revealing

228
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,790
than I expected.

229
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,891
Soos, don't give up.

230
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:24,024
Anything is possible
when you...

231
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,956
"Imaginize it."

232
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:27,898
But I don't know
what that means.

233
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:28,959
Shh!

234
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,132
Shh...

235
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,065
Believein yourself.

236
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:36,867
But--but i--

237
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:40,040
( wind whistles )
oh, so--so cold.

238
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,272
How's my favorite Wendy?

239
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:44,875
( Laughter )

240
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,847

00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,049
Yeah!

242
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,022
Oh, what's this?

243
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,954
( Sobbing )

244
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,956
Your face!
It's ruined!

245
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,789
I'm so sorry.
Please, have a refund.

246
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:05,966
Wendy, you've got
a lot of cleaning up to do.

247
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,798
Please?

248
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:11,742
Whoa. all this rule stuff
is starting to make you
sound like Stan.

249
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:13,974
What?! no,
I'm nothing like Stan!

250
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:17,848
In fact, take the rest
of the day off.

251
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:20,881
With full pay?
Of course.

252
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,053
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha.

253
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:28,959

Actually, it's not

273
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:14,504
I'm ready to solve!
No. The game hasn't started.

274
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:17,367

Well, I just made
two people go insane.

312
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,444
How about you?
I'm so tired.

313
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,277
I gave Wendy the day off,
so I had to doherjob.

314
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:10,350
Well, maybe you need to start
being a little bit tougher
around here.

315
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,222
No way! That's what
Stan would do!

316
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,454
I just need to
think positive,
be friendly,

317
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,386
and everything
will work out fine.

318

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,262
( All screaming )

320
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,035
What? how did he get out
of his locked cage?!

321
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:26,436
Well...

322
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:28,899
Huh?

323
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,373
You gave him abreak?!

324
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,605
He's an employee!
Sort of.

325
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:37,577
We gotta round him up.
Where's Soos?

326
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:41,051
He was stressed out,
so I told him to take
a soothing nature walk.

327
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:43,353
Hello? civilization?

328
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:45,315

333
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:54,524

Mmm!

341
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:24,924
What do we do?!

342
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,958
He's awarding himself stickers
that he didn't even earn!

343
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,003
Uh, got it. "When fighting
a gremloblin, use water...

344
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:36,967
"...only as a last resort,
as water will make him
much, much scarier."

345
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:39,039
Aah! who writes
sentences like that?!

346
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:43,113
( Cuckoo clock strikes )

347
00:15:43,113 --> 00:15:44,474
Cuckoo.

348
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:49,449
Don't worry. He's gotta
leave eventually.

00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:57,587
в™є I'm the singin' salmon
spendin' all day jammin' в™є

351
00:15:57,587 --> 00:16:00,390
в™є I'm the singin' salmon
spendin' all day jammin' в™є

352
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,133
ohh! why doesn't he
just leave?

353
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,365
( Sniffs, growls )

354
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:09,169
Our profits!
Mabel, wait!

355
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:12,002
Stop! stop!

356
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:13,473
( Screaming )

357
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,275
Don't look into
his evil eye!

358
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,476
You'll see your
worst nightmare!

359
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,379
I wishwehad an evil eye
to showhim!

360
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,351
Oh, no!
Aahh....

361
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:24,054
Wait. hey, monster!

362
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:25,585
Take a look at this!

363
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:36,566
( Anguished roar )

364
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,568
( Whimpering )

365
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:41,671
Well, at least he didn't do
thatmuch damage.

366
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:45,205
( Car alarm wails )

367
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,477
Oh, boy.
Dipper, it's the third day.

368
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:49,609
We've only got seven hours
to earn back our profits

369
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,542
or I've gotta wear
that "loser" shirt
all summer!

370
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,385
Hey, guys. Am I nuts,
or does this place
look different?

371
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:58,348
Wendy! Soos!
Am I glad to see you.

372
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:00,390
We've got a lot of work to do,
but if we hurry,

373
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,492
we can still beat Stan!

374
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,494
Uh, yeah. I got
a little headache,

375
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:06,596
so maybe I should,
like,notwork today.

376
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:09,028
And I actually just met
this pack of wolves,

377
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,401
and I think they're gonna,
like, raise me as
one of their own?

378
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:14,104
So I should really be
at the den right now.
But--but--

379
00:17:14,104 --> 00:17:16,106
but, hey,
we'll see you on Monday.

380
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:18,568
Uh, is anyone
gonna eat these?

381
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,344
Enough!!!

382
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,276
I havehadit!

383
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:28,248
I fought amonster
to save this business,

384
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,180
and this is how
you repay me?!

385
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,552
I'm gonna get an ulcer
from your lollygagging!

386
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,554
Lollygagging?
ulcer?

387
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,386
You're acting...
Different.

388
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:37,557
You shut your yaps!

389
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,829
I've been doing
everyone's jobs

390
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:42,462
while you've both
been bleeding me dry!

391
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,165
But--
no "buts" except yours
on the floor, cleaning!

392
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,168
Now quit loafing
and get to work!
Yes, Mabel.

393
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,200
That's "yes,boss."

394
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:53,072
( Gasps )

395
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,205
Dipper! what have I become?

396
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:58,478
What you had to, Mabel...
What you had to.

397
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,181
We've got seven hours
to turn this around!

398
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,582
Let's go, people!

399
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:06,586
You landed on "cash flood"!

400
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,158
Ha ha ha ha!

401
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:11,391
I'm givin' none of this
to charity!

402
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,563
And now you can go home
a thousandaire...

403
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:15,795
Or you could risk everything
to double your money

404
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,427
with the bonus word!

405
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:19,269
( Siren wails )

406
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,770
Rich, I'm a simple man.

407
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,474
So I'm gonna take my winnings,
pack my bags, and...

408
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:26,506
Bet them all on the bonus word!

409
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,439
( Cheers, applause )
come on!

410
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,612
Time is money, hardhats!

411
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,316
You got complaints,
file 'em with
the complaint department!

412
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,518
Ohh! my back!

413
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,321
Dipper! we got tourists
at nine o'clock!

414
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,853
What do I show them?
Real magic just
freaks people out.

415
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,895
Figure something out,
knucklehead!

416
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,359
Dipper:
ladies and gentletourists,

417
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,702
this shack is filled with
wonders never before seen
by human eyes!

418
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:56,536
Behold: the horrible
giant question baby!

419
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,209
Am I a man?
Am I a baby?

420
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:00,670
These are legitimate questions.

421
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,212
( All gasp )

422
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:03,873
Have your picture taken
with it for a buck.

423
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:06,246
Uh, ten bucks.
A hundred bucks!

424
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,879
( All clamoring )

425
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,352
We put the fun
in "no refunds."

426
00:19:13,723 --> 00:19:16,726
How'd we do?
We filled
the whole jar!

427
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:18,228
( All cheering )

428
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,191
Minus the money to replace
all the furniture

429
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:25,365
and supplies to fix the shack,
that leaves us..

430
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,767
One dollar.
( Door opens )

431
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,601
Tick-tock! time's up, kids!
Oh, no!

432
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:34,304
Nice to see you learned
how to dress while I was gone.

433
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:36,746
How much did you
beat us by?

434
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:40,410
I won $300,000!

435
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,782
And then...

436
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,615
For a chance to
double your cash
or lose it all,

437
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:48,718
what is a six-letter word
you use to ask for something
politely?

438
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:52,292
For example,
"may I (blank) Have that?"

439
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,594
Do I look like
an idiot, folks?
( Laughter )

440
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,327
The word is "gimmee."
Two e's.
( Buzzer )

441
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:59,569
Oooh! you know,
because you've gone this far,

442
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:01,531
we're gonna give you
one more chance.

443
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:03,703
Let's try again.
It's a "p" word.

444
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,606
Some might even say
it's the "magic word."

445
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,509
Abracadabra!
final answer!
( Buzzer )

446
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,711
I'm sorry, Stan,
but the word is...

447
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,513
"Please."

448
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,585
Apparently that word
canmake you money.

449
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:17,887
So, wait. If you
lost everything,

450
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:20,450
then that means--
Mabel! You won!

451
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,822
Whoo!
we did it!

452
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,695
Wait. what do we win
again?
Well, according to our bet,

453
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:28,428
I guess Mabel's the new boss?

454
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,501
All: no! No!
Don't do that!
Huh? What?

455
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:34,964
Grunkle Stan,
i had no idea how hard
it was being boss.

456
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:39,609
This place was cuckoo bananas
until I started barking orders
at people like you.

457
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:41,741
Yeah, well, I got to admit,

458
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,744
it's kind of nice
to be back, ya know?

459
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,277
Okay, okay, that's enough,
get offa me!

460
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:48,718
And Soos, Wendy...

461
00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:50,680
Get to work!

462
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,023
Ahem. please.
Uhh! Still hurts.

463
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:56,726
Mabel, didn't
your agreement say
something about

464
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:59,629
Stan having to do
some kind of apology dance
if he lost?

465
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:02,031
N-no. no, it didn't.
Actually, yeah,

466
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:04,033
I think I have it
in my notes here.

467
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,335
No! that never happened!

468
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:06,696
Ha ha! I'll get the camera!

469
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:08,398
All right, let me just--

470
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:09,569
huhh!

471
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,571
Grunkle Stan!

472
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:14,003
Uhh. look, I'm not gonna--

473
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:15,705
Mabel: do it!

474
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:18,648
В™є I'm Stan,
and I was wrong в™є

475
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:21,381
в™є I'm singing
"the Stan wrong song" в™є

476
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,783
в™є I shouldn't have
taken that chance в™є

477
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,486
в™є now here's my
remorseful dance в™є

478
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,687
do the kicks!

479
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:28,758
( Grunting )

480
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:31,561
Jazzier!

481
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:32,892
Hey, gimme that!

482
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:36,326
Stan: ow! My back!

483
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:38,428
What doyouthink?
( Squeals )

484
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:39,899
Take thirty!
