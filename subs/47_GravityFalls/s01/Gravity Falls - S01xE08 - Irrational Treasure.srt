1
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,607
( S( kids munching) )

2
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:12,080
Ha ha! Nacho earrings!
I'm hilarious!

3
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,481
That's debatable.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,483
Aw, come on.
What's with all this traffic?

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,318
And why is it all--

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,287
covered wagons?!

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,521
Oh, no!

8
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:21,822
No! no!

9
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,092
( Tires squeal )

10
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,527
Not today! Not today!

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,197
Ogoodness!s!

12
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,134
Grunkle Stan,
what's going on?

13
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:36,470
We gotta get out of here--
before it's too late!

14
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,473
They've circled the wagons!
We're trapped!

15
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:42,476
No!!!

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,212
( Cow bell clanks )

17
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:47,281
I got a good feeling
about today.

18
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:50,218
**

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,258
( laughter )

20
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,526
Man, look at the town.

21
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,431
Dirty glass!
We got dirty glass!

22
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:39,567
Aw, boy.Ass.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,369
It's pioneer day.

24
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,671
Every year these yahoos
dress up like idiots

25
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,207
to celebrate the day
gravity falls was founded.

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,277
Welcome to 1863!

27
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,312
I will break you,
little man!

28
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,314
Aah! aah!

29
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,484
Wow, look! Candle dipping!

30
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,220
Dipper: whoa!
Gold panning!

31
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,323
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

32
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:03,591
I do!

33
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,593
What you talkin' about?

34
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,229
Oh, yeah,
i remember this.

35
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:12,500
In gravity falls
it used to be legal
to marry woodpeckers.

36
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,436
Oh, it's still legal--
very legal.

37
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,273
Announcer:
come one and all
for the opening ceremonies!

38
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:22,276
Grunkle Stan,
no thank you!

39
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,911
Just remember if you
come back to the shack

40
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,280
talking like these people,
you're dead to me!

41
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:29,317
(With a twang)
Thar's a carpetbagger
in the turnip cellar!

42
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,585
Well, hornswaggle
my haversack!

43
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,686
( Both spit )

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,423
Dead to me!!!

45
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,391
Hear ye, hear ye!

46
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:41,695
Ye olde commencement ceremony
is about to commence.

47
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,498
Whoo! I got a bell!

48
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,302
Oh, no! Police! My purse!

49
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,604
Ring ring! Ring ring!
Hoo!

50
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,441
(Laughing) he sure
loves his bell.

51
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,444
( Microphone feeds back )

52
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,978
Howdy, everyone.

53
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,281
You all know me,
pacifica northwest,

54
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,316
great-great-granddaughter
of town founder

55
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,684
Nathaniel northwest.

56
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,353
I'm also very rich.

57
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,655
( Applause )

58
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,990
Now, if you've got
the pioneer spirit,

59
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,560
we ask you to come on up
and introduce yourself.

60
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,362
Audience participation!

61
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:17,565
I don't know, Mabel.
Isn't that girl kind of like
your arch enemy?

62
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,501
That's water
under the bridge.
( Giggles )

63
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,670
Our first newcomer is...

64
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,305
Mabel.

65
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,408
Yeah! let's this this
pioneer day started!

66
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,543
( Blows raspberry )
right, guys?

67
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,380
Chanting:
usa! usa!

68
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,682
All: usa! Usa!

69
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,552
Usa!...(sobbing)...usa!

70
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:41,989
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but pioneer day is for
serious people,

71
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,292
and you look and act
ridiculous.

72
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:46,660
I mean, a puppy
playing basketball?

73
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,462
Are you always this silly?

74
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:51,265
Hey! I can be serious!

75
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,266
( Grunting )

76
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,436
You do have nachos
hanging from your ears, hon.

77
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,407
(Giggles) wow,
I'm embarrassed for you.

78
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,608
Give her a hand,
everybody!

79
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,610
( Piano plays flourish,
audience applauds )

80
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,414
Now, who wants to hear
more about me?

81
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,415
Excuse me.

82
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,650
Every say, "northwest."

83
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,419
( Picture snaps )

84
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,687
(Laughing) we're perfect.

85
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,489
Hey, you okay?

86
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:18,692
I need some
old-timey butterscotch.

87
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,661
Let's get out of here.

88
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,798
( Wheels spinning )

89
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,367
( Hey, there.S )

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,303
Donkey boy. Give me a hand
with my car, huh?

91
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:33,407
Here in 1863
i have never heard tell
of a...Car.

92
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,410
Pray tell, what is
this magic wheel box?

93
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:39,079
Ach! come on, Steve,
you're a mechanic,
for Pete's sake.

94
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,213
Cut me some slack!

95
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:44,718
"Slack." I am unfamiliar
with this bold new expression.

96
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,387
I can't take this anymore!

97
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,389
I'm getting dumber
every second I'm here!

98
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,458
Are we gonna have to
intervene here?

99
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,361
Oh, look--
the constable.

100
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,430
What are you gonna do,
throw me in "ye stocks"?

101
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,098
Ha ha ha ha!

102
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,667
Aw, come on!

103
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,735
( Humming )

104
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,704
Hey, nice outfit, Gideon.

105
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,474
You actually look
less girly than usual.

106
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,475
Aha ha ha ha ha!

107
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,711
Why, Stanford, I'm just
a humble tomato farmer

108
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,480
sellin' his wares.

109
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,615
Whoops! I dropped one!

110
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,517
Whoops!

111
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,752
I dropped another one.

112
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,121
Arghh!!

113
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,924
Pioneer day!!!

114
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,698
Dipper, can i
ask you something?

115
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,534
Do you think I'm...Silly?

116
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,603
Uh, noooo.

117
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,538
Ohh! I knew it!

118
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,707
The nacho earrings,
the sweater--

119
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,542
I thought I was being charming,

120
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,378
but I guess people see me
as a big joke.

121
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,814
( Sighs )

122
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,782
Come on, Mabel.
You love that sweater.

123
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,552
I did before pacifica
ruined it for me.

124
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,920
She ruins everything.

125
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,523
Pacifica!

126
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,658
Why Doe she think that being
related to the town founder

127
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,493
means she gets to treat
everyone like garbage?

128
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,462
Someone needs to
take her down a peg.

129
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,731
Wait a minute!
I feel like I read something

130
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,400
about pacifica's
great-great-grandfather before.

131
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:09,136
Of course!
Oh, this is perfect.

132
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,572
(Old man voice)
"In my investigations..."

133
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:12,840
Should I do the voice?

134
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,808
I'll just read normal.

135
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:18,412
"In my investigations
i recently made a discovery.

136
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:21,682
"Nathaniel northwest
may not be the founder
of gravity falls.

137
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,784
"I believe the proof
of this secret is buried

138
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,687
"somewhere on
the enclosed document.

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,557
If only I could
crack the code."

140
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,429
Oh, man! If this
cover-up is true,

141
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,565
it means pacifica's
whole family is a fraud!

142
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,166
This could be
a major conspiracy!

143
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,569
I gotta investigate this!

144
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,604
Wait. I'm coming with you.

145
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,507
Conspiracies are
oh, yeah, definitely.

146
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,908
Well, if I help you
crack this code,

147
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,877
nobody could ever
call me silly again!

148
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,812
Yeah! mystery twins?

149
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,547
I thought you hated that.

150
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,948
I'm starting
to accept it.

151
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:57,885
( Both laughing )

152
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,956
This is sheriff blubs.
We've got a code sepia.

153
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,593
What?! and what
are you doing about it?

154
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,660
I'm following them
right now.

155
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:09,730
Find them and stop them.
There's no room for error.

156
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,533
I understand.
Blubs out.

157
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,602
Deputy durland,
maintaining this cover-up

158
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,705
is the mission we've been
training for our entire careers.

159
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,840
Are whoo!Eady?

160
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:23,577
If being delightful
was a crime, you'd be
breaking the law.

161
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:24,845
Let's go get 'em!

162
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,780
Ha ha ha ha!

163
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,521
Back in the olden days,
pioneers drew sustenance

164
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,656
from telling stories
around the fire.

165
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,491
So let's eat some books,
children.

166
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,527
Go ahead, eat the books!

167
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,765
All right, Mabel.
If we can prove that
Nathaniel northwest

168
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,767
wasn't the real founder
of gravity falls,

169
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,769
it'll finally put
pacifica in her place.

170
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,639
And solving a mystery
will prove that I'm not silly,

171
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,940
I'm serious!

172
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,678
Seriousss...

173
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,647
We just need to crack this code.

174
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,682
Let me see...

175
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,651
It's not Egyptian,

176
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,653
it's not numerology,

177
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,788
it's not--wait! Of course!

178
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,591
The triangle is
the alchemist's
symbol for flame.

179
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,594
Lighting the parchment on fire
will reveal the secret message!

180
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,829
It's so obvious!

181
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,799
All right. Let's just
light this sucker up and--

182
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,902
mwop! I just made a hat!

183
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,573
Achh! I just did
something silly again!
( Blows raspberry )

184
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,609
Wait. Mabel,
you folded it into a map.

185
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,279
And I was gonna burn it.

186
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,814
Blubs: we were on the lookout
for two kids

187
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,649
who might be reading.

188
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,118
We're hunting 'em down
for secret reasons. Whoo!

189
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,855
Mrrrrp!

190
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,924
Maybe we should
take this elsewhere.

191
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:47,861
This map should lead us to...

192
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,964
The gravity falls
museum of history.

193
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,700
You realize what
this means, Mabel.

194
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,736
We're gonna have to
break in.

195
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,708
And those are your free
pioneer day passes

196
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,611
and your balloons,
blue and pink.

197
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,079
We're in.

198
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,649
What are we gonna do next?

199
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,719
Steal Thomas Jefferson's
rib cage?

200
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,854
Ew. no. According to the map,

201
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:18,058
the next clue about
the real town founder
should be right...Here!

202
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,127
We have to figure
this one out quick.

203
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,731
I have a feeling those cops
weren't at the library
to check out books.

204
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,066
I don't think the one
with the bell can read.

205
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,835
So what is it,
anyway?

206
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:30,804
Hmm.

207
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,642
Hmm.

208
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,344
Hey, painting.
Be less stupid.

209
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,013
(Gasps)huh?worked!

210
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,853
Wait! it's not abstract,
it's upside-down!

211
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,789
I think I've seen that statue
in the cemetery.

212
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:49,857
Let's go! Quick!

213
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,392
Ahh! ow!
Head rush.

214
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,728
I'm sorry, but we're
all out of pink balloons.

215
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,897
Why did we even come?

216
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,732
Radio:
officer blubs.

217
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,701
Blubs here.

218
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,935
Have the targets
been apprehended?

219
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,837
Negative.
but we're close.

220
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,974
I promise, those kids'll
never get past us.

221
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,776
Hey! wait!

222
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:10,744
( Both grunting )

223
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:12,780
Dang it!

224
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,014
( Bird singing )

225
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,783
For the last time,

226
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,918
we are not
going south for the winter!

227
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,788
Our home is here!

228
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,656
You alwa say that!

229
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,693
Come on...(Grunting)...

230
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:26,960
Come on. Aah!

231
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,865
Well, if it isn't
Mabel's uncle,
Mr. pines.

232
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,734
Lookinyeah, yeah.

233
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,902
What do you want,
money?

234
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,037
I want you to say that
the northwest family

235
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,673
is the best family
in gravity falls.

236
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,075
Oh, sure.
You want that in writing?

237
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,944
(Grunting) mm-hmm...

238
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,178
There we go.

239
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,916
Ha! I did that
with my mouth!

240
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,250
( Whistles )

241
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,856
Oh, come on!

242
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,424
Dipper: ah.

243
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:01,829
The statue must be pointing
to the next clue.

244
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,798
Oh, cool!
She's picking my nose! Ha ha!

245
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,133
Ach.

246
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,770
Mabel, look!

247
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,006
Ha! who's silly now,
pacifica? Bam!

248
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,843
Ahh! ow. Ow. Ow.
Okay.

249
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,081
Now we're getting into
real conspiracy mode.

250
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,184
I feel so serious.

251
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,886
Mmm.

252
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:30,057
Okay, look out
for booby traps.

253
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,159
Ha! booby traps.

254
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,766
Tranquilizer daaah!

255
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,804
( Both scream )

256
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,881
It's a treasure trove
of historic-y, secret-y things.

257
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,818
Oh, man!

258
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,888
Ben Franklin
secretly was a woman.

259
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:01,922
Hey, jackpot!

260
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,093
Now we'll find out
who the real town founder was.

261
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,197
"Let it be here recorded
that Nathaniel northwest,

262
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,999
"fabled founder
of gravity falls,

263
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,167
"was, in fact, a fraud,

264
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,938
as well as a waste-shoveling
village idiot."

265
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,172
Ha ha ha!

266
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,109
Oh, bad news
for pacifica.

267
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,311
Wait'll the papers
hear about this!

268
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,047
Once people see that I uncovered
a historical conspiracy,

269
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,882
they could never call me silly!

270
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,851
"The true founder
of gravity falls

271
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:34,221
was sir lord,
Quentin trembley,
III, esquire."

272
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,323
Who's Quentin trembley?

273
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,191
That's none of your business!

274
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,326
( Both gasp )

275
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,328
Whoo! we gotcha!

276
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,963
Whoo! whoo--

277
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,899
hmm--whoo-hoo...

278
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,768
He got hit with
quite a few of those darts.

279
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,574
I hate to do this,
but Quentin trembley's
a matter of national security.

280
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,110
Yeah! yeah-- whoo--

281
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,179
I think I might
be colorblind now.

282
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,848
What do you mean,
national security?

283
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,950
And who is Quentin trembley,
anyway?

284
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,384
See for yourself.

285
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,157
Ahh, black and white?!

286
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,825
Shh! Mabel.

287
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,160
If you're watching this,

288
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,562
then you are
one of eight people
in these United States

289
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,965
with clearance
to view this information.

290
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:22,235
In fact, I myself
will be shot as soon as
the filming is complete.

291
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,138
What? no? Ha!
Well, that's a relief!

292
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,374
Of all of America's secrets,

293
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,177
the most embarrassing
was that of Quentin trembley.

294
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,113
The eighth-and-a-half president
of the United States.

295
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,148
Eighth-and-a-half?!

296
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:40,020
After winning
the 1837 election
in a landslide,

297
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,389
Quentin trembley
quickly gained a reputation

298
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,858
as America's
silliest president.

299
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:48,195
He waged war on pancakes,
appointed six babies
to the supreme court,

300
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,131
and issued
the de-pants-ipation
proclamation.

301
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,166
His state of the union speech
was even worse.

302
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,402
Trembley:
the only thing we have to fear

303
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,972
is gigantic,
man-eating spiders!

304
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,140
He was kicked out of office

305
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,308
and escaped to
an uncharted valley

306
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,076
he named gravity falls,

307
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,878
after plummeting into it
at high speed.

308
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,214
Trembley's shameful term
was erased from history

309
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:10,951
and officially replaced
by William Henry Harrison
as president

310
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,154
and local nobody
Nathaniel northwest
as founder of gravity falls.

311
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,324
The whereabouts
of president trembley's body
are unknown.

312
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,028
Until now.

313
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,196
Whoa!

314
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,265
Is that, like,
Amber or something?

315
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,967
The fool thought
he could live forever

316
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,170
by encasing himself in a block
of solid peanut brittle.

317
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,272
Smooth move,
Mr. president!

318
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,175
Finding trembley's body
was our special mission.

319
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,011
And now, thanks to you,
it's complete.

320
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,046
Who knew all we had to do

321
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,382
was follow a little girl's
trail of candy wrappers?

322
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,684
Ohh, silly!

323
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,286
Now that you know the truth,

324
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,322
well, we can't let you
go around talkin' about it.

325
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,258
Are you gonna kill us?!

326
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,060
No, no.

327
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,928
Calm down now, buddy,
calm down.

328
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:58,231
We're just gonna escort you
and all this stuff
back to Washington.

329
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:01,034
You ain't comin' back,
by the way.

330
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,270
( Train whistle blows )

331
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,372
Whoo-hoo!
we got fold-out beds!

332
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,675
Good thing I brought
my book of spooky ghost stories!

333
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,211
I brought rope for
friendship bracelets!

334
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,080
( Both giggling )

335
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,347
Mabel: anyone there?! Help!

336
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,216
Hey! let us out!

337
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,253
Ohh. I can't believe I left
a trail of candy wrappers.

338
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,355
This is all my fault.

339
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,225
Pacifica had me pegged
all along.

340
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,693
I'm just a silly failure,

341
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:30,030
like that embarrassing
president what's-his-name.

342
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,004
Aahh!

343
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,372
It is I, Quentin trembley.

344
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,443
You're alive! But how?

345
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:47,414
Peanut brittle really does have
life-sustaining properties!

346
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,250
You're not silly,
you're brilliant!

347
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,385
And so are you, dear girl,

348
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,256
for following my clues
and freeing me from
my delicious tomb!

349
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,292
He's right!
Making maps into hats,
hanging upside-down;

350
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,194
your silliness solved the code

351
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,463
that serious cops couldn't crack
in a hundred years!

352
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,398
Oh, stop it.

353
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,234
By Jefferson!

354
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:11,104
We seem to be trapped in
some sort of crate-shaped box.

355
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,273
It's a crate,
Mr. president.

356
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,542
Good thing I have
the president's key,

357
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,578
which can open
any lock in America.

358
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,483
( Grunting )

359
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,285
I don't think
that's gonna work.

360
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,787
Wood! my age-old enemy.

361
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,955
In order to get out of here,

362
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,392
this is going to take
the silliest plan
ever conceived.

363
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,195
I think I know who can help you.

364
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,497
Hmm. how about...

365
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,399
That hole?

366
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,534
We will leap
through it!

367
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,472
Almost. almost there...Good...

368
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,307
Keep pushing.

369
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,142
I'm not sure
this is working.

370
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,344
Trust the silliness!

371
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,380
Fiddlesticks!
keep going...

372
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,117
Is that my third wife Sandy?

373
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,423
Well, we didn't fit
through the hole.

374
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:06,193
Let's rebuild the box
and try again.

375
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,460
We gotta
get out of here!

376
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,229
Also good.

377
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,233
Blubs!

378
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,473
Give me that!

379
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,245
( Grunting )

380
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,619
(Panting) there is...

381
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,122
No escape!

382
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,557
I gotta take a knee.

383
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,227
Are you okay?
Can I get you
anything?

384
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,097
Edwin durland, you are
a diamond in the rough.

385
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,833
Sheriff blubs,
do you really want
to lock us all up

386
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,868
in a government
facility somewhere?

387
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,337
I've got no choice!

388
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,239
Our orders come from
the very top!

389
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,107
Wait!

390
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,110
Quentin, did you ever sign
an official resignation?

391
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:01,181
No, sir. I ate a salamander
and jumped out the window.

392
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,383
Then technically
you're still legally

393
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,385
the president of
the United States, right?

394
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,520
You've gotta answer
to thi guy now!

395
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:08,888
Huh?

396
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,491
As president of these
several United States,

397
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:15,395
I hereby order you
to pretend none of this
ever happened.

398
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,397
And go on a delightful vacation.

399
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,432
Ow! yes.

400
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,134
Vacation?

401
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,203
What place have you
always wanted to visit?

402
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,604
One, two...

403
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:28,308
Both: silly water fun slides
in grand lakes, Michigan!

404
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,143
( Both laughing )

405
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:33,380
Bybye!e!

406
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:36,483
You've done a great service
to your country, Mabel.

407
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,453
As thanks, I'd like to make you
an official U.S. congressman.

408
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,291
I'm legalizing
everything!

409
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,159
Auh, actually--

410
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,228
you, dear boy,
are on your way to unlocking

411
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,197
the mysteries of
this great land,

412
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,600
so I'd like you to have
my president's key.

413
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,507
And then he chased me around
and spanked me with a paddle
for, like, three hours.

414
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,942
Bottom line:
George Washington was a jerk.

415
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,244
Agreed.

416
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,713
Oh!

417
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,715
Kick her off the team.

418
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,453
Hey, pacifica! I uncovered
a government conspiracy

419
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,456
about the eighth-and-a-half
President of the United States!

420
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,590
Who's silly now?

421
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,193
What? who is
that idiot?

422
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,462
Put up your Dukes,
you bald fiend!

423
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,465
The eighth-and-a-half president
of America.

424
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,335
I know what you're thinking:
How is he still alive?

425
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,271
Well, turns out
you can hibernate
in peanut brittle and it--

426
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:35,342
ha ha ha! Wow!
You really are a sad,
dumb little girl.

427
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,544
Nice top hat,
by the way.

428
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:40,413
Ha ha!
Good one, daughter.

429
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,250
Ooh! I see your car
is stuck in the mud.

430
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,285
Enjoy walking home.

431
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:51,224
Aren't you gonna tell her about
her ate-gray ampa-gray?

432
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:54,261
You know what, Dipper?
I've got nothing to prove.

433
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,397
I've learned to see
silly as awesome!

434
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,534
Well, I haven't
learned anything!

435
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:02,735
Hey, pacifica!

436
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,571
( Brakes squeal )

437
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,474
Nathaniel northwest
didn't found gravity falls,

438
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,008
and your whole family is a sham.

439
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,543
Deal with it!

440
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,515
What?! mom!!!

441
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,650
Man, revenge
is underrated.

442
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,386
That felt awesome!

443
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,521
Children, I am
needed elsewhere.

444
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,557
Just know that
I'll always be
right here...

445
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,627
On the negative
twelve dollar bill.

446
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,396
Whoa.

447
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,663
This is worthless.

448
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,599
It's less then worthless,
my boy.

449
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,634
Trembley away!

450
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,640
Where do you think
he's going?

451
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,575
I'm gonna say...
Off a cliff.

452
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,578
And then Soos came by
and talked to me
for like an hour.

453
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,647
You've been through
so much.

454
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,284
It works!

455
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:54,654
So wi am a congressman.Hat?

456
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,657
You are officially
pardoned.?

457
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,426
( Both laughing )

458
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,629
Oy! you are never gonna
make sense, are you, kid?

459
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,664
No, I'm not,
grunkle Stan.

460
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,533
No, I'm not.

461
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,835
Mabel away!

462
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,438
I'm okay!

463
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,674
Esteemed gentlemen
of the United States
supreme court,

464
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,444
I implore you to
rethink your decision!

465
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:20,713
( Baby talk )

466
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,550
Very well. But who
would you have replace me?

467
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,584
Mama.

468
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,785
That old crone?!

469
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,555
Ba ba ba...

470
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:31,324
Chief justice num-num,
you're spitting up on yourself!

471
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,726
Now--ohh! oh, come on!

472
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,728
This is a courtroom! I--

473
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,597
this--this is a--

474
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,366
this is a dark day for America.
