1
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,540
( Bleating )

2
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,409
( Squeaking )

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,810
Mabel, do you
believe in ghosts?

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:13,447
I believe you're
a big dork! Ha ha ha ha!

5
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:14,448
Aaahhh!

6
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:15,583
Soos! Wendy!

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,786
( Panting )
what's up, Mr. pines?

8
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,589
I'm headin' out.
You two are gonna wash
the bathrooms, right?

9
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,591
Absolutely not.

10
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,060
Ha ha!
You stay outta trouble.

11
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,397
Hey, guys, what's this?

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,499
A secret ladder
to the roof?

13
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,801
Uh, I don't think
Mr. pines would like that.

14
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,536
Uh?

15
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,071
You're freakin'
me out, dude!

16
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:38,539
Can we actually go up there?

17
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,442
Sure we can.
Roof time! Roof time!

18
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,077
Roof time! Roof time!

19
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,612
Uhh...

20
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,419
All right, check it out.

21
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:52,386
Whoa, cool!

22
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,589
Did y put all this
stuff up here?

23
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,858
I may or may not
sneak up here during work,

24
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,660
all the time, every day.

25
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,666
Me first!.

26
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,638
( Car alarm chirping )

27
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,841
Jackpot! high five!

28
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,510
Don't leave me hangin'.

29
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,611
Both: ha!

30
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,481
Hey, it's my friends.

31
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:21,682
Thompson: Wendy!

32
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:25,119
Uh, you guys aren't gonna tell
Stan about this, are you?

33
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,124
Later, dorks.

34
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,564
Let's get outta here!

35
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,665
Whoo!

36
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,501
Later, Wendy!
( Laughing )

37
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,603
Ah, guh-oh!Mes.

38
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:46,507
Somebody's in love!

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,575
Yeah, right.

40
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,510
I just think
Wendy's cool, okay?

41
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,546
It's not like
i lay awake at night
thinking about her.

42
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:56,550
Uh-oh.

43
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:42,596
Put on some dance party
for no reason!

44
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,932
( Dancgo! go! Go!Ying )

45
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,735
Go! go! Go! Go! Go!

46
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,741
( Stammering )
what? Yes? Yeah?

47
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,476
Aren't you gonna
get in on this?

48
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,944
I, uh,
don't really dance.

49
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,546
Yeah, you do.

50
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,614
Mom used to dress him up
in a lamb costume

51
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:01,715
and make him do...

52
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,751
The lamby dance.

53
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,587
Now is not
the time to talk
about the lamby dance.

54
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,621
Lamb costume? Whoa!

55
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,723
Is there, like, little ears
and a tail, or...?

56
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,492
Well, uh... uh...

57
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,495
Dipper would prance around
and sing a song about grazing.

58
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,630
( Cuckoo clock chimes )

59
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,499
Hey, look at that.

60
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,501
Quittin' time.
The gang's waitin' for me.

61
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,503
Hey, wait,
uh, maybe I could--

62
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,971
or we could come with you.

63
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,573
Ooh, I don't know.

64
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,641
My friends are
pretty intense.

65
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,510
How old did
you guys say you are?

66
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,513
We're 13, so,
technically a teen.

67
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,582
All right.
I like your moxie, kid.

68
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,216
Let me get my stuff.

69
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,787
Since when are we 13?
Is this a leap year?

70
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,556
Come on, Mabel.
This is our chance
to hang out with,

71
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,758
you know, the cool kids--
and Wendy and whatever.

72
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,794
I knew it!
You love her!

73
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,530
Love, love,
love, love, love!

74
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,664
Oh, hey, what's that?

75
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:51,732
Huh?

76
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,568
Bluh bluh bluh bluh.

77
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:56,770
Hurry up.

78
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,739
Lee and Nate:
In the belly!
In the belly!

79
00:03:58,772 --> 00:03:59,773
( Thompson groans )

80
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,610
In the belly!
In the belly!

81
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,745
Oh! ha ha ha!
Yeah!

82
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:07,781
All: Wendy!

83
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,683
Nate: Wendy! Wendy!

84
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,019
Hey, guys, these are
my pals from work,
Mabel and Dipper.

85
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,556
I chewed my gum
so it looks like a brain.

86
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,558
She's not much
for first impressions,

87
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,693
unlike this guy!

88
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,631
This guy...!

89
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,633
So are you, like,
babysitting or...?

90
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,668
Come on, Robbie.

91
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,836
Guys, this is
Lee and Nate...

92
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,604
Unh! ha ha ha!

93
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:31,839
Tamehh...

94
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,808
Thompson, who once ate a run-
over waffle for 50 cents...

95
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,710
Don't tell them that.

96
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,846
And Robbie.
You can probably
figure him out.

97
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,650
Yeah, I'm the guy
who spray-painted
the water tower.

98
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:43,817
Oh, you mean
the big muffin.

99
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,654
Um, it's
a giant explosion.

100
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,591
Heh heh! Kind of does
look like a muffin.

101
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,792
( Both laughing )

102
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,864
Let's hurry it up, guys.
I got big plans for
tonight, huh?

103
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,866
Letget in the car! Re!

104
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,734
( Playfully ) ow-wow!

105
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:03,303
Sorry, kid, I'll ride
shotgun, all right?

106
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,776
Okay, just, before we go,

107
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,880
my mom said you guys
aren't allowed to punch
the roof anymore, so...

108
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,649
Thompson! Thompson!
Thompson!

109
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:18,886
Thompson!
Thompson! Thompson!

110
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,632
Ha ha! This is gonna
blow someone's mind.

111
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,700
Mabel, please.

112
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,769
What? am I embarrassing
you in front of your new...

113
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:36,804
Girlfriend!

114
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,872
( Mumbling )

115
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,775
Uhh! did you just
lick my hand?

116
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,777
( Music playing )

117
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:44,845
You're watching
the black-and-white

118
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,815
period piece old lady
boring movie channel.

119
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,818
Kids! I can't find
the remote, and i
refuse to stand up!

120
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,754
Stay tuned for
the Friday night movie,
the duchess approves,

121
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,723
starring sturly
stembleburgiss

122
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,858

124
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:00,928
Kids!

125
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,832
( Orchestral music rises )

126
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,768
No! noooo!

127
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,140
There it is, fellas--

128
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,776
the condemned dusk-to-dawn.

129
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:16,810
Whoa!

130
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,812
Neat! awesome!

131
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:19,780
Wh-why did they
shut it down?

132
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,849
It's, like, a health
code violation, or...?

133
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,851
Some folks died in there.

134
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,953
The place has been
haunted ever since.

135
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,822
This town has such
a colorful history!

136
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,891
What? are--
are you guys serious?

137
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,727
( Feigning terror )
yeah. We're all
gonna die!

138
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,730
Chill out, man.
It's not as bad
as it looks.

139
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,901
Come on, Dipper.

140
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,169
( Chuckling )
okay.

141
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,838
Just-- just
gotta get a foothold.

142
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,740
Dude,
your sister did it.

143
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,809
Whup whup whup
whup whup whup.

144
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,878
Hey, you know what?
Just... there you go.

145
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,912
( Thud )

146
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,981
( Laughing )
sorry, dude.

147
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,750
Robbie: good job
throwing the kid
off the fence, genius.

148
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:57,885
Lee:
your mom's a genius.

149
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,987
( Audibly struggling )

150
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,956
Ho ho ho!
This place is amazing.

151
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,892
I think it's--
it's stuck.

152
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,827
Let me take
oh, yeah.T it.

153
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,862
I can't get in,
but I'm sure junior here

154
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,964
is gonna break it down
like Hercules.

155
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,934
Come on, leave him alone.
He's just a little kid.

156
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,779
Tambri: whoa, kid!
What are you doing?

157
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:29,016
( Audibly struggling )

158
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,986
Go, Dipper!
Punch that metal thing!

159
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,022
Hey, Dipper,
take it easy.

160
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,826
Who wants to bet
he doesn't make it?

161
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,995
( Happy chatter )

162
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,031
Good call,
inviting this
little maniac!

163
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,800
Your new name
is Dr. fun times.

164
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:47,901
All right.

165
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,937
Cool.
yeah, man.

166
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,038
Nice work.

167
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,009
Thompson:
do you guys really
think it's haunted?

168
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,978
Robbie:
nah! Thompson,
are you kidding me?

169
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,913
Come on, shut up,
man! Ha ha ha!

170
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,655
Whoa! no way!

171
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:11,625
( Overlapping
awed chatter )

172
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,660
Oh, man.

173
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,095
It's even creepier
than I imagined.

174
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,571
Yep, it's dust.

175
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,677
Hey, dude, where
do you think they
keep the dead bodies?

176
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,278
( Laughing )
shut up, man!

177
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,681
Guys, check it out!
You think they still work?

178
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,683
( Clanking )

179
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:39,319
( Machinery whirrs to life )

180
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,590
( Overlapping chatter )

181
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,691
Jackpot!

182
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,559
So, what are we
gonna do now?

183
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:46,694
Anything we want.

184
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,700
Take that.

185
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,602
( Laughter and chatter )

186
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,604
Ha ha ha! Ohh!

187
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,107
Put 'em in, put 'em in!
Three at a time,
three at a time!

188
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,109
( Happy shouting )

189
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,545
( Laughter )

190
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:09,316
Oh, my gosh!
Smile dip!

191
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,619
I thought this stuff
was banned in America.

192
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,720
Maybe they had
a good reason.

193
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,155
Ha ha ha!

194
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,595
Robbie: hey, come here,
man, we got it ready!

195
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:22,696
Whatever it is,
I'll do it!

196
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,332
Ha ha ha! Thompson!

197
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,134
Dipper, this night
is, like, legendary.

198
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,703
Just look around.
The guys are bonding.

199
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,605
( Laughter )

200
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,142
I've never even seen
tambri look up from
her phone this long,

201
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,645
and your sister
seems to be going nuts
for that smile dip.

202
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:38,746
Uhh.

203
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,714
Maybe I've had too much.

204
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,650
What do you think?

205
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:46,153
( Inarticulate speech )

206
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,623
Would you like
to eat my candy paws?

207
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,692
Of course,
you little angel.

208
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,161
( Gnawing )

209
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,631
( Freezer buzzing )

210
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,166
You know, Dipper,
i wasn't sure

211
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,768
if you could hang
with our crew at first,

212
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,770
but you're surprisingly
mature for your age.

213
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,738
Yes. yes, I am.

214
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,776
Hey, guys,
we need more ice.

215
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,211
I'm on it.

216
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,689
( Screams )

217
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,624
( Panting )

218
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,669
What was that?

219
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,771
I thought I heard some
lady screaming back here.

220
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,206
You freakin' out, kid?

221
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,809
No. no, I'm cool.
Everything's cool.

222
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,677
Then what's all this about?

223
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,412
Oh, that's...
Uh... uh... uh...

224
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,714
Hey, look!

225
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,215
Dancy pants revolution,

226
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,817
the game that tricks
people into exercising.

227
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,418
All right, I'm down.

228
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,754
Yeah, let's all--
let's all go play that.

229
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:54,822
Hm.

230
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,427
Male voice:
( Dadance! Hurry up!G )

231
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,229
Go! go! Go! Go!

232
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,464
Wow! he's really
terrible at this.

233
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,768
( Nervous chuckle )
yeah, yeah, that's--
that's great.

234
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,275
( Cries out )

235
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,712
I'll be right back.

236
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,747
( Telephone rings )

237
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,481
Come on,
grunkle Stan,
pick up!

238
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,450
Uhh! what is he doing?

239
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,753
I don't care about
Dukes or commoners...

240
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,488
Or his royal highness,
Lionel of cornwall.

241
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,257
I'm not afraid
anymore, mother.

242
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,726
D ( telephone rings ) u.

243
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,497
I may be a duchess,
but I'm also a woman!

244
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,899
Yes! yes!

245
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,868
In your face,
Elizabeth!

246
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,737
( Hysterically )
it's just like my life!

247
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,905
( Calmly )
in a way.

248
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,774
( Dial tone )

249
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,275
Mabel,
i need your advice.

250
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,843
We're hanging out
in a haunted
convenience store,

251
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,745
I can't get ahold
of grunkle Stan,

252
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,679
and if I try to say
anything about it

253
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,281
to any of these guys,
they'll just think

254
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,283
I'm a scared little kid
or something.

255
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,885
( Groaning )

256
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,853
Mabel?

257
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,889
The future is in the past!

258
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,957
Onward, deoshebah!

259
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,797
( Car alarm blares )

260
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,899
Mabel! how many
of these did you eat?

261
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,301
Eleventeen.

262
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,804
Oh, man.
Oh man, oh man, oh man!

263
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:26,546
Whoa, guys,
you might wanna see this.

264
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,849
( Overwhat the heck?Ons )

265
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,785
Whoa. then the rumors
are true.

266
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,787
Dude, dare you
to lie down in it.

267
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,923
Good idea.
Go lie down in it.

268
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:39,326
I'm a dead body! Look!

269
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,794
Wait!

270
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,329
Maybe let's not do that.

271
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,897
This guy's scared!

272
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,333
All I'm saying is,
why tempt the fates?

273
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:50,570
I mean, what if
this place really is...

274
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,339
Haunted?

275
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,808
( All jeering )

276
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,810
Just take it down
a notch, captain buzzkill.

277
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,812
But I thought
i was Dr. fun times.

278
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:02,582
Well, you're acting like
captain buzzkill, right?

279
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,885
Yeah. little bit.

280
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,954
Status update:

281
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,357
Trapped in store
with insane 9-year-old.

282
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,560
I'm not a 9-year-old.
I'm 13,

283
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,963
technically a teen!

284
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,965
Whoa? what is that?

285
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,973
( Gasps )

286
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,607
Whoa!

287
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,876
What?

288
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,577
"Status update...

289
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,412
Aaaahhhhhhh."

290
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,885
Aaahhh!

291
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:42,122
Aaahhh!

292
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,057
Aaahhh!

293
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,959
Tambri! tambri!

294
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,895
Can you hear us?

295
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,999
I don't know, man!
What Ari don't know! To do?

296
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,100
Let's just go already!

297
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,035
Thwait!n!

298
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,138
I've almost got
the high score!

299
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,140
Aah! aaahhh!

300
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,009
Huh? what?

301
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,144
Male voice:
Time to shake what
your momma gave you!

302
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,948
Oh, no! Help!
So many arrows!

303
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,149
You're a dance machine!

304
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,151
No, you're
a dance machine!

305
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,185
( Crying )

306
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,954
Thompson!

307
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,255
Forget him!
Let's go!

308
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,260
What the--?
Guys, it's locked!

309
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,995
Outta my way!

310
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,197
Aah!

311
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,999
Aaahhh!

312
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,134
Everybody, wait.

313
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,037
Whatever is doing this
has to have some kind
of reason.

314
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,039
Maybe if we could just
figure out what it is,

315
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,173
then they'll
let us out of here.

316
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,274
"They'll let
us out of here."

317
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,043
Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense.

318
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,011
I don't know, guys.
Maybe he's got a point.

319
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,279
Yeah, right.

320
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,248
I'm sure the ghost
just wants to talk
about his feelings!

321
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,117
Aah! aah!
Aaahhh!

322
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,286
Wh-what?

323
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,189
I'm bonkers for
eating you alive!

324
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,223
No!

325
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,992
Lee: aaahhh!

326
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,026
Lee!

327
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,027
Okay, okay.

328
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:58,198
I'm with you, kid.
One hundred percent, man.

329
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,133
Evil masculine voice:
Welcome!

330
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,202
They got Mabel! )

331
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,038
Welcome to your graves,
young trespassers!

332
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,173
Ha ha ha!

333
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,009
We're super sorry
for hanging out
in your store.

334
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,178
Yeah, can we just
go now and leave forever?

335
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:15,182
Well... okay.
You're free to go.

336
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,219
But before you leave,
hot dogs are now half off.

337
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,222
I know it might
be crazy, but you
gotta try these dogs!

338
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,025
( Both screaming )

339
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,226
Just kidding
about the hot dog sale!

340
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,029
Just let us
outta here already!

341
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,330
I don't like your tone!

342
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,135
No, no! Aah!

343
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:40,240
What? no!
I'm a hot dog!

344
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,075
It begins!

345
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,279
Whoa!

346
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,149
Unh!

347
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,284
Ohh!

348
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,022
Aah!

349
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:58,258
Welcome to your home
for all eternity!

350
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,061
Dipper, duck!Do we do?

351
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,162
Quick, in there!

352
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,234
( Both panting )

353
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,136
What do they
want from us?

354
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,238
What did we do wrong?

355
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,273
Okay, let's
try to figure out
the pattern here.

356
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,108
Why was
each person taken?

357
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,244
Tambri was texting,
Thompson was playing
a video game,

358
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,180
Lee was being sarcastic--
it doesn't make any sense!

359
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,350
Yeah. I mean,
those are all just
normal teenage things.

360
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,087
Wendy, say that
last part again.

361
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,288
"Normal teenage things"?

362
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,290
Of course! Stay here
until I get back.

363
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,127
Dude,
what are you doing?

364
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,333
( Growling )

365
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,303
I've got something
to tell you.

366
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm not a teenager!

367
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,213
Ho ho ho!

368
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,348
Well, why didn't
you say so?

369
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,184
Waaahh!

370
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,185
Ugh.

371
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,120
How old did you
say you were?

372
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,289
I'm... ( sighs )

373
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,292
I'm 12,
technically not a teen.

374
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:08,395
When we were alive,
teenagers were a scourge
on our store.

375
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,397
Always sassafrassin'
customers

376
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,299
with their boomie-boxes

377
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,401
and disrespectful
short pants,

378
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,437
so we decided
to up and ban them,

379
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,309
but they retaliated
with this newfangled
rap music!

380
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,245
Ma: the lyrics,
they were so... hateful!

381
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,213
* homework's wack,
and so are rules *

382
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,216
* tuckin' in
your shirt's for fools *

383
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,350
nooo!

384
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,352
Ma: it was so shocking,
we were stricken down

385
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,254
with double heart attacks.

386
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,156
( Both groaning )

387
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,225
( Flatline )

388
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,393
That's why we hate
teenagers so much,

389
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:43,196
don't we, honey?

390
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,131
But they're my friends.

391
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,433
Isn't there anything
i can do to help them?

392
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,401
There is one thing.

393
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,471
Do you know any
funny little dances?

394
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,474
Uh... is there
anything else I can do?

395
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,244
Nooooo!

396
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,247
Okay, okay, okay!
Um, well...

397
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,417
I do know...
The lamby-lamby dance,

398
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:08,321
but, uh, but I can't
really do it without
a lamb costume.

399
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:13,226
Oh. well. There it is.

400
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,427
Whew.

401
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,363
* well

402
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,199
* who wants
a lamby lamby lamby? *

403
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,233
* I do! I do!

404
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:24,271
* so go up and greet
your mammy mammy mammy *

405
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,306
* hi there,
hi there *

406
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,375
* so march, march,
march around the daisies *

407
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,277
yes! yes! More! More!

408
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:35,415
* don't, don't, don't
you forget about the baby *

409
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:42,222
that was some fine
girlie-dancin', boy!

410
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,424
Your friends are free.

411
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,295
Well, I don't think
you have to worry about
us comin' back, so...

412
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,334
All: ohh!

413
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,436
( Groans )

414
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,271
( Groans )

415
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,408
I'm never gonna eat
or d anything ever again.

416
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,244
Hey, there's
still some evil!

417
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,314
What-- what happened after
everything went crazy?

418
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,249
You are not
going to believe it.

419
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,285
The ghosts appeared,
and Dipper had to...

420
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,454
Uh... ahem...

421
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,523
And, um, Dipper
just grabbed a bat

422
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,326
and started
beating ghosts down,
left and right.

423
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,428
And then the ghosts
got all scared

424
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,530
and ran away like
a couple of little girls.

425
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:26,299
It no way!Ane!

426
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,368
Lee:
Dr. fun times!

427
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,507
Well, I'm probably
scarred for life.

428
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,277
Yeah, that was
pretty crazy.

429
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,280
Think I'm gonna go
stare at a wall for a while
and rethink everything.

430
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,448
Hey, next time we hang out,

431
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,416
let's stay at
the mystery shack, okay?

432
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,518
Ha ha! Next time?

433
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:48,355
Yeah, let's--
let's hang out
at the shack.

434
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,589
Ha ha! Yeah.

435
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,325
Next time.

436
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,496
Ohh!

437
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,499
What kind of
sick joke is this?

438
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,606
( Orchestral music playing )

439
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,375
Ah, the wedding.

440
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,377
I've waited
so long for this.

441
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,611
Oh, look at her
in that dress.

442
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,446
( Door bursts open;
Crowd reacts )

443
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,515
Count Lionel!
What's he doin' here?!

444
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,450
I've come to
reclaim my bride!

445
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,619
You had your chance
at the cotillion, you!

446
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,389
You had your chance
at the cotillion, you!

447
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,523
That's what I'm sayin'!

448
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,425
( Frustrated roar )

449
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,360
( Crash )

450
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,397
Uh...

451
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,698
Couldn't find
the remote.
