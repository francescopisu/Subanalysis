1
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,539
Dipper: ah, summer break...

2
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:08,276
You want cheese
woman: Sure, Hank.

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,411
A time for leisure,
recreation,

4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,446
and takin' 'er easy...

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,315
Unless you're me.

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,583
Aaaah!!!

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,452
( Screaming )

8
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,454
( Creature growling )

9
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,056
It's getting closer!

10
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,258
( Growling )

11
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:30,531
My name is Dipper.

12
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,833
The girl about to puke
is my sister Mabel.

13
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,169
You may be wondering what
we're doing in a golf cart

14
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,238
fleeing from a creature
of unimaginable horror.

15
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,272
Aaah!

16
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,275
Loaahh!t!

17
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,411
( Both screaming )

18
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:47,181
Rest assured,
there's a perfectly
logical explanation.

19
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:50,084
**

20
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,292
Dipper: let's rewind.

21
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,361
It all began

22
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:36,464
when our parents decided
we could use some fresh air.

23
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,399
They shipped us up north
to a sleepy town

24
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,368
called gravity falls, Oregon,

25
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,604
to stay at our great-uncle's
place in the woods.

26
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,307
This attic is amazing!

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,676
Check out all my splinters!

28
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,278
Baaa!

29
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,146
And there's
a goat on my bed.

30
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,481
Hey, friend.

31
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:58,319
Oh! yes, you can keep
chewing on my sweater.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

32
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,488
My sister tended to look
on the bright side of things.

33
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,890
Yay! grass!

34
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,592
But I was having a hard time

35
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,594
getting used to
our new surroundings.

36
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,928
Aaaah!

37
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,930
Aha ha ha ha!

38
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,300
And then was
our great-uncle Stan--

39
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,534
that guy.

40
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,236
Aha ha ha ha--

41
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,505
( coughing, choking )
it was worth it.

42
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,574
Our uncle had transformed
his house into a tourist trap

43
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,476
he called the mystery shack.

44
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,313
The real mystery was
why anyone came.

45
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,415
Ladies and gentlemen,
behold--

46
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:28,682
the sascrotch!

47
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,420
Oh, my gosh!

48
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:34,655
And guess who
had to work there.

49
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,324
( Soh!s )

50
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,459
No touching
the merchandise!

51
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,961
It looked like it was gonna be
the same boring routine

52
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,396
all summer,

53
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,165
until one fateful day...

54
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,203
He's looking at it.
He's looking at it!

55
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,339
Uh...

56
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,673
"Do you like me?

57
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,742
"Yes. definitely.

58
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,377
Absolutely"?

59
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,247
I riggmabel,

60
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,649
I know you're going through
your whole "boy crazy" phase,

61
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,552
but I think you're
kind of overdoing it
with the "crazy" part.

62
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,487
What?!
(blow raspberry)

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,489
Come on, Dipper!

64
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,491
This is our first summer
away from home.

65
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,994
It's my big chance to have
an epic summer romance.

66
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,730
Yeah, but do you need to flirt
with every guy you meet?

67
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:21,535
My name is Mabel,
but you can call me
the girl of your dreams.

68
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,538
I'm joking!
Ha ha ha ha!

69
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,707
Oh, my gosh,
you like turtles?

70
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,345
I like turtles too.
What is happening here?

71
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,746
Come one, come all,

72
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,716
to the mattress prince's
kingdom of savings!

73
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,452
(Whispers)
take me withaaah!

74
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,421
Mock all you want, brother,

75
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,456
but I got a good feeling
about this summer.

76
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,725
I wouldn't be surprised
if the man of my dreams

77
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,627
walked through that door
right now.

78
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,530
( Belching )

79
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,632
Oh! oh! Not good. Ow.

80
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,801
Ha ha ha!

81
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,269
All right,
look alive, people.

82
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:58,639
I need someone to go
hammer up these signs in
the spooky part of the forest.

83
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,641
Uh, also not it.

84
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,343
Nobody asked you, Soos.

85
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,012
I know, and I'm
comfortable with that.

86
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,448
Wendy! I need you
to put up this sign!

87
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:12,420
I would, but i--uhh--
can't--uhh--reach it.

88
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,355
I'd fire all of you
if I could.

89
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,391
All right, let's make it
eeny-meeny-miney--

90
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,926
oh! what?

91
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,330
Grunkle Stan,
whenever I'm in those woods
i feel like I'm being watched.

92
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,831
I'm telling you,

93
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,733
something weird is going on
in this town.

94
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,336
Just today my mosquito bites
spelled out "beware."

95
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,738
That says "bewarb."

96
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,676
Look, kid, the whole
"monsters in the forest" thing
is just local legend

97
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,779
drummed up by guys like me
to sell merch to guys like that.

98
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,048
( Laughing )

99
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,850
So quit being
so paranoid!

100
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,318
( Sighs )

101
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,487
( Wind whistling )

102
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,592
Ugh. grunkle Stan.

103
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,794
Nobody ever believes
anything I say.

104
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,565
( Metalhuh?clank )

105
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,601
( Clank clank )

106
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,705
( Hinges creak )

107
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,514
( Machinbaaa!hirring )

108
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:15,749
What the---?

109
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,535
"It's hard to believe
it's been six years
since I began studying

110
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:38,539
the strange
and wondrous secrets
of gravity falls, Oregon."

111
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,612
What is all this?

112
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:47,448
"Unfortunately, my suspicions
have been confirmed.

113
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,549
"I'm being watched.

114
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,518
"I must hide this book
before he finds it.

115
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,921
Remember, in gravity falls,
there is no one you can trust."

116
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,657
No one you can trust...

117
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,392
Aaah!!

118
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:00,428
Whatcha readin'?
Some nerd thing?

119
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,396
Uh--uh--it's nothing.

120
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,897
"Uh-uh--it's nothing."

121
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,934
( Laughs ) what? Are you
actually not gonna show me?

122
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:07,935
Uh...

123
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,370
Let's go somewhere private.

124
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,442
It's amazing!

125
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,544
Grunkle Stan said
i was being paranoid,

126
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:20,481
but according to this book,
gravity falls has this
secret dark side.

127
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,650
Whoa! shut up!

128
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,685
And get this:
After a certain point,

129
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,554
the pages just stop,

130
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,557
like the guy who was writing it
mysteriously disappeared.

131
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,858
Who's that?)

132
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,193
Well, time to spill the beans.

133
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,529
Broop. beans.

134
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,698
This girl's got a date.
Whoo whoo!

135
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,700
Let me get this straight.

136
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,903
In the half hour I was gone
you already found a boyfriend?

137
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,505
What can I say?

138
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,675
I guess I'm just
irresistible!

139
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,776
( Dooh!ell )

140
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,010
Coming!

141
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,615
What you readin' there,
slioh!

142
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,850
I was just catchin' up on,
uh...

143
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:00,554
"Gold chains for old men
that's a good issue.

144
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,523
Mabel: hey, family!

145
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,626
Say hello to
my new boyfriend!

146
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:07,895
'Sup?

147
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,663
How's it hangin'.

148
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:12,633
We met at the cemetery.
He's really deep.

149
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,635
Ooh! little muscle there.

150
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,904
What--
what a surprise.

151
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,706
So what's your name?

152
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:22,610
Uh...normal...man!

153
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:23,677
He means "Norman."

154
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,679
Are you bleeding, Norman?

155
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,616
It's jam.

156
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,884
Oh! I love jam!

157
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,820
Look at this!

158
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,857
So, you wanna go hold hands
or...Whatever?

159
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,760
Oh! oh, my goodness.
( Giggling )

160
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,828
Don't wait up!

161
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,566
( Crash,
glass breaking )

162
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,768
Dipper:
there was something about
Norman that wasn't right.

163
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,037
I decided to consult
the journal...

164
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,239
"Known for their pale skin
and bad attitudes,

165
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,643
"these creatures
are often mistaken for...
Teenagers?!

166
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,911
"Beware gravity falls's
nefarious...

167
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:58,912
( Gasps )

168
00:07:58,946 --> 00:07:59,913
( Thunder crashes )

169
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:00,981
'Sup?

170
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,017
...zombie!"
( echoing)

171
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:07,821
Did somebody say "cromby"?
What is that, "cromby"?

172
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,791
It's not even a word.
You're losin' your mind.

173
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,760
( Grunting )

174
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,662
( Grunting )

175
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,697
I like you.

176
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,065
Oh, no! Mabel!

177
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,671
No! no, Mabel!
Watuhh!Ut!

178
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,838
Aaaah!

179
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,007
Uhh.

180
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,543
Daisies?

181
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,712
You scallywag!

182
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,881
Is my sister really
dating a zombie,

183
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,549
or am I just going nuts?

184
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,150
It's a dilemma,
to be sure.

185
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,921
I couldn't help but overhear you
talking aloud to yourself
in this empty room.

186
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,823
Soos, you've seen
Mabel's boyfriend.

187
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,291
He's gotta be
a zombie, right?

188
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,827
Hmm. how many brains
did you see the guy eat?

189
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,763
Look, dude, I believe you.

190
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,865
I'm always noticing
weird stuff in this town.

191
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,568
Like the mailman? Pretty sure
that dude's a werewolf.

192
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,809
But you gotta have evidence.

193
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,011
Otherwise people are gonna think
you're a major league
cuckoo clock.

194
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,847
As always, Soos,
you're right.

195
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,850
My wisdom is both a blessing
and a curse.

196
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,052
Stan: Soos!
The portable toilets
are clogged again!

197
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,688
I am needed elsewhere.

198
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,026
My sister could be in trouble.

199
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,961
It was time to get
some evidence.

200
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,602
( Zombie-like grunting )

201
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:29,903
Aaauuggh!

202
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,675
( Grunting )

203
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:36,877
( Crash,
woman screams )

204
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,979
( Both laughing )

205
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,114
Aaah!

206
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,884
Aauggh!

207
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,719
( Both laughing)

208
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,155
I'd seen enough.

209
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,626
Mabel, we've gotta
talk about Norman.

210
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,163
Isn't he the best?
Check out this giant
smooch Mark he gave me!

211
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,032
Ha ha!

212
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:03,003
Gullible. it was just
an accident with
the leaf blower.

213
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,741
( Lkissing practice!G )

214
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,910
Mmm...mmm...

215
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,745
Aah! turn it off!

216
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,180
Turn it off!

217
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,949
No! Mabel, listen.

218
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:21,088
I'm trying to tell you
that Norman is not
what he seems!

219
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,124
( Gasps ) you think
he might be a vampire?

220
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,959
That would be so awesome!

221
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,094
Guess again, sister.

222
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,929
Saaah!m!

223
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,030
Oh, wait. I'm--
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,199
A zombie?

225
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,801
That is not funny,
Dipper.

226
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:34,968
I'm not joking!

227
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,938
It all adds up:
The bleeding, the limp--

228
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,674
he never blinks!
Have you noticed that?

229
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,043
Maybe he's blinking
when you're blinking.

230
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,946
Mabel, remember
what the book said
about gravity falls?

231
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,447
"Trust no one"!

232
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,918
What about me, huh?
Why can't you trust me?

233
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:51,952
Bemabel!!

234
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,921
He's gonna
eat your brain!

235
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,422
Dipper, listen to me.

236
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,991
Norman and I are going
on a date at five o'clock,

237
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:02,029
and I'm gonna be adorable,
and he's gonna be dreamy.

238
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,897
And I'm not gonna
let you ruin it-but--

239
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,734
with one of your
crazy conspiracies!

240
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,070
Ohh. what am I gonna do?

241
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,806
( Clock owl hoots,
doorbell rings )

242
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,041
Coming!

243
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,877
Hey, Norman.
How do I look?

244
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,847
Shiny!

245
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,149
You always know what to say!

246
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:26,987
Soos is right.

247
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,723
I don't have any real evidence.

248
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:33,026
I guess I can be kind of
paranoid sometimes, and--

249
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,094
wait! what?!

250
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,733
Aaah! I was right!
Oh, my god!

251
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,870
Oh, my god! Grunkle Stan!
Grunkle Stan! Grunkle Stan!

252
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,505
And here we have
"rock that looks
like a face" rock--

253
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,274
the rock that
looks like a face.

254
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,010
No, it looks like a face.

255
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,780
It's a rock
that looks like a face!

256
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,882
( Panting ) over here!
Grunkle Stan!

257
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,084
For the fifth time,
it's not an actual face!

258
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,152
Grrrr!!!

259
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,090
Finally, we're alone.

260
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:06,126
Yes... alone.

261
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,095
Stan! Stan!

262
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,596
Wendy! Wendy!

263
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,802
I need to
borrow the golf cart so I can
save my sister from a zombie!

264
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:18,839
Try not to hit
any pedestrians.

265
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,174
( Tires screeching,
reverse gear alarm beeping )

266
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,976
Dude, it's me, Soos.

267
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,178
Thanks. for the zombies.

268
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,948
And this is in case
you see a piг‘ata.

269
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,117
Uh...thanks?

270
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,219
Better safe than sorry!

271
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,988
(Grunts) mable,

272
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,157
now that we've gotten
to know each other,

273
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,325
there's...(exhales)...

274
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,795
There's something
i should tell you.

275
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,564
Oh, Norman!
You can tell me anything!

276
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,867
( Thinking ):
Please be a vampire,
please be a vampire.

277
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,302
All right, just--
just don't freak out, okay?

278
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,972
Just--just keep an open mind.
Be cool.

279
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,313
Is this weird?
Is this too weird?

280
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,082
You need to sit down?

281
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,084
R-right. I'll explain.

282
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,155
So, we're gnomes, first off,
get that one out of the way.

283
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,023
I'm Jeff,

284
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,592
and here we have
Carson, Steve,

285
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,227
Jason and--

286
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,129
I'm sorry,
i always forget your name.

287
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,831
Shmebulock.

288
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,200
Shmebulock. yes!

289
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,135
Anyways,
long story short,

290
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:26,039
us gnomes have been
lookin' for a new queen.
Right, guys?

291
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,042
All:
queen! queen!

292
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,078
Heh! so whaddya say?

293
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:37,117
Will you join us
in holy matri-gnome-y?

294
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,986
Matri-- matri-- mony?

295
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,854
Bleahh!
can't talk today.

296
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,223
(Inhales) look...

297
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,126
I'm sorry, guys,
you're really sweet,

298
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,329
but I'm a girl
and you're gnomes

299
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,631
and it's like, "what?!"

300
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,967
Yikes.

301
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:58,205
We understand.
We'll never forget you,
Mabel.

302
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,140
Because we're gonna
kidnaphuh?!

303
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,209
( Gnomes roar,
Mabel screams )

304
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:07,014
Dipper: don't worry, Mabel!
I'll save you from that zombie!

305
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,615
Mabel: help!!!!

306
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,317
Hold on!

307
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:17,157
The more you struggle,
the more awkward this is
gonna be for everybody.

308
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,027
Just--ha ha!--Okay,
just get her arm there,
Steve.

309
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,195
Aah! let go of me!

310
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,365
Uhh--

311
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,170
what the heck
is goin' on here?!

312
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,905
( Haah!s )

313
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,374
Dipper! Norman turned out
to be a bunch of gnomes!

314
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,176
And they're total jerks!

315
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,077
Uhh! hair! Hair!

316
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,048
Gnomes? huh.
I was way off.

317
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,917
"Gnomes. little men
of the gravity falls forest.

318
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,318
"Weaknesses:" unknown.

319
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,254
Oh, come on!

320
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,322
Hey! hey!
Let go of my sister!

321
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:52,259
Oh! ha ha. Hey there!
Um, ya know,

322
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,262
this is all really just
a big misunderstanding,
ya see?

323
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,930
Your sister's not in danger--

324
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,365
she's just marrying
all one thousand of us

325
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,201
and become our gnome queen
for all eternity.

326
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,335
Isn't that right, honey?

327
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,072
You guys are butt-faces!

328
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,240
Give her back right now,
or else!

329
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,376
You think you can
stop us, boy?

330
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,345
You have no idea what
we're capable of.

331
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,148
The gnomes are
a powerful race!

332
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,217
Do not trifle with the--

333
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,952
aaaah!

334
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,388
( Yells )

335
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,490
He's getting away
with our queen!

336
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,958
No, no, no!!!

337
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:25,925
Seat belt.

338
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,364
You've messed with
the wrong creatures, boy.

339
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:35,268
Gnomes of the forest...
Assemble!

340
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,249
Hurry! before they
come after us!

341
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,250
I wouldn't worry about it.

342
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,353
You see their little legs?
Suckers are tiny.

343
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,388
( Loud stomping
in distance )

344
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,426
Dang.

345
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,197
All right, teamwork, guys!
Like we practiced.

346
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,333
( Roaring )

347
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,400
Move. move!

348
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,369
( Roaring )

349
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,175
Jeff gnome:
Comit's getting closer!N!

350
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,776
( Roeh!ng )

351
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,578
Yahh!

352
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,982
( Evil laugh )

353
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,418
Brahh!!

354
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,587
(Shmebulock!)

355
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,291

360
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,400
Don't mention it.

361
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,337
Yahh!

362
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,174

364
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,183
( Both groaning )

365
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,119
Stay back, man!

366
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,354
( Roaring )

367
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,589
( Screaming )

368
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,557
Where's grunkle Stan?

369
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,426
Behold!

370
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,129
The world's most
distracting object!

371
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,431
Just try to look away--
you can't!

372
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,335
I can't even remember
what I was talkin' about.

373
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,604
Jeff gnome:
It's the end of
the line, kids.

Aah! aaah!

392
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,396
That's for lying to me!

393
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,365
That's for breaking my heart!

394
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,866
Ow! my face!

Anyone else wants some?

403

( Blowing )

404
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,893
( Whimpering )

405
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,295
Baaaa!

406
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,565
Hey, Dipper. I, um,

407
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,701
I'm sorry for
ignoring your advice.

408
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,903
You really were just
looking out for me.

409
00:18:56,936 --> 00:19:00,507
Oh, don't be like that.
You saved our butts back there.

410
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,709
I guess I'm just sad
that my first boyfriend

411
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,677
turned out to be
a bunch of gnomes.

412
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:08,181
Look on the bright side--
maybe the next one
will be a vampire.

413
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,483
( Laughs )
you're just saying that.

414
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,452
Awkward sibling hug?

415
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,321
Awkward sibling hug.

416
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,456
Pat pat.

417
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,525
( Entry bell rings )

418
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,328
Sheesh! you two get hit
by a bus or somethin'?

419
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,362
Aha!

420
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,599
Uh, hey!

421
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,268
W-wouldn't you know it?

422
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,703
Um, I accidentally
overstocked some inventory,

423
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:34,541
so how's about each of you
take one item from the gift shop
on the house?

424
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,476
What's the catch?

425
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,347
The catch is do it
before I change my mind.
Now take something.

426
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,482
Oooh! hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

427
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,420
Hmm. that oughta
do the trick.

428
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:50,423
And I will have a...

429
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,359
Grappling hook!

430
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:56,396
Wouldn't you rather have
a doll or something?

431
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:01,534
Grfair enough.!

432
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,536
( Laughing )

433
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,574
"This journal told me there was
no one in gravity falls

434
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,509
"i could trust.

435
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,344
"But when you battle
a hundred gnomes

436
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,512
"side-by-side with someone,

437
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,516
you realize that they've
probably always got your back."

438
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,518
Hey, Mabel,
could you get the light?

439
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,652
I'm on it.

440
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,622
It worked!

441
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,525
These grappling hooks...

442
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,794
Dipper: our uncle told us
there was nothing strange
about this town.

443
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,263
But who knows
what other secrets

444
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,332
are waiting to be unlocked?

445
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,766
( Beeping )

446
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:47,614
Aaah!

447
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,549

448
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,017
