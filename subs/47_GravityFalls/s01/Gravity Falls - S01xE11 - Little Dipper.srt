1
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:05,636
"Zombie attack"?

2
00:00:05,636 --> 00:00:07,178
Never works.
They don't take orders.

3
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:09,210
"Blood rain"?
Ew. Mess up my suit.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,581
Ha. no, thank you.

5
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:13,444
"Demon caterpillars"?
Snap!

6
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:15,346
There must be a perfect way
to exact vengeance

7
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:16,517
on the pines family.

8
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,648
It's not enough to harm 'em.

9
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:19,520
I need to take somethin'
from 'em,

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,223
somethin' that will give me
ultimate power.

11
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,654
Wait, of course!

12
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:26,527
( Whispers )
it's perfect.

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,702
Man on TV:
You've gone too far
this time, ducktective.

14
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:32,763
( Quacking )

15
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:34,065
( Doorbell rings )

16
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:37,508
Welcome to a world
of mystery--

17
00:00:37,508 --> 00:00:38,639
Stan pines?

18
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,242
The tax collector!
You found me!

19
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,573
Uhh!

20
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:44,645
( Panting )

21
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,617
( Grunting )

22
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:48,519
Which one of these
is the trap door?

23
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,421
Mr. pines...

24
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:52,683
I'm from the winninghouse
coupon savers contest,

25
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:56,387
and you are
our big winner!

26
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:57,688
В™єв™є

27
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:58,689
heh?

28
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:01,061
My one and only dream,

29
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,095
which was to possess money,
has come true!

30
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:05,636
We're rich!
I'm gonna get a Butler!

31
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:07,668
I'm gonna buy
a talking horse!

32
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,200
Just sign here
for the money.

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,201
You bet!

34
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,742
Uhh! ha!

35
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:13,574
Stanford, you fool!

36
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,776
You just signed over
the mystery shack

37
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,449
to widdle ol' me!

38
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:19,710
В™є achacha cha cha в™є

39
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,482
( gasp )
liddle ol' me.

40
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:24,255
Ah, might wanna take
another look there.

41
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:27,418
"The shack is hereby
signed over to...

42
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:29,620
Suck a lemon,
little man."

43
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,262
Ahhh ha-ha-ha!

44
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:33,324
Uhh! how dare you!

45
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:34,325
( Laughing )

46
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,867
I am not a threat
to be taken lightly!

47
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,499
Unh unh!

48
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,602
Come here, hon,
i need your arms.

49
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,674
I'll get you,
Stanford pines.

50
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:46,507
I'll get you all!

51
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,609
Want to see
what else is on TV?

52
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,181
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, all right.

53
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:51,642
Should be fun.
My favorite part's
the theme song.

54
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:54,645
В™єв™є

55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,158
little guy
to black space nine.

56
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,630
It's a "pawn,"
that's not your color,

57
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,792
and stop stealing
the tiny horses.

58
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,634
They like it better in here.

59
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:44,765
Don't you, babies?

60
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,866
( Whinnies )

61
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,168
And...
checkmate!

62
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,401
What? boo!

63
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:53,344
Ohh!
Dipper wins again!

64
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:54,905
Yo, Mabel, can you pass me
that brain in the jar?

65
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,907
The lady one.
I got it.

66
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:58,449
Thanks, but Mabel's taller.

67
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:59,780
What?
no, she's not.

68
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,782
We're the same height.
We've always been.

69
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,384
Better check again, dude.

70
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,823
Yup. she's got exactly
one millimeter on you.

71
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:13,964
What?!
whoa...

72
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:15,796
Don't you see
what's happening, Dipper?

73
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,198
This millimeter
is just the beginning.

74
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,831
I'm evolving into
the superior sibling.

75
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:21,902
Bigger...

76
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,304
Stronger...

77
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,705
Like some kind of
Alpha twin.

78
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,638
Alpha twin!
Alpha twin!

79
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,910
C'mon, guys, nobody
even uses millimeters.

80
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,942
It only makes you taller
than me in Canada.

81
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:34,485
You know, Dipper,
I've always wanted
a little brother.

82
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,317
Who knew
i already had one!

83
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,549
Hahaha! yeah!

84
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,491
I was awoken
by the sound of mockery.

85
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:41,492
Where is it?

86
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:42,923
Show me the object
of ridicule!

87
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,656
I'm taller than Dipper.
By one millimeter!

88
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:47,858
Hey, hey.
Don't get...Short
with your sister.

89
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:49,330
Hahahahah!

90
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,401
Now, grunkle Stan...

91
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:53,003
I hope you don't
think...Little of him!

92
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:54,935
Haha! yeah!
And, and, uh...

93
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:55,966
He's short!

94
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,408
Hahahaha!
hahahaha!

95
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:59,310
Dudes, maybe you should
lay off a tiny bit.

96
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,972
Hah! "tiny!"
Soos is in on it now!

97
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:04,515
Ahahahahahhaha!
ahahahahahhaha!

98
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:05,876
No, I didn't mean that.

99
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:07,017
Dipper will forget.

100
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:09,550
He's got a--3-2-1...

101
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,781
Short-term memory!

102
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:11,782
Hahah!
hahah!

103
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:13,954
Pow!
we are on fire!

104
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:14,955
( Slap )

105
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,987
Ow...ooh...
that's...aww...

106
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:18,889
I high-five hard.

107
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,392
Ugh...
stupid Mabel.

108
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:22,893
I'm not short!

109
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:26,737
Unh. unh.
Oh, come on!

110
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:28,469
Unh. unh.

111
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,672
There's gotta be some way
to get taller.

112
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,044
Let's see...

113
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:36,907
"Legends of miniature buffalo
and giant squirrels

114
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,479
"have led me to believe

115
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,950
"there are height-altering
properties

116
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,513
hidden deep within the forest."

117
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:43,514
Hmm...

118
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:44,855
Unh! whoa!

119
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,987
Ohh ow ow oh ow ow.

120
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,859
Ugh.

121
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:50,661
Ohh.

122
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,626
Whoa.

123
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:02,002
( Shrieks )

124
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,003
Huh?

125
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,376
( Growling )
huh!

126
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:06,877
Is that mountain lion tiny

127
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:08,709
or just far away
in perspective?

128
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,080
( Reow! )

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,583
Perspective!
perspective! aah!

130
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:17,918
Oof! hahaha!

131
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,850
( Purrs )

132
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,622
It still hurts,
but less!

133
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:28,529
Whoa.

134
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,836
What the heck.

135
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,441
Unh.

136
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,620
Smaller.

137
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:53,824
Bigger.

138
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:56,927
Too big!

139
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:58,589
I've been buying
big clothes.

140
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,060
I'll grow into them.

141
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,833
Hey, guys.
Notice anything
different about me?

142
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,635
Holy hot sauce!

143
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:06,136
You've grown
an extra millimeter!

144
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:07,398
Wha-wha-whhaaat?

145
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,373
What can I say, sis?
Growth spurt.

146
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,105
Eh, mine happened first.

147
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,607
I'm gonna be taller
in the end.

148
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:18,008
It's science, Dipper.

149
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,880
What? but we're
the same height now.

150
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,112
Alpha twin!
Alpha twin!

151
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,914
Oh, yeah?

152
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:27,117
Something tells me
I've got another growth spurt
coming on right now.

153
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:33,093
Give it up, Dipper.

154
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,797
( Gasps )
what happened!?

155
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,699
You know...
Puberty and stuff.

156
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,170
It doesn't make any sense!

157
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,403
Just a second ago
you were--
wait a minute.

158
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,806
This is some kind
of magicky thing,
isn't it?

159
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,407
Was it a wizard
or something?

160
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,909
There's a wizard
in this closet,

161
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,181
isn't there?
Isn't there?
What? No!

162
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:53,984
You're telling me
there is not a wizard
in this closet?

163
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:57,187
You're telling me
that if I open this door
right now--

164
00:06:57,187 --> 00:06:58,188
fine! open it!

165
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:04,725
An invisible wizard!
Really, Dipper?

166
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,056
( Doorbell rings )

167
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,158
Oy. you.

168
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:11,161
Howdy, Stanford!
Listen closely.

169
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:15,435
Inside this jar,
i have 1,000 cursed
Egyptian super termites.

170
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,137
Hand over the deed
to your property

171
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,869
or I'll smash this jar
with a bat

172
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:21,912
and they'll devour
the shack with you inside.

173
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:24,074
Hey, what's that?
Huh?

174
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:25,776
( Gasps )
oh, no!

175
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,848
Aaahh!
get it off!

176
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,580
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Soos, get in here!

177
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,081
I wanna
take pictures of this!

178
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,883
You may have won
the battle,

179
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:35,055
but Mark my words,
Stanford,

180
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,188
your family
has a weak spot,
and I'm gonna to find it.

181
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:40,190
Aaughh!
my hair!

182
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,192
Does he only respond
to incantations?

183
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:44,234
Expecto wizarium!

184
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,236
Wizzle...
wizar...

185
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:47,167
It's not a wizard!

186
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,740
I grew myself using
this magic flashlight!

187
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,072
Let me see that thing!

188
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,103
Auugh!

189
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:55,706
I'll be back for you later!

190
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:57,247
Ahhh! oof!

191
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,111
Whoa!
huh?

192
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:04,955
( Car alarm blaring )

193
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:06,186
Huh? uhh.
Huh?

194
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,190
Aah!

195
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,963
It's okay.
It can shrink things, too.

196
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:14,695
Normal-hand-karate-chop!

197
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,696
Hey!

198
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:21,201
( Grunting )

199
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,133
Aaaaagh!

200
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,275
Wha?!

201
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:26,276
Ohhh!

202
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:27,277
Hey, give it back!

203
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:30,010
Whoa! never!

204
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,212
( Both grunting )

205
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,584
Curse the pines family!

206
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:35,245
Curse Stan!
Curse Dipper!

207
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:36,917
Curse....

208
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,188
My, my,

209
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:41,221
what delightful manner
of doohickery is this?

210
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,253
Maybe he didn't
see us use it

211
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,155
and doesn't know
it's a magic flashlight

212
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:46,897
that can grow
and shrink things.

213
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:48,799
Really?

214
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,161
Click. boop.
Hoo hoo.

215
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:52,763
Both: no, no, no, no!!!

216
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:57,007
Aah!
aah!

217
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:59,109
( Deep, bellowing laugh )

218
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,613
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.

219
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,822
( Air horn blows )

220
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:13,684
Friends, I wish
i was a highway

221
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:15,656
so I could have the honor
of being rode upon

222
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:19,259
by automobiles as fine
as these ones right ch'er.

223
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,260
( Snarls )

224
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,262
Engine possum
at no extra charge.

225
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,664
I want that thar car!

226
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,665
( Cheering )

227
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,166
Yeah, me, too!

228
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,969
Say there, son,
what's in the jar?

229
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,301
That's my widdle secret!

230
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:33,173
All: ahh!

231
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,745
( Giggles )

232
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:36,947
Mouth-breathing fools.

233
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,880
Mother.

234
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,919
( Both grunting )

235
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,990
You two.

236
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,922
What-- what are you
going to do with us?

237
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:56,066
Why, Mabel,
i wouldn't hurt a hair
on your itty bitty head.

238
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:58,298
If you agree
to be my queen!

239
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,930
We live in a democracy.

240
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,131
And never!

241
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:04,174
Maybe you'll change
your mind after this.

242
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:07,107
No! I will fight you
until the day I...

243
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,380
( Gasps )
gummy koalas!

244
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,143
( Munching )

245
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:15,185
As for you, boy...

246
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:17,718
Tell me,

247
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,020
how exactly
did you come upon
this magic item, hmm?

248
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,852
Did somebody
tell you about it?

249
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:24,324
Did you read about it
somewhere?

250
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,959
Lean closer
and I'll tell you.

251
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,360
( Chuckles )
well, don't mind if i--

252
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,402
( air horn blasts )
aah!

253
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:33,864
( Heavy breathing )

254
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:35,836
Grrr!

255
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,808
I could squash you
right now!!

256
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,312
Steel yourself, Gideon.

257
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:44,074
You can use them.

258
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:46,216
You can use them.

259
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:49,780
Soos, this maze of mirrors
is your best idea

260
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,151
that I'm
taking credit for yet!

261
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,923
We're gonna make a fortune!

262
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:56,056
My ears always been this big?

263
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,257
( Phone rings )

264
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,959
I'm comin'!

265
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,935
One day...

266
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:05,996
( Phone rings )

267
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:07,667
( Groans )
Gideon: Stanford pines.

268
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,901
Listen to me very closely,
i have your niece and nephew.

269
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,943
Hand over the deed
to the mystery shack
right now

270
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:15,876
or great harm
will befall them.

271
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,907
This is Gideon,
by the way.

272
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,108
( Laughing )

273
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:20,881
Oh, yeah.
This has gotta be
your worst plot yet.

274
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,012
They're fine.

275
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:23,954
I saw them playing
in the yard minutes ago.

276
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:25,315
I have them
in my possession.

277
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:26,256
You don't believe me?!

278
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:28,188
I will text you a photo.

279
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,460
"Text" me a "photo"?

280
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,092
Now you're not
even speaking english.

281
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,193
But--

282
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,995
hello? hello?!

283
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,067
Gahhhh!

284
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,068
Aah.

285
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:42,302
( Maniacal laughter )

286
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,304
What am I doing?

287
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:47,808
I don't need ransom.
I have this!

288
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:51,711
I'll shrink Stan
and take the shack
for myself!

289
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,383
You'll all be helpless
to stop me.

290
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:56,787
And if any of you
step out of line...
Smash!

291
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:00,821
( Maniacal laughter )

292
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,152
Bud gleeful:
Gideon!

293
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:05,025
The ice cream truck
is here!

294
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,098
Oh! coming!
Hehehe!

295
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,003
Guard them, cheekums.

296
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,104
I'm coming!

297
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:15,505
( Panting )

298
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:17,868
( Squeaking )

299
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,312
( Squeaking )

300
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:24,074
We got to get out of here
and save Stan.

301
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:25,175
I know!

302
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,147
I will see you later.

303
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,879
Ok, how are we
going to do this?

304
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,082
Gideon's got magic
and like a zillion
inches on us.

305
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,985
On the bright side,
at least we're finally
the same height again.

306
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,526
Actually...

307
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,790
( Grunting )

308
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,133
You're still taller?!

309
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:45,095
Argh!
how did this happen?

310
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:46,997
I guess
it's another mystery.

311
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:50,070
Just another reason
we gotta get
that flashlight back.

312
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:56,046
Cheekums, to freedom!

313
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:58,378
To freedom!

314
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,981
Ohh!

315
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,253
You're just
a big ol' dummy-dum!

316
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:06,086
I have a plan.

317
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,091
( Grunts )

318
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:18,398
( Munching )

319
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,333
Clean me!

320
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,276
Father, could you
give widdle ol' me

321
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,208
a "wide"
to the mystery shack?

322
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,110
Ohhh, I'd love to,
sugar pie,

323
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,343
but I have
a heck of a lot
of cars to sell, I do.

324
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:34,314
( Laughing )

325
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,087
No, no!
Don't tickle me!

326
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:38,889
No!

327
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,491
Never!
never tickle me!

328
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:42,452
What have I told you?

329
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:44,024
What have i--
look at me.

330
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,155
What have I told you?

331
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,127
Tickling
is no laughing matter.

332
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,828
There we go.

333
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,100
Do you still need a ride?

334
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,132
I'll just take the bus!

335
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,934
Raah!

336
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,235
Hyah!

337
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,238
Precious memories.

338
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,410
Just keep vacuuming...
Just keep vacuuming.

339
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,972
C'mon! uhh.

340
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,175
( Grunting )

341
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,350
We need to get higher.

342
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,123
Yeah, especially you
'cause you're short.

343
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:14,224
Mabel! up there.

344
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:19,059
Uhh.
unh.

345
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,062
What cute little thing
are you off to,

346
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,264
you cute
little cutey-face?

347
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:28,468
I'm going to annihilate
my archenemy's entire family!

348
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,101
Ohh! okay!

349
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:32,642
( Weakly )
yaayyy.

350
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,078
He's heading to shrink Stan!

351
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,210
Oh, flying discount dollar,

352
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,953
if only you could fly us
back to the mystery shack.

353
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:44,454
Maybe it can.

354
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:47,487
Oh!
oh!

355
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,890
( Gasps )

356
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,024
My sky-high prices!

357
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:55,125
Yeah!
whoo-hoo!

358
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,266
Down there!

359
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:57,928
Uhh.
uhh.

360
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:00,200
Yay!
whoo!

361
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,102
To the mystery shack!

362
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,103
( Shouting )

363
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,504
Yeah!
whoo-hoo!

364
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,477
Yeah!
yeah!

365
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:12,282
We're just in time.

366
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:13,643
But how are we
going to stop him?

367
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:14,644
( Pecking )

368
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:18,218
Aah! shoo!
Aah! Aah! Ow, ow.

369
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,022
Leave that to Mabel!

370
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,454
( Laughing, humming )

371
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,259
I'm comin' for ya,
Stanford-- ohh!

372
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,532
I'm sorry,
gummy friend!

373
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,034
It's for the greater good.

374
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,436
Ow! one of those
infernal gummy koalas

375
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,138
has gotten
into my perfect hair!

376
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,269
Ew! aw!

377
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,511
I can't defeat Stan
looking like this!

378
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,516
Unh. whoo! Ha.
Whoo-ee! ( Laughs )

379
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:48,718
Quick. get in front
and I'll re-grow you.

380
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:50,350
Okay-- wait.

381
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,252
You're gonna grow us back
to the equal height, right?

382
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,184
Dipper, that doesn't
matter right now!

383
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,226
Well, if it doesn't matter,
then why don't you
just do it?

384
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:58,188
Aah! why are you
acting so weird?

385
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:01,331
Why can't you just accept
that I'm a little bit
taller than you?

386
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:02,732
Oh, I'm acting weird?!

387
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:05,665
You're the one who keeps
calling me names and stuff!

388
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,737
Oh, what?
You mean like little--

389
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:08,738
don't say it!

390
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,240
Gideon:
little Dipper.

391
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,272
( Gasps )
aah!

392
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,274
I daresay you
would have defeated me,

393
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:17,477
if it wasn't
for your sibling bickering!

394
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:23,213
Aah! the shack is mine,
Stanford pines!

395
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:25,315
No!
( Gideon laughing )

396
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:30,120
Well, well, Stanford,

397
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,062
it appears I've finally
gotten the best of--

398
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:34,064
huh?
what?

399
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:37,427
All right,
something's definitely
different here.

400
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:38,468
Uhh!
ohh!

401
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:40,430
Whoa!
whoa!

402
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,771
Tell me where Stan is!

403
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:43,773
Never!
you'll never find Stan.

404
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,535
On the second door
to the left down the hall.

405
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:48,138
Uh, wait,
why did I say that?

406
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:51,781
Stanford,
I'm coming for ya!

407
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:53,543
( Grunting )

408
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:56,616
Pffft!

409
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,289
I guess I kinda soosed
that one up, didn't I?

410
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,550
It's not your fault,
Soos.

411
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,053
I'm the guy who put together
that shrinking device.

412
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:04,394
I guess it's just...

413
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:07,127
You kept teasing me,
Mabel. Like, all day.

414
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,398
What was that all about?

415
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,331
I guess it's that...

416
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,663
You're better than me
at like everything.

417
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:16,366
And you always rub it
in my face.

418
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:20,039
Chess, checkers,
ping pong.

419
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:25,075
I guess I finally felt
like I was winning
at something for once.

420
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:28,318
Aw, man,
now I feel like a big jerk.

421
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,820
Don't you mean...
A little jerk?

422
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,821
Ohh!

423
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:33,052
( Both laugh )

424
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,225
All right,
i walked into that one.

425
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:36,386
Are we cool?

426
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:37,387
We're cool.

427
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:38,458
Am I cool?

428
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,689
You're cool, Soos.

429
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:40,830
Yes!

430
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,535
( Gasps )
Stanford!

431
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:47,397
Oh, hi, Gideon!

432
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:49,669
I've been looking
for someone to try out
my new mirror maze.

433
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,701
Then again,
you're an idiot.

434
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:53,543
That's the end
of the sentence.

435
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:54,804
You come back here!

436
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:57,677
Try and find me, twerp.
Ha ha ha!

437
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,210
Unh!

438
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,412
Let's get that flashlight
before Gideon gets Stan.

439
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:05,585
There it is!

440
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,687
( Grunting )

441
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:12,322
Whoa, his hair's so shiny.

442
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:14,424
No! don't look
directly at it!

443
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:16,466
This neck is really squishy.

444
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,668
Hey, look!
I'm making fat angels!

445
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:20,430
Ew! termites!

446
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:25,135
Tell my story!

447
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:26,136
Ohh.

448
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:29,339
Hey, there you are!

449
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:32,212
Thought you could get away
from me, eh, corn chip?

450
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,443
( Munching )

451
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,522
Ehhhh!
oh!
oh!

452
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:45,395
Aah! uhh!

453
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:50,160
Stan: ah ha ha ha!

454
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,361
No!

455
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:53,233
Hey,
watch the merchandise!

456
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,707
( Grunting )

457
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,141
You little troll!

458
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,443
These mirrors
cost me ten--

459
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,276
I mean, uh, twenty--
five-- five hundred--

460
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:07,517
five hundred dollars each.

461
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:08,848
And you're paying
for all of 'em!

462
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,180
Au contraire,

463
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,721
it'll be you who pays.

464
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,183
Grunkle Stan is doomed!

465
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:15,154
Not completely doomed!
To his armpit!

466
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,155
Uh-uh.

467
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,587
Just...unh, c'mon!

468
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:18,828
( Grunting )

469
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:20,560
Whoa,
what is that thing?

470
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,294
Finally,
after all these years,
after every humiliation!

471
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:27,467
Your business, your family,
everything will finally be mine!

472
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,369
You have no one
to protect you now!

473
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,572
Prepare for
the wrath of Gideon glee...

474
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,374
Gideon glee..

475
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:37,176
( Laughing )

476
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,508
( Continues laughing )

477
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:41,481
Uh, I don't even know
how to respond to this.

478
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,882
Hee hee, no!

479
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,654
( Laughing )
stop it!

480
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:46,286
Look, uh, kid.

481
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,418
I think this rivalry thing
is getting to you.

482
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:49,719
Ha. I understand.

483
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:52,191
I mean,
I'm a formidable foe,
what can I say.

484
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,425
No--ah hahahahah!

485
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:56,596
Hey, now.
Come on.

486
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:57,967
You'll get me
one of these days.

487
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,729
Maybe, you know,
run your evil plan

488
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:01,801
by some friends
next time, huh?

489
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:02,972
Workshop it.

490
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,775
But first get your issues
in order there.

491
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:08,638
( Laughing )

492
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:10,840
Get...up, up.

493
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,712
Over the carpet,
there we go.

494
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,244
Uhh.
around the end table,

495
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:15,485
and, uh, out the door.

496
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:16,786
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

497
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:18,518
( Laughing )

498
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,550
My light...

499
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,553
You're the light
of my life, too, pal.

500
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:25,495
Whoo!
freak show.

501
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:29,659
After you.

502
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:32,932
It's okay.
You can go first
if you want-- whoa!

503
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,912
Hey! you let me
keep my extra millimeter.

504
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:43,913
You earned it.

505
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:46,576
Ah, thanks,
"little brother"--

506
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:47,647
stop it.

507
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,649
I guess we should
destroy this thing.

508
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:53,353
You know, so it doesn't
fall into the wrong hands
and junk.

509
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,685
Seems like the smart thing
to do.

510
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:56,756
Unh!

511
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,758
Die, die!

512
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,291
Soos:
there you dudes are!

513
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,493
I been tryin'
to get your attention!

514
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,536
Glue.
lots of glue.

515
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:11,371
Oh, son, don't you mind
that Stanford pines.

516
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,643
You'll get your revenge
one of these days.

517
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:16,576
No! it's not
just about revenge!

518
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:19,649
I want that shack.
The physical building.

519
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:21,010
But why?

520
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,715
Because it holds a secret
you couldn't possibly imagine.

521
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:27,487
( Laughs evilly )

522
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,058
Uh, sweetie,
you want some ice cream?

523
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:30,520
Did you pick out
all the nuts?

524
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,521
Mm-hmm.

525
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:32,562
Ah!

526
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:33,923
( Snorting )

527
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:36,396
( Maniacal laughter )

528
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,497
Lil' more?

529
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,629
( Maniacal laughter )

530
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:41,501
That's good.

531
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,703
( Doorbell rings )

532
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,575
Mr. pines,

533
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:47,537
I'm from the winninghouse
coupon savers contest

534
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:49,939
and you
are our big winner!

535
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:51,981
( Birds chirping )

536
00:21:51,981 --> 00:21:53,613
I guess we'll have
to give the prize

537
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:54,844
to our runner-up winner...

538
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:57,016
Fiddleford h. Mcgucket?

539
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,719
( Laughter )

540
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,752
How would you like
ten million dollars?

541
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,694
