1
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:08,039
( Beeps )

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,681
Focus, deputy.
Remember your trainin'.

3
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:12,743
Easy, easy...

4
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:14,685
You're almost there.

5
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:19,090
Dang it! I almost
got the treasure!

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,653
The time we spend together
is treasure enough.

7
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:24,595
( Rumbling )
hey! You feel that?

8
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:27,498
Aah!
aaah!

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,562
Reckon we should
report that.

10
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:35,035
Or go for a ride
in our new convertible!

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,508
Yeee!
ha ha ha ha!

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,742
( Eerie screeching )

13
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,575
В™єв™є

14
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,286
Stan:
ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,687
continuing our mystery tour,

16
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,620
you'll see the world famous
outhouse of mystery.

17
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,222
I got stuck in there once!

18
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:33,294
Could I go
to the bathroom?

19
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,266
Save all questions
until after the tour.

20
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,697
( Groans )

21
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,199
Ohh.

22
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,830
And up ahead
if you look really closely--

23
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,232
everybody get your cameras,

24
00:01:41,232 --> 00:01:43,234
you're gonna
want to see this...

25
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:45,336
Oink.
finally, waddles,

26
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:47,308
we have the whole house
to ourselves!

27
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,340
What do you think,
dance party?

28
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,611
( Snorts )

29
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,243
I'm not hearing a no!

30
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:59,550
В™єв™є

31
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:19,840
yes! yes! Yes!

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,612
Yes! yes! Yes...

33
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:22,713
Uh...

34
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,749
Uh-oh, cuddle time.
Ha ha ha!

35
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,182
Waddles, can i
tell you a secret?

36
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:34,255
You're my favorite pig
in the whole world.

37
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,227
( Snorts )
( Yawns )

38
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,191
( Chuckling )

39
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:41,362
Oh!

40
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,894
Mabel! what are you
doing on the floor?

41
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,496
Being cute and great.

42
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:47,238
And I thought
your brother was weird.

43
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:50,801
No, he's more like,
"oh! Let's solve a mystery!

44
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,744
I kiss a pillow with
Wendy's face drawn on it."

45
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:56,647
Ha ha!
That's pretty good!
Kissin' a pillow.

46
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:58,949
Go! go!
Chew that pant leg!

47
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:01,181
Uhh! nyah! Nyah!

48
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,614
All right, outside. Now!

49
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:05,716
No! grunkle Stan!

50
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,888
It's not safe for waddles
outside.

51
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,521
There's predators!
And barbecuers!

52
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:12,323
That's just
the natural order.

53
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:14,525
It's not my fault
your pig's potentially
delicious.

54
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,727
He should be inside
like a person.

55
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:19,199
People don't roll around
in their own filth.

56
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,401
Except for Soos.

57
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,972
And we're the lesser for it!

58
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:24,505
Maybe we're the ones
who should be put outside.

59
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,537
Huh? huh?
Think about it!

60
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:27,578
Hmph!

61
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,244
Today's the day, Soos.
Thanks for coming along
on this mission.

62
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:36,317
Dude, it's an honor.
Today I'm sweating
from heat and excitement.

63
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,448
Whew!

64
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:39,320
There's something hiding
in these woods.

65
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,322
Something big enough to rip
the roof off a car.

66
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,324
If we get a photo
of this thing,
we'll be heroes!

67
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,695
Yeah, we'll get
all the babes.

68
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:46,657
You'll be fending off smooches
with a stick!

69
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:48,299
Ha ha!
Shut up, man.

70
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,500
With a stick, dude.

71
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,532
Here. give me a boost.

72
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:54,935
Oof! got it.

73
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,908
Uhh. is sap supposed
to be this sticky?

74
00:03:57,908 --> 00:03:59,440
If everything goes
according to plan,

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,312
the creature
will grab that steak,

76
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:02,543
cross through the string,

77
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,316
and set off
cameras a, b, and c.

78
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:06,847
And nothing can go wrong.

79
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:07,918
High five.

80
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,351
Uhh!
uhh!

81
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,323
This was poorly planned.

82
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,455
( Loud whoosh, roaring )

83
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:17,458
( Both gasp )

84
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,431
TV narrator: Hey, you!
Me?

85
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:23,334
Sick of constantly
dropping your baby?
Yes!

86
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:24,935
Hi! I'm Bobby renzobbi,

87
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:27,267
and what you need is
the huggy wuvvy tummy bundle!

88
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,039
I can hold ten babies at once!

89
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,342
Bobby:
i know what you're thinkin'--
"does it work for pigs?"

90
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:32,272
Ah ha ha!

91
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,844
Yeah, it does
work for pigs, stupid!

92
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:35,576
Feel your pig's heartbeat
next to yours!

93
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,808
It works for p-i-i-i-i-gs!

94
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:39,380
( Oinking )

95
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,281
(Gasps) grunkle Stan!

96
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,714
I'm off to get
a huggy wuvvy
tummy bundle!

97
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:47,558
Yeesh! isn't knitting
matching sweaters
for that pig enough?

98
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,890
Nope. anyway,
i need you to look after

99
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,062
this little gentleman
while I'm gone.

100
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,796
Not now, kid. I got
some tourists comin' through.

101
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,298
Grunkle Stan,
i know you're not
crazy about waddles.

102
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,000
He's a fat, naked jerk!

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,972
But you do care about me.

104
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:04,304
Promise me you won't
let him outside?

105
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:08,609
Fine! yeah, yeah,
i promise.

106
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,341
Thanks, grunkle Stan!

107
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:11,342
( Oinking )

108
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:13,384
I'm watching you, pig.

109
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,916
( Snorts )
ehh!

110
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,018
We did it!
It tripped the wire!

111
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,751
Somewhere in these cameras
is a photo of that creature!

112
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:21,852
I'll go develop the film.

113
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:23,594
I'll go make us
victory nachos.

114
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:25,626
Dipper and Soos for life!

115
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,027
( Both laughing )

116
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,899
Stan: and here,
ladies and gentlemen,

117
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,361
is our final exhibit,

118
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:32,363
the most hideous creatures
known to man!

119
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,336
( All laughing )
oh, it's us!

120
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,108
Right, right. We...

121
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,510
We have fun here.

122
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,671
But seriously, folks,

123
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:42,112
this is something.

124
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:43,544
I present to you

125
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,516
a unicorn
made out of corn:

126
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,077
The cornicorn!

127
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:49,049
I-i don't know.
I'm tired.

128
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,383
( All gasp )

129
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:53,023
What the--?!

130
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,126
What a rip-off!

131
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:58,358
Kids, we're leaving.

132
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,830
No! noooo!

133
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:02,132
Grrr. you!

134
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,136
Come on, come on...

135
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,569
Hmm.

136
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,671
That's a wing!

137
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,372
If camera b got the wing,

138
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,705
then the one that
should have got the rest is...

139
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:16,076
Camera c!

140
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:19,950
The creature!

141
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,483
Who wants victory nachos?

142
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:24,685
No!

143
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:25,716
Dude, don't worry.

144
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:27,057
I only ate like
a third of 'em.

145
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:28,619
Half of 'em.

146
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,160
(Laughing) I ate
all of 'em, dude.

147
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:35,395
Just ten minutes without
this pig in the house,

148
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,697
is that so much to ask?

149
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:39,169
There. if Mabel asks...

150
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:42,072
This never happened.

151
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,935
"Oh, but grunkle Stan!
It's not safe out there!

152
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:47,137
There's predators!"
Oh, brother.

153
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:49,109
( Loud roaring )

154
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,781
( Panicked squealing )

155
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,114
Aaah!

156
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,886
I can't believe you,
man!

157
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:59,189
Sorry, dude.
I was just so excited!
Nachos cause excitement.

158
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:02,493
Soos, no offense,
but you gotta be
more careful sometimes.

159
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:05,055
I'm mean, what are the odds
we'll ever get another picture
of the--

160
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:07,458
( roaring )

161
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,659
Wha--
wha--

162
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:15,205
dude, did you see that?

163
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:17,437
That thing was
a dinosaur, bro!

164
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,741
How is it possible
a dinosaur survived
65 million years?

165
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,112
Did you see it,
Mr. pines?

166
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:23,974
Mr. pines?
It--

167
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:26,016
it took him.
Took what?

168
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:28,118
The pig. It took waddles.

169
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:30,150
What'd you say
about waddles?

170
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,625
Oh, whoa.
Awkward silence.

171
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,057
Bleaahhhh!

172
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,793
What's going on?
Why are you standing around
all awkwardly?

173
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:44,164
And where's waddles?

174
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,596
Um, uh--

175
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:47,197
the good news is,
you're gettin' a puppy!

176
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:49,600
What happened?
Well, see,

177
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,901
uh, when the--

178
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:52,242
the pig got eaten
by a p-terodactyl, bro.

179
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:53,804
What?!

180
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:55,676
Waddles? waddles!

181
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,948
Where did he go?!
How did this happen?!

182
00:07:57,948 --> 00:07:59,710
( Hyperventilating )

183
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,553
Grunkle Stan,
you didn't put him outside?

184
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:04,985
What?! no!
I didn't put him anywhere!

185
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,617
I'm not acting suspicious!

186
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:07,958
You're acting
suspicious!

187
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,720
What's a pig?!
Then what happened?

188
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,892
Uh, look, it went down
like this, see?

189
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,825
So there I was,
in the living room...

190
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:18,529
Tenderly nursing him with
only the richest of creams,

191
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:20,801
when all of a sudden...

192
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,903
( Roaring )

193
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:28,238
So I said...

194
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:31,982
Aaah! no dice, cowboy!

195
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:33,113
Aaaaah!

196
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,946
I start punching him
right in the face!

197
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:38,018
But he played dirty.

198
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,249
Huh?

199
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:40,851
Aaah! ohh!

200
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:42,793
That really happened.

201
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:46,597
Why?! why couldn't you
have taken me?!!!

202
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:49,860
( Sobbing )

203
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:55,736
Oh, grunkle Stan,
you tried to save him!

204
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,208
Uh, yep.
I'm a...Great man,
all right.

205
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,270
You punched a pterodactyl
in the face?

206
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,272
I thought you didn't even
believe in the supernatural.

207
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:04,544
Dinosaurs aren't magic.
They're just big lizards.

208
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,576
Get off my back!

209
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:07,948
Oh, waddles.

210
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,580
( Sniffling )
that's it.

211
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,652
No pterodactyl
messes with my sister.

212
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,324
We're gonna go out there,
catch him, and save your pig.

213
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:15,856
For Mabel, guys!

214
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,057
For Mabel!

215
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,929
But how do we even
find the little guy?

216
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,893
We follow that!

217
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:26,597
Oh, sweet!
Yes! Genius!

218
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:28,739
Or, ya know,
we could just
call it a day,

219
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,841
maybe hit the pool hall
or, uh...

220
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:34,344
Yeah! let's go...

221
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:35,906
Save waggles!

222
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:37,978
Waddles.
him too.

223
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,611
All right!

224
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:42,913
That p-terodactyl
won't know what hit him.

225
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:44,955
Huh.
it's "pterodactyl," man.

226
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:46,687
Actually, nobody knows
how to pronounce it

227
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,759
because no one was alive
back in dinosaur days,

228
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,920
so, uh--

229
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,092
whoa! almost ran over
my own head there.

230
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,924
Ha ha! Wow.

231
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:55,826
Mabel,
we've gotta talk.

232
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,728
This is a really
high-stakes mission

233
00:09:57,728 --> 00:10:00,100
and I'm a little worried
about Soos coming along
on this one.

234
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,302
I love the guy,
but sometimes he...

235
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,904
Messes stuff up.

236
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,335
What?! since when?

237
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:07,808
Sorry, dude.

238
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:09,980
Sorry, dude.

239
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,682
Look! a fairy!

240
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:13,013
Ha ha!

241
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,816
Oh, sorry, dude,
i killed that fairy.

242
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,888
Let him down easy.

243
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,950
This is so great!
You and me, bro!

244
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,221
Best friends,

245
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,854
fighting and potentially
high-fiving dinosaurs.

246
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:26,957
Soos, look, I, uh...
I gotta tell you something.

247
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:30,630
Okay, but before you do,
check out these matching shirts
i made for us.

248
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,362
Who's this guy
right here?

249
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:33,834
You. totally you, dude.

250
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,837
And these rays
indicate friendship.

251
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,369
So what was it
you were gonna
tell me again?

252
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:42,673
Uh...p-terodactyl,
here we come!

253
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:43,814
Yes!

254
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:44,815
( Sighs )

255
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:47,147
Soos:
bros before dinos!

256
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:57,087
Mabel:
okay, the red yarn
leads to...

257
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,861
В™є doodlee-doo,
deedlee-doo... в™є

258
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,262
old man magucket?!

259
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,064
Howdy, friends!

260
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,736
What are you
doing out here?

261
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,097
You'll never believe me.

262
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:08,899
So I was doing my hourly
hootenanny--

263
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,140
в™є deedlee-ding-dang в™є

264
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,371
ohh! this guy.

265
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,243
When this enormous
wingly critter

266
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:15,005
stole my musical spoons

267
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:18,078
and flew lickety-split
into the abandoned mines
down yonder.

268
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,910
Whoa!
whoa!
whoa!

269
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,211
Looks kinda hairy
down there.

270
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:23,784
Come on, grunkle Stan,
you can handle it.

271
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,286
You punched a pterodactyl
in the face, remember?

272
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,988
Oh, yeah. Ha ha.

273
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,359
I did do that, didn't I?

274
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,991
Ha. uh ha ha.

275
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,293
My! what suspicious
laughter!

276
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,026
Guys, we're going in.

277
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:37,267
Need someone to tag along

278
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:38,899
and tell weird
personal stories?

279
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:39,900
No, thanks.

280
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:43,974
Mcgucket:
so there I am

281
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,776
fightin' a raccoon for
the same piece of meat,

282
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:48,809
when our mouths get close
and we kiss accidentally.

283
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,041
Uhh. you can't take
a hint, can you?

284
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,242
Nope!

285
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,986
( All scream )

286
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,117
( Thud )

287
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,149
( All groaning )

288
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,191
Whoooa.

289
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,395
Sweet Moses!
Razzle dazzle!

290
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:06,426
Fancy marmalade!

291
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,929
These plants look
all Jurassic-y.

292
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,461
Huh. this little fella
smells like battery acid.

293
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:13,033
Uhh!

294
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,335
Looks like I lost
my sense of smell.
Ha ha ha!

295
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,506
Oh, waddles,

296
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:18,238
we're gonna find you!

297
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:26,146
( All scream )

298
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:29,950
Whoa!
whoa!
wow!

299
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,482
Dipper: they're all trapped
inside tree sap!

300
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:35,085
That's how they survived
for 65 million years.

301
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:36,086
Whoa.

302
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:41,031
The summer heat must be
melting them loose!

303
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:43,964
Holy moly!
Forget the cornicorn--

304
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,535
this is the attraction
of a lifetime!

305
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:46,967
I could bring people down here

306
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,869
and turn this into
some sort of theme park.

307
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,141
"Jurassic sap hole."

308
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:52,803
Uh, dudes...

309
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:58,008
Maybe we should
keep moving.

310
00:12:58,008 --> 00:12:59,479
This could be
a gold mine!

311
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,281
Velvety rope type deal there,

312
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,552
ticket booth here--ha!

313
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:05,215
I shoulda put
that pig outside
ages ago!

314
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:08,889
Wait. what did you
just say?
Hmm? What's that?

315
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,862
You said the dinosaur
flew into the house.

316
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:13,093
( Gasps )
no, wait. Uh--

317
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,425
if you think about it--
you put waddles outside,

318
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,297
then you lied to me
about it!

319
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,800
And now, thanks to you,
my pig could be dead!

320
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,202
Waddles could be dead!

321
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,875
Look, he's an animal.
He belongs outside.

322
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,076
No! that's it!

323
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:29,479
Grunkle Stan, I am never,
ever speaking to you again!

324
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,081
Look, you can't
be serious.

325
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:34,144
Oh, is someone
talking right now?
Because I can't hear them!

326
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,285
Kid!
в™є la la la la la в™є

327
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:37,247
I can't hear anyone!

328
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:38,518
No one's talking to me!

329
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,950
Guys, guys, don't fight.

330
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,391
Why can't you be
more like me and Dipper?

331
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:43,924
Look, everything's
gonna be cool.

332
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,226
All we gotta do
to find the pig is
follow this here yarn.

333
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,928
We just keep
following and following,

334
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,299
and when we reach the end--

335
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:50,300
uh-oh.

336
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:54,204
Wh-which cave was it again?

337
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,566
Ohh, Soos!
You lost the trail!

338
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,969
Hey, come on,
we'll find our way.
Trust me!

339
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:02,612
Sorry, dude.
Ohh!

340
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:05,976
That is it! See,
this is why I didn't want
to bring you along!

341
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,277
What--what do you mean?

342
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:09,349
I mean, this is really
important to Mabel,

343
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,951
and you keep screwing
everything up!

344
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,182
You ruined our photograph,

345
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:14,054
and now you've got us
hopelessly lost!

346
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,987
But we're p-terodactyl bros.
I made t-shirts.

347
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:18,858
It's pronounced
"pterodactyl."

348
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,061
And these shirts are useless!
They're gigantic!

349
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,034
I...have...a different.
Body type, dude!

350
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,266
Oh, so it's my fault?
I just thought, ya know...

351
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:30,600
( All arguing)

352
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,372
Mcgucket: hey!
Cheer up, fellers!

353
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,174
I fixed your lantern!

354
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,608
( All scream )

355
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,250
Aaaah!

356
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,053
Heh heh! What--
what are we doin'?

357
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:49,389
Hmm?

358
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:54,965
Nobody make any
sudden movements
or loud noises.

359
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,069
Yeehah! we found
a pterodactyl!

360
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:00,130
( Screeching )

361
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,901

362
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,573
( Roaring )

363
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,542
Guys. we need a plan
to get out of here.

364
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,986
Okay, okay.
How's about Mabel
knits Soos a pig costume...

365
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:17,117
I like it.

366
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,249
And we use Soos
as a human sacrifice!

367
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:21,151
I like it.
Whaddya say, Mabel?

368
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:22,152
Humph.

369
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,223
Aw, come on,

370
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,554
you can't stop talkin'
to me forever.

371
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:26,526
Yeah, Mabel, we have
to work together here.

372
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,298
What? you want to
work with Mabel

373
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:29,359
but not your buddy Soos?

374
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:33,063
( All bickering )

375
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:34,564
( Waddles oinks )

376
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:36,967
Wait! did you hear that?

377
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:39,139
( Snorting )

378
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,370
Waddles!

379
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,542
Wait, kid!
Mabel!

380
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,543
Are you nuts?!

381
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,575
Oh, is someone speaking?

382
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,348
Because I can't hear anything!

383
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,281
Oh, no! She's gone
deaf with fear!

384
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:53,523
Mabel,
come back here!

385
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:57,557
Waddles!

386
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,658
( Oinks )

387
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,660
Oh! my waddles!

388
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,632
I'll never
lose you again!

389
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:04,194
Mmm-mm!

390
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:05,635
Uh...mabel?

391
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:07,597
Sh-sh-sh.
you're safe now.

392
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,172
(Whispering)
Mabel, great,
you got him.

393
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,673
Now we gotta
get out of here!

394
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,305
( Panicked squeal )

395
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:16,406
Waddles, wait!

396
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,508
Huh?

397
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:19,579
Ahh!

398
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,381
Get off me,
you dumb pig!

399
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,382
( Roaring )

400
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,583
Look out!
Aah!
Aaah!

401
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,754
Aaah!

402
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,118
Aaaahhh!!!!

403
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:30,090
Oh, no!
Mr. pines!
Stan!

404
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,661
( Stan screaming )

405
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:33,693
Uhh! ohh! Ooh!

406
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,765
Ohh....

407
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:37,527
( Contented oinking )

408
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,729
Yeah, you would enjoy this.

409
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:41,071
Aaah!

410
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,633
Huh?

411
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,236
( All gasp )

412
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:48,308
Guys, we've gotta
save them!

413
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,679
Mcgucket, do you have
an invention

414
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,511
that can distract
the pterodactyl?

415
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,642
Do I?!

416
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:55,445
Nope.

417
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:56,646
( Crackling )
( All gasp )

418
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:58,718
Whoa!
aaah!

419
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,721
( Chirps )

420
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:02,722
Aw...

421
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,525
Well, welcome
to the world,
little feller.

422
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,628
Aah!
aaah!
aaah!

423
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,662
The dumb thing
must be hungry.

424
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:14,104
I guess it's you or me,
pig.

425
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,068
( Grunts )

426
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,343
What are you lookin' at?

427
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,217
Aw, come on,
don't give me that look.

428
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:28,748
What am I supposed to do,
let it eat me?

429
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,781
Arrghh!

430
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,553
Oh I get it! You're
trying to guilt me.

431
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,325
Well, it ain't
workin', pal.

432
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:37,457
Who cares if you're Mabel's
favorite thing in the world?

433
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,130
I can live without the kid
talkin' to me all the time,

434
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,792
tellin' me her jokes...
Makin' me laugh...

435
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,696
( Giggly oink )
( Chuckles )

436
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:47,767
Ah, dang it!

437
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:54,744
Well, this is just about
the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

438
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,647
You want this pig?

439
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,649
( Oinking )

440
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:02,582
Then you're gonna
have to get through me,
you flying devil!

441
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,683
Come and get me!!!

442
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:04,684
Uhhh!

443
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:08,618
Aaahhh!!!!

444
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:10,520
( Munching )

445
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,793
Aw, dude. Did he really just eat
that prospector guy?
That is messed up!

446
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:17,127
I'm okay!

447
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:18,598
Aaah!

448
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,700
What do we do?
What do we do?

449
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,703
We have to get
in a straight line.
What?!

450
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,605
A pterodactyl's eyes
are so far apart

451
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,537
that if you stand
right in front of it,
it can't see you.

452
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:29,809
Soos, you've been wrong
about stuff all day.

453
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,281
How can we--
dude, look.

454
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:32,712
I know I've messed up a lot.

455
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,314
I could be sorta clumsy,

456
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,845
and it's not always
as loveable as I think.

457
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:38,888
But please, as my friend,
just trust me on this one.

458
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:47,297
Get behind me, dudes.

459
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,433
Ahh! ah.

460
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,569
( Chirps )

461
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,371
It's working.

462
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,676
Uh-oh!

463
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,181
( Confused chirp )

464
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:14,284
( Relieved sighs )

465
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:15,685
Soos, you did it!

466
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:16,756
( Distant screech )
huh?

467
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,660
Was that...

468
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:23,593
Stan?

469
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:25,695
Ahhh....

470
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:27,166
( Screeches )

471
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,940
( Oinking )

472
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,472
Waddles!

473
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,304
He's punching him
in the face!

474
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:35,745
Aaah!

475
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:38,748
From heck's heart
i stab at thee!

476
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:40,550

( Grunting,
panting )

478
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,956
Oh, yes! Ha ha!
You're all right, Stan?

479
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:48,618
Oh, Mr. pines,
you're okay!

480
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,761
Here's your pig, kiddo.

481
00:19:51,761 --> 00:19:53,693
( Oinks )

482
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,765
Oooh! waddles!

483
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:58,568
Oh...
you saved him for me!

484
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:00,970
Yeah, well, sometimes
you just gotta--

485
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,832
look out!

486
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:07,877
( All screaming )

487
00:20:12,582 --> 00:20:14,744
( All screaming )

488
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,717
We're trapped!

489
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,623
Quick! the geyser
can shoot us back up!

490
00:20:27,497 --> 00:20:28,628
Come on, go! Go!

491
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,530
( Roaring )
( All screaming )

492
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:34,003
Bros before dinos!

493
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:50,650
Oh. oh.
Oh. Oh.

494
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,382
( Panting )

495
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:53,483
Oh!

496
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,761
I can't believe
you did all that
for waddles!

497
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,564
Ah, well, I can't have
my favorite niece not
talking to me,

498
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:07,367
and if I gotta
leap onto a pterodactyl
and punch him in the face,

499
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,968
then that's what
i gotta do.

500
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,470
That's kinda sappy.

501
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,841
What?! that's how I feel!

502
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:13,042
No, I mean...

503
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,273
Oh, yeah.

504
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,605
Gotcha!
ahhh.

505
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:17,547
Uh-oh.
uhh! uhh!

506
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:19,309
Aaaah!

507

( All snoring )

508
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:24,684
Check it out,
that thing destroyed my vest.

509
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,616
Soos, look!

510
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:28,558
A real dinosaur tooth?
That's awesome!

511
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,661
Not as awesome
as you saving us
back there.

512
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:32,922
Pterodactyl bros?

513
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:35,294
Pterodactyl bros.

514
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,626
Boosh!
boosh!

515
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,728
Hey, I pronounced it
right that time.

516
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:41,300
Think we need to worry
about the rest of those
dinosaurs?

517
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,732
I doubt it.

518
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:47,707
( Creaking )

519
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,082
I ate my way through
a dinosaur!

Hi, I'm Bobby renzobbi!

523
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,649
Are your arms jealous
of your legs?

524
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:00,920
Then you need arm pants--

525
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,792
the pants that you
wear on your arms!

526
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:05,695
Sheesh. who actually buys
this infomercial stuff?

527
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:07,527
Ha. I know, right?

528
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:08,758
Cancel the order.
Cancel the order!

529
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:11,831
( Snorting )
snorting. That's his tell.

530
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,663
I fold.
Tough luck, sucker.

531
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:15,735
Waddles was bluffing.
What?!

532
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,036
I had four aces!

533
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,338
That pig is a wizard!

534
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,340
Look at him.
