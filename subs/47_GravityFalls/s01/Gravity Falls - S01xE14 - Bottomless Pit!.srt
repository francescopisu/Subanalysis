1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,642
In this land of ours,
there are many great pits,

2
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:14,315
but none more bottomless
than the bottomless pit,

3
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:16,417
which as you can see here,
is bottomless.

4
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:20,451
Question. is it bottomless?

5
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:23,694
( Sighs ) kids, could one of you
try explaining this to Soos?

6
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:25,456
Grunkle Stan,
why are we here again?

7
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:27,328
To dispose of things
that we don't want.

8
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:30,301
So long, mystery shack
suggestion cards.

9
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,703
Goodbye, creepy love letters
from lil' Gideon.

10
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:34,735
( Grunts)
die! die!

11
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,537
( Grunting )

12
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,708
What are you doing?

13
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,040
Throwing stuff, dude.
Everyone's doing it!

14
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,675
( Grunting )
what you got there, Mabel?

15
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:48,319
( Chuckles )
it's just my personal box
of mysterious secrets.

16
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:50,251
Nothing worth wondering about!

17
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,523
( Laughs, grunts )

18
00:00:52,523 --> 00:00:54,525
Goodbye forever!

19
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:57,688
Grunkle Stan, do I really
have to be the one to point out

20
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:00,791
that a bottomless pit is,
by definition, impossible?

21
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,593
Says you!

22
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:04,064
Well, I guess
we'll never know.

23
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,142
Aah! it's some sort
of invisible pushing force!

24
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:13,104
Quick! everyone
back to the shack!

25
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:15,746
I'm not done getting rid
of these yet!

26
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:17,678
Ahh!

27
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,110
Grunkle Stan! No!

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,284
Almost... almost... almost...

29
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,286
( All screaming )

30
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,360
( Bleats )

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,362
( Theme music playing )

32
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,503
( All screaming )

33
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:21,542
( Screaming stops,
wind blowing )

34
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,174
So, anyone wanna
scream some more?

35
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:26,277
Where are we?

36
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:29,380
We're somewhere where
it looks like we're nowhere.

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,851
( Laughing )

38
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,523
We're gonna land on
something eventually.

39
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:33,784
Could be any second now!

40
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,532
Well, it looks like we're
down here for the long haul.

41
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,534
Who wants to see
some card tricks?

42
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,569
Ta-da!

43
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,842
Hey! maybe we should pass
the time by tellin' stories.

44
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,874
I've got a story! It's called:
"The time grunkle Stan

45
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,946
got us all thrown
into a bottomless pit,

46
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:58,949
where we spent the rest
of our natural lives!"

47
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,811
Go on.

48
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,953
Come on, Dipper,
you can do better than that.

49
00:03:02,953 --> 00:03:05,786
Fine. I'll tell you a story,

50
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,788
a story I'd like to call:

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,492
Ready?

52
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:15,266
All: spin the pig!
Whoo!

53
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:20,501
Hey, grunkle Stan,
ever kissed a pig before?

54
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,503
I'm not gonna answer
that question.

55
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,205
Guys! guys! I think
i just got bit by a snake!

56
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,578
I need you to get me
to a hospital quick!

57
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:28,979
( Laughing )

58
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,881
What? what's so funny?

59
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:32,943
Uh, sorry, it's just hard
to focus on what you're saying

60
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:35,716
with that squeaky
puberty voice you got there.

61
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,787
My what?

62
00:03:36,787 --> 00:03:38,349
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, Dipper.

63
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,492
Your voice is hilarious.

64
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:42,553
Are you saying
my voice cracks?

65
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:43,824
My voice doesn't crack.

66
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,456
Dude, no offense,
but it cracks so much

67
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:47,528
we've already made
a techno remix out of it.

68
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,659
( Dipper on recording )
nice to meet you.

69
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,861
My name's Dipper pines.

70
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,503
( Distorted )
p-p-pines, pines, pines.

71
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:54,705
Do I really sound like that?

72
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:56,006
Oh! here comes
my favorite part!

73
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:58,539
Stop it, guys!

74
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,910
( Laughing )

75
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,911
Gimme that!

76
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,444
( Grunting )

77
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,416
All: spin the pig!

78
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:08,449
( Sighs, voice cracks )

79
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,851
Ugh! even my sighs sound weird.

80
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,283
Hello there!
Aah!

81
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:14,685
I couldn't help
but overhear
yer sitchy-ation!

82
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:15,956
Old man mcgucket!

83
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,828
( Spits )
part-time inventor!

84
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:19,460
Why did you spit
on your hand?

85
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,861
I don't rightly know!

86
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,262
Hey, I remember you!

87
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,964
Your robot almost killed me!

88
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:27,898
Come here! Follow
me into this dark,
dangerous alley!

89
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:31,442
Lately I been a-tinkerizin'
with a voice altering tonic,

90
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:35,005
on account
of my horrifyin' voice!

91
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:37,648
( Cries )

92
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:41,852
You can run,
but I'll still be
in yer nightmares!

93
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:44,054
This will really
fix my voice?

94
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:47,618
Thanks!
( gulping )
ah!

95
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,321
Come mornin',
you'll sound like a new man!

96
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:53,293
If you survive.

97
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,495
( Rooster crowing )

98
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:59,400
( Yawns )

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,833
( In deep voice )
good morning, Dipper.

100
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,337
I did it! I did it!

101
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:08,979
Now I have a new voice!

102
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,482
( Hearty laugh )

103
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:14,985
'Morning, Mabel.
Who's my favorite Mabel?

104
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,086
Ahh!

105
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:16,947
Who are you?
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

106
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:18,419
What have you done
with my brother?

107
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,750
Dipper!

108
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,892
I'll save you from this
body-switching warlock!

109
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:22,953
Mabel, it's me!

110
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:24,955
This is my voice now.

111
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:26,397
I sound awesome.

112
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:28,899
Sound awesome.

113
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:32,332
I knew boys' voices changed,
but this is weird.

114
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,564
Weird and bad.

115
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:36,767
Mabel, this is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

116
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:40,611
And just think
of the prank calls.

117
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:42,042
Hello?

118
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:46,346
Hello. this is the president of
the United States of America.

119
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,820
I'm calling to tell you...
( Blowing raspberries )

120
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,682
(Through telephone)
What? Who is this?

121
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:54,655
(In deep voice) Ho-ho-ho!
Magnificent!

122
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,056
Mabel no like.

123
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,931
How you diddly doing, Soos?

124
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,032
Kill it!
Oh!

125
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:03,894
Kill it with fire!
Everyone flee!

126
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:06,036
Ahh!

127
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,568
What gives, man?

128
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,000
You guys all made fun
of my old voice.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,142
I thought you'd
like the new one.

130
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:14,705
Dude, at least before
you sounded like a real person.

131
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:16,807
Now you sound like some kind
of weird commercial dude.

132
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:18,008
I'll find Stan.

133
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:20,411
He'll like my new voice.
You'll see!

134
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:22,853
I'll be right back
after these messages.

135
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:26,056
I, uh, I mean, goodbye.

136
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:30,160
Grunkle Stan. Grunkle Stan!
Where are you, grunkle Stan?

137
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,863
Huh? I'd know
that voice anywhere!

138
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:35,095
You're the guy who
prank called me earlier!

139
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,897
( Growls )

140
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,998
No. no, I'm not.

141
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,870
I'm just a 12-year-old boy!

142
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,873
You expect me to believe that,
you crazy-voiced punk?

143
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:46,076
W-wait! no! Aiyee!

144
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:49,039
There's a prank caller
on the loose! Let's get him!

145
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,941
Yeah! come on!
Come on, let's get him!

146
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:54,585
Oh! oh! Oh!

147
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:55,746
( Grunting )

148
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:57,748
Huh!
whoa!

149
00:06:57,748 --> 00:06:59,149
Escape!

150
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,022
( Laughing )

151
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,195
Mcgucket! your invention
was a catastrophe!

152
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:09,159
That's probably why
i live in the dump!

153
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:11,431
My own sister
didn't recognize me.

154
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,063
I scared away crowds!

155
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:17,107
I even sound ridiculous
when I ( crying ) cry.

156
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:18,709
Well, now,
here's yer problem!

157
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,471
I gave you the wrong
drinky-majig!

158
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:23,113
This one's for
voiceover professional.

159
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:26,216
Ah! I'm sure I've got a better
voice in here somewhere.

160
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:28,979
Good! hurry up.

161
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,581
You got here just in time.

162
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:34,485
Come sundown, you'd have
reverted back to your
ridiculous old voice.

163
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:37,227
It was ridiculous,
wasn't it?

164
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:38,529
( Dipper on walkman )
d-d-d-d-Dipper pines,

165
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,890
that's me!

166
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,962
Mabel: this remix
is dedicated to my brother.

167
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,464
Dipper, your voice
is one of a kind.

168
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,036
Soos: dude, I never
heard anything like it.

169
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,137
R-r-remix over!

170
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:48,869
( Imitates sound
of an explosion )

171
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,201
You ready for yer new voice?

172
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:53,143
This one should be permanent!

173
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,251
( Clears throat )

174
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,252
( Inhales deeply )

175
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:03,984
( Normal voice )
hey, guys.

176
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,215
Dipper!
oh, dude, you're back!

177
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:06,887
( Chuckling )

178
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,160
Yeah. I guess I realized
that even though my voice
might not be perfect,

179
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,063
it's still mine,
and I wouldn't change
it for anything,

180
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:15,095
not even for whatever
was in this new vial.

181
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,267
So what did you do
with the rest of that potion?

182
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,929
I dumped it in Stan's coffee.

183
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:20,831
( High-pitched voice )
any of you kids seen my girdle?

184
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:22,803
Where my girdle at?

185
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,504
( All laughing )

186
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,037
What? what's so funny?
I'm grunkle Stan!

187
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:29,640
Kids laughin'.
Laughin' at their grunkle.

188
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:36,647
I spy, with my little eye,
something that is... black!

189
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:38,549
Ooh! ooh! Everything.

190
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,050
Yay for Soos!

191
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,652
Stan: yay for Soos!

192
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:44,024
Hey, guys, who wants
to pass the time by spinning?

193
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,596
Everyone spin!

194
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:46,957
No.
whee!

195
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:47,928
Ahh!

196
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:48,929
( Chuckles )

197
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:49,960
Whee! ( laughing )

198
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,102
Ow! ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

199
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:54,565
Dipper's pain is funny,
but I'm starting to get bored.

200
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,236
Soos, tell a story.

201
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,808
Really? okay.

202
00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:01,071
This story is called "Soos's
really great pinball story."

203
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:02,573
( Dipper screaming )

204
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:05,115
Is that a good title?
Do they have to be, like,
puns or whatever?

205
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,651
( Gunshots, neighing )

206
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,922
Go! go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

207
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:14,124
This is it, dudes.
After four long
years of trying,

208
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,786
I might finally
get the high score

209
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:17,658
on Stan's creepy old
pinball machine.

210
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,089
If I do this,
I'll go down

211
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,031
in pinball history
with the likes of

212
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:23,994
sal, gaff,
and of course poo.

213
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:26,697
Have you ever tried maybe
just tilting the machine?

214
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:27,938
I don't know, dudes.

215
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:30,070
Isn't breaking the rules,
like, against the rules?

216
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,972
Nuts to the rules!
Tilt! Tilt! Tilt!

217
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,874
( Gunshot, neighing )

218
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,976
Failure. you stink!

219
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,048
All right, that's it.
Ready, kids?

220
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,581
Both: tilt! Tilt! Tilt! Tilt!
Tilt! Tilt! Tilt! Tilt!

221
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,983
Quit tiltin', pardner.
Quit tiltin', pardner.

222
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,015
Tilt!

223
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:46,687
Bull's-eye!

224
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,059
( Gunshots )

225
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,061
New high score!

226
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,122
Yay!
whoo-hoo!

227
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:53,093
Oh, yes!
All right!

228
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,194
This is the best moment
of my life.

229
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,066
This totally beats
my old best moment.

230
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,002
Aah.

231
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:06,006
That ain't right. You cheated.

232
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,808
Oh, yeah? What are
you gonna do about it?

233
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,110
You're just a pinball game,
pinball game.

234
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,782
Taunt, taunt.

235
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:15,085
Uh, guys? There's an awful
lot of green lightning
coming out of that game.

236
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:18,088
No, that's the normal
amount of green lightning.

237
00:10:18,088 --> 00:10:19,920
( All screaming )

238
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,254
( Bells ringing )

239
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:27,057
Ugh. five more minutes.

240
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:28,699
( Ringing continues )

241
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,901
Aah! that's not
a normal alarm clock.

242
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,934
Soos!
we're inside the game!

243
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,635
Crazy.
sweet Moses!

244
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,308
Hushed exclamation of wonder.

245
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:39,639
( Gasps )

246
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,811
( All chuckling )

247
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:42,873
Awesome!

248
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:45,215
Boing! boing! Boing!

249
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:46,646
( Laughing )

250
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,681
Dude, if this is a dream,
i never wanna wake up!

251
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:52,723
That can be arranged.

252
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:56,687
Welcome to tumbleweed terror,
pardners!

253
00:10:56,687 --> 00:10:59,259
( Gunshots )

254
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,131
Hey,
it's the skeleton cowboy guy.

255
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:03,193
Did you zap me into your game
to congratulate me

256
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,265
on getting the high score?
I beat poo, dude.

257
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,799
Hardly. if'n I do recall,
i warned y'all not to cheat.

258
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,370
I tried to be gentleman-like,

259
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,102
but I'm plum sick
of being tilted.

260
00:11:12,102 --> 00:11:13,443
( Clanging )

261
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:16,346
So now I reckon
I'm gonna tilt you.

262
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:19,279
Oh, yeah?
Well-- well, take this!

263
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,752
Ow! and this! Ow! It hurts!

264
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:23,984
I wish this was working better!
Oh, dude!

265
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,255
Both: Soos!

266
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:28,418
( Laughing )
get yourselves ready for the...

267
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:29,820
( Neighing )

268
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,762
All in succession:
Multi-ball!

269
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:35,065
( Cowboy skeleton laughing )

270
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:36,466
All: ahh!

271
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,168
Over there!
( Panting, gasping )

272
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:40,030
Where are you?

273
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,873
I'm not done teachin' you
a lesson about cheating yet!

274
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:45,235
How are we ever gonna
get out of here?
Think, guys!

275
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:49,039
I'm trying, but it's
hard with that gorgeous
pinball wench distracting me.

276
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,813
( Chuckling )

277
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:53,984
Okay, don't worry, guys.

278
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:55,385
I know every inch
of this machine.

279
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:57,287
( Whispering ) there's
a manual power switch inside.

280
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,189
I can sneak in there
and turn off the game,

281
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:02,122
but we'll have to distract
the cowboy guy.

282
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,994
Are either of you
good at jumping up and down

283
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:05,395
and making annoying noises?

284
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:10,130
My time has come.

285
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,063
All right, let's go, Soos.
Soos?

286
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:15,936
So are you, like,
doing anything later or--

287
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,237
right.

288
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,869
Come on out
and show yourselves, varmints!

289
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,240
Hey! hey! Hey!

290
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,313
Listen to me and look
at what I'm doing!

291
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:25,846
( Sputtering )

292
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,248
( Blowing raspberries )

293
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,349
Somethin' ain't right here.

294
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,181
Distraction!
distraction!
( humming )

295
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,083
Let me see where this is goin'.

296
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,254
La, la, la,
la, la, la...
( Humming )

297
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:38,288
( Grunting )

298
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,295
Oof! ( gasps )

299
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:51,501
( Laughing ) yippe-ti-yi--
what? Where are ya?

300
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:55,505
( Grunting )
durn it, I wish I had a neck!

301
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,983
Soos! psst!
What's going on?

302
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,184
Just press
the switch already!

303
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,786
Okay, so I was gonna do that,
but I've been thinking.

304
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,258
According to this,

305
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:10,260
turning off the power erases
the high score permanently.

306
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,363
That score is, like,
my one big life accomplishment.

307
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:15,926
What? if you don't hurry up
we could die in here!

308
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:18,298
Fair point.
But, what is life anyway,

309
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,971
when compared to the immortality
of a high score?

310
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:22,502
Soos! are you out of your--

311
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,934
there y'all are.

312
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,437
Get ready to meet yer maker,
kids!

313
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:32,042
My maker is ballway games
in redmond, Washington.

314
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:35,946
( Grunting, yelling )

315
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:37,487
( Both screaming )
Mabel!

316
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,324
Dipper: Soos!
Mabel: Soos, please!

317
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,856
Turn it off!

318
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:47,027
Uh...

319
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,228
Ahh!

320
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,300
Goodbye, high score!

321
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,332
( Grunts )

322
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,105
( Beeping )

323
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,344
( Gasps )

324
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,545
Aah!

325
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,977
Oh, you dudes okay?

326
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:10,020
Yeah, Soos.
You did it!
You freed us!

327
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,252
Hey, man, I'm sorry
you had to lose
your high score.

328
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,885
That's okay. I got
a new life accomplishment now:

329
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:16,356
Saving you dudes.

330
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,328
Aw!
aw!

331
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:23,533
You think that pinball wench
will call me?

332
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,335
I can't believe this nonsense!

333
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:28,068
Magic tonics?
Soos winning at something?

334
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,000
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,441
I'll tell you a good story.

336
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:35,205
It's called "grunkle Stan
wins the football bowl."

337
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:40,550
( Grunts, laughs )

338
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,512
Mr. pines.

339
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:44,284
I thought old folks
were useless,

340
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,517
but you taught me and my
gloating friends a lesson.

341
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:51,521
Woman: here's your football
winning trophy, Mr. pines!

342
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:53,623
Thanks, beautiful woman,
but I couldn't have done it

343
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:56,967
without my sidekick,
foot-bot.

344
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,429
Thank you for
building me, daddy.

345
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:02,302
( All laughing )

346
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,673
Foot-bot:
i love you, Stan.

347
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:06,676
( Overlapping jeers )

348
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:08,678
What? that story was great.

349
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:11,211
I even threw in
a talking robot
for the kids.

350
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,443
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna
tell a non-terrible story,

351
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:15,445
a story called...

352
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,392
This attraction is
gonna make me a fortune!

353
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,494
Easy with that bear,
corduroy!

354
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:26,056
I need him in
showroom condition!

355
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:29,229
( Roaring )
no! No!

356
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,001
Aw!
they're hugging!

357
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,562
So let me get this straight.

358
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:35,535
Your plan is to teach
this bear to ride a bicycle?

359
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,468
Nah, come on.
Everyone's seen
a bicycle-riding bear.

360
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:41,311
No, no. I'm gonna
teach this bear...

361
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,243
To drive!

362
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,445
( Tires screeching )

363
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,517
And the yellow light
means speed up.

364
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:48,678
( Sirens )

365
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:50,050
Uh-oh.

366
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,025
What seems to be the problem,
officers?

367
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,556
( Roars )

368
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,990
Now there had
better be a darn good
explanation for this.

369
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,431
Oh, there is.

370
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:04,534
You see, I'm a very old man,
not long for this earth,

371
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:07,137
and the doctor's assigned me
a seeing-eye bear

372
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:09,539
to drive me to the hospital
in case of emergencies.

373
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,742
Is that right?
Then where's
your doctor's note?

374
00:16:12,742 --> 00:16:15,445
Why, it's right here,
inside my jacket!

375
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:17,507
( Grunts ) ah! There you go!

376
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,553
Well, I can't argue
with Dr. medicine.

377
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:26,686
To the hospital, honeypants!
( Roars )

378
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,024
Grunkle Stan,
how could you lie
to those policemen?

379
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,226
Don't you know lying
is always wrong?

380
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:37,527
Mabel, when you
get to be my age,

381
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,069
you'll learn that sometimes

382
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:41,071
you have to bend the truth
for the greater good.

383
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:43,273
Hey, has anyone seen
my plate of spaghetti?

384
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:45,635
( Slurps ) no.

385
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:48,638
But I bet Soos has.
You know how he likes to eat.

386
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:52,482
This is a dark day.
Thanks, grunkle Stan!

387
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:53,783
See? greater good.

388
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:55,645
Ahh!

389
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,191
Waddles, what am I gonna
do about grunkle Stan?

390
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:03,093
( Deep voice )
he needs to stop lying.

391
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:05,295
( Normal voice )
i know! But how do we stop him?

392
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:07,227
( Deep voice ) maybe you
should check Dipper's journal.

393
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,498
Oink, oink!

394
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:10,160
( Normal voice )
say "oink" one more time.

395
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,201
( Deep voice )
oink, oink.

396
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:13,133
( Normal voice )
waddles, you genius!

397
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,668
"Buried 'neath a tree stump in
the deep forest are truth teeth,

398
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:23,143
which force upon the wearer
an inability to lie." Hmm.

399
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:29,048
( Snoring )

400
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:45,295
Aah! what's going on?
What? Mabel?

401
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:46,566
Quick question.

402
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,598
What happened to
Dipper's spaghetti plate?

403
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:50,570
I ate it, because I have
little to no concern

404
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,173
for other people's
possessions or emotions.

405
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:56,506
Huh.
that was strangely candid.

406
00:17:56,506 --> 00:18:00,550
Almost as if I'm unable to lie.
Well, goodnight!

407
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,412
( Snores )

408
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,416
You what? That seems
like a horrible idea!

409
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,557
It's great!

410
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:09,389
Now he has to tell
the truth.

411
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,560
Hmm.

412
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,123
Scrambled meat,
here it is.

413
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:16,266
Stan, what do you do
in secret every day
during your lunch break?

414
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:19,199
Usually I spend the hour
aggressively scratching myself

415
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,730
in places
i shouldn't mention.

416
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,472
Now I'm going to avoid
making eye contact

417
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:24,534
by pretending to read
this newspaper,

418
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:25,575
and go to the bathroom
without washing my hands.

419
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:28,538
Both: ew!

420
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:29,679
Well, that was disturbing.

421
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,680
Don't worry, Dipper.

422
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,613
The truth is
always a good thing.

423
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,114
Hey, excuse me.

424
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,287
Do you think this t-shirt
is my size?

425
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,389
Never mind the t-shirt!
Hey, everybody!

426
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:42,222
Look at this guy's abnormal
and unattractive face!

427
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,293
( Audible reactions )

428
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:45,495
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

429
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:47,497
Doing my taxes.

430
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,860
Uh, grunkle Stan,
why did you write this?

431
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,633
Because I regularly commit
massive tax fraud.

432
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:58,168
Might wanna tuck
that one away there.

433
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:00,570
Doo-doo-doo-doo-do.
oh, no!

434
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,642
( Mabel and Dipper laughing )

435
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,475
Sometimes I think,
is this all there is?

436
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:08,478
Is life just some
kind of horrific joke
without a punch line?

437
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:10,420
That we're all just
biding our time

438
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,553
until the sweet,
sweet release of death?

439
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:18,788
( Audibly shudders )

440
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,292
Kids!

441
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,564
I think I have a growth
forming on my back!

442
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,696
Just wanted to be honest
with you guys!

443
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:28,468
I can't take it anymore,
Mabel!

444
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,839
You have to take those teeth
out of his mouth.

445
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,641
But then
he'd be a liar again!

446
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:33,703
Could is possibly be
any worse than this?

447
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:35,645
( Doorbell rings )

448
00:19:35,645 --> 00:19:37,507
So after further
investigation,

449
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:40,880
turns out there is
no Dr. medicine
in gravity falls.

450
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,813
You'd better have a durn
good explanation for this.

451
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,215
Oh, and I do!

452
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:46,616
You see, I lied to you.

453
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:48,918
In addition, I've been
parking in handicapped spaces,

454
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,520
shoplifting fireworks,

455
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,663
and smuggling endangered
animals across multiple
state lines.

456
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:54,894
Also, you're fat.

457
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,728
Is all this true?

458
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:01,571
No, no, it's not true...
Right, Mabel?

459
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:02,772
Uh... sirs,

460
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:05,805
I have to be completely
and totally honest with you.

461
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,537
Our great uncle Stan is...

462
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,739
Is... ugh!

463
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,212
( Growling )

464
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,315
Stan is...

465
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,916
Secretly a crime fiction
writer!

466
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,348
What?

467
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:19,789
Yeah!
he was just telling you

468
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,622
about a character
from his upcoming page-Turner

469
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,823
crime grandpa.

470
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,626
He's never committed
a crime in his life!

471
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:29,529
Also, have you lost weight?

472
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,701
( Tittering )

473
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,703
Finally, someone noticed.

474
00:20:33,703 --> 00:20:34,904
Wow, an author!

475
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:36,706
Can you teach me
how to read?

476
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:38,308
What? author?

477
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:40,310
( Chuckling ) authors--
masters of fiction!

478
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,811
Good night, officers!

479
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:43,012
Ugh!

480
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,614
Hey, you all right?

481
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:46,416
I can't believe I lied!

482
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,748
Mabel, it was for
the greater good.

483
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,420
Yeah. the greater good.

484
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,422
Hello, police station?

485
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:55,425
Yeah, I forgot to
tell 'em about my tax fraud.

486
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:57,587
No, tax fraud.

487
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:58,988
Get 'em out!

488
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:01,391
What's gotten into you kids?

489
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,334
We have to find a place
to get rid of these!

490
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:06,596
( Audibly struggling )

491
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,601
And I never saw that box
full of magical teeth again.

492
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:13,042
Oh, wait, there it is.

493
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,775
( All groan )

494
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,947
Oh, sweet, my shoes.

495
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:19,479
I liked the part
with the bear.

496
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,810
The rest seemed
pretty farfetched.

497
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,951
Mabel, we already
know that story.

498
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:23,483
We just lived through it.

499
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,485
So, if we're living
through that story right now,

500
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:26,886
how does it end?

501
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,418
Guys, do you see that?

502
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:32,762
Oh, what is that?
Oh, no!

503
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:34,824
Where are we going?
Oh, my god!

504
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,866
( All screaming )

505
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:40,730
( Bleating )

506
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,602
Aah! oooph!

507
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,434
Where... where are we?

508
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,776
( Gasps )
look! The shack!

509
00:21:46,776 --> 00:21:48,508
Which means...

510
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:52,342
We came right back out
the top.

511
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:54,444
And I don't think
any time has passed.

512
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:56,446
It must be some kind
of wormhole.

513
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:58,748
Yeah, dude, that sounds
"sciencey" enough to be true.

514
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:01,851
But that's impossible!
No one will believe us!

515
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:04,824
Maybe this is one story
we should keep to ourselves.

516
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,356
Agreed!

517
00:22:07,497 --> 00:22:09,929
Aah!

518
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,761
He'll be fine.

519
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,746
( Grunts )

520
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:40,129
This is stupid!
