1
00:00:05,076 --> 00:00:06,407
For tonight's final illusion,

2
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:10,481
we have
the incredible sack of mystery.

3
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:14,145
When you put your money in,
it mysteriously disappears!

4
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:15,616
Oh, of course!
That makes perfect sense!

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,419
Wow! what a nice man!
That was totally
worth the drive!

6
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,791
The tiger was badly injured
in the explosion,

7
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,794
but we repaired him...
With a fist!

8
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:25,156
( Gong chimes )

9
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:26,197
( All cheer )

10
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:27,628
That tiger is a hero!

11
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,136
Hey, look, it's that commercial
i was telling you guys about.

12
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,408
Are you completely miserable?

13
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:39,310
( Crying ) yes!

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,212
Then you need to meet...

15
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,545
Gideon?
what makes him so special?

16
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,447
He's a psychic.

17
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:47,478
A-roo?

18
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:48,679
So don't waste
your time with

19
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,682
other so-called
men of mystery.

20
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:53,684
( Roars )

21
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:55,686
Learn about
tomorrow tonight

22
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:57,458
at Gideon's
tent of telepathy!

23
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,530
Void where prohibited,
no c.O.D.'S accepted,

24
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,831
Carla, I've always loved you,
but I've never had the guts
to say it.

25
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:04,535
Wow! I'm gettin'
all curious-y inside!

26
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:06,367
Well, don't get too curious-y!

27
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,839
Ever since that monster Gideon
rolled into town,

28
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:10,671
I've had nothing but trouble!

29
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,745
( Tires screech, horn honks )

30
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:17,077
( All cheering )

31
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,409
Gideon!

32
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:19,750
Well,
is he really psychic?

33
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,352
I think we should go
and find out.

34
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:24,185
Never! you are forbidden from
patronizing the competition!

35
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,816
No one that
lives under my roof

36
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,818
is allowed under
that Gideon's roof!

37
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:29,120
Do tents have roofs?

38
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,861
I think we just
found our loophole...

39
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:34,094
Literally! mwop-mwop!

40
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,598
So come down soon, folks.
Gideon is expecting you.

41
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,573
В™єв™є

42
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,375
step right up there, folks!

43
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,378
Put your money in
Gideon's psychic sack!

44
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:30,681
Oh, sure!
That makes perfect sense!

45
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:36,227
Whoa, this is like
a bizarro version
of the mystery shack.

46
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:37,828
They even have
their own Soos!

47
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:42,933
It's starting!
It's starting!

48
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,566
В™єв™є

49
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,738
let's see what
this monster looks like.

50
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:57,348
Hello, America!
My name is lil' Gideon!

51
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:59,750
( Cheering and applause )

52
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,712
That's Stan's mortal enemy?

53
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:03,884
But he's so... "Widdle."

54
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,487
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is such a gift

55
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:07,958
to have you here tonight!

56
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,490
Such a gift!

57
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,492
I have a vision.

58
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:15,766
I predict you'll
soon all say, "aw!"

59
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:19,530
All: aw!

60
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,601
It came true!

61
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,433
What? I'm not impressed.

62
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,874
You're impressed.

63
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:24,875
Hit it, dad!

64
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,678
В™єв™є

65
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:28,709
aah!

66
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,581
( All screaming )

67
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:34,585
В™є oh, I can see
what others can't see в™є

68
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:38,589
в™є it ain't some sideshow trick,
it's innate ability в™є

69
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:42,893
в™є where other's are blind,
i am future-ly inclined в™є

70
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:47,428
в™є and you too could see
if you was "widdle" ol' me в™є

71
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,261
come on, everybody, rise up!
I want y'all to keep it going!

72
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,263
How did he...?

73
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:53,934
Keep it going!

74
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,667
В™є you wish your son
would call you more в™є

75
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,809
I'm leaving everything
to my cats!

76
00:03:58,809 --> 00:03:59,910
( Screeches )

77
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,913
В™є I sense that you've
been here before в™є

78
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:04,615
what gave it away?

79
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,016
Come on.

80
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,749
В™є I'll read your mind,
if I'm able в™є

81
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,521
( all clapping )

82
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:12,953
В™є something tells me
you're named Mabel в™є

83
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,685
how'd he do that?!

84
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,358
So welcome all ye в™є

85
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,930
в™є to the tent of telepathy в™є

86
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,633
в™є and thanks
for visiting... в™є

87
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:27,698
в™є "widdle" ol' me в™є

88
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:29,800
( panting )
oh, my goodness.

89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,303
( Cheering and applause )

90
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:33,644
Thank you!

91
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:35,776
You people
are the real miracles!

92
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,848
Whoo! yeah!

93
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,682
Man, that kid's an even
bigger fraud than Stan!

94
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,554
No wonder
our uncle's jealous!

95
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:46,717
Oh, come on,
his dance moves were adorable!

96
00:04:46,717 --> 00:04:49,720
And did you see his hair?
It was like whoosh!

97
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,862
You're too easily impressed.
Yeah, yeah!

98
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:53,694
( Both laugh )

99
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,970
Check it out, Dipper!

100
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,773
I successfully
bezazzled my face!

101
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:03,904
Blink!

102
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,075
Ow.

103
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:06,507
Is that permanent?

104
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,679
I'm unappreciated in my time.

105
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:09,740
( Doorbell rings )

106
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,642
Stan: somebody answer the door!

107
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,013
I'll get it!

108
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,916
Howdy!

109
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,788
It's "widdle" ol' you!

110
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:19,790
( Chuckles )
yeah, my song's quite catchy.

111
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,792
I know
we haven't formally met,

112
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,624
but after
yesterday's performance,

113
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,626
I just couldn't get
your laugh out of my head!

114
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,929
You mean this one?
( Laughs )

115
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,461
Oh, what a delight!

116
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:32,933
When I saw you in the audience,
i said to myself,

117
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,635
"now there's a kindred spirit,

118
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:38,008
someone who appreciates
the sparkly things in life."

119
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:40,471
That's totally me!
( Laughs )

120
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:41,742
( Coughs )

121
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:45,345
Enchanting.
utterly enchanting.

122
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,517
Stan: who's at the door?!

123
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:47,978
No one, grunkle Stan!

124
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,981
I appreciate your discretion.
Stan's no fan of mine.

125
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,983
I don't know how
a lemon so sour

126
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:54,985
could be related
to a peach so sweet.

127
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:56,827
Gideon! ( chuckles )

128
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:59,830
What do you say we step away
from here and chat a bit more?

129
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,692
Perhaps in my
dressing room?

130
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:03,834
Oh, makeovers!
( Cheers )

131
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,796
( Chuckles ) ow.

132
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,772
Do you see something you like?
'Cause I do.

133
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,043
( Chuckles ) what?

134
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,778
Hey, Dipper, what's going on?

135
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,910
Whoa, where have you been?

136
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,582
And what's going on
with those fingernails?

137
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,883
You look like a Wolverine.

138
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,416
I know, right?!
( Roars )

139
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,418
I was hanging out
with my new pal Gideon!

140
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:29,059
He is one
dapper little man!

141
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:32,763
Mabel, I don't trust anyone
whose hair is bigger
than their head.

142
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:33,894
Oh, leave him alone!

143
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,896
You never wanna
do girly stuff with me.

144
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,670
You and Soos get to do
boy stuff all the time.
What do you mean?

145
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,603
Hey, dude, you ready to blow up
these hot dogs in the microwave,
one by one?!

146
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,934
Am I?!

147
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:44,935
( Microwave beeps )

148
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:45,936
( Both laugh )

149
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:48,609
Dipper: one at a time!
One at a time!

150
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,584
Whoa, the view from
your family's factory is nuts!

151
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:54,885
Good thing
we both brought our...

152
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:56,917
Both: opera glasses!

153
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,950
( Both laugh )

154
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,594
Mabel, when I'm up here,
looking down on all them
little ol' people,

155
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:06,697
I feel like
I'm king of all I survey.

156
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:07,998
I guess that
makes you my queen.

157
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:13,033
What?! you are being so nice
to me right now! Quit it!

158
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,505
I can't quit it.

159
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:17,137
I'm speaking from the heart.
From the where now?

160
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,840
Mabel, I've never felt
this close with anyone.

161
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,912
So, so close...

162
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:23,013
( Chuckles )

163
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:24,515
Look, Gideon, I, um...

164
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:25,876
( Chuckles )

165
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:28,679
I like you a lot,
but let's just be friends.

166
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,980
At least
just give me a chance.

167
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,854
Mabel, will you do me the honor
of going on a date with me?

168
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:34,885
A play date?
Mm-mmm.

169
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:36,687
A shopping date?
Mm-mmm.

170
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,689
It'll just be
one little ol' date.

171
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,861
I swear on my lucky bolo tie.

172
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:41,862
Um...

173
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,997
Okay then...
I guess.

174
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:51,001
Mabel pines, you have made me
the happiest boy in the world!

175
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:53,143
Are you sniffing my hair?

176
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,610
It's not a date-date.

177
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,482
It's just, you know,
i didn't want to hurt
his feelings,

178
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,785
and so I figured
I'd throw him a bone.

179
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,256
Mabel,
guys don't work that way.

180
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:08,118
He's gonna
fall in love with you.

181
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:11,261
Pfft! yeah, right.
I'm not that lovable.

182
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:12,963
Kaboom! yes!

183
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:14,625
Okay, we agree
on something here.

184
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,196
( Doorbell rings )

185
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,000
( Neighs )
( Screams )

186
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:24,234
A night of enchantment awaits,
milady!

187
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:25,175
Oh, boy.

188
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:27,177
В™єв™є

189
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,112
I can't believe they let us
bring a horse in here.

190
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,616
Well, people have a hard time
saying no to me.

191
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,789
Ah, Mr. Gideon!
The feet on the table!

192
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,891
An excellent choice!

193
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:43,253
Jean-Luc, what did we discuss
about eye contact?

194
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,095
Yes, yes! Very good!

195
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:46,927
I've never seen so many forks!

196
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:51,531
And water with bubbles in it?
Ooh-la-la! Oui oui!

197
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,263
Oh, parlais-vous francais? *

198
00:08:53,263 --> 00:08:55,936
I have no idea
what you're saying.

199
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,609
Hey! hey! What the Jekyll
is Mabel doing in the paper

200
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:01,071
next to that
greasy pickpocket Gideon?!

201
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:02,573
Oh, yeah, it's like a big deal.

202
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:05,315
Everybody's talking about Gideon
and Mabel's big date tonight.

203
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:09,149
What?! that little shyster
is dating my great-niece?!

204
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,221
I wonder what the new name
will be for the power couple.

205
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:13,053
Mab-ideon? gide-Abel?

206
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,885
( Gasps ) ma-gid-bel-eon!

207
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:17,788
I didn't know!
I didn't hear about it!

208
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:19,289
And plus, I told her not to!

209
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:20,731
Yeah, well, it ends tonight!

210
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:23,063
I'm going right down
to that little skunk's house!

211
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,035
This is going to stop right now!

212
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:29,199
Dude, wouldn't it be funny
if that was a closet

213
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:32,302
and he had to come out again
and walk out the real door?

214
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:34,775
( Bell dings )

215
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,576
Nope. real door.

216
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:39,309
( Tires screech )

217
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:46,586
Gideon, you little punk!
Open up!

218
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,259
I will pardon nothing!

219
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,094
Why, Stanford pines,
what a delight!

220
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,096
Out of the way, bud,
I'm looking for Gideon.

221
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,928
Well, I haven't
seen the boy around,

222
00:09:57,928 --> 00:10:02,973
but since you're here,
you simply must come in
for coffee!

223
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:04,034
But-but I came--

224
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,036
it's imported
all the way from Columbia!

225
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:09,109
Wow...
i went to jail there once!

226
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,712
( Whistles )
some digs you got here.

227
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,614
Oh, this.
This is beautiful.

228
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,317
Now, I hear your niece
and my Gideon are...

229
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,721
Well, they're singing
in Harmony lately, so to speak.

230
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,853
Uh, yeah, and I'm against it!

231
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:24,154
Neh!

232
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:28,298
No, no, no, I see it as a
fantastic business opportunity!

233
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:31,301
Yes, the mystery shack
and the tent of telepathy!

234
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:34,835
We've been at each other's
throats for far too--
let me get that--

235
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:38,168
at each other's throats
for far too long!
Yes, we have!

236
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:40,841
This is our big chance
to brush aside our rivalry

237
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,014
and pool our
collective profits, you see.

238
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:45,676
( Cash register dings )

239
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:49,850
I'm listening.

240
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,854
And so I said, "autograph
your own headshot, lady!"

241
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,155
( Laughs )

242
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,057
Uh, yeah.

243
00:10:58,328 --> 00:11:01,031
Mabel, tonight's date
was a complete success,

244
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:04,795
and tomorrow's date promises
to top this one in every way!

245
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:08,769
Whoa, whoa,
you said just one date,
and this was it!

246
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,401
Hark! what a surprise!

247
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:14,104
A red crested south American
rainbow macaw!

248
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:15,375
Aah!

249
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,347
Two, three, four...

250
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:21,351
Mabel... will... you...
Accompany... Gideon... to...

251
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:25,355
The... ballroom... dance...
This... "Thurbday"...

252
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:27,918
Thursday! kaw!

253
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:29,319
Aw, so adorable!

254
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,421
Gideon's got a girlfriend!

255
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:33,924
They're expecting us.
Please say you'll go.

256
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:36,396
All: aw!

257
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,930
Gideon, I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have to say--

258
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,431
I'm on the edge
of my seat!

259
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,133
This is gonna be adorable!

260
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:46,476
If she says no,
I'll die from sadness!

261
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:48,338
I can verify that
that will indeed happen.

262
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:51,912
( All talking )

263
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,446
Hey! how'd it go?

264
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:59,389
I don't know.
I have a lobster now.

265
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,222
Well, at least it's over
and you won't ever have
to go out with him again.

266
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,797
Mabel? it's over, right?
Mabel?

267
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:11,031
Blargh! he asked me out again
and I didn't know how to say no!

268
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,502
Like this: "No."

269
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:14,734
It's not that easy, Dipper!

270
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,507
And I do like Gideon--
as a friend/little sister.

271
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,509
So I didn't want
to hurt his feelings.

272
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:22,372
I just need to get things back
to where they used to be--

273
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:23,944
you know, friends.

274
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:29,219
Boatin' at night!
Boatin' at night!
( Laughs )

275
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:33,053
You know, I thought dancing
was going to be the end
of the evening. Right?

276
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,755
Don't you want this evening
to last, my sweet?

277
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,229
No! I mean, yes.
I mean, I'm always happy
to hang out with a friend.

278
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:42,232
Buddy. pal. Chum.
Other word for friend.

279
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:43,533
Pal?
i already said pal.

280
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:44,835
Uh, mate?

281
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:46,867
How about soulmate?

282
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,042
Well, you can't say no to that!

283
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,947
He's so nice!
But I can't keep doing this!

284
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:58,178
But I can't break his heart!

285
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,180
Aah! I have no way out!

286
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,252
What in the heck
happened on that date?

287
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:03,553
I don't know!
I was in the friend zone!

288
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:05,415
And then, before I knew
what was happening,

289
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:07,417
he pulled me
into the romance zone!

290
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:10,420
It was like quicksand!
Chubby quicksand!

291
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,793
Mabel, come on.
It's not like you're
gonna have to marry Gideon.

292
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,466
Great news, Mabel!
You have to marry Gideon!

293
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:19,469
What?!
it's all part of my long-term
deal with buddy gleeful!

294
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,471
There's a lot of cash
tied up in this thing.

295
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:23,473
Plus, I got this shirt!

296
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:25,135
Ugh, I am fat.

297
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:27,137
( Screams )

298
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:30,480
Bodies change, honey.
Bodies change.

299
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:35,145
Oh, no. Mabel?

300
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:37,988
Mabel's not here.
She's in sweater town.

301
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:40,820
Are you gonna come out
of sweater town?

302
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,821
Mm.

303
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,493
All right, enough is enough.

304
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:46,496
If you can't
break up with Gideon,
then I'll do it for you.

305
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:48,999
You will?

306
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:52,362
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

307
00:13:53,904 --> 00:13:55,205
В™єв™є

308
00:13:58,468 --> 00:13:59,469
( clears throat )

309
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:02,342
Oh! Dipper pines, how are you?

310
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,574
You look good, you look good.

311
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:05,916
Thanks. you, uh...

312
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,577
Look, Gideon,
we've gotta talk.

313
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,319
Mabel isn't
joining you tonight.

314
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:11,851
She doesn't want
to see you anymore.

315
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,255
She's kind of
weirded out by you.
No offense.

316
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:18,158
So what you're saying is...

317
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,560
You've come between us.

318
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,563
You're not gonna, like...
Freak out or anything, are you?

319
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,435
( Chuckles )
of course not!

320
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:27,637
These things happen.
Bygones, you know.

321
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:30,170
So, okay, cool.
Well, then again, sorry, man...

322
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,542
But, uh, hey, thumbs up, huh?

323
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:36,576
Thumbs up, indeed, my friend.

324
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:41,451
How did it go? Was he mad?
Did he try to read your mind
with his psychic powers?

325
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:45,085
Don't worry, Mabel.
He's just a kid.
He doesn't have any powers.

326
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,889
( Breathing deeply )

327
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,664
Dipper pines, you don't know
what you've done!

328
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:05,575
You've just made the
biggest mistake of your life!

329
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,037
( Grunts )

330
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:09,109
Gideon Charles gleeful!

331
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,381
Clean up your room
this instant!

332
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:14,914
I can buy and sell you,
old man!

333
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,687
Fair enough.

334
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,700
Hit me, dude!

335
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,701
( Grunts )

336
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,033
( Laughs ) ow.

337
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,204
Feels good.

338
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:36,706
I'm so glad
everything's back to normal.

339
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:37,707
( Phone rings )

340
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:39,569
Your turn.
Your turn. Oh, man.

341
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:40,710
( Phone rings )

342
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,042
Hello?

343
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,975
Toby determined,
gravity falls gossiper!

344
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:47,717
Oh, hey, man.
Sorry for accusing you
of murder last week.

345
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:49,579
Water under the bridge!

346
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,623
Say, we want to interview you
about whether you've seen
anything unusual

347
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:56,286
in this here town
since you've arrived!

348
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,657
Oh, finally!

349
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,030
I thought nobody would ever ask!
I have notes and theories!

350
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,164
Uh-huh. uh-huh.
412 gopher road.

351
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,096
Uh, tonight? Got it.

352
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,098
There. I did your dirty work!

353
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:12,042
Now it's time to pay
your end of the bargain.

354
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:15,175
( Gasps )
Sandra jimenez's phone number!

355
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,507
Bless you, lil' Gideon!

356
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:31,421
( Echoing ) hello?

357
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,730
Hello, friend.

358
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,502
Gideon...

359
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,005
Dipper pines, how long have you
been living in this town?
A week? Two?

360
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,278
You like it here?
Enjoy the scenery?

361
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:49,279
What do you want from me, man?

362
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,680
Listen carefully, boy.

363
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,044
This town has secrets
you couldn't begin
to comprehend.

364
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:57,016
Is this about Mabel?
I told you, she's not into you!

365
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,191
Liar!
you turned her against me!

366
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:03,153
She was my peach dumpling!

367
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:04,154
Are you okay, man?

368
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:07,227
( Gasps )

369
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,528
( Groans )

370
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,260
( Squeaks )
howdy!

371
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,702
Reading minds
isn't all I can do!

372
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:14,264
But-but you're fake!

373
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:16,406
Oh, tell me, Dipper...
Is this fake?

374
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:24,043
( Door opens )

375
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,477
How's that
hair tasting, buddy?

376
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:29,479
Wendy, I need some advice.

377
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,251
You've broken up
with guys, right?

378
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,584
Oh, yeah. Russ durham,
Eli hall, stony Davidson...

379
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:36,426
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

380
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:40,059
I thought everything
was back to normal,
but I still feel all gross.

381
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,233
Mike worley, Nate holts,
that guy with the tattoos...

382
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:46,096
Maybe letting Dipper
do it for me was a mistake.

383
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:48,098
Gideon deserves
an honest break-up.

384
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:50,100
Danny feldman,
Mark Epstein...

385
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,572
Oh, man, I'm not sure I ever
actually broke up with him.

386
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,404
No wonder
he keeps calling me!

387
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:55,745
I know what I gotta do.

388
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:58,678
Thanks for
talking to me, Wendy.

389
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,079
( Bell rings )

390
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,411
( Phone rings )

391
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,582
Ignore!

392
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,585
( Grunting )

393
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,158
( Laughs )
( Gasps )

394
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:10,089
Whoa! ( groans )

395
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,323
Grunkle Stan
was right about you!
You are a monster!

396
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:15,195
Your sister will be mine!

397
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,766
( Laughs )

398
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:18,828
( Laughs )

399
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:23,873
Who's a cute little guy?
You are!

400
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:24,834
No, you are!

401
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,207
Aah!

402
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,410
( Grunts )
she's never gonna date you, man!

403
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,841
That's a lie!

404
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:36,786
And I'm gonna make sure
you never lie to me
again, friend.

405
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:37,787
( Grunts )

406
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,225
Gideon, we have to talk!

407
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:49,229
Mabel! my marshmallow!
What are you doing here?

408
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,901
I'm sorry, Gideon,
but I can't be your marshmallow.

409
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:54,604
I needed to be honest
and tell you that myself.

410
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:57,267
I... I don't understand.

411
00:18:57,267 --> 00:19:01,611
Uh, Mabel, this probably
isn't the best time to be
brutally honest with him!

412
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:04,414
Hey, but we can still be
makeover buddies, right?

413
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:06,746
Wouldn't you like that?
Really?

414
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:12,782
No! not really!
You were like attacking
my brother! What the heck?!

415
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,184
My tie! Give it back!

416
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:17,287
Ha! not so powerful
without this, are you?

417
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,688
Dipper!

418
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:19,929
( Both screaming )

419
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:23,233
( Both grunting )

420
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:26,436
( Both screaming )

421
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:42,482
Listen, Gideon, it's over.
I will never, ever date you.

422
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:43,913
Yeah!
( both groan )

423
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,288
My powers!

424
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,290
Oh, this isn't over.

425
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:55,194
This isn't the last you'll see
of "widdle" ol' me.

426
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:02,772
Ah, this is livin', brother.

427
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:07,377
From now on,
it's all name brand foods
and clown paintings.

428
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,512
Well, hey, Gideon, look who i--

429
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,214
Stanford pines, I rebuke thee.

430
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,216
I rebuke thee!

431
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,848
Rebuke? is that a word?

432
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:21,851
The entire pines family
have invoked my fury!

433
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:26,256
You will all pay recompense
for your transgressions!

434
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:28,658
What, you got like a word-a-day
calendar or something?

435
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:32,802
B-but, sunshine,
what about our arrangement
with Mabel and the--

436
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:34,233
silence!

437
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,707
Well, I see he's taken
to one of his rages again.

438
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:41,010
Sorry, Stan. I have to side
with Gideon on this one.

439
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:45,244
Okay! okay!
I can see when I'm not wanted!

440
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,878
Stan, I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna need
that painting back. Stan! Stan!

441
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:51,321
Try and catch me, suckers!

442
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:57,327
( Sighs ) I could've had it all.

443
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,628
What the heck
happened to you two?

444
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:00,890
Gideon.
Gideon.

445
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,393
Gideon.
yeah, the little mutant

446
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:05,395
swore vengeance
on the whole family.

447
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:08,838
I guess he's gonna try to
nibble my ankles or something.

448
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:11,901
Oh, yeah. Yeah, how's he
gonna destroy us now, huh?

449
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:14,404
Try to guess what number
we're thinking of? ( Laughs )

450
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:16,746
He'll never guess
what number I'm thinking of.

451
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:20,350
Negative eight!
No one would guess
a negative number!

452
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,651
( All laugh )

453
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:25,315
Ooh, look out!
I bet he's planning
our destruction right now!

454
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:30,360
( All laugh )

455
00:21:33,723 --> 00:21:37,397
( Imitating Mabel )
Gideon! I still love you!

456
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,670
If only my family
weren't in the way!

457
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,002
( Imitating Stan )
look at me, I'm old!

458
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,675
And I'm smelly!

459
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:47,607
( Imitating Dipper)
Hey, what are you gonna do

460
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:50,309
without your
precious amulet?

461
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,642
Oh, you'll see, boy.

462
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,415
You'll see...

463
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,519
You're done?
Not yet.

464
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,021
How about now?
Almost.

465
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:05,024
And there.

466
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,996
Let's do this.

467
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:10,800
В™єв™є

468
00:22:24,374 --> 00:22:25,575
you're fired.
