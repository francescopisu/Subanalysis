1
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:06,207
( Brakes screech,
all exclaim )

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:09,240
Here we are.
The summerween superstore.

3
00:00:11,682 --> 00:00:13,244
Wait-- summer what?

4
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:14,585
Summerween!

5
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,087
The people of this town
love Halloween so much,

6
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:17,388
they celebrate it
twice a year.

7
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:19,690
And wouldn't you know it?
It's today!

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,652
Do you always carry that
calendar in your pocket?

9
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:23,254
Yes.

10
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:27,228
Summerween? something
about this feels
unnatural.

11
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:30,061
There's free candy!

12
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:32,663
Both:
to the costume aisle!

13
00:00:32,663 --> 00:00:37,408
I'd lend you a hand--
but I don't seem to have any!

14
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:39,770
( Cackling )

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,772
This guy
tells it like it is.

16
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:43,314
Sir.

17
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:45,246
Could please
stop pushing that.

18
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,717
Ma'am, make these heads
less hilarious

19
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:48,419
and you got
yourself a deal.

20
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:50,651
( Head cackles )
well!

21
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,254
When the children
come to my door tonight,

22
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,725
they're gonna
run away screaming

23
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:58,429
from Stan pines,
master of fright!

24
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,631
Boo!
( baby cries, Stan laughs )

25
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:04,095
( Ongoing noise )

26
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:06,637
Uh-oh. think
this one's leaking!

27
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:10,271
Have the police come
and eject the pines
family from the store.

28
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,273
Not today!
My eyes!

29
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:15,806
You paid for this stuff,
right?

30
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:17,548
Of course!

31
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,182
I hate summerween.

32
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:23,714
Stan: let's move!

33
00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:29,860
В™єв™є

34
00:02:06,657 --> 00:02:09,230
( owl hooting )
i am so excited!

35
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,732
We're gonna have
the best costumes,
get the most candy...

36
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,804
And have the biggest
stomachaches ever!

37
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:16,167
Yeah!
ha ha! Yeah!

38
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,138
Dude, I've never seen
you guys so pumped.

39
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,171
Well, back at home,
me and Dipper were

40
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:22,773
kind of the kings
of trick-or-treating.

41
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:26,677
Twins in costumes--
the people eat it up.

42
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:28,349
Well, you dudes better
be careful out there.

43
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,850
It's a night
of ghouls and goblins,

44
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,422
not to mention...

45
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:33,784
The summerween trickster.

46
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:37,928
The summer what
what-what?

47
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:39,630
The trickster
goes door to door,

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,492
so the legend goes,
eating children

49
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:44,164
who lack
the summerween spirit.

50
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,766
Well, you don't have
to worry about us.

51
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,199
We've got
spirit to go around.

52
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,901
( Hacking and coughing )
oh, what is this stuff?

53
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,843
I've never even heard
of these brands.

54
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:54,275
Sand pop?

55
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,806
Gummy chairs?

56
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:57,908
Mr. adequate bar?

57
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:01,312
This is all
cheapo loser candy!

58
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:03,183
Quiet your discontent,
children,

59
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,356
lest the trickster overhear.

60
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:08,219
Your cape is caught
in your fly, Soos.

61
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,591
Touchг©.
( nom nom )

62
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,763
Goodbye, loser candy!

63
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:15,666
( Sinister breathing )

64
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,398
( Doorbell rings )
Stan: Trick-or-treaters!

65
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,930
Quick, give 'em
that terrible candy!

66
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,573
Happy summer--

67
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:24,375
wha--?!
'sup, squirt?

68
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,536
Hey, Dipper.

69
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:27,278
Wendy! ha ha ha!

70
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:29,209
Ow! wh--
what's up, guys?

71
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,281
Ugh! I left my jacket
here, again.

72
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,583
Hey, what's
with the candy?

73
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,745
You goin' trick-
or-treating or something?

74
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:36,216
Well, actually, I, uh...

75
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,949
Shut up, Robbie.
Of course he's not
going trick-or-treating.

76
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:41,292
No, yeah, uh...
( Nervous chuckle )

77
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:43,794
Trick-or-treating
is for babies...

78
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:45,326
I guess.

79
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,797
You should come
to this party with us.

80
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:48,259
Tambry's parents
are out of town,

81
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,960
and it's gonna be
off the chain!

82
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,363
Not surprised you
didn't hear about it.

83
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:55,235
В™єв™є

84
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,470
hey, guys, wait!

85
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,811
Maybe I'll see you
at the party.

86
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:02,543
If you're not too busy
playing dress-up.

87
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,916
( Audible blow )
it's at nine!
Don't forget!

88
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:14,985
( Sighs )
what am I gonna
tell Mabel?

89
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:16,727
( Distant wolf howls )

90
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:19,290
Uncle Stan, these are
my best friends...

91
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,592
Candy and grenda!
I am so sweet,
i could eat myself.

92
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:24,264
( Unusual, raspy voice )
hello, Mr. pines.

93
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,296
You got a cold, honey?

94
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:27,338
Something wrong
with your voice there?

95
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:29,340
What do you mean?
Why would you say that?

96
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,842
Is waddles
coming with us?

97
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:33,844
I wish he could, but...
He's got some

98
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:36,577
very important
meetings to attend!

99
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,450
( Grunting )

100
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,452
File these documents
under "i,"

101
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:43,784
for "i have a curly tail!"

102
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,286
( All laughing )
what about your brother?

103
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,289
Oh, man, guys,
just wait until you
see Dipper's costume.

104
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,422
It's amazing!

105
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:52,563
Here he comes now.

106
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:57,598
That is a very good
Dipper costume.

107
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,401
What the hey-hey,
bro-bro? Where's
your costume?

108
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,802
Look, I can't go
trick-or-treating.

109
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,376
I'm, uh, really sick.
( Coughing )

110
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:08,409
Must have been
that bad candy.
You go on without me.

111
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,382
Fight through it,
man! Where's your
summerween spirit?

112
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:13,013
( Pounding on door )

113
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,347
Trick or treat.

114
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,090
Dude, really?

115
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,592
You're a little old
for this, man. Sorry.

116
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:23,354
But wait. I'm...!

117
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:24,995
Why'd you close the door?
I told you, Mabel...

118
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,828
I'm just not feeling
it tonight. ( Coughing )

119
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,531
I think a little
trick-or-treating
will make you feel better.

120
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,333
I'm not trick-or-treating.
( Pounding on door )

121
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,106
Look, man, just go
to another house!

122
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:39,339
Dipper, where's your
summerween hospitality?

123
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,871
( Pounding on door )
I'm not getting that.

124
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:42,342
Well, I am.

125
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,875
I apologize
for my brother.

126
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,117
He came down with a case
of the grumpy grumps.

127
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:48,449
Silence!

128
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,423
You have insulted me,
and for this you must pay...

129
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:54,485
With your lives!

130
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:57,357
Ohh! what a cute
little mask.

131
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,359
You're a funny guy,
aren't you?

132
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,032
Funny am I?

133
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:03,394
"Twick-or-tweat"!

134
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:05,866
My name is gorney!

135
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,098
Aah! remember me!

136
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:09,970
( All scream )
gorney!

137
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,403
There's only one way
for you

138
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,475
to avoid his fate--

139
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,707
I need a treat.

140
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:21,051
If you can collect
500 pieces of candy

141
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:22,583
and bring it to me
before the last

142
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,416
Jack-o'-melon goes out...

143
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,887
( Blows )

144
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,089
I will let you live.

145
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,962
Five hundred treats
in one night?
That's impossible!

146
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:34,024
The choice is yours,
children.

147
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,597
You must
trick-or-treat...

148
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,098
Or die!

149
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,572
( Sinister laughter )

150
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:46,477
Oh, my gosh, Mabel,
do you know what this means?

151
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:47,908
I do.

152
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,080
( Happily ) it means
you have to come
trick-or-treating!

153
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,612
Yay!

154
00:06:54,985 --> 00:06:56,687
Who was that guy?

155
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,849
It's the legend
Soos told us about.

156
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,020
It's true!

157
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,752
What do we do,
what do we do?

158
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:03,193
What's going on
out here, dudes?

159
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:04,695
I heard a ruckus.
( Chuckles )

160
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:06,426
That's a funny word--
"ruckus."

161
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,629
Soos, a monster is making
us trick-or-treat,

162
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,860
or else he's gonna eat us.

163
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,162
I got a picture.

164
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:13,634
The summerween trickster!

165
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:17,067
Oh, man, dude, you guys
are in crazy bonkers trouble.

166
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,069
How are we gonna get
that much candy in one night?

167
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,210
There's no way!

168
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,172
( Claps )
listen up, people!

169
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:24,144
Now, some might say
that being cursed

170
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,217
by a bloodthirsty holiday
monster is a bad thing...

171
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:28,779
I wet myself!

172
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,081
But that monster messed
with the wrong crew.

173
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:33,954
With candy's spirit,
grenda's strength,

174
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,626
Dipper's brains, and...

175
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,758
( Awkwardly )
Soos, here...

176
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:41,061
We'll get 500 pieces
of candy and have fun
doing it, too,

177
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,933
even if it takes all night!

178
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:45,536
( All exclaiming )

179
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:47,067
Mabel: to the streets!

180
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,702
All night?

181
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:54,805
But-- but I'm sick,
remember? ( Coughing )

182
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:56,106
Dipper, what's worse--

183
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:58,609
getting eaten by
a horrifying monster,

184
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,180
or going trick-or-treating
with us?

185
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,612
Well...

186
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:03,083
Come on!
Aah!

187
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:06,216
Ah, summerween!

188
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:08,218
Those kids aren't gonna
know what hit 'em!

189
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,562
( Cackling )

190
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:12,723
( Doorbell rings )

191
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,665
Trick-or-treat!

192
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:17,167
( Laughing )
what can I do for--!

193
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:21,101
Oh! oh, no! No!
( Screaming )

194
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,174
( Screaming )

195
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:26,707
( Laughing )
huh?

196
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,238
Can we have candy now?

197
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:29,980
What's the matter
with you kids?

198
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,142
That was the scariest
thing you've ever seen, right?

199
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,887
Well, have you seen...
This?

200
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:40,691
( Comedic screaming )
guts! Very real guts!

201
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:43,153
Uh... we've been
watching horror movies

202
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:45,856
since we were, like,
two years old.

203
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:48,228
Yeah, we're not scared.

204
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,200
Oh, you will be.

205
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,903
You will be.

206
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:56,867
( Overlapping chatter )

207
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,840
For glory,
my children! Charge!

208
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,212
You make a great me.

209
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:04,214
No, you make a great me!

210
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:07,217
No, you do! Heh heh!

211
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:10,280
I don't understand why
we can't just buy our
candy and be done with it.

212
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,624
That sort of
takes the fun out of
"trick-or-treat or die."

213
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:16,156
I'm trying to
take the "die" out of
"trick-or-treat or die."

214
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,889
( Doorbell rings )
all: Trick-or-treat!

215
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,131
Well, aren't you
just the cutest!

216
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:22,833
And is everyone
in costume?

217
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,264
Oh, good!

218
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,697
Wonderful!
happy summerween!

219
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:28,739
Trick-or-treat!

220
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,300
And is everybody in costume?

221
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,243
Chimney sweep,
elephant man,

222
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:36,747
squeegee, ant farm.

223
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,749
Oh, and what are you
supposed to be?

224
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,881
Uh, actually, I'm not
dressed up as anything.

225
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,753
We-- we're kind of
in a hurry here.

226
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:44,584
Oh. I see.

227
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:49,159
В™єв™є

228
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,320
enjoy!

229
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:54,164
One piece of black licorice?

230
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:57,127
Circus peanut!
This is loser candy!

231
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:58,829
Four pieces of candy?

232
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:00,100
This is gonna take forever.

233
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,102
We've gotta
up our game, Dipper.

234
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,934
You gotta
put on your costume.

235
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:06,837
I told you, I'm not
up to it, Mabel.

236
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:08,178
Oh, really?

237
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:10,380
В™єв™є

238
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:13,313
hmm.

239
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,815
I've seen better.

240
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:19,820
Tick tock.
( Blows )

241
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:27,327
So, what was that
about being too sick
to wear a costume?

242
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,999
( Sighs )

243
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,934
Both: we want candy!
We want candy!

244
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,266
All right,
you got me, kids.

245
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,307
You guys win.

246
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:39,710
I guess I'm not
that scary, you know?

247
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,372
You've-- you--
oh, no!

248
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:45,245
( Screaming and squealing )

249
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:50,250
Why? why is there a pig
jumping out of my chest?

250
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:54,985
Candy.
can-Dee!

251
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,691
What scares
you two freaks?

252
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,094
Here, watch this.

253
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:06,436
What? what is this,
some kind of--

254
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:08,298
some kind of kitten or...?

255
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:11,441
Aah, aah, aah!

256
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:13,143
( Both laughing )

257
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:14,805
( Gasping )

258
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,149
What happened to you,
Stan pines?

259
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,911
What happened?

260
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:23,453
Introducing, for the first
time in public...

261
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:26,887
В™є tah-dah! В™є
peanut butter and jelly!

262
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,219
Both: awww!

263
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:31,421
I will make you
Internet-famous!

264
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:33,263
Hey, erase that.

265
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,465
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

266
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:38,298
All:
over with! Over with!

267
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:42,402
( Doorbell rings )
do you really think
this will make a difference?

268
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,774
( Man grunts )

269
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:45,475
В™є tah tah tah,
tah-tah-tah-tah в™є

270
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:47,277

00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:51,341
в™єв™є

272
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:54,084
( both laughing )

273
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,448
Let's get that candy, guys!

274
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:01,121
Thirty-four...
thirty-five...

275
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,422
Thirty-six.

276
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,054
You see? Because...
Yeah, I get it.

277
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,899
Twenty-two, twenty-three,
twenty-four...

278
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,230
A hundred and twenty-four!

279
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,401
( Blows )

280
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,507
Come on, come on!

281
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,469
( Doorbell rings )

282
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:20,510
Hello!

283
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,513
( All shriek )
what a horrible mask!

284
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:25,275
That's just my face.

285
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:27,217
This is a mask!

286
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:28,478
Ohhh!

287
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:31,281
( Overlapping chatter )
Soos: It's actually better.

288
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:32,853
Urr...!

289
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,525
( Doorbell rings )

290
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:37,387
Four ninety-eight,
four ninety-nine!

291
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,829
We did it!

292
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:40,330
( All celebrating )

293
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,863
All we need is one more
piece of candy.

294
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,865
And it's only 8:30.
Perfect timing!

295
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,767
Yeah, and your cough
went away, too!

296
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,840
Dude, I'm gonna go around
and grab the truck.

297
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,501
Soos away!

298
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:54,344
Last one to the final house
is a pair of wax lips!

299
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,176
Not me! No!

300
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,247
Ah!

301
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:59,109
The perfect time
to go to Wendy's party,

302
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:02,012
and no one needs to know
i was trick-or-treating.

303
00:13:04,454 --> 00:13:07,517
( Panicky gasping )

304
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:10,190
Hey, Dipper!

305
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,022
Oh, hey, Wendy.

306
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:13,994
What's up?

307
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,325
Are you coming
to the party?

308
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,496
What are you doin'
out here?

309
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,198
Oh, I'm--
I'm on my way.

310
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,530
I like watching
the trick-or-treaters.

311
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,833
Reminds me of when
i was a kid.

312
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,434
Okay, then.
You're coming, right?

313
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:25,936
Definitely, definitely.

314
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:28,278
Cool. see ya there.

315
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:29,409
Later, guys.

316
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,042
You're going to a party.

317
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,084
Well-- well, hey, i--
aah!

318
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:35,515
That's why you were
acting so weird

319
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,217
and trying to hurry us.

320
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,448
You're not sick at all,

321
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:40,450
so if it wasn't for
this crazy monster,

322
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,222
you were gonna ditch me...

323
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,856
On our favorite holiday!
( Both gasp )

324
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,229
What happened to the Dipper
who used to love Halloween?

325
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,601
And where's all the candy?

326
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:53,033
Relax, relax.

327
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,405
I left it right here,
behind this bush.

328
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:56,937
Oh, no!

329
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:00,010
( All gasping )

330
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,542
What did you do?
Well, i-- i--!

331
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,444
Uh... guys?

332
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,517
Mabel: oh, no!

333
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,549
All the Jack-o'-melons
are out!

334
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,580
Look!

335
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,282
Heh heh heh!

336
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:14,554
Good night!
( Inhaling )

337
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,027
( All gasp )
stop!
What?

338
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:18,488
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't, don't, don't!

339
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:19,859
Huh? what's happening?

340
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,391
Just don't blow out
that candle.

341
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:22,632
What?!

342
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:25,265
Don't blow out
that candle!

343
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,337
I'm old man mcgucket!

344
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:29,339
( Inhales )
wait!

345
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:30,500
Sorry!

346
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,505
( Monkey-like sounds )

347
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:37,407
Whoo, that was close.

348
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:39,349
( All sigh )

349
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,481
Uh-oh.

350
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:49,359
Knock-knock.

351
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,926
So, children...

352
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:57,968
Where's my candy?

353
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:00,170
I swear, we had
all 500 pieces!

354
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,972
Look, it's
down there somewhere.

355
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:03,173
We can still get it.

356
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:07,637
I'm afraid it's too late!

357
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:09,940
That was your last chance.

358
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,982
( Audibly exerts )

359
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,947
( Laughing )

360
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:20,690
Go! go, go, go!
( Sinister laughter )

361
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,693
( Shrieking )

362
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:26,026
Aah! Dipper!
Mabel!

363
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,029
( Monstrous laughter )

364
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,961
( Shrieking )

365
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:33,433
We're alive! Yeah!

366
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,235
( Tires squeal )

367
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,037
Whoa!
Soos!

368
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,939
That wasn't, like,
a regular pedestrian,
was it?

369
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,241
It was the monster.

370
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,472
Thanks, Soos.

371
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:44,144
I'm just glad it's over.

372
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,315
Right?

373
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:49,449
Did everyone remember
to put on their seatbelts?

374
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,620
Yes.
yes.
yes.

375
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:54,084
Let's go.

376
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,129
Hey, are you okay?

377
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:01,491
There are probably
some bandages back
at the shack.

378
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:07,667
Uh...

379
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,399
Guys?

380
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,144
Raaahhh!

381
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:16,176
( All screaming )

382
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,748
( Sinister laughter )

383
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,754
Brakes, brakes, brakes!

384
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:28,288
( Tires squealing )
( All shouting )

385
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,163
( Coughing, then gasping )

386
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:35,565
We have to hide!

387
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,732
It's blocking
the only exit.

388
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:51,541
Everyone stay quiet.

389
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,743
Oh, now you're worried
about the monster!

390
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:56,686
I thought all you
cared about was Wendy.

391
00:16:56,686 --> 00:16:59,749
Mabel, you know
that's not true.

392
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:02,292
I just-- I felt like I was
getting a little too old

393
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,653
to go trick-or-treating.

394
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,095
That's exactly why we need

395
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:07,097
to go trick-or-treating,
Dipper.

396
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:08,128
We're getting older.

397
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,460
There's not that many
halloweens left.

398
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,202
( Sighs )

399
00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:15,765
I guess I didn't realize
it was already our last one.

400
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:20,340
( Monstrous roar )

401
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,442
We have to escape.
What if it sees us?

402
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,144
If only there was something
we could use to cover

403
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,215
our bodies and faces with--

404
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:28,578
you know, like a disguise
of some kind.

405
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:32,822
( Monstrous breathing )

406
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,333
This way!

407
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,266
Almost there!

408
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,337
Soos!

409
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:51,301
Stop!

410
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:52,802
Soos, don't you dare!

411
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,474
Sorry, dude, today's
been way stressful.

412
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,346
I need some levity.

413
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,180
( Silence )

414
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,082
Oh, thank goodness.
It was out of batteries.

415
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,454
Soos! no!
( Gasps )

416
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:06,316
( Audibly straining )

417
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,821
No matter the score,
I'm always "a head"!

418
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:13,493
( Cackling )

419
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,766
( Guffaws )
this cackling head's
the voice of a generation.

420
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:18,128
Wha--?

421
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:20,830
( Cackling )

422
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:25,104
Hey, monster!

423
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,336
Hiyah!

424
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:28,438
Aaahhhh!

425
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,385
( Audibly exerts )

426
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:37,847
Salt water Taffy?
Gross!

427
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:41,191
What are you--?
Wait, it is!

428
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:43,653
You really haven't
figured it out yet?

429
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:45,195
Aah!

430
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:47,227
( Crying out )

431
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:50,260
Don't you recognize me?
Look at my face.

432
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,204
Look closely.

433
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:56,636
( Both gasp )
loser candy!

434
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,538
That's right.
Did you ever stop and think

435
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,870
about the candy
at the bottom of the bag

436
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,343
that no one likes?

437
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,875
Every year, the children
of gravity falls

438
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,348
throw away all
of the rejected candy

439
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,220
into the dump.

440
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:14,524
So I seek revenge--

441
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:18,828
revenge on the picky
children who cast me aside.

442
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:21,761
I'm made of every tossed
piece of black licorice,

443
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,434
every discarded bar
of old chocolate

444
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:27,237
with, like, that
white powder stuff on it.

445
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:28,368
You know that stuff?

446
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,799
I hate that stuff!

447
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,401
No one would eat me!

448
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:34,804
But now, I'm going
to eat you!

449
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:36,276
Aaahhh!

450
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,177
I'm gonna eat... ohh!

451
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,949
What is that?
( Groaning )

452
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,415
'Sup, bro?

453
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:48,518
( Shrieking )

454
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:51,221
( Groans )

455
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:52,862
Mm. dudes, you want
some of this?

456
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,799
Wait. you actually
think I taste good?

457
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,431
Uh, sure. You know.

458
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:06,636
All I've ever wanted
is for someone to say
that I was good.

459
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:09,279
( Weak laughter )

460
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,312
I'm so happy!

461
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,644
The crying makes it
a little weird, but...

462
00:20:14,644 --> 00:20:17,447
I guess I'm still eating.

463
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:19,289
'Sup, gorney?

464
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,322
I've been "twaumatized"!

465
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,424
В™єв™є

466
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,856
now what?
Let's get our candy already.

467
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,862
Old dude! Old dude!

468
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:36,536
Ahh.

469
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:40,770
Wash off the shame, Stan,
wash off the shame.

470
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,313
Ha! he thought
he could scare us!

471
00:20:43,313 --> 00:20:45,315
( Both gasp )

472
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:46,476
Heh? what's that?

473
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:50,720
( Both screaming )

474
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,523
( Triumphal laughter )

475
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:54,784
Still got it.

476
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,587
Hey, Stan.
Hi, uncle Stan.

477
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:59,429
Hello, Mr. pines.
Hello, Mr. pines.

478
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,431
How's it hangin'?
Hey, Dipper.

479
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:03,933
Wendy!
i didn't see you
at the party.
Where where you?

480
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,795
Uh, I, uh...

481
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:09,369
I was trick-or-treating...

482
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,700
With my sister.

483
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,372
Yeah.

484
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,043
Mm. party was lame,
anyway.

485
00:21:14,043 --> 00:21:16,646
Robbie ate a lollipop
stick first and had
to go home sick.

486
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,478
( Snickering )
aw, man.

487
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,310
We went to every
single house,

488
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,612
and we didn't even
get to eat any candy!

489
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:23,783
Candy?

490
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,986
How's that for candy!

491
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,460
And now back to
the fear guy from
terror town street!

492
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,494
( Comical screams )

493
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:48,037
You know, kids,
i been thinking--

494
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:50,410
at the end of the day,
summerween isn't about candy,

495
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,312
or costumes,
or even scary people.

496
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,614
It's a day when
the whole family

497
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,085
can get together
in one place

498
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:59,088
and celebrate
what really matters--

499
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:01,391
pure evil!

500
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,553
( Sinister laughter )

501
00:22:03,553 --> 00:22:05,725
( All laughing )

502
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:10,560
( Sudden silence )
i ate a man alive tonight.

503
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,603
( Oinking softly )

504
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:14,834
( Camera shutter clicks )

505
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,437
( Laughter )

506
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,439
( Dolly parton singing
"nine to five" )
