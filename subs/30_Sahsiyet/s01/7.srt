2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,040
Remember...

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,480
I just turned 65.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,160
I made a wish on my birthday.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,160
Just like a child would...

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,920
Another impossible wish, of course.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,880
You know what I wished for?

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,160
To be a good man.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,520
You know me.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,280
I do.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,760
You're a good man.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,640
KILL

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,640
Nesrin, pulling a gun is so different
than to pulling the trigger.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,320
You couldn't find any of this footage
on the internet or on TV.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
Welcome to the fan club
of the first real Turkish serial killer.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,760
Do whatever it takes, but stop them.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,880
Tufan Elibol, whom
the killer used to throw us off his track

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,520
will be instrumental in catching him.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,960
The killer will be a victim
to his own game.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,280
Go on, get out.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,680
Clouds foaming overhead.

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,240
The sea within, the sea without.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,680
I'm a walnut tree in Gülhane Park.

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Neither you realize this...

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,200
Nor the police.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,800
I MET A GIRL TODAY
HER NAME IS NEVRA ELMAS

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,680
I TRUST ONLY HER
BECAUSE NEVRA GETS ME

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,520
IT IS NEVRA'S BIRTHDAY TODAY
I GOT HER A PRESENT

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,320
NEVRA AND I HAVE A SECRET

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,960
I TOLD NEVRA EVERYTHING
BUT SHE WON'T BELIEVE ME

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,840
TONIGHT, A STAR FELL FROM THE SKY

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,440
I MADE A WISH

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,760
I WISHED THAT THEY ALL DIE

34
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,120
-They're all dead.
-All?

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,560
Ufuk had two brothers.

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,480
One of them was shot at his workplace.
The other one in the forest.

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,880
Our guy?

38
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,800
-Messages on both their foreheads.
-Their father's outside.

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,960
Came to pick them up,
waiting on paperwork.

40
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
He can't. We need to do an autopsy.

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,760
I couldn't tell him.
I could never tell him.

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,640
Come on! Come on!

43
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,880
I'll tell him.

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,560
Son!

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,760
You killed them!

46
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,400
-You killed my children!
-Salih...

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
-Salih, please don't.
-You killed my babies!

48
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,160
You ended them! You ended my babies.

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,280
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now, Nevra?

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,000
-Did you get what you wanted?
-Shut up!

51
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,000
If you had been looking for the killer
instead of going after Ufuk.

52
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,480
-They both would be alive now.
-Shut up!

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,600
Tell me I'm lying!

54
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,080
Damn!

55
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,360
I want to die!

56
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,480
What happened to me?

57
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,000
We had to pump your stomach, Zuhal.

58
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Why?

59
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,160
What happened?

60
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,520
You had alcohol poisoning
when you arrived.

61
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,360
Nevra?

62
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,120
Nevra, what are you doing?

63
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,880
It's fine. I had a nosebleed.
I got blood on my sleeve.

64
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,360
-Are you alright, daughter?
-I'm not.

65
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,360
I'm not alright at all.

66
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,840
You are sad about Ufuk, right? Poor boy.

67
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm powerless.

68
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,240
People are dying around me,
and I'm powerless!

69
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,400
It's driving me mad!

70
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,480
I try to control myself.

71
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,280
I tense every muscle in my body
just so nobody suspects anything.

72
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,760
Suspect what?

73
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,440
That I'm afraid.
That I'm afraid. I'm so afraid.

74
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,920
I'm afraid that I'm never
going to catch the killer!

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,040
I'm so afraid!

76
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
I'm so afraid...

77
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm so afraid...

78
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,800
Nevra, my darling...

79
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,360
It was so hard,
not crying in front of the crowd.

80
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,880
I ran and I ran, and here I am.

81
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
My darling...
Just like when you were a child.

82
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,120
You'd run home, about to piss your pants.

83
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,960
You'd barely make it.

84
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,040
Are you feeling better?

85
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,280
Yes. I think.

86
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,360
-Don't be afraid, Nevra.
-Mom...

87
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,560
Hush.

88
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,200
Don't be afraid.

89
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,640
Don't be afraid to be afraid.

90
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,560
Plus... So what?

91
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,720
I'm afraid, as well.

92
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,040
You're never afraid.

93
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,720
That was then.

94
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm so scared that
something will to happen to you.

95
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,440
Come on, I'll wash it.

96
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
And...

97
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,440
They can't even get a bloodstain out...

98
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,680
Yet they go become cops.

99
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,560
Some cop you are.

100
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,120
-Someone sent you flowers, Zuhal.
-Who?

101
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,240
-Me.
-You can leave when you're feeling better.

102
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,200
-You didn't go?
-No.

103
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,360
You were here through the night?

104
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,680
Hello?

105
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,160
Yes, I'm here.

106
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,320
I have the file.

107
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,880
Where are you?

108
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,880
Hello?

109
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,400
Hello? You're breaking up. Hello?

110
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,440
Cemil, I'm so sorry.

111
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,680
I'm so embarrassed.
I don't know what to say.

112
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,800
I can't even imagine the spot
I put you in.

113
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,680
I should quit the job.

114
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,840
What am I to do, Cemil?

115
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,920
WATER IT TWICE A WEEK

116
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,240
Water it twice a week...

117
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,840
And come with me. Let's go.

118
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,960
-What will you do now?
-Get back to Istanbul.

119
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
I need to ask you something.

120
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,840
Why did you lie, Selim and you?

121
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,760
About how the house burned down.

122
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,160
Why would I lie?

123
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,560
I already told you.

124
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,200
Selim forgets to take his pills
and hallucinates.

125
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,800
-That's all.
-Fine. If you say so.

126
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,680
Why wouldn't I tell you
if I knew something?

127
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,040
There's something that scares you.
I'd forgotten about it.

128
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,600
What's that?

129
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,200
You're scared of being left alone.
You always were.

130
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,720
What would you do
if something were to happen to Selim?

131
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,080
If you knew that
I was scared of being left alone,

132
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,720
why did you up and leave?

133
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,200
You didn't take me to Istanbul.

134
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,400
You were being scared of loneliness,
and I was scared of you.

135
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,720
Fine! Then don't come here
with tears in your eyes ever again.

136
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,360
Why shouldn't I? Didn't you tell me
not to be afraid of being afraid?

137
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,520
Take care.

138
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,080
Hello?

139
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,480
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

140
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,520
Hello?

141
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Hello?

142
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,480
The door is opening.

143
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
Stop! Stop!

144
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,240
Call the police! Call the police, Galip!

145
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,440
-Are you alright?
-Take your gun.

146
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,480
Are you alright?

147
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,120
-What happened? Did they find him?
-I just got word.

148
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,440
He's trapped
in a shopping centre's garage.

149
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Yes. We have all the exits blocked.

150
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,800
This is the only exit.
He's definitely in here.

151
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,920
Let's go!

152
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,640
I found his costume.
He's going up to the roof!

153
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
To be honest...

154
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,280
I don't even like
the taste of alcohol, Cemil.

155
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,560
But after I have that first glass...

156
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,160
Something happens...

157
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I can't stop myself.

158
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,040
All I want to do is drink.

159
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,560
No matter what.

160
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,200
Come what may.

161
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,960
"All I need right now is a drink.
Just let me have one more drink."

162
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,120
I can't stop myself.

163
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,240
There this writer called Bukowski,
you might've heard of him.

164
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,520
You know what he said?

165
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,760
He said drinking is a form of suicide.

166
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,040
He said drinking yourself unconscious
is attempted suicide.

167
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,800
-I don't want to die, Cemil.
-Are you sure?

168
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,240
Of course I am.
I don't even want to talk about this.

169
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,640
Talking about this with you
is such an embarrassment for me.

170
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,440
Hurting someone else
is embarrassing, Zuhal.

171
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,000
There's nothing embarrassing
about having hurt yourself.

172
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,920
You have enough problems as it is.

173
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,520
-Would you like to leave?
-No.

174
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,000
-We should stay.
-Alright.

175
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,360
I should tell you why we're here, then.

176
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,280
There was this elder in Kambura. Turan.

177
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,360
He took me aside one day
and told me I wasn't the first.

178
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,800
I asked him what he meant.

179
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,680
"You're not the first boy whose education
the Kamburan people paid for.

180
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,280
They paid for three more children
before you." he said.

181
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,720
I was surprised.

182
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,080
I asked him where they were,
what they did now.

183
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,000
They paid for the first one's education.
He said he was a good student.

184
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,520
Finished college. Started a business.
Made a lot of money.

185
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,400
But he forgot about Kambura.

186
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,040
He never went back to Kambura.

187
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,080
He said they sometimes saw him on TV,
but changed the channel immediately.

188
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
There was a second boy.
They paid for his education, as well.

189
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,640
"He finished college,

190
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
and we sent him to London
for a graduate degree."

191
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,560
But he became a gambler.

192
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,120
All that money that
the Kamburans scraped together...

193
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,480
He lost it all on roulette.

194
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,120
Apparently, he was jailed at some point.

195
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,360
After that, no one saw him

196
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,200
or heard of him ever again.

197
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,320
Their one last hope...

198
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,440
They paid for one last boy's education.

199
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,240
He got into medical school.

200
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
But he started drinking.

201
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,520
I met him, actually.

202
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,200
Rahim was his name.

203
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,640
Five-six years older than I was.

204
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,280
I went up to him...

205
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,560
"Rahim,

206
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,560
a whole village depends on you."

207
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,880
"You'll become a doctor

208
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,560
and cure the people who raised you."

209
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,320
You know what he said to me?

210
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,360
He told me they never asked him
if he wanted an education.

211
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,480
Told me they should educate themselves.

212
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,880
It was right here
that I had that conversation

213
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,720
with Rahim, Zuhal.

214
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,240
He was an intern at this hospital.

215
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,000
He came down here to drink in secret.

216
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,240
Now...

217
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
I'll tell you why we're here.

218
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,080
You're going to make a decision.

219
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,440
I never saw Rahim's face again.

220
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,280
Will I get to see yours?

221
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,720
My father never asked me, either, Cemil.

222
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,880
He never asked me anything.

223
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,640
Never asked me
if I wanted to go to boarding school.

224
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,800
If I wanted to go to college...

225
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,160
He was always so distant.

226
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,400
I told him I was moving to Australia.

227
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,000
"Farewell," he said.

228
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,840
I was so lonely.

229
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,920
I sometimes look at my photos
from those days.

230
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,360
I'm always by myself.

231
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
In the photos,

232
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,320
there are beautiful landscapes.

233
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,560
Beautiful bridges...

234
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,680
Statues...

235
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,520
And me...

236
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,520
Just me...

237
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,080
You know what I'd actually like?

238
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,240
I want the photos...

239
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,080
I want the photos to have my mom in them.

240
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,280
I want my mom, my dad and I together.

241
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,960
I want nothing else in the photos.

242
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,280
I want nothing else.

243
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,720
Even if we're in front of the best view,

244
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,360
in the most beautiful place in the world,

245
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,040
I want all of it gone.
I want us and only us to remain.

246
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,800
Because...

247
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,320
We'd be enough for each other.

248
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,960
But it didn't turn out that way.

249
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,320
I'd remember.

250
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,360
Even if
there were nothing else in the photos,

251
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,200
I'd look at my mom and dad's faces,

252
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,800
and I'd know that

253
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,360
we were standing
in front of a huge waterfall.

254
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,640
I know it's not in the photo,

255
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,520
but we're
standing by a huge sycamore tree.

256
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,000
That would be enough for me. But...

257
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,840
But it was never like that. Never.

258
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,760
The photos have only me in them.

259
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,400
And the setting sun.

260
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
The setting sun.

261
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,280
The sun.

262
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,320
There it is, always.

263
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
But it's setting.

264
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,240
I...

265
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
I've never been able to forgive
my father, Cemil.

266
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,520
-He must've had a reason.
-I wish he'd shared it with me.

267
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,160
-Let's go, Cemil. Let's get out of here?
-Sure. Let's go. However...

268
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,840
I need you to make me a promise.

269
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,360
-I promise never to drink again.
-No. It's not that.

270
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,040
It's something else.

271
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,800
Promise me you'll never forget
this place. And this smell.

272
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,240
I do. I promise. I'll never forget it.

273
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,320
Your father looked after me.
It's my turn to look after you now.

274
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,560
That's nonsense.

275
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,080
My job is to look after you.

276
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,480
-That's nonsense.
-No.

277
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,440
That's different.

278
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,640
Answer me this one question.

279
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,560
Is there room for me in that photo?

280
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,960
Cemil?

281
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,040
We're done here.

282
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,200
-Are you alright? Are you cold?
-I'm fine. A bit cold, maybe.

283
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,000
-Don't worry. You'll get over it.
-Thank you so much.

284
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,920
There's this writer.

285
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,880
Named Coubert...

286
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,840
He said that...

287
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,560
Love is the only adventure left
on this earth.

288
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,240
That's what he says.

289
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,640
I see.

290
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,320
MORGUE

291
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,240
This is a joke, right?

292
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,200
There's only one entrance
and one exit to the garage.

293
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,680
But there's no one inside...

294
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,480
With your permission,

295
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,520
I'd like to take this
to the lab for DNA analysis.

296
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,280
Sure, take it.

297
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,240
Is Nevra around?

298
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,400
Yeah. She's here.

299
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,320
I want to ask you something.

300
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,560
Do you know what's the most
dangerous thing for a murder specialist?

301
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,080
Obsession.

302
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,840
You get an idea.

303
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,400
Then you start believing it.
It takes hold in your mind.

304
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,240
Then it turns into an obsession.
It blinds you.

305
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
You can always have theories, of course.

306
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,160
But do you know the difference
between a theory and a conspiracy?

307
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll tell you that, as well.

308
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,880
Theories are smart.

309
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Conspiracy theories are sicknesses.

310
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,560
Because the evidence
for a theory is rooted in truth.

311
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,920
But the evidence for a conspiracy
is another conspiracy theory.

312
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,440
Itself, in other words.

313
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,920
It's right even when it's wrong.

314
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,760
A conspiracy theory is never wrong.

315
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,400
You know who else is never wrong?

316
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,120
Dumb people.

317
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,600
Don't get me wrong. I'm not only talking
about you, talking about myself, as well.

318
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,720
That's why we're going to build
a perimeter of logic together.

319
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,520
We'll keep running into each other.
Until we find the truth.

320
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,920
We will consider every single possibility.

321
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,360
Even the possibility that none of this
has anything to do with Kambura.

322
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,680
-Who is it?
-He didn't have an ID on him.

323
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,520
I didn't talk to him.
I waited for you to arrive, Cemil.

324
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,480
Good. Let's find out
what's his problem with Kambura.

325
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
By the way...

326
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,800
You should be glad
that Ufuk handled himself.

327
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,240
Yes, Cemil. We couldn't stop him, sadly.

328
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,760
You made up for it, though.

329
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,880
-Sir, his connection to the victim...
-Nevra...

330
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,440
-Are you talking about the house?
-Yes.

331
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,080
Nevra, we went there. You read the report.

332
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,760
Nobody burned it.

333
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't believe that report.

334
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,480
-Is that so?
-Yes.

335
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,880
On what grounds? Your mom's husband?
What was his name?

336
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Selim.

337
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,560
What about what Ufuk told us?
His brothers were killed.

338
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,600
You went there to interrogate Ufuk
and utter chaos took over.

339
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,400
I got calls from the ministry
asking what's going on in Kambura.

340
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,720
I swear I don't know anything
about Kambura.

341
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,480
I don't even know where it is!

342
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,880
I swear I'm not him!

343
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,400
Please don't!

344
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Speak! Why did you kill
all those people? Speak!

345
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,040
But sir, we also know

346
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,280
that the deceased Naz Çörtük
is also connected to Kambura.

347
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,440
-She worked in the municipality office.
-Sure, but when?

348
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Twenty years ago? Forty years ago? When?

349
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,200
-Please don't! Please don't!
-Tell me who you are.

350
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,640
What did you want from those people?
Why did you shoot that women? Why?

351
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,880
They'll kill me!
They'll put me in the ground!

352
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,760
I'm the one who'll put you in the ground!

353
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,680
I'll bury you so deep
that no one will see you ever again.

354
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,600
Alright! How about this?

355
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,920
I got a call from narcotics today.

356
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,480
The woman who was killed in
the parking garage, you know who she is?

357
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,440
I know that she worked at
a logistics firm as an accountant.

358
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,840
Not even close.
There's no such logistics firm.

359
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,080
It's a front.
They were running drugs, Nevra.

360
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,480
Narcotics has been after them
for six months.

361
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,440
They convince the woman
to turn state's evidence.

362
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,120
They were supposed to meet today.

363
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,440
She went to the office to gather evidence.

364
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,440
But she's gone. So is the evidence.

365
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,360
Now. Do you still think...

366
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,680
That the murders are connected to Kambura?

367
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,840
I saw it in the papers.

368
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,440
A guy in a cat costume
was killing people after people!

369
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,760
The people I told you about
gave me the hit on the accountant woman.

370
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,440
I just got out of prison.

371
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,080
I couldn't go back in.
But I needed the money!

372
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,200
So I donned the cat costume.
I thought it would be a good idea.

373
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,360
He's killed four, five, so many people!

374
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,600
I thought I could pin it on him.

375
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,840
I thought it would be forgotten.
What will you do to me?

376
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,240
Please!

377
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,080
Please!

378
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,480
Why aren't you saying anything? Please!

379
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,040
Tell me how much you were paid,
you bastard. Tell me!

380
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,160
If all that isn't convincing enough,
here's the file on that Terazi guy.

381
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,440
Read his file.

382
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,680
What does it say?

383
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,560
Go ahead. Read it out loud.

384
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,280
-Post-traumatic stress disorder.
-That's right!

385
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,680
He was sick!

386
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,280
But what did I do?

387
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,040
I asked myself, "What if Nevra's right?"

388
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,320
What if they burned that house down?
What if that report was fake?

389
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,040
Then what happened today?

390
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,520
We found out that the woman who was killed
had nothing to do with Kambura.

391
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,400
What did I do? I accepted that.

392
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,080
Now, Nevra, I'm begging you...
It's your turn to accept it.

393
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,880
If you want to look for connections
between the victims, look elsewhere!

394
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,400
Forget about that burnt down house!

395
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,080
Listen, Nevra.

396
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,320
Sometimes things don't turn out
the way we expect them to.

397
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,360
We want them to be another way.
We imagine them to be. But they're not.

398
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,760
They're nothing but illusions.

399
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,840
Get out.

400
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,600
Then we get a phone call, and wake up.

401
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,920
Sir? Can I have that file?

402
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,360
I wasted my breath, didn't I?

403
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,560
You'll do what you want anyway.

404
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,600
Sure. Take it.

405
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,720
Do what you want.

406
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,080
I'm so glad we finally got to meet.

407
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,720
I've been telling him.

408
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,840
If you hadn't come to me,
I'd have come to you.

409
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,680
I was almost about to, in fact.
I even have your address!

410
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,640
As you might guess,

411
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,000
communication with patients'
families is a must for us.

412
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,560
Especially when it comes to
patients like your father.

413
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,280
It's very important
that the people close to them

414
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,760
get together to support them.

415
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,040
-Again, welcome, Zuhal.
-Thank you.

416
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,760
I have some questions prepared.

417
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,560
Let's move to the table
and I can begin asking them.

418
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,040
I hope you've been doing your homework.

419
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,120
Agah, I don't know why I said yes to this!

420
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,760
This is madness!
I have to tell your doctor the truth.

421
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,480
What will you tell him? Don't be silly.

422
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,800
-I can tell him it was all a joke.
-You can't do that. It's too late.

423
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,320
I'll tell him the truth, then.

424
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,520
I'll tell him Agah's daughter
is undergoing cancer treatment.

425
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,480
He thinks telling her will upset her.

426
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,800
He was worried that you might want to
visit his home, so we came up with this.

427
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,640
Gonca, my girl, please!

428
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,640
If you won't do it for me,
do it for Münir.

429
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,640
You've been his veterinarian for years.
You practically raised Münir!

430
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,120
Let's forget about that, even.
Zuhal is what's important here!

431
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,720
What would Zuhal do in her state
if she found out her father's sick?

432
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,280
You're a doctor of many years.

433
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,040
Could you take such a responsibility?

434
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,640
Don't you know how important optimism is
when it comes to cancer treatment?

435
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,080
But what next, Agah?
How long can we keep it up?

436
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,400
It's already done.
There's nothing to keep up.

437
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,720
He has your number.
He might call you once, if that.

438
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,920
You'll just nod your head
and be done with it.

439
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,800
It was so embarrassing,
having to lie. I'm terrible at it.

440
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,840
-Do you think he could tell?
-Of course not!

441
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,040
You were such a great actor!
I'm sure he'd never even suspect you.

442
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,520
I'll do whatever you want from me now.

443
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't want to go through this again.

444
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,240
And I hope Zuhal gets her health back.

445
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,240
Amen. Thank you.

446
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,760
-I could give you a ride.
-It's fine, really.

447
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,120
Alright. Alright, then. Thank you so much.

448
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,560
You were great in there.
You deserved an Oscar, I'm telling you.

449
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,800
Ali, I need a phone number.

450
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,640
Used to work at Kambura Hospital.
It's been ten years.

451
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,640
Psychiatrist Nedim Doğru.

452
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,120
Of course.

453
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Nevra...

454
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,480
The stupid cat costume worked.
They found some DNA on it.

455
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,720
They're trying to find a match for it.

456
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,480
If they get a match, this is over.

457
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,880
I need to oversee
the autopsy of the triplets.

458
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,640
You can follow up on the DNA. Good luck.

459
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,840
To you, as well.

460
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,440
Thanks.

461
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,640
Here we are...

462
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,480
We're immortalizing this historic moment.

463
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,880
What are you doing?

464
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,200
-Writing my memoir.
-Sure you are.

465
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,760
What happens in your memoir?
Do you die at the end?

466
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,120
Medically, no. But my career? Yes.

467
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,040
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

468
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,680
Do you know how many corpses
come in here every day?

469
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,160
Should we call the police or something?

470
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,080
I work so much I've forgotten
what my place looks like.

471
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,640
I'm listening, Timur.

472
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,440
Born on the same day,
died on the same day.

473
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,680
Proper triplets.

474
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,480
That's some investigating!

475
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,600
Yes, Nevra?

476
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,800
Really? I'll be right there.

477
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,200
-Did they find him?
-How did you know?

478
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,520
That's how it always is in this place.
Whenever I start to speak...

479
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,080
Go on.
You might really have him this time.

480
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,800
Timur, do you have diarrhea
of the mouth or something?

481
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,320
-Welcome, Nükhet.
-Thank you.

482
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,680
This is for you.

483
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,200
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

484
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,240
-You're so classy.
-Not at all.

485
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,480
I hope I haven't
kept you waiting for too long.

486
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,920
I've been waiting for ten years.
I live here.

487
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,640
-We're going out for dinner, right?
-Yes.

488
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,040
We're already there. This is it.

489
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,080
-This is it?
-Yes. After you.

490
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,880
What a beautiful building.

491
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,200
It's a bit rough around the edges,
but it's still magnificent.

492
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,880
Abdulhamid the Second built it.

493
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,840
He had an Italian architect design it
for use by Italian opera singers.

494
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,520
Actually, fun fact.

495
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,400
This is the first building
with an elevator in Istanbul.

496
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,440
That's why it keeps breaking.

497
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,200
Truly wonderful.
Are all the tenants bars like this one?

498
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,920
No. There's just this one,
and a folk bar upstairs.

499
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,560
And a trattoria with divine mezzes.
That's where we're going.

500
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,840
I live here, of course. But that's it.

501
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,160
Doesn't it get loud at night?

502
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,040
It used to.

503
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,560
They used to play the drums
at the folk bar. Made quite a ruckus.

504
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,840
So I went and had a word with them.

505
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,680
We came to terms.
They're much quieter now.

506
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,280
You get used to it after a while.
They all close after 2 AM.

507
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,600
Only ones left are me and the kids.

508
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,640
There's no one else in the building.

509
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,360
Truly wonderful.
Must be so much fun. So full of life.

510
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,040
Agah...

511
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,000
How about we go in there for a start?

512
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,560
The music's so loud.
We won't even hear each other.

513
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,600
They're playing rock 'n roll!

514
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,800
It's been such a long time
since I've had some beer in Beyoğlu.

515
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,680
Let's start there.
We can go upstairs later.

516
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,960
Sure. Alright. After you.

517
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,920
They've found whose the DNA from
the cat costume belongs to.

518
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,760
-Is the SWAT team on the way?
-Yes.

519
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,840
To you.

520
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,120
-To you.
-To you.

521
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,160
Life's a beautiful thing, isn't it?

522
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,640
It is.

523
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,360
-We're almost there.
-Tell them to hold until we're there.

524
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,840
Tell the SWAT team not to go in
until we're on the scene.

525
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,960
I have a question.

526
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,480
How did you come up with the idea
to write a book named "Life is Traffic"?

527
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,920
-How do you think?
-I wouldn't know.

528
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,560
I was in a traffic accident.

529
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,320
I lost my husband in that accident.

530
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,920
I was in the hospital for 11 months.

531
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,360
The doctors told me I'd never walk again.

532
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,600
But I met you while doing the tango.

533
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,240
Indeed...

534
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,760
Everything fell into place
after that accident.

535
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,560
I realized how simple life is.

536
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,840
As simple as a traffic accident.

537
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,400
As simple as traffic.

538
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,800
I love the image of...

539
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,560
The image of road signs.

540
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,400
"Stay out." "No u-turns."
Stuff like that.

541
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,680
We carry those road signs around with us.

542
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,760
Stop. Go. You can park here.
You can't park here.

543
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,520
The rules for traffic, Agah,
turn out to be the rules for life.

544
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,760
Open up! Police!

545
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,760
How did the accident happen?

546
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,120
-My husband broke a rule.
-Which one?

547
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,960
Fuck!

548
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,600
Sefa, it's me, Firuz!

549
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,240
Tell the team to pull back.
I'm opening the door.

550
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,400
Firuz...

551
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,320
If you want to commit suicide together,

552
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,360
the first rule is
you should ask the other person

553
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,800
whether they want to die, as well.

554
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,440
Firuz, are you alright?

555
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,920
Did he do it on purpose?

556
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,760
The worst part is, I knew what he was
when I got married to him.

557
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,920
I thought I could heal him. But...

558
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,240
-Whom can you truly heal, right?
-Right...

559
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,240
Firuz...

560
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Sefa...

561
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,400
I have a gun pointed at me.
Tell the team to pull back.

562
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,200
Alright.

563
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,800
Lower your weapons.
Lower your weapons.

564
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,000
-What does he want?
-I don't know. I'm about to find out.

565
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,360
I'm closing then door now. Alright?

566
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,320
Hold on, Sefa!

567
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,640
Pull back. Pull back.

568
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,440
Back!

569
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But I have no doubt

570
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,720
that people have been healed
after reading your book.

571
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
Perhaps...

572
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,680
But I didn't write the book for them.

573
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,000
I wrote the book to heal myself.

574
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,920
If they want to heal themselves,
they need to write books of their own.

575
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,760
Speak! Where the fuck
did you hide the money? Speak!

576
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,760
Speak or you get one in the head! Speak!

577
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,240
Did you write any other books?

578
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,520
No...

579
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,960
I'm still in the investigation part.

580
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,480
-What is it about?
-Agah Beyoğlu.

581
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,240
What do you mean? Why?

582
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,640
Because something tells me...

583
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,520
That nothing is as it seems.

584
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,880
Yes, chief. Alright.

585
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,680
Alright, chief. We're waiting outside.

586
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,520
Alright, chief. Of course.

587
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,680
It's Firuz! Don't shoot, I'm coming out!

588
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,800
Excuse me. There was a small problem.

589
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,000
I had two bullets jammed in my gun.

590
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,200
-Lower your fucking weapons.
-I'm glad.

591
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,720
I heard you on the radio
and came straight over. He fell on me.

592
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,200
But I have bad news.
He isn't the guy you're looking for.

593
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,160
What do you mean?

594
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,480
He was a hired gun.

595
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,320
He knew there was a serial killer
running around in a cat costume.

596
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,440
He decided to become a cat
and catch himself a mouse.

597
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,920
-I'm leaving, then.
-Where to?

598
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,560
-I'll tell you afterwards.
-Alright.

599
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,720
-You scared us.
-Why would you be scared?

600
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,160
The devil looks after his own.

601
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,640
I'm here to see Dr. Nedim Doğru.

602
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,520
Do you have an appointment?

603
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,320
A moment please.

604
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,480
So he hung himself.
I knew that's how it would end.

605
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,920
-Where have you been?
-Excuse me?

606
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,920
I've been waiting for you for ten years.

607
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,520
What do you mean?

608
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,200
I've been waiting for a cop
to come asking about Ufuk Terazi.

609
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,720
Then...

610
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,840
Why didn't you go to the police?

611
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,920
You wouldn't be asking me that
if you knew how this report was made.

612
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,320
I had just been assigned to Kambura.
To the state hospital there.

613
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,600
Something horrible had happened.
It was before my time.

614
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,640
A fire. A house had burned down.

615
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,960
The family inside had perished.

616
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,680
They brought Ufuk to me. His father did.

617
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,040
Ufuk didn't want to talk at first.

618
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,800
But when he realized
I wasn't a Kamburan, he opened up.

619
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,720
He told the same story
over and over again.

620
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,720
I burned the house down, he said.
I didn't believe him at first.

621
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,280
I thought the trauma
had altered his perception of reality.

622
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,320
But how detailed it all
was told me he wasn't hallucinating.

623
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,240
He wasn't lying, either.
So I called the police.

624
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,440
I told them what happened,
just as I'm telling you now.

625
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,960
I told them Ufuk confessed.

626
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,000
One day, when I was on night shift,
a man came to see me.

627
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,520
I remember every word he said to me.

628
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,160
"You will forget all about this."

629
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,480
"Or you disappear," he said.

630
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,520
"What do you mean, disappear?" I asked.

631
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,800
"You'll disappear the same way
people all around this country do."

632
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,920
I got what he meant then.

633
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,880
He told me I was to write a report.

634
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,200
So I did.

635
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,880
Who was he?

636
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,840
I don't know.

637
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,480
You never asked who he was? What he did?

638
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,840
Look, Nevra.
I'll explain it to you this way...

639
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,240
Conmen prey on hope.

640
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,760
A conman comes to you:

641
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,000
"Give me a dollar
and I'll give you ten back."

642
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,760
And if you're greedy by nature,
you get hopeful and give him the dollar.

643
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,400
But the conmen of this country
stopped selling hope.

644
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,040
There's an easier way.

645
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,760
People are so afraid of you...

646
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,880
Tell someone you're a cop on the phone,
and they'll give you every dime.

647
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,520
If the conmen of a country
con you through not hope but fear,

648
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,400
you never ask them who they are
or what they do for a living.

649
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,400
Then...

650
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,280
Could you identify him if you saw him?

651
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,280
Actually...

652
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,920
I was really scared that night.

653
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,200
I couldn't even look him in the eye.

654
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,680
But you can never tell.

655
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,120
You can never tell what someone
might suddenly remember.

656
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,160
-Not even I can.
-Give me a second.

657
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,520
-I don't have to be afraid anymore?
-You don't.

658
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,920
-What did he do?
-He was a judge.

659
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,040
Heavy penal court.

660
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,680
After all these years...

661
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,200
That's such a load off my back.

662
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,200
Forgetting feels good sometimes.
But other times, so does remembering.

663
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,920
I'll never forget it.

664
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,520
Where did he come from?
Where did he go?

665
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,040
-Where did that cop come from?
-A cop? What cop?

666
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,400
The one who took my statement.
He spoke to me the next morning.

667
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,560
Where did he come from?

668
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,120
-The cop?
-The cop.

669
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,080
Probably from Istanbul.
I didn't get his name.

670
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,000
He was young. He was a young man.

671
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
I might be able to identify him
if I saw a photo.

672
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,800
What is it?

673
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,360
What's that?

674
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,120
It's what I owe you.
It's over. We're even.

675
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,240
I'm done doing your dirty work.

676
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,960
Is that so?

677
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,040
Tell me it's done.

678
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,680
Tell me you're letting me go.

679
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,320
Suppose I let you go.

680
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,040
Will what you've done stop haunting you?

681
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,200
I killed someone over that money!

682
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,080
Oh, Firuz...

683
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,320
You think you can pay me back in money?

684
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,840
It's a debt in blood.

685
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,720
How's your son doing, by the way?

686
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,200
In good health, I hope...

687
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,240
The foundation
sees to his every need, right?

688
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,320
Let me know if you need anything.

689
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,880
It's a hard condition.

690
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,000
Not only hard...

691
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,920
Also expensive.

692
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,520
Don't beat yourself up.

693
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,560
You're not a bad person.

694
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,720
You're just doing my bidding.

695
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,680
Tell your conscience that
the blame's all mine.

696
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,480
It'll feel better.

697
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,360
In the meantime, put these in your pocket.

698
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,120
You obviously deserved them.

699
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,960
Shall we go upstairs?
Aren't you getting hungry?

700
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,120
No. This is beautiful.

701
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,920
Turn the music off. Turn it off!

702
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,080
-Get out of my way!
-What's going on?

703
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,560
-What?
-Get out!

704
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,400
Get out! Get out!

705
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,920
-Go! Go! We're closing up! Go on!
-What are you doing?

706
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,080
Go on, uncle! Out!

707
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,360
-Nükhet!
-Go on!

708
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,640
-Go on, uncle! Go on!
-What do you think you're doing!

709
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,480
-Get back, bitch!
-Throw them out! Throw them out!

710
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,760
Go on, what are you looking at?

711
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,520
Get the fuck out of here!

712
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,000
-They didn't pay their tax this month!
-Fuck you!

713
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,400
Do you have a death wish or something?

714
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,600
That's exactly what I have.
What will you do about it?

715
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,760
-Somebody help him!
-Shut him up!

716
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,600
Nükhet, I'm so sorry. I really am.

717
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,160
This kind of thing
never happens around here.

718
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,400
Don't worry about it. It's not your fault.

719
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,880
It can't be helped.
Besides, I had so much fun.

720
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,680
I'm mad that I didn't say anything
to those two-bit crooks.

721
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,720
Don't be silly. What if they have guns?
How do we know they don't?

722
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,160
Isn't it that way in traffic also?
You should never pick a fight.

723
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,560
You don't know who anyone might be.
What if they have a gun in their car?

724
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,040
What we did was right,
not getting involved in their affairs.

725
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,720
Thank you so much for everything.
Good night.

726
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,480
Good night...

727
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,600
-Some outfit. What's this now?
-He looks ridiculous.

728
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,920
Are you from the mafia?

729
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,880
Hush. It's saying something.

730
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,520
-What?
-I asked you if you're from the mafia.

731
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,520
-He's a loon.
-Are you drunk or something?

732
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,080
Are you looking for trouble?

733
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,520
Hold on. Show me your face. Show it!

734
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,280
Come on, we have another stop
to make at Sıtkı's.

735
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,720
Fucking clown.

736
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,360
I asked you
if you're from the mafia, my boy.

737
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,560
Yes. That's exactly what we are. So what?

738
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,680
Here's the mafia for you.

739
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,040
Just a bunch of wannabes.
