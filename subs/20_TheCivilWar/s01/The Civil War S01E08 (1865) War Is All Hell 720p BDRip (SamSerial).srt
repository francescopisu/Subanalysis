1
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:11,595
"We believed
that it was most desirable

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,598
"that the north
should win.

3
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,892
"We believed
in the principle

4
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,521
"that the union
is indissoluble.

5
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,524
"We, or many of us at least,
also believed

6
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,777
"that the conflict
was inevitable

7
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,740
"and that slavery
had lasted long enough,

8
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:34,535
"but we equally believed
that those who stood against us

9
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,954
"held just as sacred
convictions

10
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,999
"that were
the opposite of ours,

11
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,544
"and we respected them
as every man with a heart

12
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:49,300
must respect those
who give all for their belief."

13
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,469
Oliver Wendell Holmes.

14
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:06,567
<i>We are the veterans
of the civil war,</i>

15
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,196
<i>'61 to '65.</i>

16
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>This flag is of
the Hawkins' zouaves,</i>

17
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,203
<i>New York.</i>

18
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,621
<i>Now salute.</i>

19
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,965
As a southerner,
i would say

20
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,885
one of the main importances
of the war

21
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:37,139
is that southerners
have a sense of defeat,

22
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:42,353
which, none of the rest
of the country has.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,522
You'll see
in the movie patton,

24
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,398
the actor
who plays patton saying,

25
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,193
"we Americans
have never lost a war."

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,612
That's a rather amazing
statement for him to make

27
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,405
as patton because
patton's grandfather

28
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,450
was in Lee's army
of northern Virginia,

29
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,911
and he certainly
lost a war.

30
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,637
In 1865 in South Africa,

31
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:20,266
whites drove the basuto tribe
from their land.

32
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,269
In Afghanistan,

33
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,646
Russian troop movements
along the border

34
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,691
were a cause of great
international concern.

35
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,278
At a monastery
in Austria,

36
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,488
Gregor mendel
established

37
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,448
the principle
of heredity,

38
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,825
and in Ireland,

39
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,703
the poet William Butler
yeats was born.

40
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,666
In 1865 in America,

41
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,044
Samuel clemens published
his first short story

42
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,505
as mark twain.

43
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,674
The 13th amendment,
abolishing slavery,

44
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,468
was formally ratified,

45
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,722
and the ku klux klan
was formed.

46
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,685
In 1860,

47
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,396
most of the nation's
31 million people

48
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:11,525
lived peaceably
on farms or in small towns.

49
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,196
By 1865,
everything had changed.

50
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,449
Sharpsburg, Maryland.

51
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:21,911
Fredericksburg, Virginia.

52
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,206
Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

53
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,459
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

54
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,712
Vicksburg, Mississippi.

55
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,381
Atlanta, Georgia.

56
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,224
By the beginning of 1865,

57
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,060
the confederacy
was dying.

58
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,686
To the west,

59
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,232
only the tattered confederate
army of Tennessee remained.

60
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,859
Its soldiers,
like Sam Watkins,

61
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,071
worried more about food
and blankets and shoes

62
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,906
than fighting.

63
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,242
Outside Petersburg,

64
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,703
Elisha hunt rhodes
and 120,000 other union troops

65
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,080
were dug in,

66
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:10,584
unable to dislodge
the stubborn rebel army.

67
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,253
Atlanta had been razed,

68
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,256
and Georgia and the carolinas
lay helpless

69
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,968
in William tecumseh sherman's
path.

70
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,719
As the new year began,

71
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,264
Robert e. Lee assumed command
of all Southern forces

72
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,267
and, with it,
the hopeless task

73
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,270
of hurling back
the huge union armies

74
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,273
now closing in
from every side.

75
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,109
With victory
within his grasp,

76
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,946
Abraham Lincoln looked forward
to a second presidential term

77
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,115
and a new challenge--

78
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,741
healing the nation

79
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,953
he had struggled so hard
to reunite.

80
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,292
"Here was the greatest
and most moving chapter

81
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,918
"in American history,

82
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,296
"a blending
of meanness and greatness,

83
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,923
"an ending
and a beginning.

84
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,926
"It came
out of what men were,

85
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,305
"but it did not go
as men had planned.

86
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,766
"Of all men,
Abraham Lincoln came the closest

87
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,770
"to understanding
what had happened.

88
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,940
"Yet even he, in his final
backward glance,

89
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,319
"had to confess that something
that went beyond words

90
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,154
had been at work
in the land."

91
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,326
<i>"The almighty had
his own purposes."</i>

92
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,369
Bruce catton.

93
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,236
Man, as sherman: "My aim
was to whip the rebels,

94
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,822
"to humble their pride,

95
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,367
"to follow them
to their innermost recesses,

96
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,370
and to make them
fear and dread us."

97
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,374
"War is cruelty.

98
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,502
"There's no use
trying to reform it.

99
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,130
The crueler it is,
the sooner it will be over."

100
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,424
William tecumseh sherman.

101
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,096
"War is all hell,"

102
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,223
William tecumseh sherman
once said,

103
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,725
and it was now his aim
to bring that hell

104
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,894
to the heart
of the confederacy.

105
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,773
He saw
from the very beginning

106
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,150
how hard a war
it was gonna be,

107
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,986
and when he said how
hard a war it was gonna be,

108
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,698
he was retired
under suspicion of insanity

109
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,243
and then brought back
when they decided

110
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,955
maybe he wasn't
so crazy after all.

111
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:57,084
Sherman is maybe the first
truly modern general.

112
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,795
He was the first one
to understand,

113
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,256
in the present-day world,

114
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:06,802
that civilians were
the backers-up of things

115
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,762
and that if you
went against civilians,

116
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,807
you deprived the army
of what kept it going,

117
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,768
so he quite purposely
made war against civilians.

118
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,447
From Atlanta in late 1864,

119
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,407
sherman proposed
to march his army

120
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:32,202
through the heart of Georgia
all the way to Savannah.

121
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,455
His army would live
off the land,

122
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,457
destroying everything
in its path

123
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,835
that could conceivably aid
the faltering confederacy

124
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,962
and a good deal
that couldn't.

125
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,298
"I can make this march,"
he promised,

126
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,633
"and make Georgia howl."

127
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,724
Lincoln's advisors thought
sherman's plan foolhardy.

128
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,809
The president approved it.

129
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,478
"If you can whip Lee

130
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,522
and I can march to the
Atlantic," sherman told Grant,

131
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,817
"i think uncle Abe
will give us 20 days' leave

132
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,862
to see the young folks."

133
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,032
"There are rumors
that we are to cut loose

134
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,950
"and march south
to the ocean.

135
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,952
"We're in fine shape
and, I think,

136
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,330
could go anywhere
uncle Billy would lead."

137
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,499
Private Theodore upson.

138
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,459
Before leaving Atlanta,

139
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,212
sherman ordered all townspeople,
white and black,

140
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,880
out of their homes,

141
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,341
then directed his men
to burn or destroy

142
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,343
anything of use
to the rebels.

143
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,972
Civilians looted the town

144
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,977
and helped spread the Blaze
throughout the city.

145
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,897
"A grand and awful spectacle
is presented to the beholder

146
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,358
"in this beautiful city,
now in flames.

147
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,361
"The heaven is one expanse
of lurid fire.

148
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,489
"The air is filled
with flying cinders.

149
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,533
"The city which,
next to Richmond,

150
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,868
"has furnished more material
for prosecuting the war

151
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,663
than any other
in the south..."

152
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,082
"Exists no more
as a means for injury

153
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,417
to be used by the enemies
of the union."

154
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,047
Sherman began his march.

155
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,553
62,000 men in blue
were on the move

156
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,304
in two great columns.

157
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,558
Their supply train
stretched 25 miles.

158
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,394
A slave watching the army
stream past

159
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,438
wondered aloud
if anybody was left up north.

160
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,194
"The name of the captor
of Atlanta, if he fails now,

161
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,488
"will become
the scoff of mankind

162
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,575
"and the humiliation of
the United States for all time.

163
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:39,329
If he succeeds, it will be
written on the tablet of fame."

164
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,081
London <i>herald.</i>

165
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:49,047
"Reaching the hill just
outside the old rebel works,

166
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,049
"we paused to look back.

167
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,885
"Behind us lay Atlanta
in ruins,

168
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,972
"the black smoke
rising high in the air,

169
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,558
"hanging like a pall.

"Then we turned
our horses' heads to the east.

00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,356
"Atlanta was soon lost
behind the screen of trees

172
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,484
and became
a thing of the past."

173
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,448
It had been
cumulative evidence

174
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,618
that an army
could subsist itself

175
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,288
on what was growing
in the fields, winter or summer,

176
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:26,251
and they were
a moving city, like.

177
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,128
They would grind
their own corn

178
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,255
at the grist mills
along the way,

179
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,758
butcher their own cattle.

180
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,385
Sherman was perfectly satisfied
he could make the march

181
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,638
without difficulty
with regard to supplies.

182
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,097
In fact, they ate better
on that march

183
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,099
than they did
not marching.

184
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:45,646
Sweet potatoes were
particularly prized, and pork.

185
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,689
They had plenty to eat.

186
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,109
"This is probably

187
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,488
"the most gigantic
pleasure excursion ever planned.

188
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,658
"It already beats everything
i ever saw soldiering

189
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,535
and promises
to prove much richer yet."

190
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,790
"We had
a gay old campaign.

191
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,125
"Destroyed all we could not eat,
stole their niggers,

192
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,503
"burned their cotton and gins,
spilled their sorghum,

193
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,505
"burned and twisted
their railroads,

194
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,548
and raised hell, generally."

195
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,761
Sherman's men
tore up railroads,

196
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,764
heating the rails
and twisting them beyond repair.

197
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,058
It became a trademark--

198
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,060
sherman's neckties.

199
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,445
He forbade his men to plunder
the homes they passed,

200
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,657
but neither he nor they
took the order very seriously.

201
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,413
"I've got a regiment that
can kill, gut, and scrape a pig

202
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,998
without breaking ran ks."

203
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,462
"They say
no living thing

204
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,631
"is found
in sherman's track,

205
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,092
"only chimneys,
like telegraph poles,

206
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,387
to carry the news of
his attack backwards."

207
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,431
Mary chesnut.

208
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,435
"I doubt if history
affords a parallel

209
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,186
"to the deep
and bitter enmity

210
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,731
"of the women
of the south.

211
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,191
"No one who sees them
and hears

212
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,194
but must feel the
intensity of their hate."

213
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,202
"As far as
the eye could reach,

214
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,204
"the lurid flames
of burning houses

215
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,749
"lit up the heavens.

216
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,584
"I could stand
out on the veranda

217
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:35,213
and, for 2 or 3 miles, watch
the Yankees as they came on."

218
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,591
"I could mark
when they reached the residence

219
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,178
of each and every friend
on the road."

220
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,225
The troops looted slave
cabins, as well as mansions,

221
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,227
poked their ramrods
into flower beds

222
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,605
in search
of buried valuables,

223
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,274
and burned everything
in their path.

224
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:02,240
"The thousand pounds of
meat in my smokehouse is gone.

225
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,619
"My 18 fat turkeys,
my hens,

226
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,164
"chickens, and fowl,
my young pigs

227
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,626
"are shot down in my yard

228
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,670
as if they were
the rebels."

229
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,178
"The cruelties
practiced

230
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,765
"on this campaign
towards the citizens

231
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:31,812
"have been enough to blast
a more sacred cause than ours.

232
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,314
We hardly deserve
success."

233
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,202
At milledgeville, Georgia,

234
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,204
sherman's men
boiled their coffee

235
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,206
over bonfires
of confederate currency,

236
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,376
held a mock session
of the legislature

237
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:58,630
that passed a resolution
returning Georgia to the union.

238
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,424
Sherman's men
were feasting on delicacies

239
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,093
foraged from local farms

240
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,555
when a band of emaciated men
tottered into the firelight.

241
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:11,017
They were union escapees
from andersonville prison.

242
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,435
An Indiana colonel
remembered

243
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,312
that the sight
of the starved men

244
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,066
"sickened and infuriated"
his troops.

245
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,442
"When foraging now,

246
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,695
"they think of
the tens of thousands

247
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,824
"of their imprisoned comrades
slowly perishing with hunger,

248
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:30,579
and they sweep
with the scythe of destruction."

249
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,125
Before they were
through, sherman and his men

250
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:39,462
would cross 425 miles
of hostile territory

251
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,466
and wreak $100 million
worth of havoc.

252
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,053
The south
would never forget.

253
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,017
"We will fight you
to the death.

254
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,019
"Better to die
a thousand deaths

255
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:58,148
than submit to live under you
and your negro allies."

256
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,650
General John bell hood.

257
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,486
Lacking a leg
and the use of one arm,

258
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,282
John bell hood had to be strapped
to the saddle each morning,

259
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,410
but he fought as hard
and as recklessly as ever.

260
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,828
Hood and his
dwindling army

261
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,497
now tried to divert
sherman's attention

262
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,499
by moving north
to join forces

263
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,877
with Nathan bedford forrest's
cavalry

264
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,503
and invade Tennessee.

265
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,631
Sherman was delighted.

266
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,841
"If he will go
to the Ohio river,

267
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,843
I'll give him rations,"
he said.

268
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,888
"My business
is down south."

269
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,515
Waiting for hood
in Tennessee

270
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,684
was a fresh, well-equipped
union army

271
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,728
1/3 again
as large as hood's,

272
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,231
commanded by George Thomas,
"the rock of chickamauga."

273
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,904
At Franklin, hood ordered
a series of 13 hopeless charges

274
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,531
in which
12 confederate generals

275
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,660
and 7,000 soldiers
were lost,

276
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,788
more men than U.S. Grant
had lost at cold harbor

277
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,456
the year before,

278
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,864
more than George mcclellan lost

279
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,836
in all the battles
of the 7 days in 1862.

280
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,425
Franklin is
a horrendous battle,

281
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,678
and the flower
of the army fell.

282
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,930
There's a strong suspicion

283
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,349
that hood was trying
to discipline his army

284
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,558
by staging that charge,

285
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,977
and there's some truth in it.

286
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,145
His army was wrecked.

287
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,440
The defeat at Nashville
is in large part

288
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,485
due to what had happened
at Franklin a month before.

289
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,573
At Nashville,
George Thomas attacked

290
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,576
what was left
of hood's army.

291
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,328
"My boot
was full of blood

292
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,455
"and my clothing
saturated with it.

293
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,582
"I reached
general hood's headquarters.

294
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,584
"He was much agitated
and affected,

295
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,795
"pulling his hair
with his one hand--

296
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,338
"he had but one--

297
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,840
and crying like
his heart would break."

298
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,092
Sam Watkins.

299
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,470
Hood's army
had disintegrated.

300
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,473
"I beheld for the first
and only time," he confessed,

301
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,602
"a confederate army
abandon the field in confusion."

302
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,231
Hood resigned.

303
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,359
Lee recalled Joe johnston
to active duty

304
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,862
and put him in charge
of patching together

305
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:14,117
whatever confederate forces
remained outside of Virginia.

306
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,994
"We were willing
to go anywhere

307
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,121
"or to follow anyone
who would lead us.

308
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,750
"We were anxious
to flee, fight, or fortify.

309
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,628
"I have never seen an army
so confused and demoralized.

310
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,215
The whole thing seemed to be
tottering and trembling."

311
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,639
"Gentlemen,
you cannot qualify war

312
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,893
"in harsher terms
than I will.

313
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,895
"We cannot
change the hearts

00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,897
"of these people

"but we can make war
so terrible

316
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,860
"and make them
so sick of war

317
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,904
"that generations
will pass away

318
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,531
before they again
appeal to it."

319
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,575
William tecumseh sherman.

320
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,664
"Darkest
of all decembers

too far from his columns,

they would be caught
by confederate guerrillas.

"Perfect anarchy reigned,"
one plantation owner said.

342
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,955
It was, said another,
"the breath of emancipation."

Man, on recording: <i>And the Yankees
vvould come, and after a while,</i>

around me in crowds,

351
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,028
"and I can't find out
whether I am Moses or Aaron,

352
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:59,073
but surely I am rated
as one of the congregation."

353
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,040
"It seems the good
people in the north

354
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,958
"are terribly worried
about us.

355
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,044
"They called us
the lost army,

356
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,546
"and some thought we
would never show up again.

357
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,798
"I don't think they know
what kind of an army this is

358
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,342
"that uncle Billy has.

359
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,802
"Why, if Grant can keep
Lee and his troops busy,

360
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,680
we can tramp all over
this confederacy."

361
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,099
Private Theodore upson.

362
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,686
Throughout the north,

363
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,898
people wondered what
had happened to sherman's army,

364
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,316
until suddenly,

365
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:37,820
William tecumseh sherman
emerged near Savannah.

366
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,865
"December 25, 1864.

367
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,825
"Dear Mr. president,

368
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,204
"i beg to present you,
as a Christmas gift,

369
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,081
"the city of Savannah,

370
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:52,210
"with 150 heavy guns
and plenty of ammunition,

371
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:56,631
also about 25,000 bales
of cotton."

372
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,843
He then regroups at Savannah,

373
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,845
and in the last week

374
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,847
of January,

375
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,643
he starts into south Carolina.

376
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,105
South Carolina gets it
even worse than Georgia

377
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,566
because they figured
that's where secession started.

378
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,529
Sherman now turned
his columns northward

379
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,240
into the carolinas.

380
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,117
A relentless
winter rain was falling,

381
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,119
and confederate generals
were confident

382
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,122
no army could march
through the mud,

383
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,959
but sherman and his men
made a steady 10 miles a day.

384
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,752
Battalions of axmen
led the way,

385
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,382
hacking down whole forests
to construct corduroy roads.

386
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,968
"When I learned
that sherman's army

387
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,219
"was marching through
the salkehatchie swamps

388
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,554
"making its own roads

389
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,806
"at the rate
of a dozen miles a day

390
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,392
"and bringing its artillery
and wagons with it,

391
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,520
"i made up my mind that there had
been no such army in existence

392
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,273
since the days
of Julius Caesar."

393
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,692
Joseph e. Johnston.

394
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,405
Sherman's men were
still harsher in south Carolina

395
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,157
than they had been
in Georgia.

396
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,160
"Here is where treason began,"
a private said,

397
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:11,164
"and by god,
this is where it shall end."

398
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,666
Few houses
were left standing.

399
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,172
"The wind moans
among the bleak chimneys

400
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,675
"and whistles through
the gaping windows.

401
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,677
"The market is a ruined shell,

402
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,806
its spire fallen in,

403
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:32,310
"the old bell, secessia,

404
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:36,022
"that had rung out every
state as it seceded,

405
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,484
lying half-buried
in the earth."

406
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,448
On February 17, 1865,

407
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,450
fort sumter
was abandoned,

408
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,994
along with
all of Charleston.

409
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,457
<i>"This</i> disappointment,"
Jefferson Davis admitted,

410
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,876
"is extremely bitter."

411
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,596
"A city of ruins,

412
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,182
"of desolation,

413
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,310
of vacant houses,
of widowed women..."

414
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,688
"Of rotting wharves,

415
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,483
"of deserted warehouses,

416
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,488
"of weed-wild gardens,
of miles of grass-grown streets,

417
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:29,159
"of acres of pitiful
and voiceful barrenness--

418
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:33,037
"that is Charleston,

419
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:37,291
wherein rebellion
loftily reared its head."

420
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,066
"Jack middleton
writes from Richmond,

421
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,902

422
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,904
<i>"We dread starvation far more</i>

00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,490

<i>Famine--that is the word now."</i>

Mary chesnut.

426
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,794
Everywhere the union
armies marched,

427
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,590
the back roads filled
with confederate refugees.

428
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,928
Thousands fled to Texas
in search of a new start.

429
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,930
Thousands more
flocked to Richmond,

430
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,809
hoping the confederate
government would care for them.

431
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,686
There was little
it could do.

432
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:42,106
The confederate government
was coming apart.

433
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,525
The governor
of north Carolina

434
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,944
refused to permit
any but his own troops

435
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:50,573
to wear the 92,000 uniforms
he was hoarding.

436
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,949
In Georgia,

437
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,327
governor Joseph brown
threatened to secede

438
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,329
from the confederacy.

439
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,167
States' rights
still came first.

440
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,256
"If the confederacy fails,

441
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,967
"there should be written
on its tombstone--

442
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,970
died of a theory."

443
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,431
President Jefferson Davis.

444
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,977
Man, as Lee: "I have been up
to see the congress,

445
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,355
"and they do not seem able
to do anything

446
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,982
"except eat peanuts
and chew tobacco,

447
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,360
while my army
is starving."

448
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,821
Robert e. Lee.

449
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,740
Lee begged
for more supplies.

450
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,284
Davis had none to give.

451
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,288
A single stick of firewood
cost $5.00 in Richmond.

452
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,667
A barrel of flour
had risen to $250

453
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:47,129
and could rarely be found
even at that price.

454
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,675
"I daily part
with my raiment for food.

455
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,303
"We find no one
who will exchange eatables

456
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,305
"for confederate money,

457
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,350
so we are devouring
our clothes."

458
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,398
Hundreds of confederate
soldiers were deserting every day,

459
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,025
cold, hungry, barefoot,

460
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,903
driven by desperate letters
from home.

461
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,910
Lee asked that slaves
now be armed

462
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,620
to defend
the confederacy.

463
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,455
"We must decide,"
he said,

464
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,710
"whether the negro shall fight
for us or against us.

465
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,337
Those willing to fight,"
he added,

466
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,424
would be freed
after the war."

467
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:35,344
The con federate congress
finally authorized black troops

468
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,888
because,
as the Richmond examiner said,

469
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,891
"the country will not deny
general Lee anything

470
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,019
he may ask for."

471
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,478
6 days later,

472
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:48,190
the citizens of Richmond
saw an astonishing sight--

473
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,359
a new
confederate battalion

474
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,363
made up of white convalescents
and black hospital orderlies

475
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,409
marching up main street
to the strains of <i>Dixie.</i>

476
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,247
"You cannot make
soldiers of slaves

477
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,749
"or slaves of soldiers.

478
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,001
"The day you make
a soldier of them

479
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,962
"is the beginning of the end
of the revolution,

480
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,757
"and if slaves
seem good soldiers,

481
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,760
then our whole theory
of slavery is wrong."

482
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,429
Senator howell Cobb,
Georgia.

483
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,475
Earlier that winter,

484
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:26,771
the United States congress
had voted 119 to 56

485
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,982
to pass the 13th amendment
to abolish slavery

486
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,444
and sent it to the states
for ratification.

487
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,406
11 months later,

488
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,784
slavery was officially
abolished everywhere

489
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,203
and for all time.

490
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:49,126
"Verily,
the work does not end

491
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,129
"with the abolition
of slavery,

492
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,507
but only begins."

in place,

00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,331
flooding the stand
with brilliant sunlight.

526
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,628
Man, as Lincoln:
"Fondly do we hope,

527
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,088
"fervently do we pray

528
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:02,927
that this mighty scourge of war
may speedily pass away."

529
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,598
"Yet if god wills
that it continue

530
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,600
"until all the wealth
piled up

531
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:13,312
"by the bondsman's 250 years
of unrequited toil

532
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,856
"shall be sunk

533
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:19,276
"and until every drop of blood
drawn with the lash

534
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:23,864
"shall be paid
by another drawn with the sword,

535
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:27,034
"as was said
3,000 years ago,

536
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,870
"so still must be said,

537
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,747
<i>"the judgments of the lord</i>

538
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:35,167
<i>are true and righteous
altogether."</i>

539
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:41,131
"With malice towards none,

540
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:44,677
"with charity for all...

541
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,887
"With firmness in the right

542
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,723
"as god gives us
to see the right,

543
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,436
"let us strive on
to finish the work we are in,

544
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,189
"to bind up
the nation's wounds,

545
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,693
"to care for him
who shall have borne the battle

546
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,322
"and for his widow
and his orphan...

547
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,242
"To do all
which may achieve and Cherish

548
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,662
"a just and lasting peace
among ourselves

549
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,914
and with all nations."

550
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,336
Can it be anyone
but Lincoln

551
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:22,840
that any of us
could be drawn to

552
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,926
as the central figure
of the war?

553
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:31,974
Because, in away,
he comprehended both sides.

554
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:38,689
"We must not be enemies.
We must be friends."

555
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,944
"I'm a tired man,"
Lincoln said afterwards.

556
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:47,865
"Sometimes I think
I'm the tiredest man on earth."

557
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,210
In the crowd
just a few yards from Lincoln

558
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,922
was the young actor
John wilkes booth,

559
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,841
a pistol in his pocket.

560
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,968
His vantage point
on the balcony,

561
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,762
booth said afterwards,
had offered

562
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,765
"an excellent chance
to kill the president...

563
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,683
If I had wished."

564
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,897
John wilkes booth

565
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:23,484
was a fervent believer
in slavery and white supremacy,

566
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,235
but during
4 years of war,

567
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,987
he had not been able
to bring himself

568
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,407
actually to fight
for the Southern cause.

569
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,285
Man, as booth: "I have begun
to deem myself a coward

570
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,413
and to despise
my own existence."

571
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,668
His mind
fixed on Lincoln

572
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,796
as the tyrant responsible
for all the country's troubles

573
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,423
and his own.

574
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,010
Booth hatched a scheme
to kidnap Lincoln

575
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,013
and gathered a worshipful band
of dubious conspirators

576
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,723
willing to help out.

577
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,433
Lewis paine,

578
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,810
a wounded confederate

579
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:01,730
who had recently sworn
allegiance to the union.

580
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,482
David e. Herold,

581
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,942
a druggist's clerk

582
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:08,487
who was thought by some
to be mentally retarded.

583
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,114
George atzerodt,

584
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,074
a German-born wagon painter

585
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:15,786
barely able to make himself
understood in English.

586
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,955
And John h. Surratt,

587
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,416
a sometime confederate spy

588
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,001
whose widowed mother Mary

589
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,794
kept a Washington
boarding-house

590
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,839
where booth and his admirers
sometimes met.

591
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,760
Two weeks
after the inauguration,

592
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,763
booth and his accomplices,
all wearing masks,

593
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,016
rode out
toward the soldiers' home,

594
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,767
where Lincoln often slept,

595
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,353
hoping to intercept
his carriage.

596
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,481
The president never came.

597
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,775
"So goes the world,"
booth wrote.

598
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,819
"Might makes right."

599
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,785
Late in march, Lincoln sailed
down to city point, Virginia,

600
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,245
to confer
with his generals

601
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,414
aboard Grant's
floating headquarters,

602
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,166
the <i>river queen.</i>

603
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,794
Sherman, who had interrupted
his march through the carolinas,

604
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,965
had met Lincoln
only once before, in 1861,

605
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:13,385
and found him then
a weak and partisan politician

606
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,138
unequal to his task.

607
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,807
The talks lasted two days.

608
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,268
Grant, sherman,
and admiral Porter

609
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:24,813
detailed plans
for one last major campaign.

610
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,150
Lincoln, satisfied that victory
seemed within reach,

611
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,903
outlined plans for peace.

612
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,823
"If the rebels would lay down their
guns and go home," Lincoln said,

613
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,366
"they should be
welcomed back

614
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,286
as citizens
of the United States."

615
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,915
"I never saw him again.

616
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,292
"Of all the men
i ever met,

617
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:49,046
"he seemed to me to possess more
of the elements of greatness

618
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,423
"combined with goodness

619
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,467
than any other."

620
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,886
William tecumseh sherman.

621
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,236
"My own corps
was stretched

622
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,655
"until the men stood
like a row of vedettes

623
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,406
"15 feet apart.

624
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,867
"It was not a line,

625
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,870
it was the mere skeleton
of a line."

626
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,789
General John b. Gordon.

627
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:27,710
Ulysses s. Grant
and Robert e. Lee

628
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,003
had faced one another
in front of Petersburg

629
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,880
for 9 months.

630
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,465
Slowly, steadily,

631
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,511
Grant had extended his trenches
around Petersburg.

632
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,888
Lee's lines had been forced
to stretch, too,

633
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,974
but his army was shrinking.

634
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:43,892
In 9 months,

635
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,688
60,000 Southern soldiers
had deserted.

636
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:50,858
"All of us think
we're whipped now.

637
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,902
"The men are ragged
and are getting half rations.

638
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,549
"Some say we'll have to
go to georgey,

639
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:59,116
but the men
will not go there."

640
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:02,035
The thinning confederate
lines around Petersburg

641
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:05,330
finally extended 53 miles.

642
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,792
Grant's forces
numbered 125,000.

643
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,670
Lee's had dwindled
to 35,000.

644
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:18,135
Lee's only hope lay in
moving his army to the southwest

645
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:21,263
to link up with johnston
in the hills of north Carolina

646
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,182
and fight on.

647
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:31,190
On march 25th,

648
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,316
confederates
under John b. Gordon

649
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,236
mounted a sudden night assault
that briefly won possession

650
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,323
of an earthwork
called fort stedman.

651
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,409
It was Lee's last advance.

652
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,077
Grant counterattacked,

653
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,746
racing around the rebel flank

654
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,790
to block Lee's escape
at five forks.

655
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,417
There, on April 1st,

656
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:54,630
he routed a confederate division
under George pickett.

657
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,340
The next day,

658
00:36:56,506 --> 00:37:00,010
union forces attacked
all along the Petersburg line.

659
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:03,430
Slowly, relentlessly,
and at great cost,

660
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:06,016
they drove the con federates
out of their trenches.

661
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:10,687
Among the Southern dead
left behind

662
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,900
were shoeless boys
as young as 14.

663
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,366
"The conduct
of the Southern people

664
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:26,370
"appears many times truly noble,
as exemplified, for instance,

665
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,956
"in the defense
of Petersburg.

666
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,292
"Old men with silver locks
lay dead in the trenches

667
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:37,673
"side by side
with mere boys of 13 or 14.

668
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,218
"It almost makes one sorry
to have to fight against people

669
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:45,389
who show such devotion for
their homes and their country."

670
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,392
Washington roebling.

671
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:52,812
A.P. Hill, who had served
Lee faithfully in a dozen battles

672
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,149
and staved off confederate
disaster at antietam,

673
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,277
tried to rally his men.

674
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,446
Two union infantrymen
shot him dead

675
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,991
as he rode
between the lines.

676
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,413
"He is at rest,

677
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,749
and we who are left
are the ones to suffer."

678
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,636
Petersburg, the scene
of 9 months' siege,

679
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,763
fell to Grant's army.

680
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,732
As black civilians
cheered the black soldiers

681
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,484
that led the union
columns into the city,

682
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:44,156
Lee's army slipped
across the appomattox river.

683
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,910
In Richmond, Jefferson Davis
was attending 10:00 services

684
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,287
that Sunday morning

685
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:52,831
at St. Paul's
episcopal church

686
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,710
when the sexton
handed him a message.

687
00:38:56,877 --> 00:39:01,381
"President Davis, my lines
are broken in 3 places.

688
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:05,093
Richmond must be evacuated
this evening."

689
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,387
Robert e. Lee.

690
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:11,683
"I happened to sit in the
rear of the president's pew,

691
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,645
"so near that I plainly saw
the sort of gray pallor

692
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,773
"that came upon his face

693
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:22,819
as he read a scrap of paper
thrust into his hand."

694
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,654
Davis hurried from the church

695
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,657
and ordered his government
to move to danville, Virginia,

696
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,452
140 miles to the south.

697
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,954
On the evening of April 2nd,

698
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,791
Davis and his cabinet
boarded the last train,

699
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,835
a series of freight cars
labeled "treasury department,"

700
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:43,423
"quartermaster's department,"
"war department."

701
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,805
"We tried to comfort
ourselves by saying in low tones

702
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,724
"that the capital
was only moved temporarily,

703
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,810
"that general Lee
would make a stand

704
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,229
"and repulse
the daring enemy,

705
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,898
and that we would yet win
the battle and the day."

706
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,820
A slave dealer
named lumpkin

707
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,948
failed to get his
50 chained slaves aboard.

708
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:12,619
He had to unlock $50,000 worth
of property in the street

709
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,539
and let them go.

710
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:19,709
The retreating confederates
set fire to much of Richmond.

711
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:24,256
Mobs plundered stores,
broke into abandoned houses.

712
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:27,884
The fire on land spread
to the confederate arsenal.

713
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,851
The explosion
rocked the city

714
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,937
and shattered windows
for miles around.

715
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,999
"Everything was
in the wildest confusion.

716
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,793
"The low characters of the town
had broken into everything

717
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,170
"and were looting the town,

718
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,921
"being aided
to a considerable extent

719
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,298
"by the soldiers

720
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,967
who had broken
through all discipline."

721
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,520
"I saw a confederate
soldier on horseback

722
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,064
"pause under my window.

723
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,901
"He wheeled
and fired behind him,

"rode a short distance,

725
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,655
"wheeled and fired again.

726
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,326
Coming up the street
rode a body of men in blue."

727
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,544
"Arriving at the capital,
i sprang from my horse,

728
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,881
"first unbuckling the stars
and stripes from my saddle,

729
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:51,009
"and with captain Langdon,
i rushed up to the roof.

730
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:54,679
"Together, we hoisted the first
large flag over Richmond

731
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:58,683
and, on the peak of the roof,
drank to its success."

732
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:13,990
Mrs. Robert e. Lee, too
crippled by arthritis to travel,

733
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,951
remained in Richmond.

734
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,162
The union commander
posted a guard before her house,

735
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,956
<i>a black cavalryman,</i>

736
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,625
to ensure
no harm came to her.

737
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,381
Man, as Lincoln:
"April 3, 1865.

738
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:32,676
"Thank god
i have lived to see this.

739
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,135
"It seems to me

740
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,429
"that I have been dreaming
a horrid nightmare

741
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,473
"for 4 years,

742
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,850
"and now the nightmare
is gone.

743
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:44,479
I want to see Richmond."

744
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:51,111
On April 3rd,
Abraham Lincoln and his son tad

745
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:54,322
arrived at rockett's wharf
aboard a small barge

746
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,491
and were escorted
through the smoking city

747
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,995
by a unit of black cavalry.

748
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:03,665
Freed slaves
mobbed the president,

749
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,001
laughing, singing,
weeping for joy,

750
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,252
kneeling before him,

751
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,421
straining to touch
his clothes.

752
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:11,965
"I know I am free,"
said one man,

753
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:15,927
"for I have seen father Abraham
and felt him."

754
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:20,849
The president walked
about a mile through the crowd

755
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,727
and loped up the steps
of the confederate white house,

756
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,354
now union headquarters.

757
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,482
When he sat down
at Jefferson Davis' desk,

758
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:33,278
the troops outside
burst into cheers.

759
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,783
"Richmond has fallen,

760
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,578
"and I have no heart
to write about it.

761
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:44,748
"They are too many for us.

762
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,585
"Everything lost in Richmond,
even our archives.

763
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:51,880
Blue-black
is our horizon."

764
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,090
Mary chesnut.

765
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,798
"There is a stillness
in the midst of which

766
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:15,338
"Richmond, with her ruins
and her unchanging spires,

767
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:18,675
"rests beneath a ghastly,
fitful glare.

768
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:21,010
"We are under the shadow
of ruins.

769
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,470
"From the pavements
where we walk

770
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,889
"stretches a vista
of devastation.

771
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,059
"The wreck, the loneliness
seem interminable.

772
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,853
"There is no sound of life

773
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,689
"but the stillness
of the catacomb,

774
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:36,693
"only as our footsteps fall dull
on the deserted sidewalk

775
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,403
"and a funeral troop
of echoes

776
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:43,408
"bump against the dead walls
and closed shutters in reply.

777
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,327
<i>"And this is Richmond,</i>

00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,705
"says a melancholy voice.

779
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:50,999
<i>And this is Richmond."</i>

780
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:01,217
On April 8th,

781
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,720
Abraham and Mary Lincoln
took a drive together

782
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:07,932
pasta country cemetery
on the outskirts of Petersburg.

783
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,729
Woman, as Mary: "It was a
retired place shaded by trees,

784
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:16,900
"and early spring flowers were
opening on nearly every grave.

785
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,068
"It was so quiet
and attractive

786
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,572
"that we stopped the carriage
and walked through it.

787
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:25,617
"Mr. Lincoln seemed
thoughtful and impressed.

788
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:27,243
"He said,

789
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,790
<i>"Mary, you are younger than I.
You will survive me.</i>

790
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,750
<i>"When I'm gone,</i>

791
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:37,796
<i>lay my remains in some
quiet place like this."</i>

792
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:45,637
"General Lee
was riding slowly

793
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:48,640
"along the line
of tangled wagons.

794
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:53,353
He rode erect,
as if incapable of fatigue."

795
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:00,235
Lee's army fled westward.

796
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,695
Grant was right behind them.

797
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,033
"On and on,
hour after hour,

798
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,952
"from hilltop to hilltop,

799
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,919
"the lines were alternately
forming, fighting,

800
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,080
"and retreating,

801
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:14,916
"making one
almost continuous battle.

802
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:18,336
"A boy soldier came running by
at the top of his speed.

803
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,797
"When asked why he was running,
he shouted back,

804
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:22,841
<i>I'm running
'cause I can't fly."</i>

805
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,595
From danville on April 4th,

806
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,806
Jefferson Davis
issued a proclamation

807
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:32,350
pledging to fight on.

808
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:37,146
Man, as Davis: "Relieved from the
necessity of guarding cities,

809
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,817
"with our army free to move
from point to point,

810
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:44,279
"nothing is now needed
to render our triumph certain

811
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:48,157
"but our own
unquenchable resolve.

812
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:52,745
No peace will ever be made
with the infamous invaders."

813
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,833
On April 6th at sayler's creek,

814
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,501
union cavalry and infantry

815
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:01,838
inflicted 6,000 casualties
on Lee's army

816
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,631
and captured 8 generals,

817
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:06,759
including Lee's own son
custis.

818
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:10,680
He now had fewer
than 25,000 men.

819
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:13,391
125,000 federal troops

820
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:17,353
were now closing in on Lee
from 3 sides.

821
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,983
Union general Phil Sheridan
wired Grant,

822
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,735
"if the thing is pressed,

823
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:25,904
I think
that Lee will surrender."

824
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:30,575
"Let the thing be pressed,"
Lincoln answered.

825
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,494
An officer urged Lee
to surrender.

826
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:37,874
The general asked what the country would
think of him if he failed to fight on.

827
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,001
"The country be damned,"
said the officer,

828
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,628
"there is no country.

829
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,756
"There has been no country
for a year or more.

830
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:48,009
You're the country
to these men."

831
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:50,637
"The few men who still
carried their muskets

832
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,640
"had hardly the appearance
of soldiers,

00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,184
"their clothes all tattered
and covered with mud,

834
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,978
"their eyes sunken
and lusterless,

835
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:01,564
"yet still they were waiting
for general Lee to say

836
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:04,484
where they were
to face about and fight."

837
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:07,946
Magnus Thompson,
35th Virginia cavalry battalion.

838
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,201
Lee's confederate
army was moving

839
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:15,870
along one side
of the appomattox river,

840
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:20,041
a Willow-fringed run
that any country boy could jump.

841
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:23,711
His pursuers clung
to the opposite bank.

842
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,684
Man, as Grant:
"5 P.M., April 7, 1865.

843
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,519
"General Lee,

844
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:41,771
"the result of last week
must convince you

845
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:44,899
"of the hopelessness
of further resistance.

846
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:47,860
"I regard it as my duty
to shift from myself

847
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,698
"the responsibility
of any further effusion of blood

848
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,158
"by asking of you
the surrender

849
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:57,495
"of that portion
of the confederate states army

850
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,707
known as the army
of northern Virginia."

851
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,917
Ulysses s. Grant.

852
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:06,921
On April 8th,

853
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:09,007
Grant again
flanked Lee's army

854
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,010
and captured two trainloads
of supplies.

855
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:17,056
The confederates were living
on handfuls of parched corn.

856
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:18,725
That night,

857
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:22,645
Lee and his weary lieutenants
gathered around a campfire

858
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,898
near the little village
of appomattox courthouse.

859
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,568
"We met in the woods
at his headquarters

860
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,737
"by a low-burning
bivouac fire.

861
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:34,741
"There was no tent, no table,
no chairs, no camp stools.

"On blankets spread
upon the ground

"or on saddles
at the roots of trees

we sat around
the great commander."

865
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,708
General John b. Gordon.

866
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:47,211
They were almost
entirely surrounded,

867
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,756
outnumbered nearly 5 to 1,

868
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:53,634
without hope
of resupply or reinforcement.

869
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,432
"By sunrise, we had reached
appomattox station,

870

"where we might
cut Lee's retreat.

871
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,772
"Already we heard the sharp ring
of the horse artillery.

872
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,565
"There was no mistake.

873
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,068
"Sheridan was square
across the enemy's front,

874
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,570
"holding at bay
all that was left

875
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:16,074
"of the proudest army
of the confederacy.

876
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,828
It had come at last--
the supreme hour."

877
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,041
April 9th was palm Sunday.

878
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:29,045
Lee ordered Gordon to make one
more attempt at breaking out.

879
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:32,799
At dawn, just outside
appomattox courthouse,

880
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,802
Gordon's men drove federal
cavalry from their positions

881
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:39,347
and swept forward
to the crest of a hill.

882
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:41,224
Below them,

883
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,976
a solid wall of blue
was advancing--

884
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:47,480
the entire union army
of the James.

885
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,692
Man, as Lee: "There is
nothing left for me to do

886
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,821
"but to go
and see general Grant,

887
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:58,366
and I would rather die
a thousand deaths."

888
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,702
Shortly before noon,

889
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,830
Lee dispatched a letter
under a white flag

890
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:06,541
into the union lines.

891
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,709
Grant was resting
in a field,

892
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,837
nursing a blinding headache.

893
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,131
Suddenly, a horseman
galloped up at full speed,

894
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,966
a reporter noted,

895
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:18,678
"waving his hat above his head
and shouting at every jump."

896
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,888
Grant opened the envelope,
looked at it,

897
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,099
then asked his friend
general John rawlins

898
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,560
to read it aloud--

899
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,854
Lee would surrender.

900
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,856
Grant himself said nothing,

901
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:32,441
betrayed no more emotion,
a witness said,

902
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,861
than "last year's
bird nest,"

903
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:38,698
but his headache
had instantly disappeared.

904
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:41,868
"No one looked
his comrade in the face.

905
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,453
"Finally colonel duff,
chief of artillery,

906
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,207
"sprang upon a log
and proposed 3 cheers.

907
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:51,711
"A feeble hurrah came
from a few throats,

908
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:54,922
when all broke down
in tears."

909
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:58,885
Lee dispatched
colonel Charles Marshall

910
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,344
to appomattox courthouse

911
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,929
to find a suitable building

912
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,098
in which he and Grant
might meet.

913
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:06,642
The streets
were almost deserted.

914
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,896
Marshall stopped the first
civilian he happened to see,

915
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,899
wilmer mclean,
who reluctantly agreed

916
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:16,819
to loan the armies his house
for the occasion.

917
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:19,113
"By a singular
coincidence,

918
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,866
"the meeting
of generals Lee and Grant

919
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,493
"took place in the house
of wilmer mclean,

920
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,205
"the same gentleman
who, in 1861,

921
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,998
"at the battle of bull run,

922
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,167
"had tendered his house
to general beauregard

923
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:32,919
"for headquarters.

924
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:35,129
"He removed from manassas
after the battle

925
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,673
"with the intention
of seeking some quiet nook

926
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,718
where the alarms of war
could never find him."

927
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,934
"1200 came.

928
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,019
"I turned about.

929
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:52,730
"There behind me appeared
a commanding form,

930
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,942
"superbly mounted,
richly accoutered,

931
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:59,070
"of imposing bearing,
noble countenance,

932
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:02,156
"with expression
of deep sadness

933
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,368
"over-mastered
by a deeper strength.

934
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:09,496
"It was no other
than Robert e. Lee.

935
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:11,958
"Not long after
appeared another form--

936
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:15,962
"plain, unassuming, simple,
and familiar to our eyes,

937
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,465
"but as awe-inspiring as Lee
in his splendor and sadness.

938
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:21,008
"It was Grant,

939
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,553
"sitting his saddle
with the ease of a born master,

940
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,097
"taking no notice of anything,

941
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:29,517
"all his faculties gathered
into intense thought.

942
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:33,104
"He seemed greater
than I had ever seen him,

943
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:36,524
a look as of another world
about him."

944
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:39,735
Lee arrived
at the mclean house first,

945
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,446
magnificent
in a crisp gray uniform,

946
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,283
an engraved sword
at his side.

947
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,244
"I have probably to be
general Grant's prisoner,"

948
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:49,829
he explained to an aide,

949
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:52,915
"and thought I must make
my best appearance."

950
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:57,169
He waited half an hour
for Grant to arrive.

951
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,172
The union commander wore
a private's dirty jacket.

952
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:03,134
His boots and trousers
were splattered with mud.

953
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:05,594
He had no sword.

954
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:09,015
The two commanders
shook hands.

955
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:12,560
Man, as Grant: "What general Lee's
feelings were, I do not know.

956
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,562
"As he was a man
of much dignity

957
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:16,230
"with an impassible face,

958
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:18,149
"his feelings
were entirely concealed

959
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,401
"from my observation,

960
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:23,571
"but my own feelings
were sad and depressed.

961
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:26,574
"I felt like anything
rather than rejoicing

962
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,034
"at the downfall of a foe

963
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,745
"who had fought
so long and valiantly

964
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,581
"and had suffered so much
for a cause,

965
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:35,791
"though that cause was,
i believe,

966
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:39,211
one of the worst for which
people ever fought."

967
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,219
Grant reminded Lee
that they had met once before

968
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,221
during the Mexican war.

969
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:53,225
Lee said he had not remembered
what Grant looked like.

970
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,977
Man, as Grant: "Our
conversation grew so pleasant

971
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:58,314
"that I almost forgot
the object of the meeting.

972
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:02,485
General Lee called my attention
to the object."

973
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:06,280
They knew each other.

974
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:10,201
Grant remembered Lee
very well.

975
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:12,870
Lee didn't quite
remember Grant.

976
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:14,705
That was understandable

977
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,624
from the time
that they were acquainted

978
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,667
back in the early days,

979
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,295
but I think
it was the sensitivity

980
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:24,840
that the two men
had for each other

981
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:28,386
and for the moment,

982
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:34,016
enormous dignity and yet
the necessary informality--

983
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:39,730
Grant not wanting to get
to the point too quickly,

984
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,858
Lee bringing him up shortly

985
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,153
to the point
of why they're together;

986
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:52,159
Lee dressed
in his last good uniform,

987
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,913
Grant apologizing that
he was rushing from the field

988
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,000
and didn't have time to change;

989
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:05,005
the scribe being unable
to hold the pen steady

990
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,426
and having it taken
by another soldier;

991
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,803
the...

992
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:15,182
That, from Lee's point of view,
awful moment,

993
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,601
and from Grant's point
of view, glorious moment,

994
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:24,525
and yet for the two of them,
a sad and quiet moment;

995
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:26,861
and Lee taking his leave

996
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:31,073
and doffing his hat
from traveller

997
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:36,579
and riding back to his troops

998
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:41,417
after securing
those reasonable terms.

999
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:42,918
It was the--
it was the beginning

1000
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,921
of the unification
of the country.

1001
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:49,925
The terms Grant offered
were simple and generous.

1002
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,427
Confederate officers

1003
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:54,597
could keep their side-arms
and personal possessions.

1004
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:57,349
Officers and men
who owned their own horses

1005
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,268
could keep them, too.

1006
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:01,729
It was planting season.

1007
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:04,398
Grant asked Lee
how many men he had

1008
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,984
and if they needed
any rations.

1009
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,904
Lee said he no longer knew
the size of his army,

1010
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,740
but he was sure
all his men were hungry.

1011
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:16,327
Grant offered
25,000 rations.

1012
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:19,663
Man, as Lee: "This will have
the best effect upon my men.

1013
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,040
"It will be
very gratifying

1014
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:24,835
and do much toward
conciliating our people."

1015
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:27,004
Colonel ely s. Parker,

1016
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,757
a seneca Indian
and a member of Grant's staff,

1017
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:31,759
inscribed the articles
of surrender

1018
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:34,512
for the two commanders
to sign.

1019
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:37,932
The two men
shook hands again.

1020
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,435
Lee left the house,
mounted traveller,

1021
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:44,772
and started
back toward his army.

1022
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:48,484
The union soldiers
began to cheer.

1023
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:50,361
Grant ordered them to stop.

1024
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,128
"The confederates
are now our prisoners,"

1025
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,489
he explained,

1026
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:57,117
"and we do not want to exult
over their downfall.

1027
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,370
"The war is over.

1028
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:02,706
The rebels are
our countrymen again."

1029
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:09,380
Lee's men lined the road
to his camp.

1030
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:10,798
"As he approached,

1031
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,800
"we could see
the reins hanging loose,

1032
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:15,302
"and his head was sunk
low on his breast.

1033
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,804
"As the men
began to cheer,

1034
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:19,807
"he raised his head,
and, hat in hand, he passed by,

1035
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:23,811
his face flushed,
his eyes ablaze."

1036
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,814
"As he passed,
they raised their heads

1037
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,400
"and looked upon him
with swimming eyes.

1038
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:33,654
"Those who could find voice
said good-bye.

1039
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:35,281
"Those who
could not speak

1040
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:39,118
passed their hands gently
over the sides of traveller."

1041
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,914
"If one army drank
the joy of victory

1042
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,959
"and the other
the bitter draught of defeat,

1043
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:50,838
"it was a joy moderated
by the recollection of the cost

1044
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:52,840
"at which
it had been purchased

1045
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:54,675
"and a defeat mollified

1046
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:57,636
"by the consciousness
of many triumphs.

1047
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:00,848
"If the Victors could recall
a malvern hill, an antietam,

1048
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,392
"a gettysburg, a five forks,

1049
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:07,313
"the vanquished could recall
a manassas, a fredericksburg,

1050
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:11,025
a chancellorsville,
a cold harbor."

1051
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:17,406
A crowd of soldiers
waited in front of Lee's tent.

1052
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:20,034
"Boys," he told them,

1053
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,453
"i have done
the best I could for you.

1054
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,455
"Go home now,

1055
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:27,916
"and if you make as good
citizens as you have soldiers,

1056
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,835
"you will do well,

1057
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:32,379
"and I shall
always be proud of you.

1058
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:36,425
Good-bye,
and god bless you all."

1059
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:40,137
He turned and disappeared
into his tent.

1060
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,609
The formal surrender
came 3 days later.

1061
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,903
General John b. Gordon,

1062
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:59,198
shot through the face
and wounded 4 more times

1063
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:01,492
in the service
of the confederacy,

1064
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:05,579
led 20,000 men toward the union
lines for the last time--

1065
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:08,165
not to fight,
but to stack their arms

1066
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,876
and surrender
their battle flags.

1067
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:12,920
There to receive them

1068
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:16,507
was major general
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain,

1069
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:19,802
himself wounded six times
for the union.

1070
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,221
Promoted on the field
at Petersburg near death,

1071
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:25,766
he had somehow survived.

1072
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:27,935
"On they come

1073
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:31,355
"with the old swinging route
step and swaying battle flags.

1074
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:33,232
"Before us
in proud humiliation

1075
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:35,109
"stood the embodiment
of manhood--

1076
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,944
"thin, worn, and famished,

1077
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:40,531
"but erect and with eyes
looking level into ours,

1078
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:44,868
"waking memories that bound us
together as no other bond.

1079
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:47,079
"Was not such manhood
to be welcomed back

1080
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:51,250
"into the union
so tested and assured?

1081
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,961
"On our part, not a sound
of trumpet more

1082
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,964
"nor roll of drum,
not a cheer nor word

1083
01:01:57,131 --> 01:02:01,636
"nor whisper of vainglorying
nor motion of man,

1084
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:05,556
"but an awed stillness, rather,
and breath-holding,

1085
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:08,183
as if it were
the passing of the dead."

1086
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,227
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.

1087
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:17,776
Now Chamberlain made
an extraordinary gesture.

1088
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:20,070
"Chamberlain called his men
into line,

1089
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,322
"and as my men marched
in front of them,

1090
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:24,992
"the veterans in blue
gave a soldierly salute

1091
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:28,662
"to those
vanquished heroes,

1092
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:32,207
a token of respect
from Americans to Americans."

1093
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,251
General John b. Gordon.

1094
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:39,006
"At the sound of that
machine-like snap of arms,

1095
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:41,258
"general Gordon started,

1096
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,469
"then wheeled his horse,
facing me,

1097
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:45,220
"touching him gently
with the spur

1098
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:48,015
"so that the animal
slightly reared,

1099
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:53,020
"and, as he wheeled,
horse and rider made one motion.

1100
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:56,023
"The horses head swung down
with a graceful bow,

1101
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:59,526
"and general Gordon dropped
his sword point to his toe

1102
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,737
in salutation."

1103
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:16,960
In Washington,
fireworks filled the sky.

1104
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,129
A great crowd gathered
around the white house

1105
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,256
and called for Lincoln.

1106
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,675
He was too weary
to make a formal speech

1107
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:26,678
but asked the band
to play Dixie.

1108
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:32,267
"I have always thought it one of the
best tunes I ever heard," he said.

1109
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:33,811
The next day,

1110
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:36,480
Lincoln walked over
to Alexander gardner's studio

1111
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:38,690
at the corner
of 7th and d street

1112
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,984
to sit for another portrait.

1113
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,488
Somehow, the glass-plate
negative cracked

1114
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,615
while being developed.

1115
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:48,742
The photographer
made a single print,

1116
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,661
then threw the negative away.

1117
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:52,621
Over the next 4 years,

1118
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:57,501
there would be plenty of time
to make more Lincoln portraits.

1119
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,628
Just a few blocks away,

1120
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:03,465
a friend found John wilkes booth
alone in his darkened room

1121
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:06,635
and asked him if he wanted
to get a drink.

1122
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:08,262
"Yes," said booth,

1123
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:11,557
who was now drinking
a quart of Brandy a day,

1124
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:14,935
"anything to drive away
the blues."

1125
01:04:14,959 --> 01:05:14,959
