1
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:23,257
Are you okay?

2
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:57,559
- You are a lifesaver.
- Yeah, man.

3
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:00,354
- We can't thank you enough.
- No, hey, mad props.

4
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:02,439
I could have sworn the guy said south.

5
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:05,192
But then all of a sudden
we're off the main road.

6
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,362
I'm trying to read the map while
driving, a bonehead manoeuvre.

7
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,490
And then all of a sudden, bam,
we're in that ditch.

8
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,243
Yeah, bam. I'm like,
"What the hell?" You know?

9
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:18,122
Yes. Oh, yes, and my coffee mug.
Of coffee? My mug of coffee.

10
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,084
It spills all over my pants, I mean...
Just a nightmare.

11
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:25,212
There's your Sony GPS,
I mean, for real.

12
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:41,353
Let's just...

13
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:52,614
Like I said,
we couldn't be more grateful.

14
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,548
Can't we just dump them here?

15
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,592
What, and somebody finds them?

16
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,843
Then what?

17
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:15,512
People have seen us.

18
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:22,853
Hey, you're gonna flood it, man.

19
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:25,731
I'm not gonna flood it.
She's not gonna flood, all right?

20
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,275
We're just gonna stay positive, right?

21
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,069
We're gonna clean up this mess.

22
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,112
And you, start.

23
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:34,656
Goddamn it. See, you flooded it.

24
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:36,158
All right.

25
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,870
All right. You know what?
The RV is going to start now.

26
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,705
The RV is going to start right now.

27
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:44,374
It's gonna start.
We're gonna drive it to your house.

28
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,626
- My house?
- Your house.

29
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,378
We're gonna drive it over there
and park it overnight.

30
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:50,923
- And then tomorrow...
- Man, not my house.

31
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,718
Shut up. Shut up.

32
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:09,858
After we finish
cleaning up this mess...

33
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,111
...we will go our separate ways.

34
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,155
Our paths will never cross.

35
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:17,616
And we will tell this to no one.

36
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,618
Understood?

37
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:23,956
Oh, what, I can talk now?

38
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,461
Fine. That goes double for me.

39
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,342
Okay. Okay.

40
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:37,344
Be good to me.

41
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,268
Yes!

42
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,567
Yes. Okay. Okay.

43
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,152
Thank you.

44
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,798
Oh, shit.

45
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:44,203
Walt?

46
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,582
You coming out?

47
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:59,468
Yeah, absolutely.

48
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:02,429
<i>We've got looky-loos</i>
<i>in both directions, Dan. </i>

49
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:05,057
<i>Better plan on being late</i>
<i>if you're going to work. </i>

50
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:09,853
<i>This is Lisa in the Skycopter, we'll have</i>
<i>more Albuquerque traffic on the hour. </i>

51
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:14,066
Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?

52
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,862
We had a faculty meeting
last Thursday...

53
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:22,699
...and the topic was
senior-class photos...

54
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:25,494
...and how we had instituted
a new rule last year...

55
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,622
...that seniors are allowed
to have photos taken...

56
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,999
...by a photographer of their choice.

57
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,627
You know, not necessarily
the photographer...

58
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:36,505
...that the school hires, right? So...

59
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:41,343
So anyway,
some of the senior girls...

60
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:46,598
...were going to that Glamour Shots
place to have their photos taken.

61
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,227
And now they're bringing us
all these photos...

62
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:52,354
...and Joan Everman...
You know Joan.

63
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:54,648
- Suddenly has to go through
all the photos...

64
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:58,527
...and turn them down
because they show cleavage.

65
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:04,491
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetie?

66
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:06,618
Yeah. I'm good.

67
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:07,953
Okay.

68
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:12,541
You know, even the
small-busted girls have cleavage.

69
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,881
Apparently there's some new type of
brassiere or something.

70
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,716
The Wonderbra.

71
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:23,969
It's the Wonderbra.

72
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:25,763
Yeah?

73
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:28,557
Okay.

74
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:35,439
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,</i>
<i>Skyler and Walter Jr. </i>

75
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:39,026
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,</i>
<i>so please leave us a message.</i>

76
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:42,571
<i>Hello, Mr. White.</i>
<i>This is AT& T calling. </i>

77
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,824
<i>Are you happy with your current</i>
<i>long-distance service?</i>

78
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,119
<i>Because if you're not,</i>
<i>I would definitely really, really love...</i>

79
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:51,497
<i>...to talk to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible about...</i>

80
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,582
Hello, this is Walter White speaking.

81
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,793
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

82
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:57,628
You said he would die any minute.

83
00:07:57,836 --> 00:08:01,090
Listen, I am having breakfast
with my family right now...

84
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:04,218
...and I really don't appreciate
these sales calls.

85
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:06,804
<i>Well, too bad, man,</i>
<i>because guess what. </i>

86
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,222
<i>He's still not dead. </i>

87
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,099
I went and put my ear to the RV.

88
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:13,310
I can hear him, like,
rolling around in there, all right?

89
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,772
I think he's awake, man.
I think he's trying to get loose.

90
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,108
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>
<i>I'm freaking out here.</i>

91
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:22,027
- Calm down, damn it.
<i>- You gonna heIp me clean this up?</i>

92
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,322
- We got loose ends here.
- Calm down.

93
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:27,116
I will be there after school.

94
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,368
<i>After school. Are you shitting me?</i>

95
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,578
Ditch it, man. Call in sick.

96
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:34,415
Listen, that is just
not gonna work for me.

97
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:36,250
I'm not interested in that at all.

98
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,753
And I would appreciate it
if you don't call here anymore.

99
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:43,465
Damn. They're so annoying,
those people.

100
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:51,056
- You have a good day, sweetie.
- Okay, Mom. You too.

101
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,975
Bye, honey.

102
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:59,940
- Drive safe.
- Okay.

103
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:17,124
<i>Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3</i>
<i>to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.</i>

104
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:20,961
<i>What up, beyotch?</i>
<i>Leave it at the tone.</i>

105
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:39,772
So the term "chiral"...

106
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,317
...derives from the
Greek word "hand. "

107
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:49,490
Now, the concept here being that just
as your left hand and your right hand...

108
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:54,119
...are mirror images of one another,
right, identical and yet opposite...

109
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:57,206
...well, so, too,
organic compounds can exist...

110
00:09:57,414 --> 00:10:01,126
...as mirror-image forms
of one another...

111
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,337
...all the way down
at the molecular level.

112
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:07,132
But although they may
look the same...

113
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,677
...they don't always behave the same.

114
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:13,013
For instance...

115
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:17,434
For instance.

116
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,772
I'm sorry. For instance...

117
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,524
Thalidomide.

118
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:28,445
The right-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

119
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:30,572
...is a perfectly fine, good medicine...

120
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:33,659
...to give to a pregnant woman
to prevent morning sickness.

121
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,579
But make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman...

122
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:42,126
...the left-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

123
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:47,965
...and her child will be born
with horrible birth defects.

124
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,511
Which is precisely what happened
in the 1950s.

125
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:58,892
So chiral, chirality,
mirrored images, right?

126
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:03,605
Active, inactive, good, bad.

127
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:08,318
So.

128
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:11,321
- Yes, Ben.
- Is this gonna be on the murder?

129
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:15,325
What?

130
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:17,953
Is this gonna be on the midterm?

131
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,042
Chirality on the midterm?
No, no. Well, maybe.

132
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:28,464
Maybe. Yes, you know...
But prepare for it to be on the midterm.

133
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:30,883
Can't hurt to know it, right? So...

134
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,343
Knowledge is power.

135
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:51,422
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No.

136
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:00,848
Not good. Not good, not good.

137
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:21,326
What the...?

138
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:44,641
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

139
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,643
Hey, listen, you.

140
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:48,520
No, no, no!

141
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,068
Oh, God.

142
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:41,990
Okay.

143
00:14:58,215 --> 00:15:00,092
MILFs?

144
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:02,594
The hell is a MILF?

145
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,241
Now what?

146
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:29,955
Lock the other one out in the RV.

147
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:31,915
He's:

148
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:33,250
- You're sure?
- Yes.

149
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:34,960
- You're positive?
- You know what?

150
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,796
- Feel free to go check.
- Good idea. Maybe I should...

151
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,215
...before he, too, wanders off
down the street.

152
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:42,801
- Okay, you know what? I am sick...
- All right.

153
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,386
Just...

154
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:47,389
The one downstairs,
tell me about him.

155
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:51,059
Oh, come on. Anything. Something.
Start with his name, at least.

156
00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:52,561
Krazy-8.

157
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,355
Krazy-8.
What the hell does that even mean?

158
00:15:55,564 --> 00:16:00,152
I don't know, man, okay? It means,
like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

159
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,280
So you work with him regularly.

160
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:05,449
No, not him so much.

161
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:08,327
- His cousin, mainly.
- Who's his cousin?

162
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:11,371
- The guy out in the RV.
- All right, all right, all right.

163
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,083
Krazy-8's one level higher.

164
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,751
One level higher.

165
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,588
Yeah, you know.
Not, like, street level. Higher.

166
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:22,633
You know how there's, like,
a Starbucks on every corner?

167
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:26,470
Krazy-8 is like the dude that sells
Starbucks' beans.

168
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:28,263
Okay, so he's a distributor.

169
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:33,852
Okay, so is he? I mean, is?

170
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:38,649
In other words,
what is his reputation for violence?

171
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:44,071
Well, he did try to kill us both
yesterday, so there's that.

172
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,574
Look, what I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?

173
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:51,203
He's a businessman.
He's a man of business.

174
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:53,622
It would therefore
seem to follow that he is...

175
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:57,584
...capable of acting out of
mutual self-interest, yes?

176
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,294
What?

177
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:04,174
Do you think he is capable
of listening to reason?

178
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:08,095
What kind of reason? You mean,
"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen...

179
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:11,974
...if I let you go, you promise not to
come back and waste my entire family?

180
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:14,518
No Colombian neckties?"
That kind of reason?

181
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:18,480
No, man, I can't say as I have high
fucking hopes where that's concerned.

182
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,488
What was that?

183
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:28,657
What was what?

184
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,666
We didn't tie him up.

185
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,586
- Why the hell didn't we tie him up?
- Oh, God.

186
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:44,465
- Because he was out cold.
- Yeah, but what if he's faking it?

187
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:48,927
You know, like, if it was me,
I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo.

188
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:53,599
And then, when the coast is clear,
I'd be up looking for weapons and shit.

189
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,934
Ready to pounce.

190
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,335
No, see. Now, if it was me...

191
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:24,046
...and I couldn't find
a decent enough weapon...

192
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:27,883
...I would just lie back down
and bide my time.

193
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:24,022
So now what do we do?

194
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:34,533
You keep asking me that
like you think I have some answer.

195
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,619
- Well, you gotta do something.
- We.

196
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:41,081
We have got to do something,
and I am open to suggestions.

197
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,751
Man, okay,
this whole thing was your deal.

198
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,753
Don't you dare put that on me.

199
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:49,214
You brought those guys out there.
This is your responsibility.

200
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,717
Like I came to you,
begging to cook meth.

201
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:56,346
"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude I know,
you wanna come cook crystal?" Please.

202
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:58,223
I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny...

203
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:01,185
...but her wheelchair wouldn't fit
in the RV.

204
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:10,402
What about the phosphate gas?

205
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:13,113
Phosphine gas. What about it?

206
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,908
I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

207
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,660
You know, with, like,
a delayed reaction or something?

208
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:22,456
I don't know.

209
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:25,125
- You're supposed to be a scientist.
- Look.

210
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:29,588
This isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.

211
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:33,217
We have got a body in that RV.
And it's getting warmer outside.

212
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:34,676
Understand?

213
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:38,097
And we have got to
do something about that soon.

214
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,557
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

215
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:45,562
Now, that last part
is very, very important.

216
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:50,692
Therefore, it seems to me...

217
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:56,448
...that our best course of action
would be chemical disincorporation.

218
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:02,746
Dissolving in strong acid.

219
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:12,297
Oh, man, that's messed up.

220
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:16,468
I mean, you're not serious.

221
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,431
You serious?

222
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:29,356
Well, who's gonna do that?

223
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:31,442
And don't look at me.

224
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:35,863
I guess we'll both do it together.

225
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:39,199
No, Mr. White, okay,
I'm not good with dead bodies.

226
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:44,621
Look, we are in this fifty-fifty. Okay?

227
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:52,671
I guess the only other fair way
to go about this would be...

228
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,885
...that one of us deals with
the body situation...

229
00:21:58,093 --> 00:22:04,391
...while the other one of us deals with
the Krazy-8 situation.

230
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:14,985
In a scenario like this,
I don't suppose it is bad form...

231
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:19,615
...to just flip a coin.

232
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:31,001
- Heads or tails?
- No, I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

233
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,962
Heads or tails?

234
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:44,932
Heads. Heads.

235
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:04,701
Best two out of three?

236
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:27,725
<i>Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3</i>
<i>to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.</i>

237
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:31,562
<i>What up, beyotch?</i>
<i>Leave it at the tone.</i>

238
00:23:32,438 --> 00:23:35,274
<i>Hey, Mr. White, it's me. Pick up. </i>

239
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:38,193
<i>I got a container question. </i>

240
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:42,197
<i>Hello, Mr. White.</i>
<i>Pick up the phone, man. </i>

241
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:44,700
- Yes.
- Yo, what kind of plastic, man?

242
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:47,953
<i>Polyethylene.</i>

243
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,456
How the hell am I
supposed to know that?

244
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:52,124
Because I told you.

245
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:59,006
Look, just look at the bottom
for a triangle...

246
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:01,467
...stamped LDPE.

247
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:03,552
<i>It should be moulded into the plastic. </i>

248
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:06,263
Yeah, yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got it.

249
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:10,768
I don't know, man.
This feels kind of flimsy.

250
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:13,437
Any decent acid's
gonna eat right through this.

251
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:16,148
- Not hydrofluoric.
- Why not?

252
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:22,654
Look, you skipped, clowned around...

253
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:26,575
...or otherwise jerked off
through every lecture I ever gave.

254
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:29,995
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

255
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:33,665
Oh, okay, be a dick about it. Jesus.

256
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:40,380
So, hey, have you done the thing?

257
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:48,597
Yeah, I'm working up to it.

258
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:55,854
You know what?
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

259
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:59,942
You know, not even if you took him
to the hospital right now.

260
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:03,404
Now, if it was me,
I would just try and think of it...

261
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:07,241
...like I was doing him a favour.

262
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:35,310
<i>I need a cheque approval</i>
<i>on checkstand eight. </i>

263
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,356
<i>Approval on checkstand eight, please.</i>
<i>Thank you. </i>

264
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:54,037
Yeah.

265
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:21,166
Who's there?

266
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,923
What, you fucking break in?
Show me who's there.

267
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,596
Yeah. I see you.

268
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:39,059
What you gonna do?

269
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:41,812
Hey.

270
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:44,648
Hey...!

271
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:51,155
Hey.

272
00:27:51,864 --> 00:27:53,949
I need water.

273
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,869
Hey, hello.

274
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:00,622
Bring me some water, would you?

275
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,418
Please.

276
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:20,869
You don't like the crust?

277
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:33,882
Where's my cousin Emilio?

278
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:40,806
He dead?

279
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:06,874
Oh, I'm a coward.

280
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,133
Hey, Mr. White. Hey, Mr. White?

281
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:41,260
Oh, fuck.

282
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:48,934
Are you smoking weed? Oh, my God.

283
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:51,854
Wait a minute, is that my weed?

284
00:31:53,397 --> 00:31:57,484
What the hell, man? Make yourself
at home, why don't you?

285
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:04,950
- So, what'd you end up buying?
- Nothing.

286
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:10,497
No store in town sells a plastic bin
big enough for a body.

287
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:15,419
I don't suppose
you could buy two bins?

288
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:19,465
And just:

289
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:22,259
Legs in one, torso in the other?

290
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:25,262
Oh, God.

291
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,849
I don't suppose
you could kiss my ass?

292
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:39,068
So...

293
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,279
...how'd it go?

294
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:52,956
- You didn't do it?
- Not yet.

295
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:56,835
Oh, God.

296
00:32:58,253 --> 00:33:00,964
- Oh, damn. I gotta go.
- Hey, hey.

297
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:04,093
What? No, no, no. Come back here.

298
00:33:04,301 --> 00:33:07,721
- Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
- Tomorrow.

299
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:10,015
I've got a doctor's appointment.
I gotta go.

300
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:13,602
Look, stay away from him.
He's awake.

301
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,191
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

302
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:23,237
We flipped a coin.

303
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:30,828
We're good?

304
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:35,582
We're very good.
We're excellent, I'd say.

305
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:44,133
Oh, would you look at that face?
Smile, peanut.

306
00:33:47,845 --> 00:33:50,389
So who's up for knowing?

307
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:55,853
It's...

308
00:33:57,312 --> 00:33:58,355
Yeah.

309
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:01,442
- Girl.
- Girl?

310
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,695
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

311
00:34:08,574 --> 00:34:11,535
Oh, God. Can I tell you,
that's exactly what I was hoping.

312
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:13,412
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

313
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:16,623
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

314
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:21,420
Looking fabulous. Let me see
if they're done with the blood sugar...

315
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:25,132
...then we'll get you out of here.
I'll be right back.

316
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:54,411
Who's Jesse Pinkman?

317
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:05,047
- Jesse?
- Jesse Pinkman.

318
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:09,426
He called just this morning.

319
00:35:09,676 --> 00:35:12,388
- Walt, please don't deny it.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

320
00:35:12,596 --> 00:35:16,141
It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

321
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,186
- Was he one of your students?
- Yeah.

322
00:35:19,395 --> 00:35:22,940
He was nobody.

323
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:28,695
Who is he to you? Why is he calling?
What is this big secret...

324
00:35:28,904 --> 00:35:33,742
...you seem to be discussing
with some druggie burnout?

325
00:35:36,453 --> 00:35:40,165
You don't come home last night until 2
in the morning. You don't tell me...

326
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:45,838
...where you've been. You spent
the entire night in the bathroom, Walt.

327
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:51,927
Tell me what's going on with you.
Don't you think you owe me that?

328
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,225
Who is this Jesse Pinkman to you?

329
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:05,315
He sells me pot.

330
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:12,698
- He sells you pot?
- Marijuana, yeah.

331
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:17,411
Not a lot. I mean, I don't know.

332
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:21,123
I kind of like it.

333
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:26,211
Are you out of your mind?
What are you, like, 16 years old?

334
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,592
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
What is wrong with you?

335
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,679
Look, Skyler...

336
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:43,604
...I just haven't
quite been myself lately.

337
00:36:44,396 --> 00:36:48,859
- Yeah. No shit. Thanks for noticing.
- I haven't been myself lately...

338
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:51,153
...but I love you.

339
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:57,076
Nothing about that has changed.
Nothing ever will.

340
00:36:57,326 --> 00:37:00,287
So right now, what I need...

341
00:37:00,496 --> 00:37:04,750
...is for you to climb down
out of my ass.

342
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:11,799
Can you do that?
Will you do that for me, honey?

343
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:17,429
Will you please, just once,
get off my ass?

344
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:19,473
You know.

345
00:37:19,848 --> 00:37:24,144
I'd appreciate it. I really would.

346
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:46,500
Stop.

347
00:37:57,553 --> 00:38:00,764
Stop in 15 minutes.

348
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:29,334
<i>Your face is too sharp. </i>

349
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:40,387
<i>Powder. Powder!</i>
<i>Take a powder, go on. </i>

350
00:38:43,307 --> 00:38:47,561
<i>Nice. Beautiful talcum powder. </i>
<i>Lucky you, number eight. </i>

351
00:38:50,606 --> 00:38:53,442
Just meat,
it's all just a bunch of meat.

352
00:39:00,115 --> 00:39:02,534
Oh, Jesus.

353
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:08,165
You're cool, you're cool.

354
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:12,711
You're all good, you're all...
You're all good. You know it.

355
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,050
It's fine. It's just a bunch of meat.
Come on. You're good.

356
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:41,573
Excuse me.

357
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:48,622
Excuse me. You. Yes, you.
May I talk to you?

358
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,502
Hey, hey, hey.
This is private property.

359
00:39:53,752 --> 00:39:56,505
- Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.
- No, not interested.

360
00:39:56,755 --> 00:40:00,759
- Come on.
- Hey, don't touch me. Do not touch me.

361
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:03,053
All right. Look, not touching.
Not touching.

362
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:05,931
Look, lady, whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, yo.

363
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:12,813
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
My husband is Walter White, yo.

364
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:15,899
He told me everything.

365
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,153
- Seriously?
- That's right.

366
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:25,617
And just so you know,
my brother-in-law is a DEA agent...

367
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:31,665
...and I will not hesitate to call him.
Not if I have to. Understood?

368
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,961
This is your one and only warning.

369
00:40:36,211 --> 00:40:40,215
Do not sell marijuana to my husband.

370
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:46,346
- Okay.
- I mean it. Don't call our house again.

371
00:40:46,555 --> 00:40:51,060
You stay away from him,
or you will be one sorry individual.

372
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:56,607
- You get me?
- I think so, yeah.

373
00:40:56,815 --> 00:41:00,527
No more marijuana. I can dig it.

374
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:04,073
You can dig it. Wonderful.

375
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:18,003
Not that it's any of my business,
but you might wanna consider...

376
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:20,172
...a different line of work.

377
00:41:20,798 --> 00:41:22,382
Okay.

378
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,982
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go to your house, you know.

379
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:27,322
Makes perfect sense. Let's
completely screw up your house...

380
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:32,286
...so you never wanna spend another
night in it. Sure. You know, why not?

381
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:40,627
Yeah, and how's about
I send over my psycho-bitch wife...

382
00:42:40,836 --> 00:42:43,547
...to, you know, break your balls
and threaten you?

383
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:45,716
God, that would be hilarious,
you know.

384
00:42:45,924 --> 00:42:48,218
And then, you know,
the killer in the basement...

385
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:51,513
...the one who's completely
my responsibility...

386
00:42:51,722 --> 00:42:54,933
...hell, let's just
let him live down there.

387
00:42:55,142 --> 00:43:00,689
Just, I don't know, make sure
to feed him, like, three times a day.

388
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:06,945
Sure, why not? It's been really amazing.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.

389
00:43:07,446 --> 00:43:11,825
I always dreamt about, I don't know,
melting bodies.

390
00:43:35,057 --> 00:43:37,476
You got a brother
in the goddamn DEA?

391
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:42,981
- What?
- You said you were...

392
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,861
...just doing some ride-along. Yes or
no, do you have a brother in the DEA?

393
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:52,699
- He's a brother-in-law.
- Well, there's a load off my mind.

394
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,076
Where did you hear that?

395
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:58,163
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up in my shit.

396
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:02,251
Yeah, that's right.
She almost caught me moving Emilio.

397
00:44:03,293 --> 00:44:05,546
Good job on
wearing the pants in the family.

398
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,799
And why'd you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

399
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:12,803
Because somehow
it seemed preferable...

400
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:17,433
...to admitting that I cook crystal meth
and killed a man.

401
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:27,484
Is that what I think it is?

402
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:31,363
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl.
So what? My house, my rules.

403
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:33,866
Hey, no, no.
Don't give me that, okay?

404
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:38,579
I held up my end. I already took care of
Emilio. You're still diddling around...

405
00:44:38,787 --> 00:44:41,248
...trying to get your nut up.
- Yeah, well, boo-hoo.

406
00:44:41,457 --> 00:44:43,375
I have the truly awful job here.

407
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,627
You wanna talk awful?
You wanna go there?

408
00:44:45,836 --> 00:44:49,965
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink
up a flight of stairs.

409
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:52,384
I barely got him in the bathtub.

410
00:44:52,885 --> 00:44:56,013
Bathtub, what?
What do you mean, bathtub?

411
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:58,807
Another thing. Why you got me
running around town...

412
00:44:59,016 --> 00:45:01,310
...trying to find
some stupid piece of plastic...

413
00:45:01,518 --> 00:45:03,729
...when I have a perfectly good tub
I can use?

414
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:09,902
Oh, God.

415
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:12,613
Hey. Hey.

416
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:10,879
I'm sorry, what were you asking me?
Oh, yes.

417
00:46:11,088 --> 00:46:15,300
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

418
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:19,096
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

419
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:25,811
It will, however, dissolve metal,
rock, glass, ceramic.

420
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:28,147
So there's that.

421
00:46:45,038 --> 00:46:47,124
Okay, here we go.

422
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:55,841
Okay.

423
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:03,182
Here I go.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
