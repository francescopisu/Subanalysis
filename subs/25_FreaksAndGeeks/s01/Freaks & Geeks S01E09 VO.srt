00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,700
Hey, lindsay,

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,200
Do you ever think about heavy stuff?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,100
"Heavy stuff"?

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,100
Like...death and the meaning of life?

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,600
Well, yeah.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,600
When my grandmother died,

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,600
I was pretty depressed.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,100
I took it pretty hard.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,600
Yeah, yeah. No, yeah.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,100
I knew that u were like me.

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,100
I can't even talk to those otheruys.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,100
Ken and daniel,they don't think aboutand
they don't they're jokethink about...

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,700
Why we're here

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,700
And they don't think
about the they don't think-

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,400
The point of it all.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,900
Are you stoned?

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,900
A little bit.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,400
Do you wanna smoke?

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,900
No, thanks.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, ok.

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh. Hey, you know whatwhere

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,700

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,700
I thought d, but what i'm saying

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,200
Is that where is he?

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,700
Like, is he in the ground
rotting away somewhere,

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,700
Or maybe he's up in heaven...

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,200
Partying with jimi and janis.

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,200
Look at you. you were so cute.

30
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,200
Yeah. That's the, uh...

31
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,300
That's the year i won mvp.

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Well, who's this?

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
That's me.

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,000
No.

35
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,000
Who's this girl?

36
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,000
That's heidi henderson.

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,500
I went out with her for a while

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,500
Before you came along.

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,700
Who's lincoln?

57
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Our rivals.

58
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,200
We made regionals. isn't that cool?

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,700
In what?

60
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,700
Basketball.

61
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,200
Will you stop jerking it out of my hand?

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
You're gonna rip it.

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,700
God.

64
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
Hey.

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,100
Did you guys hear about the basketball game?

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
Pretty exciting.

67
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,100
I'm so sick of all this
rah-rah crap everywhere.

68
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,600
These jocks think they're such badasses,

69
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Walking around like they cured cancer.

70
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,100
They're just monkeys.

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Hey, guys.

72
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,600
Hey. hey.

73
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Where's lover boy?

74
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,500
Nick? I don't know.

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,000
I thought you two re joined
at the tongue or something.

76
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,500
Hey, kim, can i talk to you for a second?

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,500
Woo... woo...

78
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Are you pregnant?

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey! no!

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
Don't be such a pig.

81
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
God. She wants to talk to me.

82
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Excuse us.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,300
So...are you pregnant?

84
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
No.

85
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm thinking of breaking up with nick.

86
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Why?

87
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,200
I like him, but he's just...

88
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
He's really intense, kim,

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,700
And he's always stoned.

90
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,700
I just don't...

91
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
Something just isn't right.

92
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,700
Don't do it, lindsay.

93
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,700
What?

94
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,700
Let me straighten him out.

95
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,200
I'll beat some sense into him.

96
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,700
It'll be fine.

97
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,600
No. Kim, don't.

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,600
I'll figure itut. it's not a big deal.

99
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,100
Ok, just don't break up with him.

100
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,100
The last time nick got dumped...

101
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,600
He kinda went a little berserk.

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
You mean with heidi henderson?

103
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
He told you about that?

104
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,500
No.

105
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,100
What happened?

106
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,100
No, nothing. Nothing.

107
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
I don't even know, really.

108
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,600
Hello.

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I've been looking all over for you.

110
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Well, here i am.

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
I'll see you guys later, then.

112
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Ok. Bye. ok.

113
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
Hey, cindy.

114
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,800
What are you doing?

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,300
We decided to decorate the players' lockers

116
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,300
To pump them up for the big game.

117
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,300
Ok.

118
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,300
If this was your locker,
would you be pumped?

119
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,700
Yeah, i'd be really pumped.

120
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,000
Do you think todd will be pumped

121
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,000
'Cause it's his locker.

122
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,400
Well, i think it looks really good.

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
All the other girls wanted to do it,

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,300
So i had to beg them to let me.

125
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,600
Oh, my god. here he comes.

126
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey, todd.

127
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,500
Me and all the cheerleaders

128
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
Wanted to pump you up for the big game.

129
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,500
Cool.

130
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,500
Um, i'll take that. sorry.

131
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,500
Later.

132
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
He didn't seem very pumped.

133
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,600
If i were him, i'd be really happy.

134
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,100
I think it was really nice what you did.

135
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,600
Thanks, sam. you're sweet.

136
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,400
Do you remember how i told you

137
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I had a crush on todd?

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,900
Yeah.

139
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Well, i don't.

140
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,900
You don't?

141
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
No.

142
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,400
It's not, like, a crush.

143
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,400
It's, like, an obsession.

144
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,700
Chewin' tobacco, chewin' tobacco

145
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,700
Spit, spit, spit!

146
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,700
We make lincoln look like

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,200
Shift to the left

148
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,700
Shift to the right

149
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Stand up, sit down...

150
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,700
The mascot is depressing me.

151
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,200
Look at him. he's running in place.

152
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
What is that?

153
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Is that supposed to be funny?

154
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,100
He's trying to get us excited.

155
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
Well, i'm not excited.

156
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,000
I wish he'd sit down. he's blocking cindy.

157
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,500
Hey. Take 5, all right?

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,000
We haven't made regionals since 1971.

159
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,000
All right? Saturday is an
important day for our school,

160
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,800
So i expect to see some butts
in those bleachers saturday, huh?

161
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,700
Now i wanna bring up my team captain-

162
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,200
Todd schellinger.

163
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,200
Come on up here, son.

164
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,900
It's always todd schellinger.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,400
Thanks, coach.

166
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,800
This season's been fantastic.

167
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,800
I wanna thank coach fredricks

168
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,800
And god.

169
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,400
Why does cindy like him? he's such a jerk.

170
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,900
He's not even nice to her.

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Cheerleaders have to date athletes.

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
It's the law.

173
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,900
I wanna see all you guys
out there this saturday

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,500
To watch us destroy lincoln.

175
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
All right!

176
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,500
What do we need?

177
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,000
Spirit!

178
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,500
Whado we got?

179
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,000
Spirit!

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's
s-p-i-r-i-t!

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,500
That's spirit!

182
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
For victory!

183
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
That's spirit!

184
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,900
To win this game!

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,900
Come on, norsemen!

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,900
Put lincoln to shame!

187
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,000
See?

188
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,000
He can't even fall funny.

189
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,900
Good job, man!

190
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,400
Whoo!

191
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
comin' through! comin' through!

192
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
oww! somebody get the head off!

193
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Somebody get the head off this kid.

194
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,200
I heard that stevie wonder was jewish.

195
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
You're thinking of sammy davis jr.

196
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,700
Hi, sam.

197
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,800
No. I read it in the newspaper.


200
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Hi, cindy. how's everything?

201
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,200
Not good.

202
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,700
Our mascot broke his arm,

203
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
And he got a concussion, too.

204
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,200
Now his mom won't let him go to bed tonight

205
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,200
'Cause she's afraid he's
gonna slip into a coma.

206
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,700
My cousin slipped into a coma once.

207
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,700
And then when he woke up,

208
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
He spoke fluent spanish.

209
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,200
Anyways, um...

210
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,200
We're all freaking out.

211
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,200
I mean, we really need a mascot.

212
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,200
All right, well, i'll see you guys later.

213
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,700
Bye.

214
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,200
Sam, i think that was a subliminal message.

215
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
She wants you to be the new mascot.

216
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
What?

217
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,400
"We really need a new mascot."

218
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
I really need a new mascot.

219
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,900
I really need sam to be the new mascot.

220
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,700
You really think i should try out?

221
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,200
Open your eyes, sam.

222
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
That was the biggest
come-on i've ever seen.

223
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,700
She was practically feeling you up.

224
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,500
Neal: HEY, GUYS.

225
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,500
What are you doing?

226
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm gonna be the new norseman.

227
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,000
No. No, sam's gonna be the new norseman.

228
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,000
But sam's not funny.

229
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,500
Oh, yeah, i am.

230
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,100
And cindy asked me to do it.

231
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,100
If i could just spend some time with her,

232
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,600
Then she'd start to like me.

233
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,600
You wanna deny the school big laughs

234
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,600
Just so you can hit on a girl?

235
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,100
This is my chance.

236
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,600
You know how important this is to me.

237
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,500
You know how important this is tome.

238
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Being the school mascot
has always been my dream.

239
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah, since lunch.

240
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,400
Come on, neal.

241
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,900
I don't know.

242
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,800
Help me, obi-wan kenobe.

243
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
You're my only hope.

244
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,300
You had to go and quote
thestar wars,didn't you?

245
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,800
All right. Sure.

246
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Yes!

247
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,300
Thank you.


249
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,500
At the cafeteria today, the school
mascot fell and broke his arm.

250
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
It was pretty scary.

251
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Yeah. They oh, poor thing.

252
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Need a new mascot for the game,

253
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
So i think i'm gonna audition.

254
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, that'll be fun.

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You know how i love to
watch you kids perform.

256
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're notoing to the game, are you?

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,500
Of course we are.

258
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a big community event.

259
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So?

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,400
So i'm expected to be there.

261
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,400
I'm a community leader.

262
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,400
Since when?

263
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,900
Heh heh...

264
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,900
It's just a dumb basketball game, dad.

265
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,300
I know why you don't want us to go.

266
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,200
You have a date with your
new boyfriend, nick andopolis.

267
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,700
I mean, we're gonna get to
know him sooner or later.

268
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,400
Why don't we just all go together?

269
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,700
Mom...no.

270
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm a member of the rotary, you know.

271
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,700
And the masons.

272
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
And councilman applebee, just last week,

273
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,700
Asked me to run for the school board.

274
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,700
That's great, dad.

275
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,200
Boy, i could be the mayor,

276
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,200
I wouldn't get any
respect around this house.

279
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,700
What are you doing here?

280
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,500
But my parents...

281
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,500
Go home.

282
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Hey.

283
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Nick...what are you doing here?

284
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,100
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

285
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,100
I just had to see your face.

286
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,100
Ok.

287
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,600
Well, i don't wanna get you in trouble.

288
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,100
Sleep tight.

289
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,700
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

290
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,200
Good night.

291
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Bye.

292
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,200
Hey, sam, i heard the mascot

293
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,200
Has to change with the cheerleaders
in the girls' locker room.

294
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,000
Really? That doesn't sound right.

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Hey, cindy.

296
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Hey, sam. hey. Uh...

297
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,900
Guess what? what?

298
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,900
I'm gonna audition for the school mascot.

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,900
Really? yeah.

300
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Sam, being a mascot's a
lot harder than it looks.

301
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
I mean, you have to be super coordinated.

302
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,300
I'm really coordinated.

303
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,700
You'd be surprised.

304
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,700
All right, cool.

305
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,200
Not up to me.

306
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Vicki's head cheerleader.

307
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,100
Ok. Can you put in a good word for me?

308
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Ok. But it's not like vicki
and i are best friends.

309
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,600
She's kinda bossy.

310
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I'll do what i can, though.

311
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,800
All right. see you at auditions.

312
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,000
Ok. bye.

313
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You thin

314
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,000
There's a subliminal
message in there somewhere?

315
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,000
For your sake, i hope not.

316
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Hi, heidi.

317
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,500
I'm lindsay.

318
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm in your spanish class.

319
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,900
Um, you went out with nick andopolis, right?

320
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,400
Don't remind me.

321
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,900
Do you mind if i ask what happened?

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,900
What, are you dating him or something?

323
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Sort of.

324
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,300
You better ditch him. he's crazy.

325
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,300
What do you mean?

326
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,300
Breaking up with him was, like, a nightmare.

327
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,300
He started stalking me.
he broke into my house.

328
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,300
He got in this insane fight with my dad.

329
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,200
Oh, god.

330
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,700
Hey.

331
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
Why were you talking to heidi?

332
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,200
Because we're in the same spanish class.

333
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,200
What were you guys talking about?

334
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,200
Spanish stuff.

335
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,700
Well, you know, just be careful with her

336
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
Because she's a liar.

337
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,700
She likes to screw people over.

338
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Um...i'm gonna go to woodworking.

339
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,800
I'll see you.

340
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,000
Ok, boys, i wanna see the funky chicken.

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,700
How funky is your chicken?

342
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,700
How loose is your goose?

343
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,200
Sam's pretty good, isn't he?

344
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,700
Yeah, but he's not very funny.

345
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,200
Well, at least he's
better than the old mascot.

346
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,700
That guy was as funny as a car wreck.

348
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
I-i-i was
just kidding.

349
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,200
Hey, herbert, you didn't fall
asleep last night, did you?

350
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,900
No. My mom's not gonna let
me sleep tonight, either.

351
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,700
Yeah, well, if you feel
yourself start to fall asleep,

352
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Pull out a nose hair.
it'll wake you right up.

353
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,700
So come on, everybody

354
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:49,700
And shake your caboose

355
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,600
You're pretty good, sam.

356
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,600
You should try out for the
musical. We're doingfiddler.

357
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,600
You could be a dancing yeshiva student.

358
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,400
Ok, um...

359
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,900
This was not an easy decision for me.

360
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
The norseman head could've fit nicely

361
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,400
On any one of your shoulders.

362
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,300
But, um, the next school mascot will be...

363
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Sam weir.

364
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,700
It's all politics!

365
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,200
Sam, you are so coordinated!

366
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,700
I had no idea.

367
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,200
This is gonna be so much fun.

368
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm gonna teach you all
my cheers and everything.

369
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Cool! When do we start?

370
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Assassinate Lincoln !

371
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,800
This place is turning into a cult.

372
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
These jocks, they put
a ball through a hoop-

373
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,300
Whoop-de-freakin'-do.

374
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,300
My par

375
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,300
Ents are making me go to the game with them.

376
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,300
They're really into it.

377
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm going.

378
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,300
What? really?

379
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,800
Yeah. I heard we're gonna lose, right?

380
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,300
I kinda think it's funny
when the jocks cry, you know?

381
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
"Ooooh, they cheated!"

382
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Ha ha ha!

383
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,800
Here comes nick.

384
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Hey, lindsay... What's up with you and nick?

385
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,300
Nothing.

386
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,800
Nothing? K

387
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,300
Im says you're gonna dump him.

388
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,800
So it's true?

389
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Lindsay, don't.

390
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Hey, nick. i'm great.

392
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Thanks for asking, though.

393
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,300
Hey, ken. hey, guys.

394
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,700
Nick, could you give me a ride home ?

395
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,200
Ok.

396
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,700

398
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Hey, lindsay.

399
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't do it. Please.

400
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
See you, man. good luck.

401
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,800
I'd hate to be that guy's drum set tonight.

402
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Get those arms up there!
get that crowd to cheer!

403
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,200
...Spit! Spit! Spit!

404
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,700
Give me more! i want more energy, sam!

405
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,200
You're a norseman! i wanna see power!

406
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,700
Come on, sam! i need to see it!

407
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,200
Be strong! Be powerful!

408
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
I want pep!

409
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,600
I need a bigger ending, sam.

410
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,500
All right, girls, funky
chicken. Let's see it.

411
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,000
All right, hit it!

412
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,600
How funky is your chicken?

413
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,100
Come on, sam! flap those wings!

414
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
I wanted to be funny.

415
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,000
Vicki didn't want comedy.

416
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,900
...Your caboose!

417
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Not funky enough, sam.

418
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,300
Ok, that was really good, girls.

419
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
It'll be better when you have your head on.

420
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,800
Yeah. Can i try that on today?

421
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,300
Um, no. It's still being fixed.

422
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,300
Now, are you ready to try the pyramid?

423
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Uh...yeah.

424
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
Um, ok.

425
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,400
It's pyra-time, girls.

426
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Uh-oh. Pyramid.

427
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,400
He's gonna need some pointers, right?

428
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,400
Hey,am, see, uh... when
you're climbing them,

429
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Be careful not to pull their hair

430
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,900
'Cause they'll jerk up, and you'll fall.

431
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
Ok? And when you're climbing them,

432
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,400
Be careful not to pull their bra straps...

433
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,400
'Cause they'll wiggle, and you'll fall.

434
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,800
All right. all right.

435
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,800
Now, if you fall, be
careful to cover your head

436
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,300
So you don't break your neck, ok?

437
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,800
Herbert! do you mind?

438
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Sam, it's pyramid time. let's go.

439
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,200
Ok, girls, hit it.

440
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,600
Gimme an "m"! "m"!

441
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,100
You got your "m"! you got your "m"!

442
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Gimme an "h"! "h"!

443
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,200
You got your "h"! you got yourh"!

444
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,900
Gimme an "s"! "s"!

445
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,600
You got your "s"...

446
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,200
Man, i love the smell of gasoline.

447
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,700
Yeah? It gives you brain damage.

448
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,200
You guys go to mckinley?

449
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
Yeah.

450
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,100
Norsemen suck!

451
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,100
Aah!

452
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,300
Dammit! i'm soaked!

453
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
Will you do something, daniel?!

454
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,800
What do you want me to do, blow on you?

455
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,300
That better have been water.

456
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,800
That's all i'm sayin'.

457
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,800
Oh, eww! Man!

458
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,300
I think he'd be cute with
that mask on and everything.

459
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,300
It would be so funny.

460
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hello?

461
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh, hi, nick! how you doin'?

462
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,500
I'm not here.

463
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh...yeah-no. you know, she's not.

464
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,000
She's, um...

465
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,000
Uh, out with her father.

466
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah. I don't know what they're doing,

467
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,500
But they're out there doing it.

468
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,800
Ok. I'll let her know you called.

469
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Bye-bye, sweetie.

470
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Lindsay, i don't like to lie.

471
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,900
Mom, i know. i'm sorry.

472
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
You gonna let me know what's going on?

473
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Mom, it's complicated.

474
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,900
I see.

475
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
I wanna break up with nick.

476
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,400
You do? Why?

477
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,800
It's just...it's going too fast, you know?

478
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,300
I need my space.

479
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,300
And every

480
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,300
Time i try to do it, mom, i chicken out.

481
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
I'm afraid i'll hurt his feelings.

482
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,800
You don't keep going steady
with a boy just to be nice.

483
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
If it's not gonna work out,

484
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,300
You need to muster your
courage and let him know.

485
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,800
Yeah.

486
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,900
Yeah?

487
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
No. I gotta go call him.

488
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,900
I gotta go do it right now.

489
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,800
Hmm.

490
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,000
Hello.

491
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,400

492
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,600
Ken, if this is you, behere an hour ago.

493
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,100
I don't like having to wait around.

494
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,100
I got other stuff to do.

495
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,100
Are you gonna answer me, keennn?

496
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,700
Hello-

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,200
Hey, how'd it go?

498
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,700
Well, i think i should tell him in person.

499
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,200
Ye dot you?

500
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,100
Ah. Remember, you have to
do what's right for you.

501
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
I'm just gonna tell him
tomorrow before the game.

502
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,100
Ok. Night, sweetie.

503
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,100
Oh, and...if there's anything
else you want to talk over,

504
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,100
I'm always here for you.

505
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,600
Fine. If this isn't ken,

506
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,600
You better not call back here...

507
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,600
Or i'll find you.

508
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,100
Hey, harold. what is it?

509
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,600
I just had a conversation with
lindsay about her love life.

510
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
She doesn't like her boyfriend.

511
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
She's gonna break it off.

512
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,100
Oh, praise god.

513
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,100
She confided in me, harold,
and she took my advice.

514
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,500
I feel like... a mother, you know?

515
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah.

516
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,500
You're on my leg.

517
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,500
Oh, oh. I'm sorry.

518
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,500
I just
- i'm so tickled!

519
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,800
Hey, lindsay, you wanna drive

520
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,800
With your father and i to the game?

521
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,800
Yeah. I'd like to introduce you
to the pillars of the community,

522
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Also known as my friends.

523
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Well, i have to take
care of something first,

524
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
So i'll just meet you guys there, ok?

525
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,300
Oh, that's right. What will you say to him?

526
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,800
Mom, i don't know.

527
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,700
Why don't you tell him he's a greasebucket,

528
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,200
And you deserve better?

529
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,600
Harold. dad!

530
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,600
I'll see you guys there.

531
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,600
Ok. Good luck, honey.

532
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,400
What's wrong with you?

533
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm sore.

534
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,700
I had mascot practice yesterday.

535
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
Um, dad?

536
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,200
I think cindy sanders likes me.

537
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,500
Oh, yeah?

538
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,900
Yeah.

539
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,400
I got to form a human pyramid on top of her.

540
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,700
Well, that'll do it.

541
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,700
No. I mean, nick's cool, you know?

542
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,200
It's just that when he gets a
girlfriend, he just goes psycho.

543
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Maybe he just gets so horny,
his brain fries, you know?

544
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
No. Dumbest thing you can do...

545
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
Let a girl know how much that you like her.

546
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,600
Then they just run.

547
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,100
Oh, is that why you're such a bastard to me?

548
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Yeah. Well, you're still here, aren't ya?

549
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,100
Oh, man, there's that car!

550
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,900
Those jerks from Lincoln
that nailed ud, that's them !

551
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,200
Go. Go. Go. Go. before they get away!

552
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,200
Go. Go. Go!

553
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,300
How funky is your chicken ?

554
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Flap your wings!

555
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,200
I want 'em harder!

556
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,200
So come on, everybody

557
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,700
You see that phony sword?

558
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,400
That is a great prop.

559
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,900
Sam's not even using it.

560
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,700
What do you do with a phony sword?

561
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,200
A million things. You fall
on it. You stab yourself.

562
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
You stab the other mascot.

563
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
That's not funny.

564
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
It is if you do it right.

565
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,800
So come on, everybody and shake

566
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
The norseman should be doing schtick,

567
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,000
Zany dance moves, like this.

568
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,000
How funky is your chicken?

569
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,000
How loose is your goose?

570
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Why is that funny?

571
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,500
'Cause i'm a norseman in a chorus line.

572
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,000
Or-or wait, this one.

573
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
How funky is your chicken?

574
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,500
Hula dancer norseman.

575
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,000
Yes. A norseman in hawaii. That's funny!

576
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,000
I can't be seen with you.

577
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,500
How funky is your chicken?

578
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,500
How loose-

579
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Hey !

580
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,700
Your dad let me in.

581
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,700
Look

582
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,700
Nick, i don't have much time
because i told my parents

583
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,200
I was gonna meet them before the game.

584
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Um, i wanna talk to you. Ok?

585
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Will you sit down for a second, please?

586
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Please?

587
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,700
I just-i want-i want to
tell you what happened

588
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,200
With me and heidi henderson.

589
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,100
Yodon't have to do that.

590
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,100
I know. I know i don't have to,

591
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,100
But i want to, ok?

592
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,800
All right.

593
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,300
I had this really huge crush on her.

594
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,300
And, uh, when she broke
up with her boyfriend,

595
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,300
We went out for, like, a week.

596
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,400
I wrote her poems...

597
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,900
Lots and lots of poems.

598
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,900
It turns out that sheand she was trying to
was just on the rebomake her boyfriend jealous,

599
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,500
And she wasn't even really
interested in me at all.

600
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,000
So when she got back
together with her boyfriend,

601
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
She started showing him
all of my poems, right?

602
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,200
An

603
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,700
She's just showing everybody my poems.

604
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,500
And it w r

605
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,300
Ul.

606
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,800
Because i want to get
those poems back, right?

607
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,300
And her dad catches me,
and he starts yelling at me.

608
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,800
And then the cops came. it was-

609
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,300
The whole thing just got blown...

610
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Totally out of proportion.

611
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,300
But the thing is, it just-it all
made me end up feeling really...

612
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,100
Really, really insecure...

613
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,600
About girls.

614
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,500
Nick, i would never show
your poems to anyone.

615
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,500
You rule...

616
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
So hard.

617
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,900
Let's go to the game.

618
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,100
Shelley, you have a
huge stain on yourweater.

619
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,600
I told you guys not to
wear these when you eat.

620
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,100
Hey, cindy, you'd make a
really great head cheerleader...

621
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,100
Much nicer than vicki.

622
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,100
Thanks, sam.

623
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,600
She's just so rude sometimes.

624
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,100
I mean, we're all here
to have fun, you know?

625
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,600
Hey, cindy.

626
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,100
Hey Todd have a great game.

627
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Thanks. Thanks.

628
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,600
Uh, hey, i-i need to ask you something.

629
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Yeah.

630
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,900
Schellinger! You wanna
quit chattin' up the ladies

631
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,900
And get over here?

632
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,400
Yeah. Uh, it wasn't important anyway.

633
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,900
All right.

634
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,400
Good luck!

635
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,900
Oh, my god.

636
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
What do you think he wanted?

637
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,400
Do you think he was gonna ask me out?

638
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,900
I don't know. i don't think so.

639
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Yeah, but what if he was going to.

640
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Maybe i should talk to him after practice.

641
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,800
Oh, this is gonna drive me crazy.

642
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,300
I'm not gonna be able to
remember my cheers or anything.

643
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,700
Cindy, he probably has a
lot of other girlfriends.

644
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
Sam, don't say that.

645
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,700
Todd is a really popular guy.

646
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,700
I just don't want you
to get too hung up on him

647
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Just in case, you know, he won't
go out with you or something.

648
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,600
I guess. maybe you're right.

649
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,600
I'll talk to you later.

650
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,000
I saw 'em. Do it.

651
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,500
Why don't you do it?

652
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,500
'Cause i'm a girl.

653
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Just hurry up, man, ok?

654
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,200
What are you doing?

655
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Uh-

656
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
We're giving your car a new paint job.

657
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,700
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

658
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Th what the hell?

659
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,000
At's what you get, water balloon boy.

660
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah man ! Thanks a lot.

661
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,000
Yo, something-something
tells me it's time to go.

662
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,500
Yeah, kim, let's go.

663
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,500
These losers are from mckinley.

664
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Look what that bitch just did to my car.

665
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
You're the bitch, man!

666
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Come on, daniel, kick his ass.

667
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Kick my ass?

668
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,500
Tell my mother that i love her.

670
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,800
Here's your head.

671
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Please don't break it. it costs like $600.

672
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Jeez. It's heavy. It's gonna be
harder to do the cheers with this on.

673
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,300
No duh. That's why you better stay focused.

674
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,800
Why don't you put it on

675
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,300
And walk around with it for
a while to get used to it?

676
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,800
Yeah.

677
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,300
Ok. oh, man.

678
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,100
Whoa.

679
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,800
Hey, watch it!

680
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,800
Sorry.

681
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,100
All right. See ya.

682
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Hey, man. Give me 5 for
the big game, all right?

683
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Oh, my god, sam. You are never
gonna believe what just happened.

684
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,000
He todd asked me out.

685
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,500
Said that he liked me, and then
i told him that i liked him back,

686
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,500
And then he kissed me.

687
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,000
And then he said that he
didn't have a girlfriend.

688
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,000
So see? You were wrong.

689
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Todd's a jerk.

690
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,500
What?

691
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,000
He's a jerk. I hate to
say it, but it's true.

692
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,500
He's not even nice to you.

693
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,500
He's all cocky.

694
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,500
Sam!

695
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
It's jusstupid that you like him.

696
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,000
I mean, just because you're
a cheerleader and he's a jock.

697
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,500
It's so obvious.

698
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Sam, just because you're
nervous about the big game,

699
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,500
It doesn't mean you should
take it out on me and todd.

700
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,100
Triplets.

702
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,100
When i try to do it-

703
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,100
Come over here.

704
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,100
Well, no, i'll be right back.

705
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Like you to meet a few
very good friends of mine.

706
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,100
This is councilman appleby,

707
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,100
Stan miller of stan miller motors,

708
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
and sheriff macgruder.

709
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
This is my daughter lindsay.

710
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,500
It's a pleasure to meet you, lindsay.

711
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,000
Your father has told us all about you.

712
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,000
Nice to meet you.

713
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,000
Sam, what are you doing?

714
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,000
Get dressed. the game's about to start.

715
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,000
Cindy kissed todd schellinger.

716
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,500
Sam, who cares ?

717
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,000
You're the school mascot.

718
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Now's not the time to get all weepy.

719
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,500
You gotta go out there and be funny.

720
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Well, i don't feel like being funny.

721
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,500
You think steve martin
always feels like being funny?

722
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,500
No, but he goes out on
that stage every night

723
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
With his arrow and his banjo, and he kills.

724
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,500
I'm not going out there.

725
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,000
Then give me that head.

726
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,800
Don't do it, sam. He's only
worried about getting laughs.

727
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,300
Sam, hand me the head of that norseman.

728
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,300
So, uh, dale, do you think i
should be running for school board?

729
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,300
Definitely. We could use a man like you.

730
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,200
Oh, my god. Wh-what happened to you guys?

731
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,700
We got jumped by some boneheads at lincoln.

732
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,700
Yeah. why?

733
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,700
We trashed their car.

734
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
They had it coming.

735
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,700
Dad, you remember daniel
and kim, and this is ken.

736
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,700

Yeah. Mr. Weir. You remember.

739
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,100
How's mrs. Weir doing?

740
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,100
Oh, well, she-she's ok. look, uh, lindsay,

00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,600

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Ok.

743
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,900

749
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Yeah. How are you holding up, huh?

750
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
Ok.

751
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Yeah. I am so sorry about everything.

752
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,800
You know, lindsay really
does care about you.

753
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
She told me so last night.

754
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,300
She just feels overwhelmed right now.

755
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,300
She needs her space, you know?

756
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Is that what she said?

757
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Uh, didn't-didn't lindsay talk to you?

758
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah. She talked to me.

759
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,500
Oh, good.

760
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,000
Um, it was nice seeing you.

761
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You-you, too, nick.

762
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Hey!

763
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,400
Honey, didn't you talk to nick this morning?

764
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,900
Why, what did you say to him?

765
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,400
Well, i was just trying to be nice.

766
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,900
And, uh...

767
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,900
Mom, did you break up with my boyfriend?

768
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,300
I don't-no, i just,
uh- oh, my goodness.

769
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
I knew i shouldn't have told you anything.

770
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,000
You know, from now on, just
stay out of my life, please.

771
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,500
Hey, honey.

772
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Oh, hey.

773
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,300
Hey. Are you all right?

774
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,300
Yeah, i'm fine.

775
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Are you sick?

776
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,300
No. It's just nerves.

777
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Hey, you're that new mascot, right?

778
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,200
Yeah.

779
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,700
You know, you were really funny, man.

780
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,200
We saw you doing the funky
chicken. Were all cracking up.

781
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,100
Thanks.

782
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
You zone that area, and then
you can bring in the business-

783
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Harold, i think that
lindsay's upset with me.

784
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Jean, shh. The game's about to begin.

785
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
GO, mckinley! Shut them down.

786
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Lincoln, you suck!

787
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,800
Yeah, todd! way to go, buddy!

All right. funky chicken!

810
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,500
Sammy is so cute!

811
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Well, he may be cute, but
that mascot head is disturbing.

812
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
How loose is your goose?

813
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
So come on, everybody

814
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,900
And shake your caboose

815
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,000
Look out. Sam, move!

816
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
How funky is your chicken?

817
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
How loose is your goose?

818
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,800
Sam, if you're mad at me,

819
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,200
This is a really obnoxious
way of showing it.

820
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,000
Ladies, keep your hands off the hat.

821
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,500
I can't understand
anything that you're saying.

822
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,400
Norsemen

823
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,900
Watch it !

824
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,200
"Lincoln, lincoln, i'm just thinking,

825
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,200
What the hell have you been drinking?"

826
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Yeah! Nothing but net, baby. Whoo!

827
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,000
In your face, losers!

828
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,000
Kill lincoln!

829
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,300
Yeah. that's the spirit, guys.

830
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,800
You rock.

831
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,300
Let play some "d"

832
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,000
It's called defense, feldman, come on.

833
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,700
What's in there ?

834
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,700
Mmm. Tasty.

835
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,300
Cry at night

836
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,800
No one in sight

837
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,800
And we got so much to say

838
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,800
Cindy, where's sam? We're
about to do "chewing tobacco."

839
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,400
He's over there.

840
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,400
Oh, i stabbed myself!

841
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Oh, my god. he's gonna die.

842
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Help me. I'm dying.

843
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,900
You are in so much trouble, sam weir.

844
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,400
Uh-oh.

845
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Ugh. Thank you, sir. may i have another?

846
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,400
Hey, nick.

847
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,900
Hey.

848
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,400
Well, i wa

849
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,900
S looking all over for you.

850
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,600
Listen, uh...

851
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,100
I've been, um, thinking a lot.

852
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,500
I really like you...

853
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,000
But we've been spending so
much time together, you know?

854
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,500
Um, i
can't-i-

855
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,000
I haven't beenand i
hanging out with my friends,

856
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Haven't really been spending
time on my drumming at all.

857
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And so, i sort of thought that

858
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Maybe you and me should
take a break for a while.

859
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,700
Good.

860
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,700
Great.

861
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,200
No hard feelings, right?

862
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,500
Right.

863
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,000
All right, well i'm gonna go, um...

864
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,500
Practice, or

865
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Nick.

866
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,600
Foul! that's a foul!

867
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,800
Come on! Come over here! come over here.

868

Come on ! 
Put Lincoln to shame.

872

They're loving it!

873
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,800
Ow! Vicki: what is your deal?

874
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,200
That girl just punched my little boy!

875
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,400
Ok, girls ! It's pyramid time

876
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,500
I don't know what your problem is,

877
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,000
But you'd better get to the
top of that pyramid, now!

878
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I mean it!

880
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,500
Ok girls, hit it !

881
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,300
Give me an "m"! "m"!

882
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,300
You've got your "m"! you've got your "m"!

Gimme an "h"! "h"!

884
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,300
Neal: ELEVATOR, GOING UP!

885
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,100
Girl: HEY, THAT'S MY BRA STRAP!

886
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,000
Neal: NO, IT'S THE TEAM'S BRA STRAP!

887
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,300
Nooo!

888
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,500
Oh, my god, honey! Oh!

889
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,900
Oh, he's all right. he'll be all right.

890
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,800
Sam, you've ruined everything!

891
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Where am i?

892
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,200
Who the hell are you?

893
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,200
Neal schweiber, at your service!

894
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,200
You're dead.

895
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Nate schweeber, you're a jerk.

896
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,200
It's neal schweiber!

897
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,200
The song is over

898
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,800
It's all behind me

899
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,800
I shoulda known it

900
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,300
She tried to find me

901
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,300
I'll sing my song

902
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,800
To the wide open spaces

903
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,300
I'll sing my heart out

904
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,800
To the infinite sea

905
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,300
I'll sing my visions

906
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,800
To the sky-high mountains

907
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,800
I'll sing my song to the free

908
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,300
To the free

909
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,300
Fredricks: ALL RIGHT? COME ON!

Cindy. Hey.

00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,000
Sam, what's going on?

918
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,600
Why weren't you out there?

919
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,100
I just got really nervous.

920
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,100
I didn't mean to take
it out on you and todd.

921
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,600
He's all right.

922
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,100
That's ok.

923
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
Look, i gotta go, all right?

924
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,000
Ok. bye.

You take your time and take my money

Keep yourself alive

930
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,100
Come on, keep yourself alive

931
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,600
All you people

Keep yourself alive

933
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,800
Neal, that was incredible.
