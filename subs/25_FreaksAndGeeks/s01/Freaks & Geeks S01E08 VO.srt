Freaks and Geeks S01E08 Girlfriends and Boyfriends (VO)

1
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:11,092
I was just coming to look for you.
Wow, you look beautiful.

2
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:12,767
- Thanks.
- Come on.

3
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:19,328
Hey, guys.
What you guys doin'?

4
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:21,512
Nothing, I'm just
hanging out with Linds.

5
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:22,727
So...

6
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,501
Are you guys going out or what?

7
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,462
Hey, come on.
I don't kiss and tell.

8
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:31,632
Cool, man.
That's great.

9
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,508
Yeah, Nick!

10
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,062
Grab me a piece!

11
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,271
Shut up, man.
Get outta here.

12
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,317
I'm sorry about that.

14
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,836
You remember those guys
from the band Dimension?

15
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:46,510
They found a drummer.

16
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:47,839
Aw, really?

17
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:51,880
I heard he dropped his
stick soloing on <i>Black Dog</i>.

18
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,612
You know, like that first gig.
I'm not jealous.

19
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:56,348
I'm really not.

20
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:59,011
I'm glad I bombed the audition,
because, you know,

21
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,354
if I hadn't... Then
we wouldn't have kissed.

22
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:09,751
Well, I should... go to study hall.
I have to cram for my English quiz.

23
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,364
OK. I'll see you later.

24
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:17,369
Oh, man.

25
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,994
Come here.

26
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,878
{\a6}You just kissed Nick!

27
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:28,380
{\a6}Yeah, so?

28
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:31,868
{\a6}Are you going out with him?

29
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:33,385
No... well...

30
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:36,762
{\a6}We haven't gone on
a real date or anything.

31
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:38,474
It's just that...

32
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:41,305
{\a6}We were hanging out the other day,
and he was kinda depressed,

33
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,765
and we kissed.

34
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,840
{\a6}It's not... It's no big deal.

35
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,400
What?
You have a boyfriend.

36
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:51,439
Yeah, but Tommy goes to church!
Nick is a freak!

37
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:55,006
- So what?!
- So this...

38
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:58,338
Freaks only date freak girls.
And you're not a freak girl.

39
00:03:58,463 --> 00:04:00,030
How do you know?

40
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,497
'Cause freaks go all the way.

41
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:05,988
Millie, you've no idea
what you're talking about.

42
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,348
What about Patty Filker?
She's a freak girl.

43
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:11,006
And she has a baby!

44
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,377
But I guess that's
no big deal either.

45
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:17,264
Mind your own business, OK?

46
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,516
Hurry up. I don't want
to be late for bio.

47
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,430
Why? What is the big deal?

48
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,805
Well, yesterday I was late,
and everyone looked at me.

49
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,854
- Hi, Sam.
- Oh, hi, Cindy.

50
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:33,368
How are you?

51
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:38,027
Ho ho, hey, Merv Griffin!
Nice interview.

52
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:42,193
Come on back, Lindsay.

53
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,361
Something wrong?

54
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:47,141
No. Just checkin' in with
my good friend Lindsay Weir.

55
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,644
- Anything wrong with that?
- I guess not.

56
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:53,147
So how's everything going?
Classes keeping you interested?

57
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:54,649
Yeah, sure.

58
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:57,776
Hey, have you checked
out the new Rush album?

59
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,258
I've gotta say
it rocks pretty heavily,

60
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:03,135
and that's comin' from
a guy who's seen Hendrix live.

61
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:05,763
Yeah, I... I heard it's pretty good.

62
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,151
So...

63
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:12,614
I understand you and Nick Andopolis
are gettin' pretty tight.

64
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:14,002
How's that goin'?

65
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:17,588
Mr. Rosso, Nick and I
are just friends. That's all.

66
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:19,574
No need to explain anything to me.

67
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:23,199
I got it on in a van at Woodstock,
I'm not judgin' anybody.

68
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,414
I just want you to know what
you're getting yourself into.

69
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:29,412
I mean, when you're a teenager,
your emotions are running high,

70
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,081
and it's easy to get confused.

71
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:35,397
I want you... to have this.

72
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,339
Oh, my god!

73
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,564
Come on! Don't let
the pamphlet freak you out.

74
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:45,750
There's some good stuff in there.

75
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,431
It's just that you've
got to be careful these days.

76
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:51,392
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Do you?

77
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:54,026
I thought I knew, too.

78
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,694
Until one night,
I was checkin' out this discotheque.

79
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,197
The one at the bowling alley
on 15 mile.

80
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:02,200
I met this girl.
She seemed really nice.

81
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:04,202
We danced a bit.
I kissed her.

82
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:06,704
One thing led to another and...

83
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,076
Now I get sores on my lip
once a month.

84
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,270
I have herpes.

85
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:18,628
It doesn't hurt that much,
but believe me, you don't want it.

86
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,297
Can I please go now?

87
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,133
I just blew your mind, didn't I?

88
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,592
No! No, I just, um...

89
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:30,606
I don't want to be late for lunch.

90
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,893
Just use your head, Lindsay.
That's all I ask.

91
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:35,667
You got it.

92
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:51,786
Man! That Gordon reeks!

93
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,684
You think he ever takes a shower?

94
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:56,187
Maybe he takes baths instead.

95
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:58,584
My mom says
they don't really get you clean.

96
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:01,192
Yeah, you just sit
in your own filth.

97
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:05,174
All right, let's settle down.
We've got a lot to do today.

98
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:08,506
We're going to be
dissecting kittens.

99
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:10,948
Just trying to get your attention.

100
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:13,057
But you'll get
your lab partners today.

101
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,338
McKenna?

102
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,340
I hope I get to be
paired up with Cindy.

103
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:19,021
- Hey, what about me?
- Please let it be Cindy.

104
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:23,112
Your lab partner
will be Gordon Crisp.

105
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:27,804
Bill, your partner
will be Cindy Sanders.

106
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,439
How interesting.

107
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:33,941
Me and Cindy, you and Gordon.

108
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:38,481
Well, I better... I better go
sit next to my lab partner.

109
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:43,951
Well, there goes Cindy's
grade point average.

110
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,956
Excuse me, madam.

111
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:51,929
- May I take this seat?
- Sure, have a seat.

112
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,949
All right, people, let's go.

113
00:07:58,074 --> 00:08:01,689
Find your lab partner.
Remember, science waits for no man.

114
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,586
I think it's really great
that you and Nick are goin' out.

115
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,262
Yeah. Me, too.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,731
No, I mean it.

117
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,720
He's a great guy.

118
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:36,455
I give him a hard time, but...
You know...

119
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,476
He's the man!

120
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:43,364
I just think it's really
great you guys are goin' out.

121
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,154
He's a really great guy.

122
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:55,076
Yeah. I know.

123
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:07,622
Nick's a stud... You know?

124
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:12,677
I mean, he may not seem like it,
but he is.

125
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:17,278
Mr. Desario,
don't you have something to do?

126
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,783
Right, but I thought we were going
to do that after class, Miss Yeats.

127
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,938
Ha ha. Be still, my beating heart.

128
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:32,903
I like that dress.

129
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:36,535
How come you're not eating?

130
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,400
This tuna salad smells like Gordon.

131
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:41,622
Yeah, Cindy smells, too.

132
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:44,605
Like flowers.

133
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,590
Did she say anything about me?

134
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:52,682
I don't know.

135
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,344
Her tongue was in
my ear the whole time.

136
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:57,888
Shut up!

137
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,809
I'm gonna have to get Cindy to come
and kiss it and make it all better.

138
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,644
You guys are jerks!

139
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,650
Hi, Sam. Hey, Nate.

140
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,309
- It's Neal...
- OK, so, Bill, I was thinking,

141
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:14,697
we should probably get
started on our lab assignment.

142
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:19,105
I have cheerleading practice at 3:00,
French club at...

143
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:23,706
3:45, but do you think you could
come over at, like... 4:30?

144
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:27,245
To your house?

145
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:33,341
I think I could squeeze you in.

146
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,374
Great! I'll see you then.

147
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,043
Cindy's house. 4:30.

148
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:46,687
Should I wear Hai Karate
or Old Spice?

149
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,773
Definitely Old Spice.

150
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:54,415
Check it out.
Donkey basketball Saturday.

151
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,388
- I love those things.
- I think they're mean.

152
00:10:57,513 --> 00:11:00,147
Oh, yeah,
like the donkeys really give a care.

153
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:02,090
How would you like
some big fat teacher

154
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:04,317
on your back while you had
to run around a gym?

155
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,615
Yeah, how did your date
with Fredricks go?

156
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:12,129
- You wanna hang out Friday night?
- Um, yeah.

157
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:13,631
Yeah? Cool.

158
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,592
Have you seen <i>The Elephant Man</i>?

159
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,474
The movie.

160
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:21,910
Oh! The...

161
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:24,989
Guy with... The deformed guy.

162
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:26,269
No, why?

163
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,492
I was thinking
maybe we could go see it.

164
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:30,460
Come on, people, the bell has rung.

165
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:32,997
Quit your dilly-dallying
and get to class!

166
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:35,499
Lord and lady skips-a-lot,
come on, let's go!

167
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,374
Yes, ma'am... I mean, sir.

168
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:41,704
I was actually...
I was actually thinking...

169
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:43,991
We could hang out
at my house Friday night.

170
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:47,282
My parents are going out and
my brothers aren't going to be around.

171
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,115
So, I thought we could just
hang out or something...

172
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,500
Come on, get the lead out.
Let's go!

173
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,525
So Friday night at my house?

174
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:58,384
Romeo and Juliet.

175
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:01,631
Come on. Last one
in class, first one on welfare.

176
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,429
It's your choice.

177
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,596
I like your room, Sam.

178
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:23,208
Oh, thanks.

179
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:26,898
Oh, whoa! Cool sheets!

180
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,040
"May the force be with you."

181
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,619
OK, let's see here.

182
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,798
I already started on
the plant cell diagram.

183
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,633
It's the animal stuff that's tricky.

184
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:42,470
Yeah, I know. I couldn't tell what
was going on under that microscope.

185
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:46,057
- Could I borrow your pencil?
- Oh, yeah. OK, sure.

186
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,095
There you go.

187
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:07,679
- Here you go. Thanks.
- Thanks.

188
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,334
What's the matter, Sam?

189
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,900
Oh, nothing! Nothing.

190
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,589
I know what's bugging you.

191
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,883
You didn't want to be
lab partners with me.

192
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:22,394
Well...

193
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,553
You wanted to be with Cindy sanders.

194
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:27,598
Yeah... yeah!
How did you know?

195
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:30,785
- It's obvious you like her.
- It is?

196
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:35,746
- Do you think she likes me?
- I don't know.

197
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:38,559
Cheerleaders are hard
to read that way.

198
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,571
You and Cindy would
make a good couple.

199
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,689
She's popular and everything,

200
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,201
but... she needs someone like you.

201
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,041
- You'd be good for her.
- Really?

202
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,580
Thanks, Mom.

203
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:04,132
I'm so bad. I can't do my homework
without having a snack first.

204
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,781
Do you have chips or cookies?

205
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,592
No, I'm sorry.
My parents don't let us eat junk food.

206
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:25,119
Do you want to watch TV?

207
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,706
<i>Welcome Back, Kotter</i> is on.

208
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,996
Are you OK?

209
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:34,542
That's Horshack...
From the show.

210
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:38,548
Oh. Well, I've never
really seen it before, so...

211
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:40,171
What?!

212
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:42,787
Well, I don't really watch TV.

213
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:44,842
Except for the <i>Muppet Show</i>.

214
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:51,975
I'm sorry, I've been hogging these.

215
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,209
Did you want something to drink?

216
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:08,335
OK, I'll go get some lemonade.

217
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:12,028
This stupid chair always does that.

218
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,454
I'll be right back.

219
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,221
This is what you should do.

220
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:53,796
Find out her schedule
and memorize it.

221
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:56,694
That way, you can bump
into her and say hi.

222
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:59,897
Compliment her hair,
and the next time you run into her,

223
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:03,087
say, "hey, did you
change your hair?"

224
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:06,603
{\Pretty }Soon, you'll have tons
of stuff to talk about.

225
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:10,608
- Good idea.
- And join all her after-school clubs.

226
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:13,162
A, you'll get to see her more.

227
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:17,268
B, you'll find out about her interests,
and pretend they're your interests, too.

228
00:16:17,704 --> 00:16:20,021
- That makes sense.
- And C...

229
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:22,586
Very important.

230
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:26,090
You can make sure she's not
falling in love with anyone else,

231
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,090
like your friend Bill.

232
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:30,072
You think
Cindy'll fall in love with Bill?!

233
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:31,618
I don't know.

234
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:35,349
Being lab partners is like getting
stranded on a desert island.

235
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:37,038
You never know what might happen.

236
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:41,205
Hey, man, I heard Kim got
an A on her world civ test.

237
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,207
That's great.
Huh?

238
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:45,706
Oh, no, that's right.

239
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,162
That was <i>my</i> girlfriend.

240
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,344
Oh, that's really funny.

241
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,875
Ah, you know what, though?

242
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,670
Oh, man.
Lindsay got detention.

243
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:59,173
For flipping off her gym teacher.

244
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,176
Oh, no, that's right.

245
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:04,745
That was <i>your</i> girlfriend.

246
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:10,588
I heard Kim punched you
in the chest really hard.

247
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,541
Whoops. That was me!

248
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,261
That was really hard.

249
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:21,951
I'm telling you, she's abnormal.

250
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:24,481
She eats carrot sticks,
and she likes Miss piggy.

251
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:26,983
So what?
The muppets are cool.

252
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:29,486
Yeah, Swedish Chef is kinda cool,

253
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:31,488
but Miss Piggy's lame.

254
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:33,537
Look, Professor Honeywell
is hysterical.

255
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:35,262
Cindy is not abnormal.

256
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,117
Yeah?

257
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:39,013
She cut the cheese.

258
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:40,497
Oh, my god!

259
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:41,972
That's not funny.

260
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:46,002
I heard it, man. I swear.
She blamed it on the chair,

261
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:48,004
but she cut the cheese.

262
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:52,133
Some chairs make weird noises!

263
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,339
- What kind of a chair was it?
- I don't know.

264
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:58,786
- Vinyl?
- Well, vinyl chairs always squeak.

265
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,494
It wasn't a squeak.

266
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,569
It was the sound
of cheese being cut.

267
00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:06,439
You know what?
I think you're making all of this up

268
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:09,273
because you want me
to stop liking her

269
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:10,673
because you like her now.

270
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,067
What?!

271
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,637
Hey, what's up?

272
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:19,849
Hi, Cindy.
You changed your hair.

273
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:22,852
It just looks really flat today.

274
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,229
Oh, Bill, I wanted to tell you.

275
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,701
I have a yearbook
meeting after school,

276
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,846
but we can work on
our lab assignment afterwards.

277
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:33,577
Oh, I can't wait. Maybe this time,
you can come over to my house.

278
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:38,338
Oh, and by the way, I finally
got to see <i>Welcome Back, Kotter</i>.

279
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:41,767
You were right.
Mr. Woodman is so funny.

280
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,040
Yeah, I'm tellin' ya,

281
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,500
that guy is totally underrated.

282
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:56,707
Lindsay, it's a test, not a race.

283
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,010
And if it were a race,
Millie already beat you.

284
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,626
I need to talk to you.

285
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:24,316
- Why?
- I just do.

286
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:28,208
Yes.

287
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:32,792
Remember when we used
to love Leif Garrett

288
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,795
and we used to take
my Dynamite magazines out

289
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,297
and kiss his picture?

290
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,800
And we went to see him
at the state fair

291
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:43,113
and cut all the way
to the front row.

292
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:46,306
It turned out to be Jack Albertson
from Chico and the Man.

293
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:47,810
Oh, yeah.

294
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:50,484
That kinda sucked.

295
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:51,959
It wasn't so bad.

296
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:54,223
It was kinda funny.

297
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:57,628
Millie, I'm just saying that...

298
00:19:57,753 --> 00:19:59,819
We always dreamed
of having a boyfriend,

299
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:02,322
and I think I finally
have a boyfriend,

300
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:04,870
and... and I think
he wants to have sex.

301
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,502
You can't have sex with Nick.

302
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,736
Once you do, you'll
never be the same again.

303
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:15,089
Plus no one would want to marry you.

304
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:18,676
Why should they buy the cow
when they can get the milk for free?

305
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:25,242
Some of you will be happy to see that,
after several complaints,

306
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:28,281
I have eliminated "disco days"
from the running.

307
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,267
- Who's got photographs?
- Hey, Cindy.

308
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:34,075
Hey, Sam.
I didn't know you were on yearbook.

309
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,772
Did you just join?

310
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,157
I want to become more involved in...
after-school activities.

311
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:44,201
- That's cool.
- Any article ideas?

312
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:46,691
Cindy?

313
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:49,531
It's called
"Diary of a McKinley student."

314
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:52,001
It describes a high school
student's experience.

315
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,204
Go ahead. Read it.

316
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,035
"September 3, 1980.

317
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:01,135
"Freshman year.
Dear diary,

318
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:03,401
"high school.
So cavernous.

319
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:07,530
"Cold, uninviting.
"Starting over. No identity.

320
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:10,319
"Everyone looking, everyone judging.

321
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:12,493
"Their eyes pierce my soul.

322
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:14,744
"Aimless youth,
all trapped together,

323
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:16,436
"but no one connecting.

324
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:19,060
"Education or isolation?

325
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:21,057
Class dismissed."

326
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,407
Thank you, Sylvia Plath.

327
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,536
It's a little dark.

328
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:34,877
We want to sell yearbooks,
not tell the truth.

329
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:38,756
It was just an idea.

330
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:43,456
The next thing we need
to talk about is ad sales.

331
00:21:44,043 --> 00:21:46,138
Yes, I know. It's no fun.

332
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,927
It's not creative,

333
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:50,423
but if we don't sell
this ad space by tomorrow,

334
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:52,270
we won't have money for printing.

335
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:55,402
Here's a list of the local merchants
we haven't hit yet.

336
00:21:56,552 --> 00:21:59,406
My Dad owns A1 Sporting Goods.

337
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:03,239
Great! You can start with his store.
Why don't you pair up with Cindy?

338
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:04,741
Sure.

339
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,993
Mr. Stoker, you pair up with carl.

340
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:09,537
Can you believe we have
to sell yearbook ads?

341
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:12,582
Yeah. That really sucks.

342
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,352
Hey, Lindsay.

343
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:24,377
I got something to show you.

344
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:27,454
What?

345
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:29,302
What's up?

346
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:31,559
Somebody likes you,
that's what's up.

347
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:34,604
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

348
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:37,999
What's his name? What's he like?
I want to know everything, really.

349
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,359
He's just a friend.

350
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,528
A friend?
Do I know him?

351
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:45,039
Well, open the card.

352
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:47,088
What?

353
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:48,745
Sweetie?

354
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,462
"W-a-t-e."

355
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:20,964
My Dad's store is
right down the block.

356
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:22,789
Yeah?
All right, great.

357
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,945
You know, I really liked what
you wrote for the yearbook.

358
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,446
I think it was really cool.

359
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:33,449
Mr. Mainzer doesn't know
what he's talking about.

360
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:34,951
Thanks.

361
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:39,956
And you know, you're right.
Being a freshman stinks.

362
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:41,580
I know, it's like...

363
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:45,355
Everyone pigeonholes you
and expects you to act a certain way.

364
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:49,545
If you're a cheerleader, you're supposed
to be in a good mood all the time.

365
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,102
Yeah, that must be tough.

366
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:55,231
I know! There are some days when
I'm just feeling a little bit cranky.

367
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:56,539
Like today.

368
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:59,535
I just got my period.
So what? Deal with it.

369
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:05,695
All right, thanks, Mike.
And good luck with that bomb shelter.

370
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,533
Sam? I thought you were going
to help me out today.

371
00:24:11,257 --> 00:24:13,289
Oh, yeah, I was
at a yearbook meeting.

372
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,759
Yearbook? When the heck
did you join that?

373
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,245
Today.
This is my friend Cindy.

374
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,537
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

375
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:23,750
Look, Sam.

376
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,965
Now, look, you gotta
put in your time.

377
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,221
I'm trying to teach
you a work ethic here.

378
00:24:28,346 --> 00:24:30,723
Now, if you want to buy
those crazy Micronaut things,

379
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,725
you're going to have
to earn the money.

380
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,800
Oh, for cryin' out loud,
who mixed up the balls?

381
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:40,017
Um, you have
a really nice store, Mr. Weir.

382
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:43,003
Dave, bring up those boxes up there.

383
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:46,068
Uh, Dad, Cindy and I...

384
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:48,988
Well, we're selling yearbook ads.

385
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:53,909
1/8 of a page is $25.
Do you want to buy one?

386
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,984
1/8 for $25?!
Sam, that's highway robbery!

387
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,457
I can get a full page in
a sunday paper for a hundred.

388
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,973
But this is really important
that Cindy and I sell these.

389
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,218
Oh, well, tell you what.
Give me a full page.

390
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:14,180
Wow! Thank you, Mr. Weir.

391
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:16,899
No problem.
Sam is my best salesman, you know?

392
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:18,605
Really?

393
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:22,869
We've got 16 more ads to sell.
We should go to the big stores first.

394
00:25:22,994 --> 00:25:26,484
- They'll probably buy more space.
- But the small stores close earlier.

395
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:29,600
Oh, wait a minute now.
You're squandering your manpower.

396
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:33,374
What you gotta do is split up,
and, you know, take separate routes.

397
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,778
That way you can cover more ground.

398
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:36,903
Thank you.

399
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:41,028
But then again...

400
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:43,125
Some of the greatest
salesmen worked in teams.

401
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,027
Yeah, maybe we should
stick together.

402
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:49,752
But we'll both finish sooner
if we split up, don't you think?

403
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,128
Yeah, I guess so.

404
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:56,266
Thank you, Mr. Weir.

405
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,800
See ya, Dad.

406
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:04,480
Sir, don't open that bait.

407
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:08,572
So I saw Sam's yearbook
partner at the store today.

408
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:10,547
Quite a cute little number.

409
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:12,224
God, Dad!

410
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,844
What? What's wrong with that?
She's cute.

411
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:18,343
Am I supposed
to call her "Ms." or something?

412
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:21,918
See, Lindsay, Sam's not afraid to
show off his girlfriend.

413
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,461
What's eating you?

414
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:31,841
- Lindsay has a boyfriend.
- Oh, my God!

415
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,050
What?! Who?

416
00:26:35,182 --> 00:26:37,467
Someone sent her a red rose.

417
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:40,016
He must be some kind of Romeo.

418
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:42,917
Yeah, I'll say he is.
Who the hell is this joker?

419
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,395
He's just a friend.

420
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:47,411
Nobody who's "just a friend"
sends a single rose.

421
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:49,859
I know all about single roses.

422
00:26:50,144 --> 00:26:52,916
I sent one to your mother,
and I know when and why I sent it.

423
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,041
Harold.

424
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:56,747
Lindsay, you can tell us who it is,

425
00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:59,243
and we won't make a big deal
out of it, all right?

426
00:27:01,614 --> 00:27:02,872
OK, it's Nick.

427
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:06,667
Not another one of those burn-outs.

428
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,543
Nick? Was he the one that
ate all my fruit roll-ups?

429
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:14,842
- You said he could have them.
- No, I... I know.

430
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:19,341
You'd better know right now that your
mother and I are not taking care of some

431
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:22,016
"wedlock" baby, while you're
off gallivanting at college.

432
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,791
- Dad!
- I'm warning you, Lindsay.

433
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,438
Absolutely forbid you
from seeing this boy.

434
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:40,201
Well, at least she didn't yell.

435
00:27:40,738 --> 00:27:41,738
Honey.

436
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:52,418
See, you don't know what it's like

437
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:54,840
to have a daughter
and want to protect her.

438
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,847
Well, I mean, you will someday.

439
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,887
We'd like that day to be
a long time from now.

440
00:28:00,786 --> 00:28:03,854
We just want to be sure
that this boy respects you, honey.

441
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:05,601
Not all of them do.

442
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,437
Trust me. I know what they're like.
I was one of them.

443
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:10,432
Ugh! He was.

444
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:13,675
I know. You find it hard to believe,

445
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,992
but I did some stupid
things when I was young.

446
00:28:17,117 --> 00:28:18,341
Honey.

447
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,492
Tell her about Korea.

448
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:23,198
Ko...

449
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:25,551
... rea.

450
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,878
Well, one day...

451
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,110
I went into Seoul on a weekend pass

452
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,795
and went to this bar

453
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:42,492
and I had a few too many.
And...

454
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:47,058
I followed a couple
of my buddies to the...

455
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:50,187
red-light district.

456
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,815
Your father's first time
wasn't special,

457
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,818
and he's always regretted it.

458
00:28:56,264 --> 00:28:58,942
It was the worst
$5.00 I've ever spent.

459
00:29:00,563 --> 00:29:03,446
And I wish I could get
that $5.00 back.

460
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:07,496
Ohh, come on! Please stop!

461
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:10,403
What your father
is trying to say is...

462
00:29:11,643 --> 00:29:13,406
that your virginity is...

463
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:14,795
a gift.

464
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,876
Hold on a second.
I gotta find my smokes.

465
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,549
Did you take 'em?

466
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:58,534
We're goin' to Des's tonight.
Are you coming?

467
00:29:58,659 --> 00:29:59,622
No. Oh, hey.

468
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:02,055
No, actually,
I'm hangin' out with Linds.

469
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,041
All right.
Make it happen.

470
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,431
Oh, tonight's the night!

471
00:30:09,616 --> 00:30:12,015
Call me tomorrow, Lindsay.
I want to know everything.

472
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,562
So do I, Lindsay.

473
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,262
Keep yawnin' like that,
you're gonna dislocate your jaw.

474
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:18,587
Guys, wait up.

475
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:22,071
Hey, Sam.
You know what Cindy said last night?

476
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:25,024
What? That she's in love with you?

477
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:28,430
That... that she thinks
you're smart and funny

478
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:30,600
and you don't care
if she cuts the cheese?

479
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:32,783
You know what, Bill?

480
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:35,480
Why don't you just go out with her?
Why don't you marry her?

481
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:37,795
I don't care anymore, OK?
I don't care.

482
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:39,608
God!

483
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,330
I was gonna say

484
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:44,760
she said she thought you were
the nicest guy in the school.

485
00:30:46,587 --> 00:30:47,597
Cindy said that?

486
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,758
No, wait. No, seriously.

487
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:54,497
You don't like Cindy?

488
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:57,607
No. Man, I was just
messin' with you.

489
00:30:57,775 --> 00:31:00,042
Bill's been in love
with Melissa Karpinski

490
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,236
ever since he stood behind
her at the Dairy Queen.

491
00:31:02,783 --> 00:31:04,883
She was wearing this halter top.

492
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:07,914
She is one foxy lady.

493
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:10,411
She doesn't cut the cheese.

494
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:12,705
Come on! Everybody cuts the cheese.

495
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:15,377
Anyways Melissa Karpinski
is way out of your league.

496
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:18,306
She goes out with, like,
the big football players.

497
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,805
I'm going to fill out soon.
You know my cousin Jeff?

498
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,756
He was a shrimp until he turned 16,

499
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:28,161
and then he got all tall
and muscular in a month.

500
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,943
Now he looks like the Hulk.

501
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,768
You really think I'll fill out?

502
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:36,767
Yeah, not like me, though.
In 3 years, I'm going to be enormous.

503
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:39,142
Oh, yeah. Me, too.
My dad is 6'3".

504
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:41,454
Hey, listen, you guys.

505
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:45,012
Why don't we go see
<i>Airplane</i> again on saturday?

506
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:46,950
Surely you will.

507
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:50,046
Don't call me Shirley.

508
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:54,689
"Billy, have you ever seen
a grown man naked?"

509
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:59,502
Hey, why don't we go ask
Gordon to come with us?

510
00:32:00,312 --> 00:32:02,546
But... he smells.

511
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,627
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

512
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,130
But he's really cool.

513
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:09,971
Maybe he doesn't
even know he smells.

514
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,479
Are you gonna tell him?

515
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:18,332
Hey, Gordon.

516
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:20,593
Hey. How's it going
with you-know-who?

517
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,863
Did you join her clubs?

518
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:26,082
Yeah, yeah.
And we got to hang out.

519
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:29,156
- Uh, sort of.
- Cool.

520
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,703
You know, she smells great.
It must be her shampoo.

521
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,998
Or... deodorant or something.

522
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:39,792
What kind of deodorant do you use?

523
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,170
I know I smell, Sam.

524
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,897
What are you talking about?

525
00:32:46,022 --> 00:32:48,801
I may be smelly, but I'm not stupid.

526
00:32:51,342 --> 00:32:53,389
So... What is that?

527
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:57,080
It's a medical condition.
It's called tryptophanuria.

528
00:32:57,205 --> 00:32:58,594
It's genetic.

529
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,187
Wow! Is there a cure?

530
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:04,775
Not yet, but research
is progressing.

531
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:10,518
So you're going to be...

532
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:13,444
smelly the rest of your life?

533
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,650
But I don't mind.

534
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:18,623
Nice people don't care,
and it weeds out the jerks.

535
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,837
My mom says it's a gift.

536
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:22,903
Cool.

537
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,841
You know...

538
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:29,312
Neal, Bill, and I are going
to the movies Saturday night.

539
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:32,572
- You want to come with us?
- OK.

540
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:35,207
I'll try not to stink up the joint.

541
00:33:35,858 --> 00:33:38,338
- Just kidding.
- Yeah, I know.

542
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:39,791
Hey, Sam.

543
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:44,482
- So, did you sell all your ads?
- No, not really.

544
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:47,895
That's OK. No one else
did except for me.

545
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,750
So I'm really glad
you joined the yearbook.

546
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,873
- I had a lot of fun yesterday.
- Yeah, me, too.

547
00:33:55,811 --> 00:33:58,554
So anyway, what are you
doing after school?

548
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,456
Is there another yearbook meeting?

549
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:04,126
No, I was just gonna go to Sackie's,
I was wondering if you wanted to come.

550
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,171
Don't touch the hair!

551
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,618
Stop it!

552
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,843
Yeah, yeah, I'll come.

553
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,637
Definitely. Sure.

554
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,199
Great.

555
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:19,114
All right. I better go sit down.

556
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:21,686
See you after school.

557
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:23,082
See ya.

558
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:24,934
"See you after school."

559
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,070
Thanks, Sam.

560
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,605
Look, are you sure
you don't need any money?

561
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,080
Yeah, I'm fine.

562
00:34:40,573 --> 00:34:42,873
I love bacon cheeseburgers.

563
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:44,309
Really?

564
00:34:45,232 --> 00:34:48,007
I kinda expected you
to like, you know,

565
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:51,248
healthy food like carrots.

566
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:55,469
Yuck! If I ever saw another
carrot again, it'd be too soon.

567
00:34:55,922 --> 00:34:58,180
I mean, my parents
never take us to Sackie's.

568
00:34:58,604 --> 00:35:01,404
That's why I have
to sneak here after school.

569
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,566
- Want some?
- Sure, thanks.

570
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:16,001
He's smiling and nodding because
he wants me to pass him the ball.

571
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:18,576
So I throw it to him,
and he ducks like a girl.

572
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,840
Do you know Todd Schellinger?

573
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,905
Well, not personally.

574
00:35:33,157 --> 00:35:33,957
But...

575
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:36,513
Why?

576
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:44,101
I don't know. He's kinda cute,
don't you think?

577
00:35:47,205 --> 00:35:48,397
I guess.

578
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:51,571
OK, I've never really
told anyone this before.

579
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:56,238
But I have, like,
the hugest crush on him.

580
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:01,327
At last week's game, he asked
my friend Joe for my phone number.

581
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,456
Do you think that means he likes me?

582
00:36:06,368 --> 00:36:07,875
He asked for your phone number?

583
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:12,255
Well, yeah, but...
I mean, he never called.

584
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:16,427
And every time I see him, he acts
like he doesn't even know I exist.

585
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:19,762
Well, maybe he's just shy.

586
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,138
You think?

587
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:26,072
I don't know.

588
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,604
I'm always so nervous around him.

589
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,522
I never know what to say.

590
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,402
It's not like with you.

591
00:36:36,872 --> 00:36:38,985
You're so easy to talk to.

592
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,117
You're just like my sister.

593
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:45,454
Thanks.

594
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,125
My god, did he just look at me?

595
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,557
Don't look.

596
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:00,723
- Have a nice time, honey.
- Don't stay out too late.

597
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:02,658
I won't. Bye.

598
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:04,509
Bye.

599
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:10,713
Sam?

600
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:12,586
Hey, son.

601
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,526
Yeah?

602
00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:18,362
Come on over here and
join your mom and Dad.

603
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,645
- Why? What did I do?
- Nothing, silly.

604
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,036
- Come on.
- Get your butt over here.

605
00:37:25,814 --> 00:37:27,814
- "What did I do?"
- Come on.

606
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:39,008
I have homework.

607
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:41,791
You can do it tomorrow.

608
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:44,090
Family time's more important.

609
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:09,205
You must have been right there.

610
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,111
Perfect timing.

611
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:13,209
Come on in.

612
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,072
I hope you like the Moody Blues.

613
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,312
Oh, yeah, they're really great.

614
00:38:21,437 --> 00:38:24,759
I know, they're kind of wimpy,
but I think this song's OK.

615
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:29,398
So...

616
00:38:30,603 --> 00:38:32,937
Wow! Whose basketball trophies?

617
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,439
Yeah, they're mine.
I actually used to play.

618
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:38,359
Why'd you quit?

619
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:43,248
They found a dime bag in my locker,
and then they kicked me off the team.

620
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:44,907
And then I just lost interest.

621
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,790
Oh, yeah. No, that one's
actually for bowling.

622
00:38:58,353 --> 00:39:00,560
Do you want to hang out
downstairs for a while?

623
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:02,127
Whoa! Uh...

624
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:04,063
Yeah.

625
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Great.

626
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:20,651
Nick, what is all this?

627
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:22,282
Come here.

628
00:39:24,786 --> 00:39:26,706
Sit down.

629
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,547
Lindsay...

630
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:42,142
This song says all the things
I haven't been able to say to you.

631
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,521
It's a little corny.

632
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,033
But I mean it.

633
00:39:49,793 --> 00:39:51,027
Lady...

634
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:54,435
When you're with me, I'm smiling.

635
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:57,865
Give me...

636
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:01,633
<i>All your love</i>

637
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:05,560
<i>your hands</i>

638
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:09,170
<i>build me up when I'm sinking</i>

639
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:12,662
<i>Touch me</i>

640
00:40:13,465 --> 00:40:16,825
<i>and my troubles all fade</i>

641
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:21,173
You see, Lindsay,

642
00:40:21,298 --> 00:40:24,640
nothing about you and me
should ever be rushed.

643
00:40:26,528 --> 00:40:28,681
I made that mistake before.

644
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:32,682
But I'm not going
to make it with you.

645
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:35,213
Because we've got time.

646
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,650
We got all the time in the world.

647
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:42,161
And you know why?

648
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,168
<i>'Cause you're my lady</i>

649
00:41:16,332 --> 00:41:17,551
See, Lindsay,

650
00:41:19,196 --> 00:41:20,646
we were made for each other.

651
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:24,317
You want to make out or something?

652
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,816
No.

653
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:30,025
All guys want to make out.

654
00:41:31,096 --> 00:41:33,200
But I just want to hold you.

655
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:45,463
What's better than this?

656
00:41:57,522 --> 00:41:59,272
Can I have the ding dong?

657
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:01,054
Sure.

658
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,543
How was your "date"?

659
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:06,093
It was OK.

660
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,818
what'd you do?

661
00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:12,484
Mom and Dad made me watch TV
with them all night.

662
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:13,824
They were weird.

663
00:42:14,504 --> 00:42:16,154
Yeah, what else is new?

664
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:19,205
So, is Nick, like,
your boyfriend now?

665
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:21,374
I guess so.

666
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:24,043
But he likes you a lot, right?

667
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,608
Oh, yeah.

668
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,840
I wish Cindy liked me.

669
00:42:30,438 --> 00:42:31,638
She likes you.

670
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:34,762
Yeah... Like a friend.

671
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:38,926
That's the worst.

672
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:43,282
I don't need another friend.
I already have two.

673
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,606
How many more friends
does a guy need?

674
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:57,683
Hello?

675
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:00,913
Oh, hi, Cindy.

676
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:03,589
Todd called?

677
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:14,163
Yeah, it's great.

678
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,530
He said that?

679
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:31,902
No!

680
00:43:33,868 --> 00:43:35,743
No, no, no, I'm not busy.

681
00:43:37,513 --> 00:43:39,363
Tell me what else happened.
