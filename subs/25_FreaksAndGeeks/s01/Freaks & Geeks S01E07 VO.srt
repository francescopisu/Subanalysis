Freaks and Geeks S01E07 Carded and Discarded (VO)

1
00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:04,503
There's 2 ways you can look
at anything in this life.

2
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:06,487
Take my job, for instance.

3
00:00:06,612 --> 00:00:09,062
I could get up
every morning and go...

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,054
"I don't wanna go and help
a bunch of kids.

5
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:15,414
I'm tired." But I don't.

6
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,149
I get up and put on
my shirt and my tie,

7
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:20,311
and I say, "hot dog, let me at 'em!"

8
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,731
Do you actually say
the words "hot dog"?

9
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:25,402
Yes, I do.

10
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:28,576
I know you're struggling.

11
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,080
That's what they made guidance
counsellors for... To help you.

12
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:35,159
I understand you've just
been through puberty.

13
00:00:35,553 --> 00:00:36,730
You guys are tall.

14
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:39,637
I'm surprised you fit through
that door, quite frankly. OK?

15
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:42,507
A lot of times you might see, maybe
you're taking a shower or something,

16
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:44,460
and you go,
"What are these?" "What's that?"

17
00:00:45,363 --> 00:00:48,172
But you feel alone and confused,

18
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:51,133
and you don't think
anyone understands.

19
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:53,443
Well, I do.

20
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:55,721
Lots of people do,

21
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:58,347
even Mr. Alice Cooper.

22
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:01,060
Bet you don't think
he's a square, do you?

23
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,244
No, man.
Alice Cooper rocks.

24
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:04,712
Do you know this song?

25
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:07,767
<i>Lines form on my face and hands</i>

26
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:12,881
<i>Lines form from the ups and downs</i>

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,402
<i>I'm in the middle without any plans</i>

28
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,248
<i>I'm a boy - or girl -
and I'm a man - or woman.</i>

29
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,149
<i>I'm eighteen</i>

30
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:26,294
<i>I get confused every day</i>

31
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:30,534
<i>Eighteen, I just don't
know what to say</i>

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,342
<i>Eighteen, I gotta get away</i>

33
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:37,838
Come on, Nick, fill in
those drums there, will ya?

34
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,578
You guys know what I'm talkin' about?
Is this making any sense at all?

35
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:43,901
I think it is.

36
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:48,389
- Oh, my god.
- That was brutal.

37
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:51,893
I've never hated Alice Cooper
as much as I do right now.

38
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,896
Guys, Mr. Rosso's really
good at the guitar.

39
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,824
Some of those chords are hard.

40
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:00,911
What? You're not gonna
sing again, are you?

41
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,790
No. I was having fun in there,
but I'm worried about you.

42
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,919
- Why?
- Because you're not one of them.

43
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:10,028
You're a different breed.

44
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:12,173
I'm just worried because,
before you know it,

45
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:14,782
you're gonna have to start
applying for colleges.

46
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:17,285
And if you keep going
the way you're going,

47
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,430
some of those colleges
may not want you.

48
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:22,256
Well, maybe I don't want them.

49
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:25,269
You know, not everybody
in this world has to go to college.

50
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:28,699
You know who didn't go
to college? Einstein.

51
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:30,650
Thomas Edison.

52
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,194
Frank.

53
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:37,198
- Frank who?
- The dude who pumps my gas.

54
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,494
Just saying.

56
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:39,717
Lindsay, aunt Judy and uncle Gary
sent you a birthday card.

57
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:46,941
What is it?

58
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,686
Oh, my god.

59
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:53,524
They sent me $300
for my college fund.

60
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:57,637
Through the mail?
She's lucky that wasn't intercepted

61
00:03:57,762 --> 00:04:00,448
by some junkie working
for the post office.

62
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,243
Kids, your dad has a little
treat for us tonight. Harold?

63
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:08,413
Oh, yes. I was visiting
Mr. Prieh at his store today.

64
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,751
And he was selling a game
that my family and I used to play

65
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,369
when I was a kid...
Every Friday night.

66
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:16,509
Pit.

67
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:19,759
Sounds like fun.

68
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:21,237
It is.

69
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,843
It's a stock-trading game.
We all yell at each other

70
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:27,975
trying to get the other players
to trade stocks with us.

71
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,091
We sit around the table
and you yell at us?

72
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:31,729
You do that every night.

73
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,354
I think it sounds like fun.

74
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,652
Well, have a good time.
I'm gonna go out on Friday night.

75
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:38,945
Me, too.

76
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,664
You know what?

77
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:43,934
I'm sick and tired of you two

78
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:46,285
acting as though you don't
belong to a family.

79
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:48,955
You act like you're
staying at a hotel

80
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,473
and we're your employees.

81
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:53,584
Well, guess what?
We are not your employees.

82
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,209
We're your parents.

83
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:57,630
Now, we created you,
and we deserve respect.

84
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,697
We respect you.

85
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:02,166
Oh, you can hardly stand
to be around us.

86
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:06,170
When you two were kids,
you used to run around naked

87
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:08,516
and lay in bed with us all night.

88
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,848
We bathed you,

89
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:12,311
and we cleaned your butts,
and we loved it.

90
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:15,892
Now we try to pat you on the head,

91
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:17,982
and you run for the hills.

92
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:19,457
Well, I'm fed up.

93
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:23,281
We are gonna be close from now on,
whether you like it or not.

94
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:25,873
We are gonna spend
quality time together,

95
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:28,035
and we're going
to enjoy it, damn it!

96
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:36,493
The Weirs are playing pit
this Friday.

97
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:37,868
Get used to it.

98
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:40,934
Natural selection is a process

99
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:43,453
in which weak and inferior genes

100
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:45,344
are weeded out of the gene pool.

101
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:49,682
Many of you may know this concept
by its more popular nom de plume...

102
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,716
Survival of the fittest.

103
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:54,437
That might be Mr. Darwin now.

104
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:05,913
I'm Maureen Sampson.

105
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:07,199
I'm a transfer student.

106
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,828
Well, grab a free seat.

107
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:14,217
Always room for another head
on the chopping block.

108
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,189
I saw Ronald Reagan kissing
a monkey on TV last night.

109
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,451
On the news?

110
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:02,953
No, no, no. It was in a movie.
He's a pretty good actor.

111
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:04,902
So was the monkey...

112
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:15,226
I'm sorry.
Is this your table?

113
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:18,604
Well, we don't own it,
but we kinda sit here every day.

114
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:21,315
- I can sit somewhere else.
- No, please.

115
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,709
Join us.

116
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:32,868
So. Where did you come from?

117
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,560
Florida. My dad was transferred here
to work for General Motors.

118
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:39,423
Really? My dad drives
a Coupe deVille,

119
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:41,419
so we're practically related.

120
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,756
So, are people nice here?

121
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:47,882
Sometimes.

122
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:50,191
You gotta be careful
who you hang out with.

123
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,513
There are a lot of
characters in this school.

124
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:58,092
So, we saw you in our biology class.

125
00:07:58,217 --> 00:07:59,593
How did you like it?

126
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:03,097
It was OK. Teacher seemed
kinda weird, though.

127
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:06,154
Once he ran over an old lady,
and then he blamed it on his car.

128
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,069
He said the accelerator got stuck.

129
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:10,188
Really? We had this teacher
at our school,

130
00:08:10,313 --> 00:08:12,450
this guy broke into his house,
so the teacher shot him.

131
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:16,410
- With a gun?
- Yeah, but he didn't go to jail,

132
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:18,662
'cause I guess if someone
breaks into your house,

133
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:20,687
you're allowed to shoot him.

134
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:23,634
Our shop teacher got his
hair caught in a lathe

135
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,673
and then he got his whole scalp torn
off and now he has to wear a wig.

136
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:31,742
Our shop teacher got his pinky
cut off by the radial arm saw.

137
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:34,382
When they tried to sew it back on,
it didn't fit.

138
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:36,766
So now everyone calls him
Pinky Tuscadero.

139
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,813
I'm really glad I sat here.
You guys are nice.

140
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:45,107
You're really nice.

141
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:50,111
Would you mind showing me
the ropes around here?

142
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:53,262
Sure. We could...
Show you the ropes.

143
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:57,411
But if I start bugging you,
please, be sure and let me know.

144
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:59,492
Oh, don't worry.

145
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:01,417
We'd never let you bug us.

146
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:09,048
Every old person thinks
they're so smart.

147
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,509
What, there's, like,
no old dumb people?

148
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:15,369
I just wanna be older
so I can go to bars.

149
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:18,182
Everything fun in this world
happens in bars.

150
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:20,241
No kidding, man.

151
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:23,300
I hear there's this kick-ass band
called Feedback

152
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:25,246
playing at the Rusty Nail
tomorrow night.

153
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:28,025
But they're gonna card, so I can't...
What can I do?

154
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:31,362
Well, maybe I'll go.

155
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:33,281
You'd better shut up.

156
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:38,801
Just 'cause you got a fake ID,
don't go lording it over the rest of us.

157
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:40,644
You have a fake ID?

158
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,613
Yeah. You wanna check it out?

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,334
It's my cousin's
old driver's license.

160
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:50,214
Oh, my god.
This looks exactly like you.

161
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:51,847
I know.

162
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:54,024
Except it says you're 24.

163
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:54,927
So?

164
00:09:57,136 --> 00:10:00,141
I look mature.
Nobody ever stops me.

165
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,484
Daniel, do you have one?

166
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:09,640
Some stupid bouncer asked
what my star sign was.

167
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,642
I didn't know, so he snagged it.

168
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:14,628
Aw. It's capricorn!
Cancer!

169
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:15,823
Capricorn!

170
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,599
Dude, I hate astrology.

171
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:21,996
What, everybody born in the same
month is gonna have the same life?

172
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,588
Hey, you guys.

173
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,376
We should get fake Ids
and go see Feedback.

174
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:31,078
Howie Gelfand sells fake Ids,

175
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:33,063
but they cost like, a ton of money.

176
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:35,049
I ain't got that kind of cash.

177
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:37,551
Well, it just so happens that...

178
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:40,054
I came into a little bit of cash.

179
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:42,056
I could lend you guys some.

180
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:43,809
Well, well, well.

181
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
I don't know why, but I'm liking
her more and more every day.

182
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,360
Join the club.

183
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,655
What are you... I'm just saying...

184
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:07,481
Hey, Harris. Hey, Gordon.
You met our new friend Maureen?

185
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:09,984
Are you new at our school?

186
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:12,644
Stop by the AV room.
We got a new beta machine.

187
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:14,471
Thank you, Harris.
But we're late.

188
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:17,009
Maureen, tomorrow's
pizza day in the cafeteria.

189
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,693
It's made out of real
tomato sauce and everything.

190
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:24,398
So, what are you guys doing after
school? Want to do something?

191
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:27,401
OK. Great. I don't have
to be home until dinner.

192
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,526
I don't have to be home ever.

193
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,054
Howie?

194
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:50,229
You come and take care
of these fine young people.

195
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,511
We need some fake Ids.

196
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,207
I work here.
Come here.

197
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:10,216
I mean, we need some slacks.

198
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,372
Hello? All right.

199
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:21,839
How many do you guys need?

200
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:23,117
Four.

201
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:26,120
Didn't I just get you one?
You lose it already?

202
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:28,456
Yeah. I'm not into astrology, OK?

203
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,281
Astrology.
It's not astrology.

204
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:34,284
It's you, man. It's facts,
it's who you're supposed to be.

205
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:36,787
June, cancer. Libra, october.
Capricorn, december.

206
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:39,425
Know it. 1958.
You are them.

207
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,135
You gonna give us the IDs or not?

208
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:44,396
Who's the chick?

209
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:47,058
Hey, her name is Lindsay, all right?

210
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:50,734
Sorry, Bill Laimbeer.
You got some good timing.

211
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:53,737
Just about to get a shipment of
genuine Canadian drivers' licenses.

212
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:55,274
Canadian?

213
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:59,852
I need to look at your faces,
memorize them... So I can find a match.

214
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,784
Brown eyes, brown hair.

215
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:08,663
Brown eyes, brown hair.

216
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:14,635
Brown eyes, lovely brown hair.

217
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:18,214
Brown eyes, brown hair.

218
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:23,360
OK. I got it.

219
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:26,180
It's a 100 bucks.
Half in advance.

220
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:29,022
Half of what?

221
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:30,524
I got it.

222
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:32,979
A chick with money.
You got good taste, stretch.

223
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:39,016
Excuse me. Hey, gelfand.
You know what?

224
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:41,502
There's a box of Parisian
nightsuits in the back,

225
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:43,582
and they're not gonna
unpack themselves.

226
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:45,366
I'll be there in one second.

227
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:47,397
I'm just helping these customers.

228
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:49,996
These look great, sir.
I'll see you guys at 11:00?

229
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:51,998
Great. Thanks a lot.

230
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:54,875
Had to bring
the big rocket, didn't you?

231
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,852
What?
So I got a big rocket.

232
00:13:57,977 --> 00:14:00,577
What am I supposed to do,
cut it in half?

233
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:01,799
There she is.

234
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:05,344
She is beautiful.

235
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:08,889
I can't believe she's
gonna hang out with us.

236
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:12,685
What if I'm asleep right now
and this is just a dream,

237
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,204
and any moment Maureen
and I are gonna make love?

238
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:18,138
Then what are we doing here?

239
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,192
Maybe this is my nightmare.

240
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,539
Oh, my god, she's running
to get to us.

241
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,665
Hi, guys!

242
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,251
- Hey, Maureen.
- Your rockets look great.

243
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,503
God, Bill, your rocket's huge.

244
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,632
Oh, it is?
I hadn't noticed.

245
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:47,261
I never launched a rocket before.
This is gonna be fun.

246
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,231
Cape Canaveral, ready for lift off.

247
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,289
Ready to launch this thing?

248
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:54,101
Heck, yeah.

249
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:27,058
So, going to
the Rusty Nail with Nick.

250
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,104
This is gonna be, like,
your guys' first real date, huh?

251
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,035
I don't know.
Not really.

252
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:36,272
We're not going out or anything.

253
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:39,477
Yeah, but you're definitely
more than friends.

254
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:41,683
I don't know.

255
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:46,964
We only kissed once, and it's not...
It's not a big deal.

256
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:51,385
There's a real connection, man.
I'm telling you guys, she likes me.

257
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,961
So are you guys, like, a couple now?

258
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,680
We're not into labelling things,
you know?

259
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:59,683
We have a more mature
relationship than that.

260
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,229
Let's just say we have
an understanding.

261
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,509
Well, I'm glad you have
an understanding,

262
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:07,401
'cause I don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

263
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:12,848
So, is this what having
a girlfriend is gonna be like?

264
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:15,710
She's your best friend
and she's beautiful

265
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,185
and you can say and do
anything in front of her?

266
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,374
My dad always says that's what women
want you to think before marriage.

267
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,042
That's how they suck you in.

268
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,667
She's the kind of woman
you could cut the cheese in front of.

269
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,257
Oh, yeah, Bill, that's
what love is all about.

270
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:30,684
It is.

271
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,014
I mean, you couldn't be in love
with someone if you couldn't.

272
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:37,832
Think about it.

273
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:39,840
That is true.

274
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:43,343
You have to sleep with your wife
every night of your life.

275
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:46,847
If you couldn't blast one in bed,
you'd get physically ill.

276
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:50,111
Oh, come on, guys.
You can't fart in front of a woman.

277
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:54,463
You think you get up and run outside
every time you have to let one rip?

278
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:56,200
You'd never get any sleep.

279
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,412
I think I might like Maureen, too.

280
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,960
I thought you liked Cindy Sanders.

281
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:07,089
I mean, I do, but, you know,
Maureen talks to us.

282
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:09,380
She's not as scary.

283
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,288
No. I'm asking her out.

284
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:12,883
She clearly likes me best.

285
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:14,510
How do you know?

286
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,117
You see the way she looks at me?
She can barely contain herself.

287
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:21,665
You just happen to be looking at her
every time she's thinking about me.

288
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,252
OK. We're all in love with her,
and Maureen likes all of us.

289
00:18:25,377 --> 00:18:28,110
So all we have to do now
is decide who gets her.

290
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,567
How do we do that?

291
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:34,761
The same way we decided
who had to stand in line

292
00:18:34,886 --> 00:18:37,116
for <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> tickets.

293
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,577
I'll get the hat.

294
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,997
Sam, excited about
the big pit game on Friday?

295
00:18:43,677 --> 00:18:46,025
Well, I guess I have to be.

296
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,252
Honey, can you
come in here for a minute?

297
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:54,383
- I like pit.
- You don't even know what pit is.

298
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,215
Honey,

299
00:18:57,682 --> 00:19:01,265
you cannot force these
kids to spend time with us.

300
00:19:01,699 --> 00:19:04,972
Did you know that in some cultures,
if your children shame you,

301
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:07,294
you're allowed
to have them executed?

302
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,558
- Well, I feel shamed.
- Oh, Harold.

303
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:13,028
I'm not swinging an ax.
I just want them to play pit with me.

304
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,612
Is that so horrible?

305
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:18,204
Honey, it's like that old saying...

306
00:19:18,897 --> 00:19:21,775
If you love something, set it free.

307
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:25,206
Maybe if we try not to force it,
they'll come to us.

308
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:28,928
- Well, all right.
- There you go.

309
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:31,566
They're free.
Let 'em free. Let 'em go.

310
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:33,391
- See?
- Get back here.

311
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,778
- All right, Bill, you pick.
- Wait. Why does he get to pick?

312
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:43,432
Because I don't trust you.

313
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:48,118
Just pick fast. Don't try
to feel around for your paper.

314
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:50,270
I'm not. I'm just
trying to pick one.

315
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:52,045
Quit being so paranoid.

316
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:58,779
OK. Now, we know that
the words on this paper

317
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:01,367
could potentially change our lives.
I don't want any...

318
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:03,119
Come on.
Just open the paper.

319
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,331


320
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,398
Oh, no. Not him.

321
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:12,962
I'm the happiest man in the world.

322
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,929
Great, Bill. Now you can
go and fart in front of her.

323
00:20:16,054 --> 00:20:17,633
You'll make quite the impression.

324
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:20,449
Wait a minute.
He wet his paper with spit.

325
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:21,574
What?

326
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:24,181
That's how he wins every time.
He just feels for the wet one.

327
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:26,911
Mrs. Maureen Haverchuck.

328
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,513
Has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

329
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,115
How are we this morning?

330
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,577
I've got some brochures
from some ivy league schools.

331
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,610
Several are in color.

332
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:48,623
Why can't you just leave me alone?

333
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,172
Because it's my job.

334
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:52,585
I'm a guidance counselor.
I'm trying to guide you.

335
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:54,869
Well, guide someone else.

336
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,258
I heard the words,
but your eyes said something else.

337
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,102
They said, "I'm lost.
I need your help.

338
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,221
Don't listen to me.
Guide me."

339
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:06,259
I don't need your help.

340
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:10,600
Tell you what. Why don't I just come
and visit you then in the prison...

341
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:13,648
Where you'll be living...
And give you some really good advice,

342
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:16,299
like should you get shanked
in the yard or the dining hall?

343
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:19,329
When you have your baby, which prison
guard should take care of it?

344
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:21,739
That'd be a great way to do my job,
don't you think?

345
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:25,159
Only time will tell.
See you at the prison yard.

346
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:34,210
All right. Ready to get yourself
a new girlfriend?

347
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:35,836
Never been readier.

348
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,844
What are you gonna say to her?

349
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:41,019
I don't know.
I'm just gonna let the love... flow.

350
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,761
God, this is so unfair.

351
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:45,461
Here she comes.

352
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:48,744
I gotta get something
out of my locker.

353
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:50,526
What are you doing?
Go on.

354
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:53,326
I told you guys. That's why
you should have let me have her.

355
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:55,742
I know what to say to a woman.

356
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:57,650
She's... talking to Vicki.

357
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,165
How do you like it?

358
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,154
It's great. I've met
some really nice people.

359
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:04,735
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

360
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,952
The minute she starts getting with
that crowd, we'll never see her again.

361
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:11,914
You think she'll hang out with us
after all those jocks and cheerleaders?

362
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:15,710
- Why wouldn't she?
- Because they're pod people.

363
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:18,101
It's like <i>Invasion of
the Body Snatchers</i>.

364
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:19,720
They'll make her one of them.

365
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:22,494
We'll see her in a week,
and she'll be all...

366
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,407
Oh, man!

367
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:26,679
We've gotta get her away from Vicki!

368
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,411
What're we gonna do?

369
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:32,643
Oh! Eli!
Eli, come here.

370
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:35,187
Oh, hi! Hi, Bill!
Hi, Neal! Hi, Sam!

371
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,735
Vicki Appleby told me she doesn't
think <i>Three's Company</i> is funny.

372
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,697
But it's the funniest show on TV!

373
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,435
I know. That's what
I told her, but...

374
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,576
I'm gonna go talk to her.

375
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:56,239
Do you cheerlead?

376
00:22:56,364 --> 00:22:57,741
- No, I...
- Excuse me.

377
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,744
<i>Three's Company</i> is
the best show on TV.

378
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:02,920
- Really?
- Yes.

379
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:05,198
The Ropers don't want Jack
living with 2 girls

380
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:09,327
because he doesn't want any dirty stuff
going on in his apartment building.

381
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:13,099
There was this scene where
Jack had lost his voice...

382
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:15,709
Maureen, do you wanna
come to class with us?

383
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:18,134
Oh. Sure.
Talk to you later, Vicki.

384
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:22,215
So, which class are you headed to?

385
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,218
- Social studies.
- Cool. We're going there, too.

386
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:26,238
Cool.

387
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:29,127
Congratulations, everybody.

388
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,324
You're all of age.

389
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:38,584
Who the hell is "Jesus H. Garcia"?

390
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:41,167
It's "hey-zoos".
It's your new identity.

391
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,370
Tell me that picture
doesn't look like you.

392
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,093
This picture doesn't
look like me, man.

393
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:49,621
Sure it does.

394
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:53,057
Well, it's gotta be better than mine.
Mine looks kinda Chinese.

395
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:56,394
Yeah. Hey, mine looks Chinese, too.
What's going on with that?

396
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:00,503
There's a big Vietnamese
community up there in Alberta.

397
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:02,149
This says I'm 29.

398
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:05,653
That doesn't matter. Mine says I'm 34.
I have no problems. It's fine.

399
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:08,642
Why don't you give us
the money back?

400
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:11,617
That's top-grade stuff.
You don't get refunds.

401
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,078
Give us the money back, all right?

402
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:18,666
All right.

403
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:23,526
It's hard to find matches for you guys.
No one in Canada looks like you.

404
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,514
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go with Jesus here.

405
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,015
I think I can pull it off.

406
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,436
Finally, a sane man.
God, this is...

407
00:24:32,861 --> 00:24:34,738
Oh, guys, by the way...

408
00:24:35,214 --> 00:24:37,396
Tomorrow, at Silverman's,
we're having a big sale,

409
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:39,242
half off on all dress shirts.

410
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:42,189
Maybe you guys come by,
I'll hook you up. Be nice.

411
00:24:42,871 --> 00:24:45,192
- Oh, thanks, Howie.
- Yeah. Thanks for nothing.

412
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:49,464
Wait. That's it?
We don't have IDs,

413
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,477
and the band's playing tonight.

414
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:54,452
- That was my only connection.
- Yeah. I don't know anybody.

415
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:57,788
Wait. I think I might.

416
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,929
Maybe we can split up the day

417
00:25:00,054 --> 00:25:02,432
so at least one of us
is with her between each class.

418
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:05,379
That way we can make sure
she doesn't talk to anyone but us.

419
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,052
It's Vicki.

420
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,343
Where's Eli?

421
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:16,515
Sam, quick,
go talk to her about <i>Three's Company</i>.

422
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:17,892
Maureen!

423
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:20,316
You wanna come sit with us?

424
00:25:20,441 --> 00:25:23,105
Oh. Yeah.
I'll talk to you in algebra.

425
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:26,525
Oh, you got pudding.

426
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:29,862
I like pudding, too.

427
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,163
I like it when it's been
sitting around for a while,

428
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:34,909
and it gets that skin on the top.

429
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:39,372
Hi, Maureen.
Good to see you again.

430
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,583
How's your day going?

431
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,001
Great. I've met tons of new people.

432
00:25:45,783 --> 00:25:48,615
- What are you doing this weekend?
- Vicki invited me to a party.

433
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,540
That's gonna be fun, huh?

434
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:53,719
Wasn't that nice of her?

435
00:25:56,968 --> 00:25:58,771
Hey... Millie...

436
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,273
What's going on?

437
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:02,775
Nothing. Just going
to mathlete practice.

438
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,778
Having a scrimmage against
Mount Clemon next week.

439
00:26:05,903 --> 00:26:07,280
You wanna come?

440
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:08,781
No, thanks.

441
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:11,529
Do you ever talk to
your cousin Toby anymore?

442
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:13,823
No way. Not since he went to jail.

443
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:15,783
- He's in jail?
- He was.

444
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:18,758
He got caught stealing
hood ornaments off of cars.

445
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:21,872
They weren't gonna lock him up,
but he called the policeman a bad word.

446
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:24,247
Does he still make fake IDs?

447
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:27,067
I don't know.
My family doesn't talk to him anymore.

448
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:29,473
He was dropped on the head
when he was a baby.

449
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:31,948
That's why we think he's a bad seed.

450
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:35,052
Why do you want a fake ID?
So you can go get loaded?

451
00:26:35,706 --> 00:26:39,140
No. Millie, I just wanna
hear this band play.

452
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,267
That's why there's records.

453
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:43,666
Do you have his number?

454
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,980
I'm not gonna be
an accessory to this crime.

455
00:26:46,294 --> 00:26:48,441
You know where he lives.
Do it yourself.

456
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:52,849
I heard the drinking age is
something like 10 in Idaho.

457
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:55,784
Well, I don't think that's right.

458
00:26:58,589 --> 00:26:59,939
Wait. This is it.

459
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,336
How'd you say you know this guy?

460
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:04,837
He's Millie's cousin.

461
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:07,712
I used to know him
when I was really little.

462
00:27:07,965 --> 00:27:09,670
I think he's kinda scary now.

463
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,339
I think we can handle it.

464
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,057
The pharmacy's closed, all right?
I don't got nothin'.

465
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,142
I got no stuff. Nothin'.

466
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:25,716
Go home.

467
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:27,897
We're here for the IDs?

468
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:30,365
Oh, the IDs. The IDs, yeah.

469
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:33,483
All right. Only one person
is allowed in at a time.

470
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:35,404
One person.
You, McMurphy, you come in.

471
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,260
You two stay.

472
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:40,493
- All right.
- Hey, babies.

473
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:43,162
Don't play with that rooster!

474
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:47,541
Don't play with that rooster.
That's not a nice, petty-pet rooster.

475
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:50,795
- I'm sorry.
- No. You're the one who'll be sorry.

476
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:52,709
Very dangerous.

477
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:55,428
I understand.
I'm sorry.

478
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:07,233
Hey, man, you got a lot of stereos.

479
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:09,108
Where'd you get all this?

480
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:11,738
Don't bother with that.
Get away from there.

481
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:13,239
Get away from there, man.

482
00:28:13,364 --> 00:28:15,364
Don't even look at that stuff.

483
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:24,924
Oh, cool, man!
What's this?

484
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:28,002
I got a green thumb. Don't worry
about it. Sit down.

485
00:28:28,127 --> 00:28:29,127
Relax.

486
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:39,010
Oh, cool.

487
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:41,084
That looks pretty accurate.

488
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:42,763
It's a masterpiece.

489
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:45,266
What, you just made
a stencil and put that on?

490
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:48,352
Yeah, you know.

491
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:52,440
You just go to any art supply store,
you could get that stuff, huh?

492
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,107
And then you just... You need
the laminating machine, right?

493
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:00,470
No, you can't just buy
a laminating machine.

494
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:03,951
You can't just go into a store
and buy one like it's a toaster.

495
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,912
Only corporations have that stuff.
It's very expensive.

496
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,960
All right, man, it's show time.

497
00:29:12,263 --> 00:29:14,450
You can't just get
a laminating machine.

498
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:16,425
What, you wanna go to jail?

499
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,504
Now this is the hot spot.

500
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:20,755
All right...

501
00:29:21,346 --> 00:29:23,592
And, you know...
There's a window here, right?

502
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:26,265
There isn't actually one,
but pretend that there is one,

503
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:30,144
and don't put your face out
further than that, all right?

504
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:38,815
All right, not like this,
you know, back.

505
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,404
Come back, you know?

506
00:29:41,135 --> 00:29:42,495
There you go.

507
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,285
Good. And the hat, take the hat...
You know, what's with the hat?

508
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,456
Good. Look like you've been
waiting on line for 2 hours.

509
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,751
Look like you don't want
to have your picture taken.

510
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:58,339
Well, what are we gonna do?

511
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,499
Why should I help you guys again?

512
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,984
You weren't gonna share her
with me the other day.

513
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,762
Would you share her with us?

514
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:08,610
- Touché.
- So? What do we do?

515
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:11,958
She's gonna be at
Vicki Appleby's party on Saturday.

516
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,214
You need to hang out
with her on Friday.

517
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:17,809
Then, if you show her the time of
her life, maybe... just maybe...

518
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:21,394
she will continue to base that life
out of your lunch table.

519
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,302
What are our chances?

520
00:30:23,427 --> 00:30:24,824
You don't want to know.

521
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:26,701
Where do we take her?

522
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:30,829
Well, there's only one thing that could
compete with the Vicki Appleby party.

523
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:34,326
All-u-can-eat night at
the Iron Horse restaurant.

524
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,296
- Of course.
- So obvious.

525
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:39,672
To me it is.

526
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,719
My god, you...
You are a beautiful girl.

527
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:49,223
- A woman.
- Thanks.

528
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,247
When we were kids,
you were really cute,

529
00:30:51,372 --> 00:30:54,672
but, mean, I never thought
you would turn out this hot.

530
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:57,770
You go to McKinley?

531
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:03,321
It's a pretty good school. I almost
graduated from there a few years ago.

532
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:04,905
Oh, really?

533
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:08,614
You hungry or something?
I have some Freihoffer's cookies.

534
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:10,959
Those are really hard to get,
from the east coast.

535
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,510
- You want one?
- No, thanks, I'm not hungry.

536
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,584
- Is this gonna take a long time?
- Hey, be cool, man.

537
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,608
The laminating machine's
gotta warm up.

538
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:20,755
You're not even
supposed to be back here.

539
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:22,882
Broke my "one person
at a time" rule.

540
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:25,801
All right, sorry.

541
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,602
Hey, wanna go see Yes at Cobo?
I got tickets, I got...

542
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:33,089
You know, Richie Blackmore's Rainbow
is opening up. We could catch up.

543
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:35,353
I don't think I can.

544
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,512
Yeah, you can, just...

545
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:41,991
All right,
give me your phone number.

546
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,483
I'll call you up.

547
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:45,164
Well, um...

548
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,987
Hey, you know, actually,
she's my girlfriend, man,

549
00:31:48,112 --> 00:31:50,969
so do you think maybe
you could stop hitting on her?

550
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:52,959
No, no she's not.

551
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:55,581
Yeah, I am his girlfriend.

552
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:03,679
Hey, man, that's not cool.
That's not cool.

553
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:06,676
You know, now you make me feel like
a fool for asking for your number.

554
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:09,035
No, you can have my phone number.

555
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,055
It's just that I have a boyfriend.

556
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:15,005
I don't need to ask. I could just
get it from my cousin Millie, you know?

557
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,519
I was just being polite.

558
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:21,267
You know, let's just
get this over with.

559
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:24,568
It's 75 each.

560
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:27,154
I thought you said it was 40 each.

561
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:29,706
- Did I?
- I think so.

562
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,686
100 each.

563
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:36,205
Let's just do it
and get it over with.

564
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:42,258
Look at how much hotter
you look in this one

565
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:44,046
than in your real driver's license.

566
00:32:45,127 --> 00:32:47,758
Whoa, is this one fake, too?

567
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:48,926
No, why?

568
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,215
Because it says you're 18.

569
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:56,225
So, was left back one year.

570
00:32:56,831 --> 00:32:58,174
Well, I know.

571
00:32:58,538 --> 00:33:00,929
But still, it wouldn't make you 18.

572
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:05,615
All right, I was left back twice.

573
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,340
OK, are you happy now?

574
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:09,989
There's no secrets between us.

575
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,302
All right.

576
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:15,044
18, that makes me jail bait.

577
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,991
You better watch out.
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

578
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:22,733
Officer, I didn't know,

579
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:25,618
look at her,
she looks like she's 30.

580
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,006
No I don't!

581
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:28,591
2-2-2-2-2-2.

582
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,092
2, 2 you want, 2 you have.

583
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:35,181
I have cornered
the market on Barley.

584
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:38,059
What happened to the corn?
I'm looking for corn, here.

585
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,067
I don't know where the corn went.

586
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:42,821
Hey, you two, come on,
pull up a chair.

587
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:46,442
We have a lot of high-stakes trading
going on right here in the pit.

588
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:49,151
- Dad, I told you I'm gonna go out.
- Yeah, me, too.

589
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:51,030
See you later.
Have a good night.

590
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:54,113
- Don't worry, we will!
- Be careful, OK?

591
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:56,535
Let the trading begin.

592
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:59,118
I told you. We should have
forced them to stay with us.

593
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:00,915
You want to keep playing pit?

594
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:05,336
No. This is a terrible game
with just two people.

595
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,077
Nobody's home.

596
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:09,840
You wanna have a little sex?

597
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:11,521
Sex?

598
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:15,513
Well... OK.

599
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:20,326
Let's go.

600
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:22,432
In the bedroom.

601
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,130
So, how does this all work?

602
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:29,532
Well, we order a lot of food,

603
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:32,209
and then keep asking for more
until they go out of business.

604
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:34,139
My mom says it takes a little while

605
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:37,490
for your stomach to tell your brain it's
full. So you should eat really fast.

606
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:40,496
Yeah, but the only problem is,
the service is really slow.

607
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,990
Yeah, they take forever on purpose,
so you'll get full while you wait.

608
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,103
Watch how much bread they bring us.

609
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:48,963
Yeah, well, I'm here to eat ribs,
lots of ribs.

610
00:34:50,102 --> 00:34:52,550
Good evening.
Welcome to the Iron Horse.

611
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:55,928
I hear service here is really bad
'cause you don't want us to eat much.

612
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:59,724
What? I don't own the place.
I don't care how much you eat.

613
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:01,058
Are you sure?

614
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:04,812
No, actually, I'm a millionaire
and I just do this for fun.

615
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,135
Really?

616
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,274
We just want our money's worth.

617
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:12,153
I'll bring 'em faster than you
can eat 'em, but I want a 20% tip.

618
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,905
20? I thought 10 was the norm.

619
00:35:15,311 --> 00:35:17,491
15 is standard.
20 is classy.

620
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,621
20 it is. Why are we still talking?
I want some ribs.

621
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:27,523
This is gonna be
the best night ever.

622
00:35:27,648 --> 00:35:29,170
I hope so.

623
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,526
Oh, I forgot your bread.

624
00:35:34,388 --> 00:35:35,388
See?

625
00:36:04,068 --> 00:36:05,711
You see that show <i>Different Strokes</i>?

626
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:08,321
That little Gary Coleman,
"what you talkin' 'bout, Willis?"

627
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:09,915
He used to crack me up.

628
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:12,968
Man, I'm nervous.

629
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:15,174
Just do it like we discussed it.
It's OK.

630
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:17,885
Hey, Jimmy, what's up?

631
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:19,842
- Hey, man.
- Let's see some ID.

632
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:22,390
Really? OK.

633
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:25,977
I didn't know you guys were carding
tonight. I hope I brought it.

634
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:28,599
The suspense is killing me.

635
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:31,025
There it is.

636
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:35,522
Being a sagittarius,
I'm always forgetting these things.

637
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:37,988
- Go on.
- Yeah, thanks.

638
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,995
Where's your mustache, Jesus?

639
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:45,955
It's hay-soos, and I shaved it.

640
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,208
Too bad. You looked better with it.

641
00:36:49,748 --> 00:36:50,748
Gracias.

642
00:36:51,264 --> 00:36:52,489
Se}or.

643
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,926
It's great you guys are carding.
Makes me feel like a kid again.

644
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,011
Thank you.

645
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,100
Hey. How are you?

646
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,185
All right, come on in.

647
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,404
Do you want to see my ID?

648
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,829
No, you're good.

649
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:17,278
Those IDs look nuts!

650
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:21,264
Business must be pretty bad if
we're supposed to let them in.

651
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,244
Where's the waitress
when you need her?

652
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,913
Got to take advantage
of this evening.

653
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:30,791
Oh, man, I'm excited.

654
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:40,739
We wouldn't be here without you.
So thanks a lot, all right?

655
00:37:41,832 --> 00:37:45,139
Good evening, everybody.
Are you ready to rock?

656
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:47,154
Ready! Yeah!

657
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,148
Always ready to rock!

658
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:52,563
Then put your hands together
for a little band we like to call...

659
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:54,851
Feedback!

660
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:02,061
I hope there's a lot of party
people out there tonight,

661
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:04,119
'cause we are gonna party!

662
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,147
Jeez, I wonder if we'll
ever see her again?

663
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:56,836
Sure, we'll see her plenty.

664
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,368
Sitting at the popular table.

665
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:01,125
No way.
She's cool.

666
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,489
We'll be friends with
her for a long time.

667
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:04,837
I hope so.

668
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:11,013
That's my dad.
Better get going.

669
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:12,338
Thanks again.

670
00:39:14,278 --> 00:39:16,018
You sure you don't want any money?

671
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:18,065
No, no, no, it's on us.

672
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,898
I had a really good time.
We should do it again.

673
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:22,958
Yeah, that would be great.

674
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:24,960
See you guys later.

675
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:26,485
Specials are good.

676
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:39,676
How are we not supposed
to be in love with her?

677
00:40:00,644 --> 00:40:01,692
They're not bad.

678
00:40:06,877 --> 00:40:08,965
All right! All right.

679
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:10,758
Hey, everybody!

680
00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:14,259
I've got a great group
of hard-working rockers

681
00:40:14,384 --> 00:40:18,034
behind me right here, and I'd like
to introduce them all to you, but first,

682
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:21,796
we have some special guests in
the audience I'd like to introduce.

683
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,108
All the way from
McKinley high school,

684
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:28,218
we've got the key members of another
smokin' band we like to call "Creation."

685
00:40:29,506 --> 00:40:33,282
Daniel Desario, Ken Miller,
Nick Andopolis, Kim Kelly,

686
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:35,367
and their manager,
miss Lindsay Weir.

687
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:37,144
Give 'em a big hand.

688
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,649
Hold on, sue, hold on.

689
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:44,962
I can't let you serve
our guests plain old beer.

690
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:48,656
Why don't you bring them
some of your finest pop,

691
00:40:49,395 --> 00:40:50,545
on the house.

692
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,762
Finest pop.

693
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:07,832
Perfect.

694
00:41:09,406 --> 00:41:10,406
Thanks.

695
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:14,388
I was just starting
to like that guy, too.

696
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:23,852
The moment of truth.

697
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:32,492
Hey, guys.

698
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,703
Hey, do you mind if I go over
and sit with those guys today?

699
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,803
No, no, not at all.

700
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:45,167
Do you want to come and sit with me?

701
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:46,547
Over there?

702
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:49,922
You don't have to sit here forever
if you don't want to.

703
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:52,124
Yeah, but we like it here.

704
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:54,355
Yeah, go have fun with your friends.

705
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,098
We'll be here if you need us.

706
00:41:58,005 --> 00:41:59,105
OK.

707
00:41:59,362 --> 00:42:00,728
Oh, wait, before you do...

708
00:42:01,738 --> 00:42:03,352
Just remember,

709
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:05,358
the jocks are only after one thing.

710
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:09,904
And be careful around Vicki.
She's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

711
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,795
And remember,
don't believe everything they say

712
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,921
about people in the school.

713
00:42:15,606 --> 00:42:18,215
'cause they don't always take
the time to get to know everyone.

714
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,791
Guys, I'm just sitting 3 tables over,
I'm not moving back to Florida.

715
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,253
Well, we know.

716
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:29,423
- See you in biology class?
- See you in biology class.

717
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:12,550
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

718
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:16,012
It is, by you, my good man.

719
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:22,977
Did you guys happen to see
<i>Three's Company</i> last night?

720
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:25,582
It was so funny.

721
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:27,710
What happened?

722
00:43:27,835 --> 00:43:30,610
I don't really remember,
there was a lot going on.

723
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:33,279
Joyce DeWitt is really hot.

724
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:35,293
If I was Jack,
I'd have a very hard time

725
00:43:35,418 --> 00:43:37,735
choosing between
the 2 lovely ladies on the show

726
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,466
because, you know,
one's a brunette, one's a blonde...
