1
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:39,203
You shall murder!

2
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:41,705
You shall covet everything
all week long

3
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:46,042
And on Sundays...

4
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:49,295
You shall beat your father and mother,

5
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,215
...your sister and your juniors
You shall steal

6
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,259
Because everything around
you is yours

7
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:58,137
Everything is yours!

8
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:35,212
He sacrificed everything
passion, his family, his career...

9
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,758
Perhaps even his emotions...

10
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,136
Taking leave of our late friend today,

11
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:48,433
...the winner of eleven international
gold medals

12
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:53,145
...and participant of many exhibitions

13
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,898
I would like to offer

14
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,484
...my condolences

15
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,113
...to his family

16
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:08,493
I bow down before this grave

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,246
Farewell, my friend

18
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:45,026
Just take a look at this
tin-plated door, damn him

19
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:52,658
Well?

20
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:54,285
Wait a minute, let me see it

21
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:10,383
Right, an alarm device

22
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:12,510
Stop yelling

23
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:33,821
Shit, look

24
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:37,700
Ah well, starved to death

25
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:40,160
Get a strainer

26
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,751
No good, it's been nailed up

27
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:51,003
But why?

28
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:53,422
What do you mean, why? Why the
alarm device,

29
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:56,467
why the padlocks and bars

30
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:57,843
Don't you know what kind of man
Father was?

31
00:03:59,052 --> 00:03:59,970
Not too well, and what about airing?

32
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,472
No idea
He probably never aired it

33
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:11,577
No, thanks
I have business later on

34
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:14,830
Come on, it isn't much
To Father

35
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:16,123
Cheers!

36
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,504
How much is it worth, I wonder?

37
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:26,341
I don't know, but the stamps
are expensive nowadays

38
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:31,179
Well, some three or four thousand,
I guess

39
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:36,600
Yeah, this is our poverty

40
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:40,520
Mother's wasted life...

41
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:45,025
No decent meals, no money...

42
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,401
Oh come on

43
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:48,653
I say, he didn't even own
a decent suit to

44
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:50,822
be buried in,
I had sacrificed one of mine

45
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,658
Tell me, what is it that makes one so...

46
00:05:55,117 --> 00:05:57,619
So greedy? So set on possessing

47
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:01,748
You should know,
you like to own things

48
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:06,711
No, I just use them
I like to be comfortable

49
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,213
But I couldn't understand the old man
for a long time

50
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:14,051
I say, it's ages since we last met

51
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:17,596
Yeah, over two years?

52
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,422
Hey, look

53
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:00,260
He collected press cutting about you

54
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,179
May I?

55
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:03,680
Yes

56
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:09,852
My name's Bromski
Are you the son?

57
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:11,979
Yeah

58
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:13,773
I'd like to talk to you...

59
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:16,942
I know this is not the best
moment possible,

60
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:19,278
but you see that's
how it is with business

61
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:20,445
All right, what is it?

62
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:24,449
Your father and I were friends
I have here...

63
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:33,082
Your father owed me

64
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,417
...two hundred twenty thousand

65
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,461
...zlotys

66
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:39,171
He never told me

67
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:42,090
I ought to get the money back
in a few days

68
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:45,260
Well, I know a funeral coasts a lot...

69
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:46,886
But perhaps...

70
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:51,974
I could find an equivalent here,

71
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:53,559
if you know what I mean

72
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:56,645
To save you the trouble

73
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,649
Here's my phone number

74
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:05,445
Phone me in five days
I'll try to raise the money for you

75
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:07,447
Thank you so much

76
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:08,990
If I get you right,

77
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:12,785
You aren't going to get rid of
the collection for the time being?

78
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,918
Of course, you certainly have
your reasons

79
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,380
In your place, I think
I'd do the same

80
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,342
Well, sorry for bothering you

81
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,642
Dad owed a fellow two hundred
twenty thousand

82
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,813
That one was the first to come...
As yet

83
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,443
Nothing but rags

84
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:53,698
Look, this was his way
to iron pants Under the sheet

85
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,451
What's this?

86
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:58,994
Those cuttings about you

87
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,164
And I thought he never
even knew my name

88
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:19,012
I say, I've heard such guys have
a market or something, well?

89
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:20,973
Would you like to have a try?

90
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,309
What about that lame fellow
who was here?

91
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:26,269
No, he's too clever

92
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,649
And what about your kid?
Doesn't he collect stamps?

93
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:34,068
Uh-uh, he only likes planes

94
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:39,531
Then why not give him these?

95
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,117
Balloons or something

96
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:45,453
Zeppelins

97
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:47,372
All right, Zeppelins
It's a series

98
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:55,462
Polarfahrt, this means they're German

99
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:58,590
Uhm... 1931

100
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,311
Which one's yours?

101
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:15,606
This one here
The first tenants

102
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:19,985
Quite nice, and tell the kid
I have an LP for him

103
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,862
He's not really a kid anymore

104
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:24,322
Well, bye, then

105
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:27,117
To the Riviera Club, please

106
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,245
I'm glad we met

107
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:49,220
I'm sorry, I couldn't make it
We'll go tomorrow

108
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:52,223
Artur and I started talking after the
funeral and we quite forgot the time

109
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:54,558
I haven't said anything

110
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:58,562
No reception tomorrow

111
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:03,024
Well, the day after tomorrow then
I'll ring him up

112
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:05,860
I'm sorry, really

113
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:07,153
I haven't said a word

114
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,988
That's true, you haven't...

115
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:13,534
Your slippers

116
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:19,206
This is from Grandpa, as a souvenir

117
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:21,875
Gee, they're nice

118
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,921
Grandpa died, you know

119
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:30,758
He was buried a few hours ago

120
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:36,931
Hey, what's that? You crying?

121
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,267
Not really, I've cried already

122
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:43,270
Mum told me at dinner

123
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:47,148
I'm sorry about Grandpa

124
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,530
Have you had toothache?

125
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,951
No...

126
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,245
I couldn't make it

127
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:07,167
Mum was angry
She shouted at me all day long

128
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:37,194
Good morning

129
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,866
I'd like to have this priced
And possibly to find a purchaser

130
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:48,621
Are you Korzen's son?

131
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:50,623
Yes

132
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,251
This is but a fragment of his collection

133
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:57,379
I could sell more, I don't know...
perhaps the whole of it

134
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,840
Could you please wait a moment, sir?

135
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:11,642
Our president would like to talk to you

136
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:15,271
May I trouble you a minute, please?

137
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,313
Why, of course

138
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,904
There are two of you,
if I remember right

139
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,739
Yes

140
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:31,035
Could we perhaps meet at
your father's flat?

141
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:37,291
Of course, I'll write the address
down for you

142
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,542
I know the address

143
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,759
Well, gentlemen
What are you planning to do?

144
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:49,385
We'd like to sell it

145
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:50,887
We need money

146
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:56,100
How much of it?

147
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,519
Doesn't matter, just money

148
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:02,230
I see

149
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:17,202
Well, you can buy a 126 Fiat
for this one

150
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:22,999
And this one will get you two cars
with Diesel engines

151
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:31,048
And this series would be enough
to buy a flat

152
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:36,762
I believe you don't realize

153
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:43,059
Well, and what is the value...
of the whole lot?

154
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:46,396
Millions and millions

155
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,526
Your father wanted to insure
his collection...

156
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:54,320
...for two hundred fifty million zlotys

157
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,407
You see, your father put all his life

158
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,327
...in it

159
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:08,499
It would be criminal to waste thirty
years of somebody's life away

160
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,502
Even if that somebody was

161
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,754
...just one's father whom one hardly
knew at all

162
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,429
Good-bye, gentlemen

163
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:29,519
Good-bye

164
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:36,609
Bloody hell

165
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:41,071
Yeah, quite a surprise

166
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:48,786
Hush, Mum's asleep
Have you been at the office?

167
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:55,042
Yeah, in the morning
But then... I met Artur

168
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:58,754
Mum tried to reach you several times

169
00:15:58,962 --> 00:15:59,755
Why?

170
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:12,975
Are these autographs?

171
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:15,686
Yes

172
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:18,647
See what Artur wrote here?
For Peter to make his life happier

173
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:21,775
I say, what have you done with
those Zeppelins?

174
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,360
I exchanged them for these

175
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,278
Look how many I got

176
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:30,283
Whom...

177
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:32,952
...did you give them to?

178
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,124
Tell me

179
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,626
All right, which one was it?

180
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,753
The one with glasses

181
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,630
Stay here
Don't go anywhere

182
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,678
I have some business with you

183
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,638
Yes, sir

184
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,599
Not here
It's confidential

185
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:12,613
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

186
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:16,200
Careful, Mister, or...

187
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,451
You've cheated a kid

188
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:18,619
One has to make a living

189
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,203
He's my son

190
00:17:22,372 --> 00:17:24,207
Ah well, nearly everyone has
parents nowadays

191
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,085
I want that series with Zeppelins back

192
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,424
I sold it

193
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:35,384
To whom? Out with it!

194
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:39,805
To that fellow in Wspolna street

195
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:45,560
Thank you

196
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:52,900
I have an unpleasant business with you

197
00:17:57,488 --> 00:17:59,698
A boy from Swietokrzyska street
offered you a series of stamps

198
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:03,160
You bought it for forty thousand

199
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:03,994
I'm afraid that stamp cheated
my son out of

200
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,161
those stamps and gave
him rubbish instead

201
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:07,956
I don't know
what you're talking about

202
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,123
I see

203
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:15,004
Say I'd like to buy something
in your shop...

204
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:20,467
Well, a series of German stamps,
Polarfahrt with the Zeppelins in them

205
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,886
From 1931...

206
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:24,262
Could we perhaps...?

207
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,556
Do you want to buy?

208
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:27,599
We may...

209
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,310
...discuss it

210
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:44,948
Is this what you mean?

211
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:46,616
Yes

212
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,451
Well, it's for sale

213
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,410
How much?

214
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,124
Er... Two hundred forty thousand

215
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:57,876
The price isn't high

216
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:03,798
Well, if that's so, the next time
I'll bring the police here

217
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,133
I'm sorry

218
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:08,011
It's all right

219
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:11,764
You can use my phone, sir

220
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,308
Well, do you want to

221
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:22,232
...use the phone or not?

222
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:31,157
I've got a receipt here

223
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:35,452
The former owner of the series was

224
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:38,205
...going abroad and sold the stamps
to me for

225
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,334
...one hundred sixty-eight thousand

226
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,419
Here's the stamp duty

227
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:50,716
And this is my license

228
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:52,718
Take a look, please

229
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:05,397
That was your favourite group
NAME?

230
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:08,941
And now a short break

231
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:15,739
You'll catch a cold

232
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:16,740
I'm free now

233
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:19,076
Things have turned out badly
with the Zeppelins

234
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:21,578
Those men are gangsters

235
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:23,205
Ah, that fellow phoned me,
Father's creditor,

236
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:25,665
you know, I'm to meet him on Sunday

237
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,666
Two hundred twenty thousand, eh?

238
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,667
Precisely

239
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:33,214
Well, I have some ninety thousand,
I was saving to buy Peter some furniture

240
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:34,507
What does your wife say?

241
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:36,925
She suspects me of having an affair
Now I have to stay in town on Sunday

242
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:42,556
And it's sure to strengthen her
suspicious Have you got the money?

243
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:44,975
Where from? I'm not the saving kind

244
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:49,729
But I might sell the amplifier

245
00:20:50,271 --> 00:20:51,522
Don't you need it to play?

246
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,524
It's not an instrument

247
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:56,819
I paid about fifty dollars for it,
I guess

248
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,278
I should get some seventy
thousand back

249
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:00,280
Yeah, that's it

250
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:01,948
And the rest of money?

251
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:09,455
The stamps?

252
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,501
Well...

253
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:17,629
I don't know...

254
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,842
I'd rather that we don't sell them
for the time being

255
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:25,011
I mean, not until we have to

256
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:27,180
I feel the same

257
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:30,099
Good

258
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,686
Let them stay where they are

259
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:21,076
God damn you!
I thought it was some stranger

260
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:24,996
What the hell are you doing here?

261
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:28,958
Looking at the stamps
I was here yesterday, too

262
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:32,086
I didn't know
I've been here today morning

263
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:43,180
What's the matter?
Have you been fired?

264
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:44,431
No

265
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:50,978
I'm anxious about this flat

266
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,147
You know, all those safety devices
are nothing, actually

267
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:56,859
Anybody could have entered the flat
just as you did

268
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,821
Besides, I'm registered as tenant here

269
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:03,365
Why, of course
I'll feel better, too

270
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:05,658
Hey, take a look at what I found

271
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:12,290
The only series in Poland
And it's incomplete

272
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,043
The blue one, the yellow one...

273
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:18,045
The red one's missing

274
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:21,923
Now listen, this is what the
old man wrote

275
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:25,301
Red Austrian Mercury of 1851

276
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:28,471
Stolen during the celebrated
robbery in 1965...

277
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:32,475
Appeared for a short time in Krakow,
at J.'s...

278
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:34,060
Was it sold or exchanged?

279
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:37,354
In 1968, before J. Left Poland

280
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:41,233
News from K.B.R.
It's now in Southern Poland

281
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:44,819
Could M.W. have it?

282
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:47,614
Is there a chance?
Just a sign, not money...

283
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,366
Half the note book is taken
by such notes

284
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,494
Figures, symbols...

285
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,289
Most of it, I just can't make out
I've been reading for several hours

286
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,130
The red Austrian Mercury

287
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:08,466
It would look swell together with
the other two, wouldn't it?

288
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,219
It's red...

289
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,856
They just slip down a rope...

290
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,275
...or jump down

291
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,987
...and there they are
It's just a few metres

292
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:38,243
You mean, a grating?

293
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:42,998
Yes, in both windows

294
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,293
The ideas the old man had,
nailing them up

295
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,088
A pane's just a pane, it's enough
to break it and you're inside

296
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:53,924
I say, Arthur...

297
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:58,971
I forgot I ever had any problems

298
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:02,599
I forgot everything

299
00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:07,187
Know what? I feel the same somehow

300
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:10,106
Like many years ago,

301
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:14,860
...when we were just kids and didn't care
about the grown-ups' problem

302
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:17,821
It's the same now

303
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:20,490
...as we sit here like this

304
00:26:20,907 --> 00:26:25,245
Nothing matters anymore

305
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:28,414
Yes, one forgets... lt's children

306
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:30,666
But nice

307
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:33,502
Oh yes, very...

308
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:40,092
Maybe the rest of your life
simply isn't there...

309
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:44,679
...if you don't want it to pester you

310
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,980
Hey, I've just thought of something

311
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,985
Find a stamp for me,

312
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:03,655
...worth say about 200 thousand

313
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:06,533
But it must be an official price,
printed in catalogue or something

314
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,993
Two hundred thousand?

315
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:10,453
Yes

316
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:14,373
With pleasure, wait a moment

317
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,376
I found this

318
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:21,088
How much is it worth?

319
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:28,011
Where have you found it?

320
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:28,803
At home

321
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:31,055
Your own?

322
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:32,473
Possibly

323
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:40,731
Well, it's worth...

324
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:44,067
Say, fifteen thousand

325
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:46,069
I can buy it from you

326
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:48,363
For three thousand...

327
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:51,866
No, five

328
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,660
Four

329
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:55,995
It's stolen property

330
00:27:58,497 --> 00:27:59,414
Ah well, O.K.

331
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:15,930
Here you are

332
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:19,057
Thank you

333
00:28:22,018 --> 00:28:22,894
What are you doing?

334
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:27,649
Shall we listen to it?
Check the recording, you know

335
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:33,112
It's worth, say, fifteen thousand

336
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:36,365
I can buy it from you
for three thousand

337
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:37,366
No, five

338
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:39,993
Four, it's stolen property

339
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:45,832
All right, let's come to brass tacks

340
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,500
What do you want?

341
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:54,673
Three German stamps with Zeppelins,
issued in 1931

342
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:00,012
I'm giving you four thousand for them
and a brand new Sony cassette

343
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:03,848
The recording only takes the first
few metres

344
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,142
And it's a ninety-minute cassette, see?

345
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,728
Clever, that

346
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:10,771
I had an inkling when you came in

347
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:13,774
You should have followed your instinct

348
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:16,277
Yeah, a fellow came to me
to the other day...

349
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:17,403
My brother

350
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:20,572
Not as clever as you

351
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:23,950
He didn't know everything then

352
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:26,828
He didn't know you

353
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:28,788
Do you want money, or the stamps?

354
00:29:29,872 --> 00:29:30,623
The latter

355
00:29:32,124 --> 00:29:33,542
I see

356
00:29:35,544 --> 00:29:37,463
You're...

357
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:42,384
...the sons of...?

358
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:50,099
Who is it?

359
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:52,059
It's me

360
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:53,644
Jerzy

361
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:54,895
A moment

362
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:57,606
What's that beast you have there?

363
00:29:57,731 --> 00:29:59,691
Wait a minute

364
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:08,866
What was that?

365
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:12,787
A dog, I locked him in the bathroom

366
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:16,165
My key doesn't fit the lock, damn it

367
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,708
I changed the lock

368
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,044
They say you should do it
from time to time

369
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:22,587
Who says so?

370
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:25,298
Friends of mine who know a thing
or two Here's your new key

371
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:28,092
The next time would you please
tell me in advance

372
00:30:28,718 --> 00:30:31,304
I've spent half a day wandering about
and trying to reach you on the phone

373
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,513
And what about that dog?

374
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:34,098
Just a dog

375
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:36,850
Does he ever stop?

376
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:40,562
Those friends told me to get one,
so I bought him, shall I let him out?

377
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:43,106
O.K.

378
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:43,940
I'm afraid he might bite you

379
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:46,484
But you've got to do something
about him He should know I'm not a thief

380
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:48,528
I'm scared of him myself

381
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:51,280
Lokis! To heel! Halt!

382
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:55,492
To heel, Lokis?

383
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:11,883
Gee, do something

384
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:15,261
This is Jerzy, a friend

385
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:18,472
He's a friend

386
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:20,974
Just look at him

387
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:23,059
Jerzy is a friend
Isn't he nice?

388
00:31:24,853 --> 00:31:25,895
What about the Zeppelins?

389
00:31:26,104 --> 00:31:27,689
It's all right, I've got them
Over there

390
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:34,403
Good doggie, good doggie

391
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:36,655
Stroke him

392
00:31:38,824 --> 00:31:40,742
Good doggie... Down, Lokis!

393
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,413
No, that's good

394
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:47,832
On my way here, I came across
that fellow with a limp,

395
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,876
Remember him?
The one Father owed money

396
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:50,877
What did he want?

397
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:52,837
He was glad to see me He said
he had friends in the neighborhood

398
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:56,423
Did he come here?

399
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:58,509
No, why?

400
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:01,803
Sit down

401
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:04,681
Let him have it

402
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:05,515
What if he bites?

403
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,141
He won't

404
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:09,060
Hey, what's that?

405
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:12,271
Uhm... perhaps you should try
with the left

406
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:16,317
Good, doggie, good Lokis

407
00:32:17,192 --> 00:32:19,570
See, he only accepts what you give him
with your left hand, he's your friend now

408
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:20,696
The left hand or the right?

409
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:21,780
Come on, risk it

410
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:27,535
Who's that?

411
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:31,247
Get him, Lokis!

412
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:38,670
Good doggie, keep guard

413
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:43,466
Some beast, that dog

414
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:47,345
I say, I might stay here for the night
He'll get used to me this way

415
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,596
Sure

416
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,559
Where are the Zeppelins?

417
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:06,571
The shop-owner's quite a fellow

418
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:07,572
Is he?

419
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,366
Yeah, wants to talk to us

420
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:16,705
Now, gentlemen

421
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,252
Have you already
come across the problem

422
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,755
...called the red Austrian Mercury?

423
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,009
Well, we have

424
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,013
Do you know...

425
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:36,765
...its value?

426
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:38,600
All we know there's one such stamp
in Poland

427
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,103
And I know

428
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,230
...who has it

429
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,778
Your father tried to find out
but couldn't... all those years

430
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,197
As far as I know,
he was very particular about it

431
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,743
If you gentlemen are interested, too...

432
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:02,664
We're rather out of cash, my brother
here even sold his car, but...

433
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:06,459
Oh no, money's not the problem

434
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:07,377
Well, what is the problem then?

435
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:09,837
You see, gentlemen...

436
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:18,053
I'd like us to meet again
to discuss it

437
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,390
Only you'd have to have
some tests made

438
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:23,475
What tests?

439
00:34:23,642 --> 00:34:25,727
Nothing special

440
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,646
Blood group, sedimentation, urine...

441
00:35:10,017 --> 00:35:10,560
Ye-es...

442
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:15,773
As I told you,
this is not a financial problem

443
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:18,609
The man I was telling you about
lives in Tarnow

444
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:23,238
You know, the owner of
that red Austrian Mercury

445
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,281
And what does he want?

446
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:28,785
Just two stamps, a tiny series...

447
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:34,874
...owned by a serious
Szczecin businessmen

448
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:35,874
Well, what about him?

449
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,835
That's a good question

450
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,295
He in turn needs...

451
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:44,174
...a small and inconspicuous stamp

452
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:46,092
Which we have, right?

453
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,303
But why on earth you needed
our blood groups?

454
00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:50,263
No

455
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:52,974
You haven't that stamp

456
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:56,810
Who has, then?

457
00:35:57,061 --> 00:36:00,188
It so happens that... I do

458
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:11,824
You're the one

459
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:15,744
Why not me?

460
00:36:17,204 --> 00:36:18,705
He's got the right blood group

461
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:21,666
You see, gentlemen...

462
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:25,503
the red Austrian Mercury

463
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:29,298
...is worth over two million

464
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:31,509
But it's not for sale

465
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:36,388
All of the parties involved
care for an exchange only

466
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:43,019
What about you?
Is blood what you want?

467
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:44,813
No

468
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:47,607
A kidney

469
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:57,449
My daughter is seriously ill
A girl of sixteen

470
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:02,704
I've been looking for someone

471
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:06,583
Your father was too old

472
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,130
Hell, what am I supposed to do?
Let them

473
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:15,758
remove one of my kidneys
to get a blood stamp?

474
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:20,470
To get the red Austrian Mercury

475
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,848
You're right, why, you have a family,
wife and son

476
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:25,767
No, I didn't mean that

477
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:31,105
Why, it's a part of myself

478
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:32,982
That's true

479
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:36,819
In your place,
I wouldn't hesitate a minute

480
00:37:36,902 --> 00:37:38,821
What do I need that bloody kidney for,
I've got another one to live on

481
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,698
A guy I know had his kidney removed
over twenty years ago

482
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:42,866
...and he lives a normal life,

483
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:45,326
likes his liquor
and women and so on, no problem at all

484
00:37:45,994 --> 00:37:47,954
And there's another thing!

485
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:53,918
I would also think about that girl
to save the life of a young girl

486
00:37:55,878 --> 00:37:57,421
It's so humane

487
00:37:58,464 --> 00:37:59,464
Artur...!

488
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,511
Come on, I'm not trying to persuade you

489
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:07,180
It's your kidney

490
00:38:09,432 --> 00:38:11,058
But it's our stamp, too

491
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:19,942
I don't want anything from you

492
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:21,943
But I don't want...

493
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:25,321
...a thing from you,

494
00:38:25,822 --> 00:38:28,408
And I won't give you a thing

495
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:30,993
I don't know who you are

496
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:32,953
But I don't want

497
00:38:33,954 --> 00:38:35,497
...anything from you

498
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:38,876
Hopeless

499
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:41,628
He'll improve

500
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:45,465
Couldn't you go with us after all?
Such a tour...

501
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:47,800
I can't

502
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:50,553
You've been trapped, eh? A girl?

503
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,181
Some girl

504
00:39:17,494 --> 00:39:18,412
Great

505
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,845
Good morning

506
00:40:13,212 --> 00:40:13,963
Yes?

507
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,550
You see, I...

508
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:22,929
Are you from the City Death?

509
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:24,764
Actually, yes

510
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:26,266
Gee...

511
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:30,561
I'm looking for my brother

512
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,148
He's having his kidney removed
right now

513
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:37,276
Yes, I've been there
It'll be all right

514
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:39,611
I say, sir...

515
00:40:42,114 --> 00:40:43,490
May I touch you?

516
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,407
Sure

517
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:59,338
Are you sure there's no danger?

518
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,350
Doctor?

519
00:42:56,028 --> 00:42:56,987
How are you?

520
00:42:57,154 --> 00:43:00,741
I'm fine as if nothing happened at all

521
00:43:00,907 --> 00:43:01,783
Really?

522
00:43:01,908 --> 00:43:02,826
Have you got it?

523
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:04,995
Of course

524
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,380
Christ... At last

525
00:43:17,673 --> 00:43:18,966
When did you get it?

526
00:43:19,508 --> 00:43:20,967
Ah well, about a week ago

527
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:23,887
Then why haven't you visited me
to let me see it?

528
00:43:24,054 --> 00:43:25,930
I've been waiting all the time

529
00:43:26,014 --> 00:43:26,514
I feared he could have cheated us

530
00:43:26,598 --> 00:43:30,184
or something
Or that you've decided to keep it for yourself...

531
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,727
I couldn't come

532
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:32,853
What's the matter?
Out with it

533
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:38,817
During that operation, you know

534
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,530
I stayed in the hospital and
waited for news

535
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,742
You see, we've been robbed

536
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:49,786
What?

537
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:54,206
Robbed of everything

538
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:02,894
Bloody fool of a dog?

539
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:05,522
They locked him in the bathroom

540
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:10,860
I told you he should be poisoned

541
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:16,156
Move!

542
00:45:22,412 --> 00:45:23,246
Get out!

543
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:33,255
What the hell did you go

544
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:36,342
to the hospital for?
They could manage without you

545
00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:40,304
Does it ache?

546
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:46,226
Hey, did you report it?

547
00:45:49,145 --> 00:45:50,021
Here

548
00:45:59,905 --> 00:46:02,115
My brother's just been released
from the hospital

549
00:46:02,407 --> 00:46:03,366
And how do you feel?

550
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:06,035
How shall I feel in these circumstances?
Do you know what was in this flat?

551
00:46:06,453 --> 00:46:07,996
Yes, I know well enough

552
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,540
I'd like you to come over
to the headquarters

553
00:46:11,874 --> 00:46:12,917
Why, with pleasure

554
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:17,171
By the way, sir... your brother
didn't know for sure

555
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:19,923
The alarm apparatus in the window
and balcony door...

556
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:23,593
...had been disconnected

557
00:46:32,935 --> 00:46:33,936
From inside the flat

558
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:36,313
I did it

559
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,942
It hooted every time I put the grill on

560
00:46:42,736 --> 00:46:44,779
You know, to be able to
open the window

561
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:49,200
I thought the girl was enough

562
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:52,411
I see, your brother wasn't sure

563
00:46:52,536 --> 00:46:54,580
Well, good-bye, gentlemen

564
00:46:57,499 --> 00:46:58,500
We'll get in touch with you, sir

565
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:04,255
Here's my phone number in case
you should want to see me

566
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:20,020
You never told me about
that alarm device

567
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:23,106
I forgot

568
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:28,778
This is all...

569
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:33,074
...we have

570
00:47:37,828 --> 00:47:38,704
It's yours

571
00:47:41,623 --> 00:47:42,457
Why?

572
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:46,294
The kidney was yours

573
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:48,338
Besides, I don't want it

574
00:47:50,673 --> 00:47:51,632
Where are you going?

575
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:55,219
What business is it of yours?
I'm moving away

576
00:47:58,472 --> 00:47:59,723
I've found a job in a bar

577
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,643
Leave me alone, will you?
I don't care a damn about this here

578
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:30,460
You wanted to see me, sir?

579
00:48:30,751 --> 00:48:31,043
Yes

580
00:48:33,462 --> 00:48:34,505
Well...

581
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:35,506
It's rather...

582
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,094
It's rather difficult to say...

583
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:47,308
You're sure to think the worst of me...

584
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:50,603
Don't worry about it

585
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:56,150
I think you should...

586
00:48:57,109 --> 00:49:00,904
...well, check my brother

587
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,909
That dog, you know
Only my brother could touch him

588
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:09,454
...and yet the robbers managed
to lock him in the bathroom

589
00:49:09,704 --> 00:49:13,499
He says he spent many hours in the hall
while I was operated on

590
00:49:13,582 --> 00:49:16,543
That's right, he sat there all the time
Later, he even lay in the nurses' duty room

591
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:20,005
No, I didn't mean he did it

592
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:23,967
But some of his friends, perhaps...
You know, the company he keeps

593
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:29,639
Thank you

594
00:49:32,058 --> 00:49:32,933
You've helped me a lot

595
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:03,378
Take care

596
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:08,007
Sorry I'm late

597
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,889
You wanted to see me?

598
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:19,893
Well, yes
You think I'm crazy?

599
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:22,979
No, why?

600
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:27,108
Well, we spent so much time in each
other's company, and now

601
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:28,526
I've invited you to have coffee
with me

602
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,570
Quite natural
It's confidential, isn't it?

603
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,032
Exactly

604
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,786
You see, we've talked a lot but...

605
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,708
I just couldn't say it

606
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,795
I suspect...

607
00:50:50,588 --> 00:50:55,217
I suspect my brother might be involved

608
00:50:56,343 --> 00:50:58,053
...in this robbery

609
00:51:01,306 --> 00:51:02,182
Oh God, what have I said

610
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:05,935
You said...

611
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:08,021
You believed your brother
might be involved

612
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,564
I feel somehow
Well, I don't really know

613
00:51:11,524 --> 00:51:13,651
It might be intuition only

614
00:51:14,777 --> 00:51:16,403
Oh yes, intuition is not to be neglected
as you very well, know yourself

615
00:51:18,405 --> 00:51:19,656
Well, you've helped me a lot

616
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:22,242
Just like they say in the movies

617
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:23,994
But it's a fact

618
00:51:24,244 --> 00:51:24,911
Yes

619
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:06,699
Can I help you?

620
00:52:07,116 --> 00:52:10,286
Thanks, I'm looking for new stamps
Have you any?

621
00:52:10,453 --> 00:52:11,495
Oh yes

622
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:20,087
Fortieth anniversary of the police and
Security Force, sixty zlotys

623
00:52:20,962 --> 00:52:23,924
A stamp with a seal on it, thirty

624
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:28,511
And world Championships
in Wrestling, twenty-five

625
00:52:29,387 --> 00:52:31,556
I'd like one of each
How much are they?

626
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:32,598
One of each?

627
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,350
One hundred and five zlotys

628
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,943
I didn't expect you here

629
00:54:17,903 --> 00:54:18,904
And I didn't expect you

630
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:20,739
Shut up, will you?

631
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:33,834
Arthur...

632
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:38,630
I did something horrible

633
00:54:40,048 --> 00:54:41,008
So did I

634
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:46,471
I thought it was you

635
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:51,642
So did I

636
00:54:56,563 --> 00:54:57,439
Jerzy

637
00:55:00,192 --> 00:55:01,234
What's this?

638
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,156
Ah, I went to the post office and
bought these

639
00:55:25,006 --> 00:55:26,132
It's a series

640
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,107
Ahk!

641
00:55:44,232 --> 00:55:46,401
Darkness, darkness and jeer

642
00:55:46,484 --> 00:55:48,820
Jeer and lies

643
00:55:48,903 --> 00:55:51,030
Lies all week long,

644
00:55:51,113 --> 00:55:53,115
All week long

645
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:55,784
You're the only hope

646
00:55:55,909 --> 00:55:57,619
The only glimmer

647
00:55:57,661 --> 00:56:00,455
You are everything

648
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,541
Because everything is...

649
00:56:02,624 --> 00:56:05,543
...inside you
