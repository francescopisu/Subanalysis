1
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,700
Law should not imitate nature...

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,100
but rather improve it

3
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,540
Law is mankind's idea...

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,060
to regulate the interpersonal relations

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,420
What we are and how we live
is the effect of law...

6
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,100
which we either observe or infringe

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,300
Man is free

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,740
His freedom is restricted by another
person's right to freedom

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,460
And punishment...

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,340
punishment is a revenge,

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,580
particularly if it's aimed at
injuring the criminal

12
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,540
...and not at preventing crime

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,900
But in whose name does law
take its revenge?

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,780
Is it really in the name
of the innocent?

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,540
And are the law-maker
really innocent?

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,620
Mr. Piotr Balicki

17
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,700
Will you come in, please?

18
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,100
Throwing rage away, Mister?

19
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,900
They might still be of use

20
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,660
Somebody threw this at me

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,580
And hit you?

22
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,420
No, did you see anybody
with a rag like this?

23
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,180
Is it a good film?

24
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,660
No, it's boring

25
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,940
What is it about?

26
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,460
Love, but it's boring anyway

27
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,140
Besides, there's no performance
right now, we're making a break

28
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,340
What are you doing?

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,980
Plucking the gray hairs out

30
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,980
Do you happen to know where...

31
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,260
the nearest taxi-rank is?

32
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,700
In the Castle Square

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,060
A gala concert took place,

34
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,660
organized by
the Ministry of Culture and Art...

35
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,260
In fact...

36
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,180
I've taken so much time answering
not because I don't know want to say

37
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,220
But I've already been asked
this question twice

38
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,060
During my admission exams
to the University, the answer seemed very simple

39
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,860
Four years later, in this building

40
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,140
I was not so confident any more

41
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,820
Hey, Madam!
We've brought supplies

42
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,940
Quick, Beata!

43
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,340
Good morning

44
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,300
Want a portrait like this one?

45
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,980
No

46
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,060
Is this the way to the Castle Square?

47
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,740
Yeah, straight ahead

48
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,180
I suppose that practicing
this profession,

49
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,380
one can correct the errors
made by that huge machinery

50
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,740
...called administration of justice

51
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,220
Or at least one can try
to correct them

52
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,580
I find another thing interesting, too

53
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,340
Most of all perhaps that I will
meet and understand people...

54
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,340
whom I would never meet

55
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,420
if I practiced another profession

56
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,820
Go away!
You scare my pigeons!

57
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,020
Go away, will you!

58
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,900
Cad!

59
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,740
Are you free?

60
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,860
Don't you see I'm washing the car?

61
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,180
Could we perhaps wait here?
It's so cold...

62
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,940
We all ask ourselves...

63
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,780
whether what we're doing
makes any sense

64
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,220
But...

65
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,100
I'm afraid finding the sense is a
more and more difficult task

66
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,420
It's more and more often

67
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,140
...that we doubt the sense of
our actions

68
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,140
And maybe even of our plans, too

69
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,900
I believe it's a decline of criteria
Or worse still, of values

70
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,580
The manageress forgot to charge you
for the soup vegetables

71
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,420
How about a life, Miss Beata?

72
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,180
I say, Mister!

73
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,620
Good afternoon

74
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,620
What can I do for you?

75
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,660
I have here...

76
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,460
Are you perhaps one of the specialists
who drive pegs into the walls?

77
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,060
No

78
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,260
I thought you might be

79
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,020
I have here a photograph...

80
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,620
Could you enlarge it?

81
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,180
But the bends will be visible

82
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,820
Never mind

83
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,740
All right

84
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,180
Excuse me, Madam...

85
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,340
Is it true that you can tell
from a picture...

86
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,740
whether the person is alive or dead?

87
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,780
You've been listening to
some non sense

88
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,460
Acting through the prisoner,

89
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,300
or to be more precise, with the
prisoner to influence others

90
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,740
I mean deterrence or simply
frightening people

91
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,820
It's mentioned among others
in Article 50 of the Penal Code

92
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,900
I don't think I like that irony
in your voice, the general presentation

93
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,620
...is a doubtful justification of
severity of punishment

94
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Not in my opinion only
Besides, it's often unjust...

95
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,060
Want some?

96
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,340
The wife's prepared it for us

97
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,820
There, have some

98
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,900
A glass of tea, please

99
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,180
We don't serve teas here

100
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,300
What do you serve?

101
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,820
Coffee and a cake...

102
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,660
I'll take coffee and a cake then

103
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,620
Which one?

104
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,620
A cream puff

105
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,900
No, not this one...
This one here

106
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,100
From Cain, no punishment...

107
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,260
has ever improved anybody or
deterred him from committing offences

108
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,300
And now, for the news for driver
To begin with, the weather forecast

109
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,340
Road conditions are rather bad

110
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,100
Apart from the south-eastern regions,
occasional showers possible all over the country

111
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,900
Madzio!

112
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,700
It is my pleasure to inform you that
you have passed the examination

113
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,220
From today on, after four years
of study and four years of legal training,

114
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,140
please consider yourself our colleague

115
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,460
Eh, Mister...

116
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,020
Excuse me

117
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,180
Are you perhaps going to
Mokotow district?

118
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,020
NO, the opposite direction

119
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,660
You see, we're in a great hurry

120
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,260
Motokow, please

121
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,060
Where did that fellow want to go?

122
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,580
The opposite direction

123
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,460
Could you wind the window up?

124
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,420
It's cold

125
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,100
Turn left here

126
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,660
It's easier to reach Fogel street
going straight ahead

127
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,860
I prefer it this way

128
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,900
As you wish...

129
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,900
Stop the car, it's over there

130
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,380
You couldn't get through any

131
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,700
I wouldn't even try

132
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,220
Christ...

133
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,500
The glove compartment...

134
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,740
The money...

135
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,820
My wife...

136
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,220
The money...

137
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,460
Give her...

138
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,420
Please...

139
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,940
Let me tell you about a lion
A brave golden lion

140
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,340
He got braver and braver every day

141
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,700
All big lions kept telling him

142
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,140
That a lion should have a lion's heart

143
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,940
The session is closed

144
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,820
Is it all, sir?

145
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,300
It is

146
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,740
Yes, it's me...

147
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,380
I lost... yes, completely...

148
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,260
I don't know, have no idea

149
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,540
Maybe I'll go for a walk

150
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,500
No, don't come

151
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,340
How are you?

152
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,820
Slept well?
Yes...

153
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:48,940
Well, bye then

154
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,420
Sir!

155
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,180
Jacek!

156
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,340
Excuse me, Your Highness

157
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,060
I know it isn't customary

158
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,700
You're right

159
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,740
It isn't

160
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,340
But I'd like to know,
once it's all over now

161
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,180
Would it help any

162
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:10,300
...if he had an older

163
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,140
and renowned counsel?

164
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,340
Not at all

165
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,660
The things I said...

166
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,700
Maybe I could have said it
differently...

167
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,780
Your speech was probably
the best speech...

168
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,380
against capital punishment
that I've heard in years

169
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,860
But the sentence had to be
what it was

170
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,580
You made no mistakes,

171
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,300
whether as a lawyer or as a man

172
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,020
The circumstances of our meeting
were rather unpleasant,

173
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,100
but all the same I'm glad
to have met you

174
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,660
Good-bye, sir

175
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,580
This case... could have been tried
by a better judge

176
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,500
All this to happen will be my fault
Is that no consolation to you?

177
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,940
No, you know, sir

178
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,900
It may be irrelevant,

179
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,780
but remember what that boy said,

180
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,780
about winding a rope around his hand
in the coffee bar

181
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,300
in Krakowskie Przedmiescie street

182
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,740
I was...

183
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,020
there

184
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,060
Where?

185
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,980
In that coffee-bar, at that very time

186
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,860
A year ago, that day I passed
my lawyer's examination

187
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,060
Perhaps there was something
I could have done then?

188
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,700
You're too sensitive to practice
the legal profession

189
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,780
It's too late now

190
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,540
You've grown a year older today

191
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,940
The warden will see you presently

192
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,660
How are things doing?

193
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,660
Rather warm, eh?

194
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,980
Good morning?

195
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,260
The curtain doesn't work

196
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,220
Tidy up, will you?

197
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,340
Come in!

198
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,500
Everything's ready, sir

199
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,460
Thank you

200
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,380
Thank you

201
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,460
I expected this

202
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,740
So did I

203
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,300
Yes, sir
You have half an hour time

204
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,540
Half an hour?

205
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,060
All right

206
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,340
Come in!

207
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,820
You wanted me, sir?

208
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,940
Take this gentleman

209
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,020
Hello, counselor

210
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,700
I'm going to see him
He wants to talk to me

211
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,300
An unpleasant duty, that

212
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,380
It is... I say, sir

213
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,100
This is my first time

214
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,980
Let's hope it will be the last one

215
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,340
This isn't perhaps
the best moment, counselor

216
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,180
But we don't see each other
too often, you and me...

217
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,900
I heard you have a son
Congratulations

218
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,380
Thank you

219
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,860
You wanted to see me?

220
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,580
Have you seen my mother?

221
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,300
Yes

222
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,100
Was she crying?

223
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,540
She was

224
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,140
Maybe she wanted you to...?

225
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,060
Tell me something, or...

226
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,820
No

227
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,940
She just cried

228
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,300
Sit down

229
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,380
Would you...

230
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,940
Could you...

231
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,780
see my mother...

232
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,420
once again?

233
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,220
Of course I could

234
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,300
After... you know, afterwards...

235
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,380
I'm asking because...
back there in the court,

236
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,740
when they were putting me into
the prison van...

237
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,580
You called my name
You called, Jacek

238
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,820
Yes, I called you

239
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,540
I wanted...

240
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,180
I'm nearly twenty-one

241
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,460
But tears rose in my eyes...

242
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,020
when you called my name

243
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,660
I said during the trial...

244
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,700
I don't know

245
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,780
I didn't listen too much

246
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,300
Only when I heard
you calling my name

247
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,940
They were against me

248
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,780
All of them, it's the same here

249
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,900
Against what you did

250
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,540
It doesn't make any difference

251
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,700
You wanted me to see your mother?

252
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,020
Yes

253
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,020
I want her to bury me
in father's grave

254
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,940
It's a double grave

255
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,700
Can I be buried in a cemetery?

256
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,820
Yes

257
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,500
A priest visited me here
He said it was possible

258
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,700
Yes

259
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,500
Well, in that case
Father's grave is a double one

260
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,180
Mother was...

261
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:30,060
to be buried there
It was arranged that way

262
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,700
You see, I'd like her to let me
have that place

263
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,220
Yes, yes sir, Warden

264
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,580
The Warden wants to know
whether you're ready yet?

265
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,100
Not yet...

266
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,980
You were saying...

267
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,660
I don't remember

268
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,740
But you told me it was a triple grave

269
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,940
Yes, that's right

270
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,820
Marysia's buried there and Father
...and the third place is free

271
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,380
They put Marysia there five years age

272
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,460
Yes, she was run over...

273
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,180
by a tractor five years ago

274
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,500
Back in our village...

275
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,980
She was starting the sixth form
of elementary school

276
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,660
This means she was twelve
when she died

277
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,180
The sixth form

278
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:13,380
That tractor-driver,
he was an acquaintance

279
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,420
We'd been drinking together

280
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,460
We'd had wine and vodka

281
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,340
And then he drove away,
and ran her over

282
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,300
...on a meadow near that forest

283
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:38,420
There was a meadow there, you know

284
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,860
I've been thinking

285
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,700
Had she been alive, everything
would have been different

286
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,980
I wouldn't have to go away
I'd have stayed in the village

287
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,780
She was my sister

288
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,340
I had three brothers
but only one sister

289
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,420
I was her favourite

290
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,620
And I liked her best, too

291
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,580
Everything could have been different

292
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,940
Perhaps...

293
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,700
Perhaps

294
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,420
Perhaps it would never have happened

295
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:30,700
Yes

296
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,460
And I wouldn't be here now

297
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,140
The Warden and the prosecutor
want to know if you're ready

298
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,420
Tell the prosecutor I'll
never say I'm ready

299
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,660
You'll never say you're ready?

300
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,580
Never

301
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,780
We bought that grave...

302
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,140
Have you got the sentence?

303
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,380
I've got all the papers

304
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,700
Let's go

305
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,260
Leave your briefcase in my office

306
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:43,980
This way, please

307
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,900
Take the prisoner out

308
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,380
Yes, sir

309
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,420
The prosecutor requests that
you end the conversation

310
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,060
They give the personal belongings
back afterwards

311
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,060
things a receipt from a photographer's in Krakow

312
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,380
I wanted a photograph enlarged and

313
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,500
...didn't have the time to collect it

314
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,340
Please collect the enlarged picture
and give it back to Mother

315
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,420
What is in that picture?

316
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,860
It's an old picture I had
Made during her first Communion

317
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,060
I stole it from Mother when I was
going away and I always had it with me

318
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,980
It got so bent...

319
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:08,940
Let's go

320
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,340
I say, sir

321
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,220
I don't want to

322
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,300
Hold him! Get him!

323
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,980
Now, gentlemen...

324
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,300
Open the door!

325
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,780
A medical certificate of death

326
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,020
Your name and Christian name?

327
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,020
Lazar, Jacek

328
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,740
Date of birth?

329
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,020
March 17, 1967

330
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,580
Parent's names?

331
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,620
Jan and...

332
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,820
Luc... Lucja

333
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,020
I'll now read to you the sentence...

334
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,900
in the name of
the Polish People's Republic

335
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:03,020
...of November 27, 1987

336
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,180
Having examined the case of Jacek Lazar,
accused of having an assault and robbery

337
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,580
...and murder of Waldemar Rykowski
on March 16, 1987 in Warsaw

338
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,340
Provincial Court in Warsaw

339
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,260
...has found the defendant

340
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,980
...guilt of the act as charged

341
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,620
And sentenced him on force of
Articles 148 point 1

342
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,940
...and 44 point 2 of the Penal Code

343
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,460
...to death penalty and deprivation

344
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,540
...of public rights forever

345
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,700
The Supreme Court has maintained
the sentence in force

346
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,300
The Council of State has resigned
it's right to grand pardon

347
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,260
In this connection,
the penalty will be executed

348
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,300
Want a cigarette?

349
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,180
I'd rather have one without filter

350
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,340
The hands

351
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,660
Execute the penalty

352
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,860
Hold him!

353
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,060
All right, pull it now!
Pull it!

354
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,140
Is it O.K. Now?

355
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,140
More! More!

356
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,260
I hate you!

357
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,180
I hate you!

358
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,340
I hate you!
