1
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,840
Eleven... twelve...

2
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,680
Thirteen... fourteen...

3
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,080
I couldn't go on

4
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,160
Dad?

5
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,560
Could you think of
something, Dad?

6
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,760
Kermit running away.
From Miss Piggy...

7
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,440
riding a sledge at sixty-two
kilometers per hour

8
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,000
Piggy chasing him, skiing at
eighty-seven kilometers per hour

9
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,720
How much later has she left?

10
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,120
Three minutes

11
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,280
Fix the numerical value

12
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,720
It'll catch up 626seconds later

13
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
I made it, Dad

14
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,240
She'll catch up with him in ten
minutes and twenty-six seconds!

15
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,680
Hi

16
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,960
Come on in

17
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,800
Cold, isn't it?

18
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,760
Say, somebody dies abroad

19
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,960
Would his obituary be
published, too?

20
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
Possibly...

21
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,160
You see, there are paid ads
You pay, they publish Â°Â¶

22
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,920
Why do people die?

23
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,880
It depends...
Heart failure cancer...

24
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,800
Accidents, or just old age...

25
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,360
I mean, what is death?

26
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,640
Death?

27
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,400
The heart ceases
to pump blood...

28
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
Blood fails to reach the brain...

29
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,880
Everything stops... stops dead...

30
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,560
...and that's it

31
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,160
What remains?

32
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,160
Everything you did

33
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,960
The memory of what you did,
of you as a person

34
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,120
Memory's quite important,
I guess

35
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,720
You remember there was
somebody who walked

36
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,360
with a funny leap,
or who was a kind man

37
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,680
You remember his face, his smile...
the gap in his front teeth...

38
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,800
Come on, Pawel, not yet

39
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,920
What do you want?
It's too early

40
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,720
Turned sour, eh?

41
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah...

42
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,720
It says here, a requiem mass...
may her soul rest in peace...

43
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,640
You never said anything
about the soul

44
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,520
It's just a way to bid farewell...

45
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,560
There isn't any soul...

46
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,520
Aunt Irena says there is...

47
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,640
Some people just find
life easier if they believe in it...

48
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,920
What about you?

49
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,680
Me?

50
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,920
I really don't know

51
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,960
What are you thinking about?

52
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,200
It's nothing... it's just...

53
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,640
I was so glad in the morning when I
managed to get that calculation right

54
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,520
And then the pigeon came
for the bread crumbs

55
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,160
But I went shopping
and saw a dead dog

56
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,160
I knelt over him, and I said
to myself, what good is it?

57
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,000
Who needs the information
how long it will take

58
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,840
Miss Piggy to
catch up with Kermit

59
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,480
It doesn't make any sense

60
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,720
Which dog was it?

61
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,840
The one with the yellow eyes

62
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,840
You could always find him
at the dust-bins

63
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,440
Yes?

64
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,360
Maybe he's better off where he is
now. How do you think

65
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,200
We have visited School No 218
to talk to the head-master

66
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
I see you distribute milk
to the children

67
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,200
Yes, We've made
an arrangement with the dairy

68
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,480
The children get a glass of milk
each during the long break

69
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,840
But this milk tastes foul
The children pour it down the toilet!

70
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,680
Not in our school,
during the long break

71
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,920
What is it that you've got?

72
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,440
A guinea pig

73
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,840
What for?

74
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,840
I brought it to biology classes
But the teacher is scared of it

75
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,760
Look, it's got sharp teeth,
hasn't it?

76
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,720
Pawel!

77
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,400
Just one more time!

78
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,280
Pawel!

79
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,840
What's for dinner?

80
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,760
Soup and something
to follow, right?

81
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,800
Sure it is, I'm hungry

82
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,520
Some TV people came to
our school today

83
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Why?

84
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,400
I don't know, something about milk
They told us to run about

85
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,360
Did you?

86
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
Of course I did

87
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,800
Want to take your bag home?

88
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes, I've got a great thing
to show to you

89
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,680
See?

90
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,560
Stop at the door

91
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,640
Which door?

92
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,960
The front one

93
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
O.K. I'm ready

94
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Now watch it,
it's going to lock it...

95
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,840
Has it?

96
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,920
Yes

97
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,240
Now it's going to unlock it

98
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
So it has

99
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,240
Go to the bathroom

100
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,200
But don't touch anything

101
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,240
Watch the tap

102
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,640
Water

103
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,160
Look what I programmed

104
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,560
I got a letter from Mum,
saying what

105
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,520
she does during the day,
hour after hour

106
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,960
Well, I fed that into its memory,

107
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,360
and I added the time
difference, too

108
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
It's now...

109
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,760
thirty-three minutes past three...?

110
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:18,960
Mama 15.33

111
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,960
She's asleep

112
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,680
Ask it what she's dreaming about

113
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
what does she dreaming about?

114
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,440
I do not know

115
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,840
It doesn't know

116
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,840
Do you know what you
Mum's dreaming about?

117
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,840
No, I guess I don't

118
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,720
Why that's simple, you...

119
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,640
Me?

120
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,400
Of course

121
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,240
She's dreaming about you

122
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,400
Not about Dad?

123
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Who knows...

124
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,880
Know what he's doing?

125
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,960
More or less...

126
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Christ!

127
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,560
What is it?

128
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm hungry

129
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Let's go

130
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,280
I wish Dad let me try his one

131
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,320
It would surely know
what Mum's dreaming about

132
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,200
Care for a race?

133
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,200
O.K.

134
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,240
Do you want odds?

135
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,440
Not today, well

136
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,360
Go!

137
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,160
That was good

138
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,200
Want me to wash the dishes?

139
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,400
No, thanks
I'll do it

140
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,920
I want to show you something

141
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,920
Hey, Pawel

142
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,760
Come here!

143
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,320
That was when you brought
that pink pen-case for me?

144
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,160
Right, I had them developed

145
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Know who it is?

146
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,920
Yes

147
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Is he... kind?

148
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,600
Yes...

149
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,720
And wise?

150
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,160
How do you think... Does he know
what people live for?

151
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,080
I guess He does

152
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,520
Dad says we all live to
make life easier...

153
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,600
...for those who come after us

154
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
But sometimes we fail

155
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Yes, that's right
Sometimes we fail

156
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,840
You know...

157
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,800
What matters in life is that
you can do some thing for others

158
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,400
help them...

159
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,320
Whenever you do somebody
a favor, no matter how small

160
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,440
You feel they need you

161
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,000
And then, life's easier

162
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,800
There are big and
small things you can do

163
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,880
Say today, you liked the ravioli
and that made me happy

164
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,840
Life is...

165
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,560
...a present

166
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,400
a gift, you know

167
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,560
I say

168
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,920
Dad's you brother, right?

169
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,840
Don't you know?

170
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,680
Ah, you mean,

171
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,080
Why we're different?

172
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,920
Your father and I...
We grew up in a Catholic family

173
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,040
But you Dad noticed very early...

174
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,880
...that a lot of things could be
counted and measured...

175
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,520
And then he started to believe that
everything could...

176
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,720
He still thinks so today

177
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,720
I guess he has doubts sometimes...
but he won't admit it

178
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,840
A life like your Dad lives
may seem more reasonable

179
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,160
But it doesn't mean
there's no God

180
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,840
...for your Father, too...
Know what I mean?

181
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,960
I'm not sure

182
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,280
There is God

183
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,560
It's very simple... if you believe

184
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,080
Do you?

185
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,840
Do you believe in God?

186
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,080
Yes

187
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,840
Who is He?

188
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,440
What do you feel?

189
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,320
I love you

190
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,040
Exactly... And this is what God is...

191
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,080
Checkmate!

192
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,640
That's would be too simple

193
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,320
She's already won six games

194
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,280
Checkmate

195
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,080
Seven

196
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,160
But look, she'll use
the queen as a shield,

197
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,280
and then we've got her
where he want her

198
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,320
Checkmate

199
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,840
I told you...
She plays routine games

200
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,280
Well, what happens now?

201
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,720
The bishop - and checkmate

202
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,000
Checkmate

203
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,520
Congratulations

204
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,880
Thank you

205
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,800
Is that you, Pawel?

206
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Yes

207
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
Have you talked to your father?

208
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,760
Hey, Dad... It's Aunt Irena

209
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,800
Well?

210
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,600
She wants to know
if it's all right with you

211
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,400
Irena?

212
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
I enrolled him for religious
instruction. Has he told you?

213
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,520
Well, if that's what he wants

214
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Of course, if that's what he needs

215
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,400
I talked...

216
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,440
to the priest

217
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Oh, you did?

218
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,360
They're building a new church
not far from your house

219
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,320
The priest is a young man
I think Pawel's going to like him

220
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,240
How about tomorrow?

221
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,520
No, thanks, I can manage...
Well, bye

222
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,520
Pawel...

223
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Did you switch it on?

224
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,120
No, I never touched it

225
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
Hey, mate

226
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,880
what do you want?

227
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,520
I am ready

228
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,760
Switch yourself off, will you?

229
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What if - if it really
wanted something?

230
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,920
Like what?

231
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,680
I don't know, but you asked him
Hey, mate, what do you want?

232
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,000
Just trying to be funny

233
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,080
It's half past nine, time to bed

234
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Are you going out?

235
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,560
Yeah... But I'll leave
the lights on for you

236
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,760
Have you checked
the thermometer?

237
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,600
Yes, it's fourteen degrees
below zero

238
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,720
Think Mum's going to phone
before Christmas?

239
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,680
I guess so

240
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,360
Group one: Juda, judasz, judzic

241
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,240
Group two: Podbechtywac,
podskakiwac, podkopywac...

242
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,040
Group three: Dranstwo, zaprzanstwo,
swinstwo, koltunstwo, panstwo

243
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,440
These are associative fields

244
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
Now...

245
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,200
Take a word which does not exist
in the Polish language

246
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,120
But which we find rather
easy to understand

247
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,920
The problem only arises when we try
to translate it into another language

248
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,160
In exceptional cases only,
a foreign language

249
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,720
become one's own
intimate language

250
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,440
We may have a very good
rational knowledge

251
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,560
...of that language

252
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,320
We may be able to use it to
discuss most intricate problems

253
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,160
Have an immense vocabulary

254
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,760
But - that's it
how could we get...?

255
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,760
To what's hidden deep
behind the separate words

256
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,520
syllable and letters?

257
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,360
How could we discover that
language's cultural heritage?

258
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,120
How could we formulate its
connections with history, politics

259
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,040
...culture and everyday life

260
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,680
How to know and understand...?

261
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,440
...all that creates the
spirit of a language,

262
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,520
its metasemantics...

263
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,720
or perhaps even
its metaphpysics?

264
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,160
According to Elliot, poetry is...

265
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,320
...untranslatable

266
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,080
But was Elliot necessarily right?

267
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,880
Imagine a translator who...

268
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,080
...is able to accumulate
the entire knowledge

269
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,680
there is about words
or about a language

270
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,440
A translator who has
an unlimited memory...

271
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,000
that can be drawn from any time

272
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,920
Used in an unconventional way,

273
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,760
a computer may be something -
somebody - liomebody - like that

274
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,640
Consider that instrument

275
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,280
it seems to discern just two figures,
zero and one

276
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,760
But actually it not only has something
that might be called intelligence

277
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,960
but also a kind of consciousness
it select which means it makes a choice

278
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,000
Or perhaps it might be
called conation?

279
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,120
As I see it,

280
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,480
an appropriately...

281
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,400
programmed computer may have...

282
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,760
it's own taste

283
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,320
Aesthetical preferences...

284
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,040
Individuality...

285
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,040
Ah, yes...!

286
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,880
For our next class...

287
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,080
Please choose a line of any text...

288
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,480
and do what i did

289
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,560
with that word I conceive myself

290
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
I hope it's not too much
for homework

291
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,440
Is it?
That's good

292
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,440
Look,
I left it here for one hour only

293
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,160
Would tea freeze, too?

294
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,720
Yes

295
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,000
Just touch it

296
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,920
Hey, be careful... it's glass

297
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,920
Great, isn't it?

298
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Leave it in the tub...

299
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,360
No, let's leave it here and
check what happens

300
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,680
Nothing, it's going to melt as
soon as a thaw sets in, what else?

301
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,440
Or maybe during the day,
in the sun...

302
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,040
Let's calculate it

303
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,960
You promised?

304
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,240
Oh, all right

305
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,040
It would be wrong to assume that
the temperature never goes up

306
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,480
Say, it's below zero during the
night only About ten hours

307
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,520
But we need precise data

308
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,480
O.K.

309
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,280
All right, call the Meteorological
Institute and ask them...

310
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,120
about the temperature
near the ground today

311
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,560
yesterday, and the
day before yesterday

312
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,840
Hello... Is this the
Meteorological Institute?

313
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,520
I need information
about the temperature

314
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,680
near the ground, please... today...

315
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,160
Yesterday...

316
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,960
And the day before yesterday

317
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,920
Yes, in Warsaw
Thank you, good-bye

318
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,880
What's the pressure formula?

319
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,040
P equals F divided by S

320
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,520
Fine... Now, the temperature?

321
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Eleven today, fourteen yesterday

322
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,120
and twelve and a half
the day before yesterday

323
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,200
There's been frost
for eight days now

324
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,920
Well?

325
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,880
As you see: Maximum load is
257kg/m2<

326
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,840
It means a fellow three times
your weight

327
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,920
...can skate safely

328
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,600
Really?

329
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,200
Can I have them?

330
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,120
Have what?

331
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,280
What I was to get for Christmas,
From Mum and you

332
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,200
Can I have them?

333
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,800
I found those skating boots...

334
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,400
Where?

335
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,720
In the counch...

336
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,520
Can I have them?

337
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,520
Lake depth: 3.5m

338
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,840
Maximum load: 257kg/m2<

339
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,280
How's the size?

340
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,200
They're perfect

341
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,480
Well, then... Put off
your clothes and go to bed

342
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,680
I'm going for a walk
by the time I'm back

343
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,880
You asleep?

344
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,360
No, I've been
watching them shine

345
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,400
I checked the ice

346
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,240
That's why I couldn't sleep
I guessed where you went

347
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,840
It's all right

348
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,560
But promise never to come close
to where the river falls into the lake

349
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,920
Keep a distance of fifteen meter,
right? The river never freezes

350
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,880
O.K., fifteen meters it is

351
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,280
It's a shallow river but I don't
want you to take a bath in it

352
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,160
Where's your elephant?

353
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,880
Asleep

354
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,840
Is Pawel home?

355
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,320
No, why?

356
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,240
I don't know
Mum wanted to know

357
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,400
Good evening...
Ewa Jezierski speaking...

358
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,160
Is Pawel home?
Marek hasn't returned yet...

359
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,040
Oh, good evening, Madam
No, Pawel isn't here

360
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,200
But he's having the English lesson
tonight, what time is it?

361
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,040
Past four...
They ought to be back by now

362
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,880
They'll be back any minute

363
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,800
For you see, something's happened...

364
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,040
I don't know

365
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,000
Something happened in the
neighbourhood I'll go bring them back

366
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,320
Piotrus!

367
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,320
No, wait! My Coat

368
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,960
Sonny!

369
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Is Pawel here?

370
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,720
What's the matter with you?

371
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,320
A nasty case of flu, I couldn't
lecture today, I dismissed them

372
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,120
When was that?

373
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,200
Right after they came

374
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,360
Where are they?

375
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,080
I don't know

376
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,800
Take it easy... come in!

377
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,880
She's ill
The boys aren't there

378
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,640
The ice broke on the lake

379
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,600
This can't be true

380
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,360
It broke...

381
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,680
Don't get excited
It couldn't have

382
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,800
But it did... Please go there

383
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,880
I'll be all right

384
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,480
Have you seen
Pawel anywhere?

385
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
At school, today morning

386
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,160
He told me a dream he had

387
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
But not now?

388
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,320
No, he said he'd
call me on the phone

389
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,440
one, two, three, four, five...

390
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,960
...ten...

391
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,040
Pawel!

392
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,760
Is that you, Irena?

393
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,440
Has Pawel phoned you?

394
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,720
You mean, when?

395
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,920
Lately... Today?

396
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,360
Yes, after school,
I asked him to lunch

397
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,440
but he couldn't,
he had that English lesson

398
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,080
He hadn't and that's the problem

399
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Where is he?

400
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,200
I don't know... not here

401
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,480
Is anything wrong?

402
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,600
Well... The ink got spilled

403
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,480
The ink bottle cracked and
it got spilled, all of a sudden

404
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,880
But I mean, is anything
wrong with Pawel?

405
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,240
I don't know

406
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,560
They say the ice broke
on the lake

407
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,200
But he said, you figured it out

408
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,400
The ice is strong enough

409
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,760
They say it's cracked

410
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,560
I'm coming

411
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,760
I'm off to look for him

412
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,160
Pawel? Where are you, Pawel?
Over

413
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,640
This is your father calling...
Pawel? Over

414
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,080
Mummy!

415
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,840
Mummy...

416
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,720
Jacek darling!
Where have you been, sonny?

417
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,400
We've been playing in that old car

418
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,720
Come on, dear, we're going home

419
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,000
Excuse me, sir
Pawel was...

420
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,800
to phone me in the afternoon

421
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,720
Do you remember me, sir?

422
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,960
That boy might know something

423
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,920
Which boy?

424
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,480
The small one, Jacek

425
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,480
Please wait a moment

426
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,080
He didn't play with us

427
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,840
He skated on the lake!

428
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
On the lake!

429
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,080
I am ready...
