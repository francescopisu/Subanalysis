Must we die?</i>

2
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:20,608
<i>Are there beings in the cosmos
who live forever...</i>

3
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:26,619
<i>...afloat on an endless journey
down the river of time?</i>

4
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:11,011
<i>TYSON: Our ancestors marked the passage
of time by the moon and stars.</i>

5
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:43,464
But it was the people who once
lived here, around 5000 years ago...

6
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:47,752
...who first started chopping up time into
smaller bite-sized portions of hours...

7
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:54,346
...and minutes. They call
this place Uruk. We call it Iraq.

8
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,347
It's a part of Mesopotamia...

9
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,390
...the land between the Tigris
and the Euphrates rivers.

10
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,194
The city was invented here.

11
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,889
And one of humanity's
greatest victories was

12
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,449
won in the ceaseless
battle against time.

13
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,611
It was here that we learned
how to write.

14
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,779
Death could no longer silence us.

15
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,450
And writing gave us the power
to reach across the millennia...

16
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,415
...and speak inside
the heads of the living.

17
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,666
<i>No one had ever spoken across
a longer stretch of time's river...</i>

18
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,962
<i>...than this Akkadian princess,
daughter of the first emperor in history...</i>

19
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,428
<i>...and priestess of the moon. Enheduanna.</i>

20
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,591
<i>For not only did she write poetry...</i>

21
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:40,513
<i>...but Enheduanna did something
no one before her had ever done.</i>

22
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,478
<i>She signed her name to her work.</i>

23
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,397
<i>She's the first person for whom we can say
we know who she was and what she dreamed.</i>

24
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:54,194
<i>She dreamt of stepping through
the Gate of Wonder.</i>

25
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,536
<i>Here's a thought Enheduanna
sent across more than 4000 years to you.</i>

26
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,828
<i>It's from her work entitled
Lady oi the Largest Heart.</i>

<i>ENHEDUANNA". Innana, the planet Venus,

And Uruk is also the place
where the epic tale

32
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:25,767
of the hero's journey
was first written down.

33
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,859
Before Batman, Luke Skywalker,
Odysseus, before them all...

34
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:36,653
...there was a man named Gilgamesh
who left home on a quest to vanquish time.

35
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,698
<i>Gilgamesh was searching for immortality.</i>

36
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,539
<i>He looked everywhere,
gained complete wisdom...</i>

37
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,253
<i>...uncovered what was hidden.</i>

38
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,007
<i>He brought back a tale of times
before the Great Flood.</i>

[ROARING]

40
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,715
<i>He built the wall of Uruk,
which no future king will ever match.</i>

41
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:02,762
<i>Read the story of that man, Gilgamesh,
a hero born of Uruk...</i>

42
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,556
<i>...who went through all
kinds of sufferings...</i>

43
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,066
<i>...who crossed the ocean, the broad seas...</i>

44
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,193
<i>...as far as the sunrise...</i>

45
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:14,482
<i>...who inspected the edges of the world,
searching for eternal life.</i>

46
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:19,404
<i>On his travels, Gilgamesh encountered
a wise man named Utnapishtim...</i>

47
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,914
<i>...who told him the story of a flood
that destroyed the world...</i>

48
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,077
<i>...and how one of the gods
instructed Utnapishtim...</i>

49
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:30,794
<i>...to build an ark
to rescue his family and the animals.</i>

50
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:08,418
The earliest surviving account of the flood
legend was written down in Mesopotamia...

51
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:13,925
...a thousand years before it was retold
as the story of Noah in the Old Testament.

52
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:18,383
So you could say Gilgamesh
fulfilled his quest for immortality.

53
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,675
We still read the <i>Epic</i> of <i>Gilgamesh,</i>
and with every reader...

54
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,138
...he lives again.

55
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:29,478
And all those heroes and superheroes who
have come since follow in the footsteps...

56
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,812
...of the first hero's journey...

57
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,478
...another kind of immortality.

58
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:40,151
A story sent from one civilization
to another across thousands of years.

59
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:44,663
But life itself sends its own stories
across billions of years.

60
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,170
It's a message that every one of us
carries inside...

61
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,469
...inscribed in all the
cells of our bodies in

62
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,632
a language that all
life on Earth can read.

63
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:03,549
The genetic code is written in an alphabet
consisting of only four letters.

64
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:09,813
Each letter is a molecule made of atoms.
Each word is three letters long.

65
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,191
Every living thing
is a masterpiece...

66
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,650
...written by nature
and edited by evolution.

67
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,358
The instructions for running...

68
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,525
...and reproducing
the intricate machinery of life.

69
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,619
The essential message of life
has been copied...

70
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,203
...and recopied
for more than 3 billion years.

71
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,743
But where did that message
come from?

72
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,627
Nobody knows.

73
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,423
Perhaps it began in a shallow,
sunlit pool...

74
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,057
...just like this.

75
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:52,394
Somehow, carbon-rich molecules began using
energy to make crude copies of themselves.

76
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,685
Some varieties were better
at making copies, and left more offspring.

77
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,230
The competing molecules
became more elaborate.

78
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,742
Evolution and life itself
was underway.

79
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,460
<i>Or life could've started
in the searing heat</i>

80
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:13,874
<i>of a volcanic vent on
the deep sea floor.</i>

81
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:22,010
<i>Or is it possible that life came to Earth
as a hitchhiker?</i>

82
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:27,641
<i>Let me tell you a story about a traveler
from another world.</i>

83
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,600
<i>The peace of the Egyptian village
of Nakhla, near Alexandria...</i>

84
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,816
<i>...was abruptly shattered
on a June morning in 1911.</i>

85
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,914
<i>Written in this meteorite
was a message from another planet.</i>

86
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,711
<i>But 70 years would pass
before anyone could read it.</i>

87
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:12,644
<i>In 1976, NASA landed two Viking
spacecraft on Mars.</i>

88
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,933
<i>Carl Sagan took us there on our original
journey through the cosmos.</i>

89
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,149
SAGAN: <i>We found that the Martian air
was less than 1 percent as dense as ours...</i>

90
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,156
<i>...and made mostly of carbon dioxide.</i>

91
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:30,492
<i>There were smaller amounts of nitrogen,
argon, water vapor and oxygen.</i>

92
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,666
<i>TYSON: A few years later, when scientists
thought to analyze the gasses...</i>

93
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,749
<i>...trapped inside the Nakhia meteorite,
and other members of its class...</i>

94
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,007
<i>...they found a striking similarity.</i>

95
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,760
<i>The vast majority of meteorites
are fragments of asteroids.</i>

96
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,517
<i>But the kind that hit Nakhla on Earth
could only have come from one place.</i>

97
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,233
Mars.

98
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,869
TYSON:
Welcome to Mars.

99
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,498
Over a billion years ago,
a volcano erupted here...

100
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,540
...and its lava cooled into solid rock.

101
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:27,131
Hundreds of millions of years later,
this area was flooded with water.

102
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,389
And long after that flood, an asteroid
the size of the Rock of Gibraltar...

103
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:36,349
...crashed into the Martian surface,
blasting out a huge crater.

104
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,689
Much of the debris
was ejected back out into space...

105
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,012
...where it orbited
the sun until a

106
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:47,197
gravitational tug from
its home planet, Mars...

107
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:52,987
...diverted one of the boulders into a
collision course with Earth. Its arrival...

108
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,407
...shook up the little village
of Nakhla. Meteorites...

109
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,325
...of the type that hit Nakhla...

110
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,371
...are the vehicles of a natural
interplanetary transit system...

111
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,881
...that sends rocks between the planets.

112
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,507
<i>Such a meteorite can safely shelter
microscopic cargo...</i>

113
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,266
...the seeds of life,
an interplanetary ark.

114
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,803
Most rocks are porous,
full of tiny nooks and crannies...

115
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,267
...where life can stow away.

116
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,940
<i>We know that some microbes can survive
the hostile environment of space.</i>

117
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,608
<i>Take these guys, for instance.</i>

118
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,574
<i>These microbes spent a year and a half
riding on the outside...</i>

119
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:40,243
<i>...of the International Space Station,
exposed to the extreme temperatures...</i>

120
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,127
<i>...vacuum, and radiation of space.</i>

121
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,948
<i>And some of them were
still alive and kicking</i>

122
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,634
<i>when they were brought
back to Earth.</i>

123
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,510
<i>Even more astonishing
are these creatures...</i>

124
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:56,266
<i>...awakened from a death-like sleep
of 8 million years.</i>

125
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,479
<i>They were frozen in the
Antarctic ice millions</i>

126
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:02,557
<i>of years before our
species even existed.</i>

127
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,315
And they're still alive.

128
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:11,235
If life can withstand the hardships
of space and endure for millennia...

129
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,849
...then it could ride the
natural interplanetary

130
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:16,324
transit system from
world to world.

131
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,832
It's a good bet that our microbial
ancestors spent some time in space.

132
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,537
Why do we think so?

133
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,000
The Earth is 4 and a half billion
years old.

134
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,667
<i>For the first half of its lifetime...</i>

135
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,634
<i>...large asteroids were bombarding
the planet every few million years.</i>

136
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:42,684
<i>The most violent impacts vaporized the
oceans and even melted the surface rock.</i>

137
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,025
<i>Each such collision
would have completely</i>

138
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:49,228
<i>sterilized the planet
for thousands of years.</i>

139
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,324
<i>But we know from fossils in the rocks
that bacteria were evolving on Earth...</i>

140
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,861
<i>...during this formative period.</i>

141
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:04,619
<i>So how could life have survived
such a lethal series of blows?</i>

142
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,171
Whenever one of those big asteroids
hit the Earth...

143
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:13,506
...the explosion would blast out a crater,
launching millions of boulders into space.

144
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,342
Many of those rocks
carried living bacteria inside.

145
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,883
Some of the bugs
would have survived in space...

146
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,644
...while all those left behind on Earth
would have been fried.

147
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,226
<i>A few thousand years after each impact...</i>

148
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:31,361
<i>...the Earth would have cooled down enough
for water to condense into oceans.</i>

149
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,065
<i>The planet would again be habitable.</i>

150
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:41,910
Meanwhile, most of the rocks launched into
space would have been orbiting the sun.

151
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,701
<i>Some of them would encounter
the Earth again...</i>

152
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,869
<i>...reenter the atmosphere as meteorites...</i>

153
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:52,917
<i>...and deliver their precious cargo of life
to re-seed the planet...</i>

154
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,840
<i>...like Noah's ark.</i>

155
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,257
<i>What this means is that life
doesn't have to start over again...</i>

156
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,597
<i>...from scratch after each catastrophe.</i>

157
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,764
<i>It can pick up where it left off.</i>

158
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,977
When the solar system
was young...

159
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,738
...Venus was probably more like Earth,
with oceans and maybe even life.

160
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,116
Venus, Earth, and Mars were all
exchanging rocks with each other...

161
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,072
...due to asteroid impacts.

162
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:24,114
Does life on Earth carry any traces
of interplanetary voyages...

163
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,953
...made in the distant past?

164
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:32,122
Why is it that some microbes can survive
the intense radiation and vacuum of space?

165
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,462
These conditions don't naturally exist
on Earth.

166
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,425
Maybe those bugs are telling us
that their ancestors survived...

167
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,967
...those same conditions in space,
a few billion years ago.

168
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,768
So we know that microbes can stow away
in rocks and survive the voyage...

169
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,557
...from planet to planet.

170
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:55,820
But what about a trip from star to star,
an interstellar odyssey?

171

The dandelion.

172
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,408

176

177

184
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,718
Each seed, in its DNA,
carries a story...

185
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,720
...the character and destiny
of the next dandelion.

186
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,225
Life propagates by retelling its story.

187
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:13,398
<i>Is it possible that life could survive
the journey from star to star?</i>

188
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:19,154
The stars are about a million times farther
apart from each other than are the planets.

189
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,537
Space is so vast that
it would take billions

192
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:35,124
Any stowaway microbes would never survive
the cosmic radiation for that long.

193
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,925
But there's a plausible
scenario for how life

194
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:40,588

<i>...our sun is accompanied
not only by its planets...</i>

207

<i>...but also by a trillion distant comets.</i>

208
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,491
<i>When our solar system
passes through an interstellar cloud...</i>

209
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:51,621
<i>...the gravity of the massive cloud
stirs up the outermost comets.</i>

210
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:57,995
<i>Some comets will be hurled out
into the space between the stars.</i>

211

<i>The high-speed impact of a comet
with a rocky planet...</i>

215

to come in contact with liquid water...</i>

One problem was the
almost ceaseless warfare

327
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,555
between the cities
of Mesopotamia...

328
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,520
...which continually destroyed
their achievements.

329
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,528
They glorified military conquest,
and ultimately...

330
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,030
...became its victims.

331
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,822
<i>Another cause of decline was that...</i>

332
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,705
<i>...their technical know-how
overran their understanding of nature.</i>

333
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,536
<i>The ingenious irrigation system...</i>

334
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,872
<i>...that was the basis for the great
civilizations of Mesopotamia...</i>

335
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,379
<i>...had an unintended consequence.</i>

336
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,462
<i>The water channeled
into their farmlands every year...</i>

337
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,924
<i>...evaporated and left its salt behind.</i>

338
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:13,592
<i>Over generations, the salt accumulated
and began to kill the crops.</i>

339
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,385
<i>And then, about 2200 B.C...</i>

340
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,977
<i>...not long after the time of Enheduanna,
disaster struck.</i>

341
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:25,228
<i>A drought of truly epic proportions,
lasting for many decades.</i>

342
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:29,740
<i>The rains stopped, crops withered,
there was famine and anarchy.</i>

343
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,366
<i>Barbarians invaded.</i>

344
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,495
<i>The streets of many cities
were littered with dead.</i>

345
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,872
<i>There could be only one explanation.</i>

346
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,749
<i>Enlil, the supreme god, was angry...</i>

347
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,707
<i>...because one of his temples
had been destroyed.</i>

348
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,339
<i>The people of Mesopotamia could not know...</i>

349
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:49,593
<i>...that the same drought was crushing
the dawning civilizations of Egypt...</i>

350
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,051
<i>...Greece, India, Pakistan and China.</i>

351
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:57,434
<i>All the gods of the Earth must have
been really angry about something.</i>

352
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,970
<i>For all their brilliance...</i>

353
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,935
<i>...the people of those civilizations
had no inkling...</i>

354
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:06,273
<i>...they were experiencing
abrupt climate change.</i>

355
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,689
<i>Three thousand years later...</i>

356
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,406
<i>...the climate would change abruptly
for another glorious civilization...</i>

357
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,411
<i>...this one in Central America.</i>

358
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,949
<i>At its peak,
the Mayan civilization perished...</i>

359
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,961
<i>...wiped out by a series of severe droughts
over the course of a century.</i>

360
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,425
<i>We still carry within
us the echoes of these</i>

361
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:30,088
<i>extinct civilizations,
in our languages...</i>

362
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,881
<i>...and our myths.</i>

363
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,722
<i>Today, we have a single
global civilization.</i>

364
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,508
<i>How long will it live?</i>

365
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,269
<i>There are so many ways
for a civilization to die.</i>

366
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,648
Let's start with the ones that
we wouldn't be able to do much about.

367
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,772
<i>That supernova is 1000 light-years away.</i>

368
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,988
<i>If it were much closer,
say less than 30 light-years from Earth...</i>

369
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,576
...its <i>cosmic radiation would shred
the atmosphere's protective ozone</i> layer...

370
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,116
...and destroy our civilization.

371
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,331
Lucky for us, none of the
stars close enough to harm us...

372
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:09,499
...are likely to go supernova any time
in the next few hundred million years.

373
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,968
<i>Every million years or so,
a supervolcano erupts somewhere on Earth.</i>

374
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,684
<i>The last time it happened
was 74,000 years ago...</i>

375
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,976
<i>...on the island of Sumatra
in what is now Indonesia.</i>

376
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:33,648
<i>It spewed hundreds of times more
rock, ash and toxic gas...</i>

377
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:37,444
<i>...than any single volcano
in recorded history.</i>

378
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,955
<i>The molten rock that erupted from
Earth's crust left this caldera...</i>

379
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:46,711
<i>100 kilometers long, now
filled with</i> a <i>lake.</i>

380
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:53,585
<i>The Toba volcano sent
more than 600 cubic miles...</i>

381
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,799
<i>...of pulverized rock soaring skyward.</i>

382
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,557
<i>The westward wind
carried the volcanic ash over</i> India...

383
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:05,267
<i>...where it fell out in a smothering
blanket over the subcontinent.</i>

384
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:09,441
<i>The eruption loaded the upper atmosphere
with sulfur gases.</i>

385
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,103
<i>The result was a global haze
that blocked most of the sunlight...</i>

386
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,194
<i>...from reaching the surface
for at least five years.</i>

387
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:20,361
<i>It was like one five-year-long cloudy day.</i>

388
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,161
<i>This so-called volcanic winter
resembled a nuclear winter...</i>

389
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,702
<i>...but without the radiation.</i>

390
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,912
Temperatures fell everywhere.

391
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,753
Plants and animals froze,
even in the tropics...

392
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,043
...dying in enormous numbers.

393
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:40,089
But life is hardy. Only a few species
were driven to extinction.

394
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,850
One of our ancestors in central India
sharpened this stone blade...

395
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,603
...in the years before the Toba eruption.

396
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:51,108
And this blade was one of dozens
that were found in the soil layer...

397
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,394
...above the volcanic fallout.

398
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,403
This tells us that some toolmakers...

399
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,281
...even in the area
directly affected by the volcano...

400
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,238
...managed to survive the cataclysm.

401
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:05,452
But the global human population
must have plummeted before rebounding.

402
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,117
If an eruption like this
were to happen tomorrow...

403
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,706
...our civilization would be
brought to its knees...

404
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,248
...although the human species
would survive.

405
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,178
I can imagine that our technology
of a few hundred years from now...

406
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,967
...would allow us to siphon off the energy
of a threatening supervolcano...

407
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,475
...before it explodes.

408
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,478
We could then use that energy
for our own purposes.

409
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,312
About once every million years,
a small asteroid collides with the Earth...

410
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,318
<i>...causing a similar amount of devastation.</i>

411
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,483
<i>With our science and technology...</i>

412
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,320
<i>...we already know how
to prevent an asteroid impact.</i>

413
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,484
<i>We would see it coming years in advance...</i>

414
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,076
<i>...and could send a spacecraft there
to deflect it into a harmless orbit.</i>

415
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,661
With the technology
of a thousand years from now...

416
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,579
...we might even be able to mitigate
the deadly effects of a nearby supernova...

417
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,462
...on Earth's atmosphere.

418
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,592
But what happens when
the danger to a civilization is invisible?

419
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,673
When no one can see it coming?

420
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:13,023
TYSON: Beginning with Columbus,
the European invaders of the Americas...

421
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,277
...had a secret weapon
that even they knew nothing about.

422
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:21,987
<i>They were carrying bacteria and viruses
for deadly diseases, such as smallpox...</i>

423
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:26,325
<i>...that the original Americans
had never been exposed to.</i>

424
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,625
<i>The Europeans like to
believe that it was their</i>

425
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:30,787
<i>valor and superior
weapons and culture...</i>

426
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,792
<i>...that won them the New World.</i>

427
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,296
<i>The real conquistadors
were the armies of the pathogens...</i>

428
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,880
<i>...that raced on ahead
to infect and kill nine out of 10...</i>

429
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:44,296
<i>...of all the Indians of North,
Central and South America.</i>

430
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,263
<i>The great civilizations of the New World
crumbled...</i>

431
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,224
<i>...under the onslaught
of invading microbes.</i>

432
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,979
<i>Without his invisible army...</i>

433
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:57,939
<i>...Cortez and those who followed
might never have stood a chance.</i>

434
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,398
But what about civilizations
that self-destruct?

435
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,869
<i>Our economic systems were formed
when the planet and its air...</i>

436
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:19,711
<i>...rivers, oceans, lands,
all seemed infinite.</i>

437
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,968
<i>They evolved
long before we first saw the Earth...</i>

438
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,505
<i>...as the tiny organism
that it actually is.</i>

439
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,218
<i>They're all alike in one respect.</i>

440
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:32,261
<i>They're profit-driven, and therefore,
focused on short-term gain.</i>

441
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:04,468
<i>The prevailing economic systems,
no matter what their ideologies...</i>

442
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,301
<i>...have no built-in mechanisms
for protecting our descendants...</i>

443
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:13,515
<i>...of even 100 years from now,
let alone 100,000.</i>

444
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:22,152
In one respect, we're ahead
of the people of Ancient Mesopotamia.

445
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,110
Unlike them, we understand
what's happening to our world.

446
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,819
For example, we're pumping
greenhouse gases into our atmosphere...

447
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,488
...at a rate not seen on Earth
for a million years.

448
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,458
And the scientific consensus
that we're destabilizing our climate.

449
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,332
Yet, our civilization seems to be
in the grip of denial...

450
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,831
...a kind of paralysis.

451
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:47,003
There's a disconnect between
what we know and what we do.

452
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,638
Being able to adapt our behavior
to challenges...

453
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,771
...is as good a definition
of intelligence as any I know.

454
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,946
<i>If our greater intelligence
is the hallmark of our species...</i>

455
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,529
<i>...then we should use it,
as all other beings use their advantages...</i>

456
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:14,197
<i>...to help ensure that their offspring
prosper, and their heredity is passed on...</i>

457
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:18,868
<i>...and that the fabric of nature
that sustains us is protected.</i>

458
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:23,835
<i>Human intelligence is imperfect, surely,
and newly arisen.</i>

459
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:27,422
<i>The ease with which it can be sweet-talked,
overwhelmed, or subverted...</i>

460
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,302
<i>...by other hard-wired tendencies...</i>

461
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:34,137
<i>...sometimes themselves disguised
as the light of reason, is worrisome.</i>

462
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:39,229
<i>But if our intelligence is the only edge,
we must learn to use it better.</i>

463
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,891
<i>To sharpen it. To understand
its limitations and deficiencies.</i>

464
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,816
<i>To use it, as cats use
stealth before pouncing.</i>

465
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,401
<i>As walking sticks use camouflage.</i>

466
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,155
<i>To make it the tool of our survival.</i>

467
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,365
<i>If we do this...</i>

468
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,497
<i>...we can solve almost any problem
we are likely to confront...</i>

469
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,830
<i>...in the next 100,000 years.</i>

470
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:11,094
<i>And now we've arrived at the place
where our ancient dreams of immortality...</i>

471
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:16,850
...and modern astrophysics converge.
Giant elliptical galaxies...

472
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,682
...are something like Florida...

473
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,098
...where the oldest stars
in the universe may be found.

474
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:33,609
<i>This is a red dwarf star,
smaller and fainter than our sun.</i>

475
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,951
<i>Red dwarfs are by far
the most plentiful stars in the cosmos.</i>

476
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:42,289
<i>Unlike the sun, which is halfway through
its 10-billion-year lifetime...</i>

477
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,421
<i>...red dwarfs will continue to provide
light and warmth to their planets...</i>

478
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,297
<i>...for trillions of years.</i>

479
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,802
<i>That's hundreds of times longer
than the present age of the universe.</i>

480
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,884
<i>What would intelligent beings do...</i>

481
00:36:55,046 --> 00:37:00,018
<i>...if they had an eternity to develop
their understanding of the universe?</i>

482
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:04,306
<i>Perhaps they would learn how to open
shortcuts in the fabric of space-time...</i>

483
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,318
<i>...to travel between galaxies
faster than the speed of light.</i>

484
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,979
<i>Maybe they would create
whole new universes...</i>

485
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,241
<i>...as artistic or scientific experiments.</i>

486
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,573
Of course no one,
or at least nobody on Earth...

487
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,865
...knows what the immortals
might do.

488
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,910
<i>If one allows the imagination free rein...</i>

489
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,832
But what about us?

490
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,672
What is our own future?

491
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:38,508
What would the cosmic calendar
of the next 14 billion years look like?

492
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,698
TYSON: If the original cosmic calendar
includes all of the time...

493
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:59,031
...from the birth of the universe
until this very moment...

494
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:04,997
...what would the cosmic calendar look like
for the next 14 billion years?

495
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,869
Just as with the cosmic calendar
of the past...

496
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:12,291
<i>...every month on the future calendar
equals about a billion years...</i>

497
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:16,007
<i>...every day, some 40 million.</i>

498
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,382
<i>Science makes it possible
for us to foretell...</i>

499
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:24,474
<i>...certain astronomical events
in the unimaginably distant future.</i>

500
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,559
<i>The death of the sun, for example.</i>

501
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,936
<i>In some 5 billion years...</i>

502
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,777
<i>...our star will have
exhausted its hydrogen,</i>

503
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:34,480
<i>the nuclear fuel
that powers it...</i>

504
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,944
<i>...becoming a red giant.</i>

505
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,986
<i>I know that sounds depressing,
but if we apply our intelligence...</i>

506
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,246
<i>...our descendants of
that distant future...</i>

507
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:47,534
<i>...will have long departed
from the lost worlds of the sun.</i>

508
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,252
<i>Who knows?</i>

509
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,914
Human events entail too many variables,
too many uncertainties...

510
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,051
...to make scientific statements
about our future.

511
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,132
But we can still dream.

512
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,720
The next golden age of human achievement
begins here and now.

513
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,679
<i>New Year's Day of the next cosmic year.</i>

514
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,688
<i>In the first tenth of a second...</i>

515
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,817
<i>...we take the vision
of the pale blue dot to heart...</i>

516
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:15,696
<i>...and learn how to share this tiny world
with each other.</i>

517
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,404
The last internal combustion engine
is placed in a museum...

518
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,285
...as the effects of climate change
reverse and diminish.

519
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,118
<i>A fifth of a second into this future...</i>

520
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,911
<i>...people will stop dying
from the effects of poverty.</i>

521
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,505
<i>The planet is now a completely</i>

522
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:34,957
<i>self-sustaining,
intercommunicating organism.</i>

523
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,750
<i>A half-second from now...</i>

524
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,762
...the polar ice caps are restored
to the way they were in the 19th century...

525
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,972
<i>...and the forecast is mild and pleasant
for the next cosmic minute and a half...</i>

526
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,887
<i>...40,000 years.</i>

527
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:54,022
<i>By the time we are ready to settle
even the nearest other planetary systems...</i>

528
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,652
<i>...we will have changed.</i>

529
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,654
<i>The simple passage of so many generations
will have changed us.</i>

530
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,990
<i>Necessity will have changed us.</i>

531
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,748
<i>We are an adaptable species.</i>

532
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,247
<i>It will not be we who
reach Alpha Centauri...</i>

533
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,505
<i>...and the other nearby star systems
on our interstellar arks.</i>

534
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,084
<i>It will be a species very like us...</i>

535
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,971
<i>...but with more of our strengths
and fewer of our weaknesses.</i>

536
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:27,680
<i>More confident, far-seeing,
capable and wise.</i>

537
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,688
<i>For all our failings,
despite our flaws and limitations...</i>

538
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,476
<i>...we humans are capable of greatness.</i>

539
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,146
<i>What new wonders, undreamt
of in our time...</i>

540
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,942
<i>...will we have accomplished
in another generation...</i>

541
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,825
<i>...and another?</i>

542
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,830
<i>How far will our nomadic species
have wandered...</i>

543
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:53,915
<i>...by the end of the next century
and the next millennium?</i>

544
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,504
<i>Our remote descendants...</i>

545
00:40:56,663 --> 00:41:01,339
<i>...safely arrayed on many worlds
throughout the solar system and beyond...</i>

546
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,630
<i>...will be unified by
their common heritage...</i>

547
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,057
<i>...by their regard for their home planet...</i>

548
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:12,062
<i>...and by the knowledge that
whatever other life there may be...</i>

549
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:17,226
<i>...the only humans in all the universe
came from Earth.</i>

550
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,902
<i>They will gaze up and strain
to find the blue dot in their skies.</i>

551
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:28,821
<i>They will marvel at how vulnerable the
repository of all our potential once was...</i>

552
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:34,539
<i>...how perilous our infancy,
how humble our beginnings.</i>

553
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:39,501
<i>How many rivers we had to cross...</i>

554
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,841
<i>...before we found our way.</i>
