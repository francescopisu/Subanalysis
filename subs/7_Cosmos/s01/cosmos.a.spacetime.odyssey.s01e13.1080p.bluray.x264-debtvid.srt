00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,911
<i>TYSON: The dream of becoming a citizen
of the cosmos was born here...</i>

2
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,416
<i>...more than two millennia ago,
in the city of Alexandria...</i>

3
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:38,456
<i>...named after and conceived
by its dead conqueror, Alexander the Great.</i>

4
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,623
The Ptolemys...

5
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,465
...the Greek kings who inherited the
Egyptian portion of Alexander's empire...

6
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:48,599
...built this library
and its associated research institution.

7
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:53,137
Rarely, if ever, before or since,
has there been a government...

8
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,523
...that was willing to spend so much
of its gross national product...

9
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,481
...on the acquisition of knowledge.

10
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,237
And it paid off, big time.

11
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,651
Every ship entering Alexandria's harbor
was searched...

12
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:11,163
...not for contraband, but for books
that might be copied and stored here...

13
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,996
...in what was then
the greatest library on Earth.

14
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,506
Here, Eratosthenes,
one of the chief librarians...

15
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:30,175
...accurately calculated the size
of the Earth and invented geography.

16
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,761
Pythagoras.

17
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,597
Hypatia.

18
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,357
Euclid.

19
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,237
Euclid set forth the
precepts of geometry...

20
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,405
...in a textbook that remained in use
for 2300 years.

21
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,704
The Old Testament Bible
comes down to us mainly...

22
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,999
...from the Greek
translations made here.

23
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,679
The original manuscripts
of the masterpieces

24
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:08,217
of Greek comedy and
drama, poetry...

25
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,847
...science, engineering...

26
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,384
...medicine and history...

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,351
...the total work product of the awakening
of ancient civilization, was kept here.

28
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,275
Estimates vary on the total
number of scrolls.

29
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:27,691
They range from 500,000
to nearly a million.

30
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,824
And all of it...

31
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,284
...all of this is but a tiny fraction
of the information that you have...

32
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,370
...at your fingertips at this very moment.

33
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,880
<i>The collective knowledge of our species...</i>

34
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,962
<i>...our own electronic
Library of Alexandria...</i>

35
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,224
<i>...may be accessed by
anyone who has a device</i>

36
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,348
<i>and the interest and
the freedom to do so.</i>

37
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:57,433
<i>This was not true in Alexandria,
where knowledge belonged to the elite.</i>

38
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,596
<i>So in the fourth century A.D.,</i>

39
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:05,236
<i>...when the mob came to destroy the library
and the genius of classical civilization...</i>

40
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,648
<i>...there were not enough
people to defend it.</i>

41
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:13,741
<i>What will happen
the next time the mob comes?</i>

42
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,053
TYSON:
We've come a long way together...

43
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,261
...traveling from deep inside
the heart of an atom...

44
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,892
...clear out to the cosmic horizon...

45
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,056
...and from the beginning of time
to the distant future.

46
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,816
I think we're ready
to perform an experiment.

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,254
It's not the kind of experiment
that requires a laboratory.

48
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,138
You can do it in your head.

49
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,766
It's called a thought experiment.

50
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,652
Pick a star, any one
of the hundreds of

51
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:49,776
billions of stars in our
Milky Way Galaxy...

52
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,860
...which is just one galaxy out of the
hundred billion in the known universe.

53
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,523
How about that star?

54
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,237
Or that one?

55
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,448
Okay, this one.

56
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,910
It's orbited by dozens
of planets and moons.

57
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,997
Suppose, on one of them,
there lives an intelligent species...

58
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:12,209
...one the ten million life-forms
on that planet.

59
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:17,094
And there's a subgroup of that species
who believe they have it all figured out.

60
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:23,476
Their world is the center of the universe,
a universe made for them.

61
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,933
And that they know everything
they need to know about it.

62
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,689
Their knowledge is complete.

63
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,477
How seriously would you take their claim?

64
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,990
Our ancestors believed
the universe was made for them.

65
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,826
It was natural to assume
that we were at the center.

66
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:49,289
After all, it looks like the sun
and stars all revolve around us.

67
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,421
We still speak of the sun rising.

68
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:58,677
The architecture of our language, myths and
dreams comes from that prescientific age.

69
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:04,717
This is our planet as it was known then,
just before Columbus set sail.

70
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,387
This first globe of the Earth
was cutting-edge...

71
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,306
...when Martin Behaim
made it in 1492.

72
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,520
Like everyone else...

73
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,778
...he believed that the jigsaw puzzle
of geography was complete.

74
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,817
There were three continents,
Europe, Africa and Asia.

75
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,531
And only the great world ocean
in between.

76
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,242
Behaim had no clue that North
and South America even existed.

77
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,704
It's easy to feel smug, right?

78
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,552
Well, the fact is
Martin Behaim knew

79
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:40,715
infinitely more about
his world, the Earth...

80
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,927
...than we know about ours, the universe.

81
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,721
A recent lesson in humility
will serve to illustrate.

82
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:56,523
<i>In 1912, Victor Hess made a series of
voyages into the sky above Austria...</i>

83
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,861
<i>...and found the thing
that scientists love best...</i>

84
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:07,071
<i>...a mystery that defied understanding
in terms of conventional scientific wisdom.</i>

85
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,909
<i>And even today, a century later...</i>

86
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:16,831
<i>...we are still searching for a complete
explanation of what Hess found.</i>

87
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:23,095
<i>A new kind of energy had recently
been discovered, radioactivity.</i>

88
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,382
<i>It was given off by certain elements,
like radium.</i>

89
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:31,892
<i>But it was also found in the air,
even far away from radioactive rocks.</i>

90
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,522
<i>It was everywhere.</i>

91
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,942
<i>Where did this strange energy come from?</i>

92
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,523
<i>No one knew.</i>

93
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,190
<i>Hess suspected that it might come
from above the Earth.</i>

94
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,907
<i>To test his hypothesis, he carried
radiation detectors high into the sky.</i>

95
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,532
<i>During a risky ascent
in a hydrogen balloon...</i>

96
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,542
<i>...he attained an altitude
of more than three miles.</i>

97
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,253
<i>When he reached the thin, cold,
upper half of the atmosphere...</i>

98
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:15,560
<i>...he found that the radiation was more
than twice as strong as on the ground.</i>

99
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,142
<i>The radiation must be coming
from above.</i>

100
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,313
<i>That's why its intensity
was weaker on the ground.</i>

101
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,982
<i>The Earth's atmosphere
was absorbing most of it.</i>

102
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,703
<i>Some thought that the radiation
might come from the sun.</i>

103
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:35,413
<i>To test that idea, Hess timed one of his
ascents to coincide with a solar eclipse.</i>

104
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,962
<i>But the eclipse had no effect
on the radiation.</i>

105
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:52,350
<i>Hess also found that the radiation
was just as strong at night as in daylight.</i>

106
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,184
<i>It was coming from above
but not from the sun.</i>

107
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,520
<i>What Hess did not know
was that the solar wind...</i>

108
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,684
<i>...doesn't move that quickly.</i>

109
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,778
<i>And so, for the wrong reason,
he came to the right conclusion.</i>

110
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,035
Hess had discovered cosmic rays...

111
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,743
...showers of subatomic particles
that crisscross the universe...

112
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,078
...at nearly the speed of light.

113
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,667
Without the shielding effect
of the atmosphere, they would be lethal.

114
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:26,211
Some cosmic rays can carry as much energy
as a bullet fired from a rifle.

115
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,755
It would take decades
to trace those cosmic rays back...

116
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,892
...to a death of unimaginable violence.

117
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,616
<i>The cosmic rays that Victor Hess detected
in the skies above Austria...</i>

118
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,822
<i>...posed a mystery to scientists.</i>

119
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,908
<i>Radioactivity in minerals on Earth,
like uranium ore...</i>

120
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,577
<i>...comes from the disintegration of atoms.</i>

121
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,496
<i>But cosmic rays were of a different nature.</i>

122
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:09,007
They were far more powerful
than anything known in Hess's world.

123
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,925
Scientists wondered for two decades
what could possibly produce cosmic rays.

124
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:20,473
Enter Fritz Zwicky, the most
brilliant man you've never heard of.

125
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,853
<i>In 1933, he and a colleague discovered
that some stars flare</i> up...

126
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,761
<i>...to become as bright
as their entire galaxy</i>

127
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:31,526
<i>for a few weeks, before
fading out again.</i>

128
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,616
Fritz Zwicky was the first person
to understand what just happened.

129
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:40,249
He correctly surmised
that this is the way a massive star dies.

130
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,127
It blows its guts out into space.

131
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:47,291
<i>He called this kind of stellar death
a supernova.</i>

132
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,976
And predicted that the
dying star would shrink

133
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:58,014
from about a million
miles across to only 10.

134
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,560
This corpse would be so dense
that a single grain of it...

135
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,441
...would weigh as much
as the Great Pyramid in Egypt.

136
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,605
It would consist almost entirely
of subatomic particles called neutrons.

137
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,446
<i>So he named these bizarre objects
neutron stars.</i>

138
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,327
<i>And 35 years after Zwicky predicted
their existence...</i>

139
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,909
...astronomers began to find them.

140
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,828
We call them pulsars when they spin rapidly
and emit regular pulses of radio energy.

141
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:28,794
Supernovas and neutron stars could account
for a wide range of cosmic rays...

142
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,676
<i>...but not the most energetic ones.</i>

143
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:36,214
Nothing yet known to science
can explain them and we're fine with that.

144
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,475
It's one of the things
I love about science.

145
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,307
We don't have to pretend
we have all the answers.

146
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,103
<i>Zwicky also came up with the idea
that the gravity of a galaxy...</i>

147
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,940
<i>...warps the fabric of space around it
to act like a lens.</i>

148
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:54,029
<i>This distorts and magnifies light from any
other galaxy lying directly behind it.</i>

149
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,612
<i>So astronomers on Earth...</i>

150
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,245
<i>...would see multiple images
of that same distant galaxy...</i>

151
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,704
<i>...deformed as in a funhouse mirror.</i>

152
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:08,539
<i>Forty years after this prediction,
we started finding them too.</i>

153
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,377
And Zwicky made yet another discovery
back in the 1930s.

154
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,221
<i>While studying the Coma cluster
of galaxies...</i>

155
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,055
<i>...he noticed something funny
about the way they moved.</i>

156
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,646
The galaxies were going way too fast...

157
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,978
...so fast that they should've been
flying apart from each other...

158
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,645
...because all the stars in all those
galaxies had far too little gravity...

159
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,360
...to hold the cluster together.

160
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,572
Zwicky thought that something else
must be binding them to each other.

161
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,158
That mysterious missing component...

162
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,918
...would have to weigh something like
5O times as much as the stars themselves.

163
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,375
But no one paid much attention
to this wild notion.

164
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,416
Just another one of Zwicky's crazy ideas.

165
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,756
In our solar system,
the innermost planet, Mercury...

166
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,762
...moves much faster than
the outermost one, Neptune.

167
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,423
And that makes sense, right?

168
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,060
The harder you push or pull
on something, the faster it goes.

169
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,937
The sun's gravity weakens
with increasing distance...

170
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,567
...so the planets that are farther
from the sun move more slowly.

171
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:18,029
Everyone expected that the outermost stars
in a galaxy would act the same way.

172
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,452
Most of the stars are concentrated
towards the center...

173
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,660
...so their collective gravity
pulls on the other stars...

174
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,042
...the same way the sun
pulls on the planets.

175
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:33,082
<i>But in the 1970s, when astronomer Vera
Rubin studied the Andromeda Galaxy...</i>

176
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,423
<i>...she discovered that the outer stars
obeyed no such rule.</i>

177
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,054
Unlike the outer planets
in the solar system...

178
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,843
...the outer stars in the galaxy
were all going at the same speed...

179
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,931
...as the stars that were closer in.

180
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,813
And they were moving way faster
than expected.

181
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,600
"That's funny," Vera thought.

182
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,986
"There must be something weird
about the Andromeda Galaxy."

183
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,646
So she looked at another galaxy.

184
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,944
Same story.

185
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,154
And another.

186
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,660
Vera studied 60 galaxies...

187
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,494
...and found that all of them seemed
to be violating the Law of Gravity...

188
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,499
...a core principle of physics.

189
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,003
After some initial healthy skepticism...

190
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:17,133
...her colleagues looked for themselves
and found that Vera was right.

191
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,670
It's not that Isaac Newton
had gotten the Law of Gravity wrong.

192
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:25,343
Vera Rubin had discovered that the gravity
of something massive and invisible...

193
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,762
...was forcing the stars to go fast.

194
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:34,860
And then, someone remembered
crazy old Fritz Zwicky...

195
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,197
...and the unknown source of gravity
in the galaxy clusters...

196
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,451
...that he called dark
matter, back in 1933.

197
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:54,542
Vera Rubin had verified the existence
of a new, much larger cosmos.

198
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,880
And just like the one we thought we knew,
it was filled with mystery.

199
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:04,890
Dark matter is completely unobservable,
except for its gravitational effect...

200
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,893
...which makes visible stars and galaxies
move faster.

201
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,555
Its nature is another deep mystery.

202
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,851
Rubin had provided the evidence
for an invisible universe...

203
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:20,568
...nearly 10 times more massive
than the one we thought we knew.

204
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,529
It was as if we had been standing
on the seashore at night...

205
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:28,993
...mistakenly believing that the froth on
the waves was all there was to the ocean.

206
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:36,004
Vera Rubin looked at the stars and realized
they were merely the foam on the waves...

207
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:40,087
...and that the greatest part of the ocean
remained unknown.

208
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,375
But wait.

209
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,045
It gets crazier.

210
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,179
<i>Our Milky Way galaxy,
a few hundred billion stars...</i>

211
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:57,351
<i>...plus the clouds of gas and dust,
the stuff of once and future stars...</i>

212
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,772
<i>...and about a hundred billion
other galaxies, all of that...</i>

213
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:08,571
<i>...including those uncounted billions of
trillions of planets, moons, and comets...</i>

214
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:13,287
<i>...amounts to only five percent
of what is actually there.</i>

215
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,876
<i>Because there's a bigger unsolved mystery
than dark matter, dark energy...</i>

216
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,464
<i>...which makes up even more of the cosmos
and drives its expansion.</i>

217
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,096
<i>And it was Fritz Zwicky's supernovas
that lit the way...</i>

218
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,804
<i>...to the revelation of its existence.</i>

219
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:37,478
In one scenario,
a star consumes all of its nuclear fuel...

220
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,151
<i>...then cools and suddenly collapses
under its own gravity.</i>

221
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,068
<i>The star rebounds in a massive explosion...</i>

222
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:52,831
<i>...leaving behind a neutron star
or a black hole.</i>

223
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,998
Since the mass of the original star
can fall within a wide range...

224
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,664
...its peak brightness as a supernova
can also vary widely.

225
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:06,052
So you can't tell how far away it is
just from how bright it looks.

226
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,008
A relatively nearby supernova...

227
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,427
...might appear just as bright as one
that was more powerful but farther away.

228
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:18,099
But there's another kind of supernova
that comes in only one strength.

229
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,359
<i>It marks the violent grand
finale of a tango...</i>

230
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,647
<i>...danced by a giant star and a dwarf.</i>

231
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,533
<i>As the two stars orbit
closely around each other...</i>

232
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:34,038
<i>...the giant sheds its outer layers of gas
onto the dwarf.</i>

233
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,868
<i>When the added weight
becomes too much for it to bear...</i>

234
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:42,961
<i>...the dwarf detonates
like a stupendous thermonuclear bomb.</i>

235
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,842
<i>For a few weeks,
the brilliance of such a supernova...</i>

236
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:51,256
<i>...rivals the combined light
of all the stars in its galaxy.</i>

237
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:55,393
<i>This kind of supernova always has
the same maximum power output...</i>

238
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,306
<i>...about five billion times brighter
than our sun.</i>

239
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:03,522
<i>With big telescopes, we can see
them in galaxies very far away...</i>

240
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,689
<i>...out toward the edge
of the observable universe.</i>

241
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,875
<i>Because all such supernovas
have the same wattage...</i>

242
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,445
<i>...they're ideal tools
for measuring distances</i>

243
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,880
<i>to the farthest reaches
of the universe.</i>

244
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:27,713
<i>We call them standard candles.</i>

245
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:37,136
In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered
that the universe is expanding.

246
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,771
The distant galaxies are drifting away
from one another.

247
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,151
Later, we learned that the expansion
began some 14 billion years ago...

248
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,530
...with the explosive birth of
the universe, the Big Bang.

249
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,448
Everybody assumed that the rate of
expansion would be slowing down...

250
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,115
...due to the mutual pull of gravity
between all the parts of the universe.

251
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,033
If there is enough dark matter...

252
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,500
...its gravity would eventually bring
the expansion to a stop.

253
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,711
And the universe
would then fall back on itself.

254
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:12,549
In that case, everything would eventually
collapse in a big crunch.

255
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,761
On the other hand,
if the universe had less dark matter...

256
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:20,554
...the expansion would continue forever,
just getting slower and slower.

257
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,060
<i>Two competing teams of astronomers...</i>

258
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,351
<i>...were observing those supernovas
in distant galaxies.</i>

259
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:30,818
<i>It turned out to be another one
of those that's-funny moments.</i>

260
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,451
<i>In 1998, both teams independently came
to the same conclusion...</i>

261
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,830
...the expansion isn't slowing down at all,
it's speeding up.

262
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:44,039
This means the universe
will continue to expand forever.

263
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,330
There seems to be a mysterious force
in the universe...

264
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,295
...one that overwhelms gravity
on the grandest scale...

265
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,961
...to push the cosmos apart.

266
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:57,007
Most of the energy of the universe
is bound up in this unknown force.

267
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,722
We call it dark energy.

268
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:05,891
But that name, like dark matter,
is merely a code word for our ignorance.

269
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,400
It's okay not to know all the answers.

270
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,780
It's better to admit our ignorance than
to believe answers that might be wrong.

271
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,865
Pretending to know everything closes the
door to finding out what's really there.

272
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:25,077
<i>Tonight, our ships sail
into even more exotic waters.</i>

273
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,165
<i>Come with me.</i>

274
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,229
<i>Only two of our ships
have ventured into the</i>

275
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:43,227
<i>great dark ocean of
interstellar space.</i>

276
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,685
<i>The longest odyssey in all of history...</i>

277
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,067
<i>...was launched back in 1977...</i>

278
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,901
<i>...NASA's Voyager</i> 1 <i>and 2.</i>

279
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:59,035
<i>The Voyagers move about 40,000 miles
an hour.</i>

280
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:03,573
<i>They gave us our first close-up look
at Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</i>

281
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,081
<i>A hurricane three times
the size of Earth...</i>

282
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,747
<i>...and one that's been raging
since at least 1644...</i>

283
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,460
<i>...when it was first observed.</i>

284
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:16,423
<i>For all we know,
it could be thousands of years old.</i>

285
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:21,432
<i>The Voyagers discovered the first active
volcano on another world...</i>

286
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,763
<i>...on Jupiter's moon lo.</i>

287
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:29,141
<i>And an ocean beneath the icy surface
of the moon Europa...</i>

288
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:37,611
<i>...with at least twice as much water
as we have here on Earth.</i>

289
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:43,120
<i>The Voyagers dared to fly
across Saturn's rings...</i>

290
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,250
<i>...and revealed that they were made
of hundreds of thin bands...</i>

291
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,081
<i>...of orbiting snowballs.</i>

292
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,541
<i>On Saturn's giant moon Titan...</i>

293
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:59,087
<i>...Voyager detected an atmosphere
four times denser than Earth's.</i>

294
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:03,679
<i>That hinted at the existence
of hydrocarbon seas on Titan...</i>

295
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,469
<i>...which we later confirmed.</i>

296
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:13,401
<i>Voyager 2 gave us our first portrait
of the outermost planet, Neptune...</i>

297
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:18,444
<i>...where the winds roar
at a thousand miles per hour...</i>

298
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,033
<i>...and its moon Triton...</i>

299
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,240
<i>...with geysers of boiling nitrogen...</i>

300
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,577
<i>...shoot five miles high.</i>

301
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:34,497
<i>Voyager successfully completed its mission
of discovery to the outer planets...</i>

302
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:39,294
<i>...but its odyssey into the darkness
was just beginning.</i>

303
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,763
Thirty-five years after its launch...

304
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:48,099
Voyager <i>1</i> became the first of our
spacecraft to enter an uncharted realm.

305
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:53,854
<i>The sun is constantly shooting out streams
of charged particles in all directions...</i>

306
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,394
<i>...moving at a million miles an hour.</i>

307
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,031
<i>This solar wind
blows a vast magnetic bubble...</i>

308
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,286
<i>...our heliosphere
that extends beyond the outer planets.</i>

309
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,995
<i>It pushes out against the thin gas
of interstellar space.</i>

310
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:14,378
<i>There's a border where one ends
and the other begins.</i>

311
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,664
<i>Voyager 1 reported back to Earth...</i>

312
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,299
<i>...that its detectors
were being pummeled...</i>

313
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,460
<i>...by more and more cosmic rays.</i>

314
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:25,552
<i>Until then, we didn't know
where the interstellar ocean began.</i>

315
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:30,845
<i>Voyager 1 pressed on past a boundary
we had never crossed before.</i>

316
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,891
<i>The heliosphere shields us
from most of the deadly cosmic rays.</i>

317
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:39,233
<i>When stormy solar winds blow,
this zone of protection grows...</i>

318
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,443
<i>...in calm solar weather, it shrinks.</i>

319
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,576
<i>When a star goes supernova
in our galactic neighborhood...</i>

320
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,913
...the debris from the exploded star...

321
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,416
...pushes the heliosphere
back towards the sun.

322
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,498
If it's strong enough to push it back
to Earth's orbit...

323
00:24:55,995 --> 00:25:00,546
...our planet gets a radioactive
bath of supernova debris.

324
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,757
Luckily, this doesn't happen very often.

325
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,139
The last one was perhaps

328

How can we possibly know this?

329
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:22,147
Because the dying star left its traces
miles below the surface of the ocean.

330
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,280
Manganese nodules...

...small rocks like this one...

332

00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,678
<i>These nodules grow in partnership
with bacteria...</i>

337
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:49,932
<i>...by taking up minerals

340
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,023
Researchers found telltale
traces of this iron...

341
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:05,110
...in a thin layer below the surface
of the manganese nodules.

342
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,900
They used the known rate of growth
of the nodules...

343
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,193
...to date that layer...

344
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,661

...is science.

348
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,175
The interstellar ocean is dark
and deep.

349
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:36,016
Out here, the sun is just
the brightest star in the sky.

350
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,022
Yet the Voyagers maintain
their regular communications...

352
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,571

from their home port.

354
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:53,867
No other objects touched by human hands
have ever ventured this far from home.

355
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,706

to respond to our command...

356
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:08,878
...the last and, by far, the longest phase
of the Voyager mission will begin.

357
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,890
Back in 1979,
when both Voyagers rounded Jupiter...

358
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,132
...its massive gravity
acted as a slingshot,

359
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:25,232

the solar system...

360
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:29,991
...to travel among the stars of our galaxy
for a billion years.

361
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,743
Carl Sagan recognized
that the Voyager mission...

362
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,577
...offered two free tickets
to something approaching eternity.

363
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,414
He assembled a small team
to create a message to any civilization...

364
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:46,174
...that might, one day,
encounter the derelict spacecraft.

365
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,432
Twenty-six centuries ago,
the Assyrian king Esarhaddon wrote:

366
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:59,562
"I had monuments made of bronze
and inscriptions of baked clay.

367
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,850
I left them in the foundations
for future times."

368
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,816
These hieroglyphics continue
that ancient tradition.

369
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,276
They are inscribed on the
cover of a message...

370
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:15,991
...designed to be read
by the beings of other worlds and times.

371
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,741
What could we possibly have in common
with an alien civilization...

372
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,581
...with its own separate
evolutionary history...

373
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:28,671
...and one so far advanced beyond us
that they can patrol interstellar space?

374
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,084
One thing at least.

375
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,921
A universal language...
...science.

376
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,300
It's hard to break the bonds of gravity.

You can only sail the cosmic seas
if you speak mathematics and physics.

378
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,934
Hydrogen is the most common element
in the universe.

379
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,817
The electron in a hydrogen atom...

380
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,480
...flips the direction of its spin
at a constant rate or frequency.

381
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,864
Hydrogen atoms are like
tiny natural clocks.

382
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,028
Tick. Tock.

383
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:02,166
Now we have a unit of time in common
with the extraterrestrials.

384
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,752
This will come in handy when we get
to the next level of the message.

385
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,585
Here's our return address in space.

386
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,784
Pulsars are rapidly-spinning
neutron stars

387
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:14,845
that give off regular
bursts of radio waves.

388
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,971
You can set your clock by them.

389
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,842
The sun is at the center of this diagram...

390
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,603
...and the lines point to
the 14 nearest pulsars.

391
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,357
A simple code labels each pulsar
with its unique frequency...

392
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,111
...using the tick tock of
the hydrogen atom as the unit of time.

393
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,898
So alien astronomers
could use this diagram...

394
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:38,035
...to locate the home star of the Voyager
spacecraft in our galaxy.

395
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,323
They could also tell how long ago
the spacecraft was launched.

00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:53,027
<i>...on the scarcely distinguishable
inhabitants of some other corner.</i>

494
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,072
<i>How frequent their misunderstandings...</i>

495
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,036
<i>...how eager they are
to kill one another...</i>

496
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,419
<i>...how fervent their hatreds.</i>

497
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,084
<i>Our posturings.</i> ..

498
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,090
<i>...our imagined self-importance...</i>

499
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:12,129
<i>...the delusion that we have some
privileged position in the universe...</i>

500
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:17,426
<i>...are challenged by this
point of pale light.</i>

501
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,394
<i>Our planet...</i>

502
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,429
<i>...is a lonely speck...</i>

503
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,226
<i>...in the great, enveloping cosmic dark.</i>

504
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,111
<i>In our obscurity...</i>

505
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,738
<i>...in all this vastness...</i>

506
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,652
<i>...there is no hint that help
will come from elsewhere...</i>

507
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,697
<i>...to save us from ourselves.</i>

508
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:42,208
<i>The Earth is the only world known so far
to harbor life.</i>

509
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,621
<i>There is nowhere else,
at least in the near future...</i>

510
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,461
<i>...to which our species could migrate.</i>

511
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,966
<i>Visit?</i>

512
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,172
<i>Yes.</i>

513
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,211
<i>Settle?</i>

514
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,425
<i>Not yet.</i>

515
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,090
<i>Like it or not, for the moment...</i>

516
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,636
<i>...the Earth is where we make our stand.</i>

517
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:07,773
<i>It has been said that astronomy is a
humbling and character-building experience.</i>

518
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:13,156
<i>There is perhaps no better demonstration
of the folly of human conceits...</i>

519
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,363
<i>...than this distant image.</i>

520
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,952
<i>To me...</i>

521
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:22,992
<i>...it underscores our responsibility
to deal more kindly with one another...</i>

522
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:27,538
<i>...and to preserve and cherish
the Pale Blue Dot...</i>

523
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:31,334
<i>...the only home we've ever known.</i>

524
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:42,185
<i>TYSON: How did we, tiny creatures
living on that speck of dust...</i>

525
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,392
<i>...ever manage to figure out
how to send spacecraft...</i>

526
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,229
<i>...out among the stars of the Milky Way?</i>

527
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:52,612
<i>Only a few centuries ago,
a mere second of cosmic time...</i>

528
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,150
<i>...we knew nothing of where
or when we were.</i>

529
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,535
<i>Oblivious to the rest of the cosmos...</i>

530
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,037
<i>...we inhabited a kind of prison.</i>

531
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:05,747
<i>A tiny universe bounded by a nutshell.</i>

532
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,549
<i>How did we escape from the prison?</i>

533
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:20,217
<i>It was the work of generations of searchers
who took five simple rules to heart.</i>

534
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,228
<i>Question authority.</i>

535
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,561
<i>No idea is true,
just because someone says so...</i>

536
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,193
<i>...including me.</i>

537
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,522
<i>Think for yourself.</i>

538
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,194
<i>Question yourself.</i>

539
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,748
<i>Don't believe anything
just because you want to.</i>

540
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,252
<i>Believing something doesn't make it so.</i>

541
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,917
<i>Test ideas by the evidence gained
from observation and experiment.</i>

542
00:38:56,209 --> 00:39:00,680
<i>If a favorite idea fails a
well-designed test, it's wrong.</i>

543
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,261
<i>Get over it.</i>

544
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:07,180
<i>Follow the evidence, wherever it leads.</i>

545
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,191
<i>If you have no evidence, reserve judgment.</i>

546
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,233
<i>And perhaps the most
important rule of all...</i>

547
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,194
<i>...remember, you could be wrong.</i>

548
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,111
<i>Even the best scientists have been wrong
about some things.</i>

549
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,405
<i>Newton, Einstein...</i>

550
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,415
<i>...and every other great
scientist in history...</i>

551
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,917
<i>...they all made mistakes.</i>

552
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,920
<i>Of course they did, they were human.</i>

553
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:37,258
<i>Science is a way to keep
from fooling ourselves...</i>

554
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,511
<i>...and each other.</i>

555
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,299
<i>Have scientists known sin?</i>

556
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,101
<i>Of course.</i>

557
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,017
<i>We have misused science, just as we have
every other tool at our disposal...</i>

558
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:58,905
<i>...and that's why we can't afford to leave
it in the hands of a powerful few.</i>

559
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,775
<i>The more science belongs to all of us...</i>

560
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,161
<i>...the less likely it is to be misused.</i>

561
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:12,123
<i>These values undermine the appeals
of fanaticism and ignorance.</i>

562
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,083
<i>And after all...</i>

563
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:19,627
<i>...the universe is mostly dark,
dotted by islands of light.</i>

564
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,219
Learning the age of the Earth...

565
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,507
...or the distance to the stars
or how life evolves...

566
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,675
...what difference does that make?

567
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:32,268
Well, part of it depends on how big
a universe you're willing to live in.

568
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,307
Some of us like it small.

569
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,691
That's fine.

570
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,477
Understandable.

571
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,112
But I like it big.

572
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:44,026
And when I take all of this into my heart
and my mind, I'm uplifted by it.

573
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,822
And when I have that feeling,
I want to know that it's real...

574
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,537
...that it's not just something
happening inside my own head...

575
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,622
...because it matters what's true...

576
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,413
...and our imagination is nothing...

577
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,254
...compared with nature's awesome reality.

578
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,682
<i>I want to know what's
in those dark places...</i>

579
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,891
<i>...and what happened before the big bang.</i>

580
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:18,856
<i>I want to know what lies beyond
the cosmic horizon and how life began.</i>

581
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:25,196
<i>Are there other places in the cosmos where
matter and energy have become alive...</i>

582
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,411
<i>...and aware?</i>

583
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,706
<i>I want to know my ancestors, all of them.</i>

584
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:43,126
<i>I want to be a good, strong link
in the chain of generations.</i>

585
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:48,389
<i>I want to protect my children
and the children of ages to come.</i>

586
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:54,351
We, who embody the local eyes and ears
and thoughts and feelings of the cosmos...

587
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,436
...we've begun to learn the story
of our origins...

588
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,523
...star stuff contemplating
the evolution of matter...

589
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,782
...tracing that long path by which
it arrived at consciousness.

590
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,238
We and the other living things
on this planet...

591
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:12,952
...carry a legacy of cosmic evolution
spanning billions of years.

592
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,116
If we take that knowledge to heart...

593
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,836
...if we come to know and love nature
as it really is...

594
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,714
...then we will surely be remembered
by our descendants...

595
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,922
...as good, strong links
in the chain of life.

596
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,133
And our children will continue
this sacred searching...

597
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:32,093
...seeing for us as we have seen
for those who came before...

598
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,387
...discovering wonders
yet undreamt of...

599
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,931
...in the cosmos.
