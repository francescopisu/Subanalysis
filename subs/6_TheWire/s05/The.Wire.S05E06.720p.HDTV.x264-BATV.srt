1
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,200
Gotta be somewhere.
You wanna keep goin'?

2
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,900
Officer Smith, ma'am.

3
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,400
We're looking for a man went after a woman
last night at Esplanda Apartments.

4
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,100
- Heard anything unusual?
- No, sorry.

5
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,700
Oh my God, that's terrible.
Is the woman all right?

6
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,100
- The woman, is she all right?
- Yeah, she good.

7
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,100
Excuse me. My brother, Omar Little, came
here last night. He fell out the damn window.

8
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,100
- We don't have anyone by that name.
- He was kinda high.

9
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Probably messed up his name.
Real dark, got himself a scar.

10
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Legs should be busted up real bad.

11
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,200
No one with that type
of injury came in last night.

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,400
Not a goddamn thing. Been in every trash can,
dumpster, vacant for three blocks 'round.

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,100
- Nothin'.
- We even checked down the sewers.

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,100
- Marlo wanna meet.
- So what you want us to do?

15
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,700
Which one?

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,400
- Don't seem possible.
- It don't.

17
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,100
That some Spiderman shit there.

18
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,400
We missed our shot.

19
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Now he gonna be at us.

20
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,000
Usually, my staff tries to keep sharp objects
out of my hands.

21
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,100
You know, it all started with Charles Center
and Tommy d'Alesandro

22
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,600
and it continued with William Donald Schaefer
and Harborplace.

23
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,200
And following that, there were mayors
Schmoke and O'Malley with Inner Harbor East.

24
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,500
Well, today it is my administration's turn to lay
claim to the middle branch of the Patapsco

25
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
and what will soon become
known as New Westport,

26
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,200
revitalizing another waterfront area
of our great city. Thank you.

27
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Say goodbye to Locust Point South.

28
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Fuck you, Krawczyk.

29
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,400
Yeah, fuck you, greedhead motherfucker.

30
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
Fuck you for tearing down
the port of Baltimore

31
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,600
and selling it to some yuppie
assholes from Washington.

32
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,600
- C'mon, buddy.
- This is bullshit.

33
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,600
- Who the hell's that?
- That's nobody, Mr. Mayor. It's nobody at all.

34
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,700
- You happy now, bitch?
- I am content, yes.

35
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,300
- You called the reporter?
- No, actually.

36
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,300
That asshole's making up his own shit.

37
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,600
Brass called a press
conference for this afternoon.

38
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,200
They'll be shoveling so much money
at my bullshit it'll make your head spin.

39
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,700
- What's with all the casework?
- Bodies from the vacants.

40
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,600
- Some still missing lab work.
- Pathetic...

41
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,500
And some of them have
been worked pretty good.

42
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,500
You know what, Jimmy?
I'm gonna go back to the beginning

43
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,600
and work every one of them again.
Back to square one.

44
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,500
You know why?
Because I'm a murder police.

45
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,500
I work murders. I don't fuck with
no make-believe, I don't jerk shit around.

46
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,100
I catch a murder and I work it.

47
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,900
Working this shit like I'm supposed to.

48
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,400
Well, let me know
if you need anything, all right?

49
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,500
Cars, some OT, some lab work...
Anything you need.

50
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,400
Because in three or four hours
the money's gonna flow on my case.

51
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,800
Whatever you need, I'm probably gonna have
more of it than even Lester could use.

52
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,300
To be that close to a serial killer.
It must be weird.

53
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,000
Kinda. Yeah.

54
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,000
- Wonderful story, Scott.
- Yeah, well, it kinda wrote itself.

55
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,300
It's lucky to have the guy call me like he did...

56
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,100
It comes from pounding the pavement, right?
That's more than luck.

57
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,800
That's putting yourself
in the place where the story comes to you.

58
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,400
What do you have for tomorrow?

59
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,000
This is not the kind of thing
we let go of after a day or two.

60
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,100
I was thinking that if I spent
a night with the homeless, you know.

61
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,500
Did what they did. Saw what they saw.

62
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,700
If it's an overnight thing, I couldn't get it
for tomorrow, but the next day, sure...

63
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,300
That's great. That could be the perfect follow.
I'll speak to Gus.

64
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,800
We've been taking calls from some
of the networks and cable outlets.

65
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,400
- They're looking for you to go on-camera.
- Me? On television?

66
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,900
I'd avoid locals, but if you can do
the national stuff responsibly...

67
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,700
Sure, yeah. I mean,
I'm just not all that comfortable

68
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,500
having myself in the center
of the story like this.

69
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,200
Of course not. But there is a way
of handling this responsibly.

70
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,500
Just remember you're an
ambassador for the paper.

71
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,900
Star time.

72
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,300
How about that?

73
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,800
- Homelessness?
- Our coverage should reflect

74
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,300
the Dickensian aspect of the homeless.

75
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,600
The human element.

76
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,200
Scott will lead it off,
spending a night on the streets

77
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
and writing from that perspective.

78
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,300
He's the lead on your education project.
We need to get him back on the...

79
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't see the school project as yielding
the same kind of impact

80
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,500
as our attention to homelessness can.

81
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,700
These murders, the phone call to our reporter.

82
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,300
It really opens up the issue.

83
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,000
- Yeah, but...
- From now till the end of the year,

84
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,400
let's focus not only on covering the murders,

85
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,300
but on the nature of homelessness itself.

86
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,400
The Dickensian aspect of it. Yeah.

87
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,400
I've reached a point, Detective Sydnor,

88
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,900
where I no longer have the time or patience left

89
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,300
to address myself to the needs of the system
within which we work.

90
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
- I'm tired.
- You're gonna quit?

91
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,200
Not yet. Not just yet.

92
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,000
So what are you talking about?

93
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,200
When they took us off Marlo this last time,

94
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,700
when they said they couldn't
pay for further investigation,

95
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,300
I regarded that decision as illegitimate.

96
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,100
- Illegitimate?
- And so...

97
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,900
I'm responding in kind.
I'm going to press a case

98
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,600
against Marlo Stanfield
without regard to the usual rules.

99
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,800
I'm running an illegal wiretap
on Marlo Stanfield's cellphone.

100
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,200
- Fuck. Lester?
- If you have a problem with this,

101
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
I understand completely

102
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,900
and I urge you to get as far fucking
away from me as you can.

103
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,200
You remember this one here?

104
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,900
I backed away from jackin' the boy up outta
respect for that goofy motherfucker Prez.

105
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Wonder what the young man might
tell me a year later, though...

106
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,100
- What the fuck is this?
- Vernon here did a search warrant

107
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,900
on his dead guy's appliance store,
pulled all of that out of the desk drawer.

108
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,300
- Grand jury shit?
- Transcripts, sealed indictments...

109
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,100
- Who's your murder?
- Eastside dealer by the name of Joe Stewart.

110
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,200
Caught one in the back
of his head the other night.

111
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,900
Somebody finally touched Prop Joe.

112
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,400
You remember when Narcotics
indicted Charlie Burman last year?

113
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,800
Motherfucker ran a couple days
before the raids, still on the wing.

114
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,500
The sealed indictments are all in there.
Every one of 'em.

115
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,700
Who don't we trust at the courthouse?

116
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,600
- They put cheese on them fries?
- They can. Chili too.

117
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
- All right, then.
- You want a drink with that?

118
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,700
- Strawberry lemonade.
- All right, I'm on it.

119
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,200
They're back on cellphones.
After more than a year?

120
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,100
- That they are.
- Tell me they're talking in code, Lester.

121
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,100
I wanna go to jail for snatchin' something better
than Marlo's lunch order.

122
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,000
There's no code that I can tell.
Half dozen calls.

123
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,400
All routine.
No drug talk, no numbers, no times...

124
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,900
Nothing but what they seem.

125
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,100
So he ain't doing business with the phone then.

126
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,400
Take this mess down.
Let's get outta here.

127
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,100
I also have five calls,
30 to 40 seconds' duration,

128
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,300
each one picked up on the first ring,
each one with nothing whatsoever

129
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,600
said between parties. You see?
When they talk, it's bullshit.

130
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,700
But there are calls where no one says a thing.

131
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,000
Thirty seconds, without conversation.

132
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,600
Is he...

133
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
We talked it through, he knows the risks.

134
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,100
I'm in. If it makes the fucking case,
I'm in all the way.

135
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,700
So, what's up now? They talking dirt?

136
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,500
- No.
- Lester. Fuck.

137
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,900
Marlo's not gonna talk dirt on the phone,
but there's something to this.

138
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,100
I just haven't figured it out.

139
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,500
We could use some more manpower,
a couple of surveillance teams

140
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,400
to get on these guys to see
how they using the phones.

141
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
You see the newspaper today?

142
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,300
Headline like that, the bosses are gonna start
throwing money at the homeless murders.

143
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,600
When they do, I'll peel off a couple detectives,
throw them your way.

144
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,800
The homeless murders?
How does that case tangle in with this?

145
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,600
Hard to explain.

146
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,100
Remember what the DNC folks told me
two years ago? How to take the statehouse?

147
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,800
Build something downtown
and stick your name on it,

148
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,900
get the crime to go down,
and stay away from schools.

149
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,400
- And keep my boyish good looks.
- One out of four ain't bad.

150
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,900
Jesus.

151
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,500
Did we have to schedule this the same
day as New Westport?

152
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,300
My news isn't even going to make
the front of the local section.

153
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,300
The ribbon-cutting was scheduled two weeks
ago. No one saw the homeless thing coming.

154
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
First of all, I'm surprised
to see so much media here.

155
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,600
A press event held earlier today
to announce the revitalization

156
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,500
of yet another part of our city
was not so well attended.

157
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,700
It would appear that media attention is always
focusing on the negatives in Baltimore,

158
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,500
but you aren't around
when we're making real progress.

159
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Still, I'm glad to see so many of you here.

160
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Some of you representing
not just our local media,

161
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,000
but national attention to this problem.

162
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,300
Thank you for caring enough
about our most vulnerable citizens

163
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,400
to address yourselves to this tragedy.

164
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Our homeless citizens, those who have fallen
through the cracks of our society,

165
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,500
those who command
the least of our attentions and efforts,

166
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,700
they seemingly have little to endear
themselves to politicians.

167
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,100
They don't vote, by and large.
They don't contribute to campaigns.

168
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,100
They offer little to a city's tax base,

169
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,000
and to the extent that our government
is made aware of their existence,

170
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,400
it responds by trying to mitigate
the damage done by their presence.

171
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,700
We open a food bank here, a shelter there.

172
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,800
We try to move them away from downtown,

173
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,000
away from our communal areas,
away from our schools, away from our homes.

174
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,800
If you were to judge our society by the manner
in which we treat those lost on our streets,

175
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,200
we would have cause to be shamed.

176
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Well, I am, God forgive me, a politician.

177
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,800
But I ran for public office because I believe
that there is a different way of governing.

178
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,800
And I believe that in the end we will be judged
not by the efforts we make on behalf

179
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,600
of those who vote for us,
who contribute to our campaigns,

180
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,800
or those who provide for our tax base.

181
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,700
I believe that we will be judged by what we
provide to the weakest and most vulnerable.

182
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,600
That is the test. That is my test.

183
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,300
Somebody is killing homeless men in this city.

184
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Taking the lives of fellow citizens
who do not have the means or the strength

185
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,400
to properly protect themselves.
They will be stopped.

186
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,600
We will do everything in our power
to stop them. You have my word on this.

187
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,900
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

188
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,600
- What got into you?
- What?

189
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,600
I want to assure the public that we are doing
everything possible in our power

190
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,100
to apprehend this subject.

191
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Homicide detectives are working non-stop.

192
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,700
District officers are in contact with the agencies
that work with the homeless.

193
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,500
I cannot go into specifics of the investigation
but, with that caveat, I will take questions.

194
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,800
Commissioner, is there any connection

195
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,100
between these murders and those
in the vacant homes last year?

196
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,600
No connection.

197
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,600
Commissioner, are you asking the FBI
to join in the investigation?

198
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,900
I think deputy commissioner
Daniels is in a position to elaborate on that.

199
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,000
We'll take whatever help is offered.

200
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,300
Our detectives will work closely with
the behavioral analysis unit at Quantico...

201
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,100
Deputy, even with all the resources
at your disposal,

202
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,000
isn't it extremely difficult to catch a serial killer?

203
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,000
Our ability to secure genetic material
and the growing DNA data bank

204
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,500
are assets unavailable
to us even a few years ago.

205
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,500
Our ability to effectively use resources

206
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,700
has been increased with the aid
of sophisticated computer software.

207
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,800
And we have some of the best criminal
investigators in the nation working 24/7.

208
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,900
As the mayor made very clear a moment ago,
this is now a priority for the department.

209
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,300
Has a note been found at any of the scenes?

210
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,300
I'm not at liberty to go into any details
of the investigation at this time.

211
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,700
You want me to hang?

212
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,600
He told you who I am, right?

213
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,400
Son, the thing about murder
is it never goes off the books.

214
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,600
I mean, we work on 'em for weeks,
months, years.

215
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,700
We keep on with it until finally
someone decides they've had enough,

216
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,900
until we get the right word
from the right person.

217
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
And you know what happens then?

218
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
When a case does go down...

219
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,400
all those people who kept quiet about it,
who lied about it,

220
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,100
all of them who thought
it wasn't coming back on 'em,

221
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,400
they end up catchin' a charge.
And they get time behind that.

222
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,500
Time? You gonna give me time?

223
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,000
If you know something
about that boy Lex getting shot,

224
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,300
now is your last chance to speak to that.

225
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
- You gave a statement last year...
- Why don't you promise to get me outta here?

226
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,300
That's what y'all do, ain't it?
Lie to dumbass niggers?

227
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,100
Yo, y'all need to get this police out my face
before I bank his ass.

228
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,800
You're a natural, kiddo.
You had them eating out of your hand.

229
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Shit, I was just following the mayor's lead.
He wants a full-court press, right?

230
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
We can add a detective or two.

231
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,500
And you can ask patrol to concentrate
on posts where vagrants congregate.

232
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
But other than that, deputy,
the cupboard is bare.

233
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,300
- But Carcetti...
- Make no mistake.

234
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,300
He wants us to solve the murders.
He just doesn't want it to cost.

235
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,700
Don't look so shocked.
You're runnin' with the big dogs now.

236
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,800
Isn't it enough that we're
up on the killer's cellphone?

237
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,100
Couldn't you track him on the GPS chip?

238
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,900
He's using a burner and we suspect he's taking
out the battery between calls.

239
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,600
And there's nothing to stop him
from changing phones,

240
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,400
calling the reporter from a new number.

241
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,900
So you want to tap the reporter's phone
as well.

242
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,700
It stands to reason that we should monitor
this thing from both ends.

243
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,100
- It's what we would normally do.
- Nothing about this is normal.

244
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,100
A Baltimore Sun reporter's phone
is problematic.

245
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,400
We need to strike a balance
between your needs

246
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,200
as investigators and the First Amendment
rights of the Sun and its sources.

247
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,900
The First Amendment does not
guarantee privacy, your Honor.

248
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Legal precedent clearly indicates...

249
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,900
- Look I'm not saying that we can't, but...
- But what?

250
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Until we get the sense
that your suspect is changing phones,

251
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm not inclined to look with favor on tapping
the Baltimore Sun's telecommunications.

252
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,300
- We're afraid to piss them off?
- Never pick a fight

253
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,900
with anyone who buys ink by the barrel-full.

254
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,100
- Christ.
- Very well, judge.

255
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,100
How many enemies do you need?

256
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,900
Deputy.

257
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,300
- Where did you get all this?
- Darling, you do not want to know.

258
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,300
What's up with you?

259
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
Got all 22 out of the drawer?

260
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,700
- Workin' the whole mess at once.
- I'm trying to see 'em fresh.

261
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,600
25. My triple.
It comes back to Marlo and his people.

262
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,100
For sure?

263
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
A good informant tells me so.

264
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,400
Says one of my vics was talking bad
about Mr. Stanfield, who took it personal.

265
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,400
Killed him, his girl, his muscle.

266
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Left the little kids alive,
so I guess he ain'tall bad.

267
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,500
People out there
so scared of this motherfucker,

268
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,400
I can't get close to an eyewitness on any of it.

269
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,000
- Where you at with the rest of these cases?
- We don't even have lab work

270
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,600
on 14 of these bodies?

271
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,100
A year later I'm still walking in
written requests into Landsman,

272
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,900
who just files them away in his drawer.

273
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,000
McNulty would've called a news reporter.

274
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,300
I am not him.

275
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,700
Well, what would the Bunk do?
Take no for a fucking answer?

276
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,800
We had cutbacks, you know that.

277
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,700
We lost three or four trace examiners.
Lost half our clerical.

278
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,600
The freezer went bad, we lost four months
of blood samples.

279
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,700
Did you know that? Four months of evidence

280
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,400
and they still haven't replaced my damn icebox.

281
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,500
My heart pumps purple piss for you.

282
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,300
Now, I got the worst mass murder
in B-more history

283
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,500
and you can't get the trace work back to me
inside of a year? C'mon, Ron...

284
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,200
Look...

285
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,800
You can't go to the press.

286
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,200
I mean, heads will roll if this gets out.
It isn't anyone's fault.

287
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,900
In fact, it's a little bit on you, in a way.

288
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,600
The fuck you say?

289
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,100
After Annette took retirement, the casework
got backed up worse than ever, right?

290
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,700
Well, we put in to fill the lab assistant slot,

291
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,100
but with the cutbacks,
the best they could give us was a temp.

292
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,400
- A temp?
- Yeah. No medical. No pension.

293
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,500
A temp hire to get us over for a while.

294
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,500
Look, I'll show you something...

295
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,800
She was assigned to sort
and file the individual trace elements...

296
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,800
Hair, fiber mostly...

297
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
You know, from each of the 14 scenes.

298
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,000
So what's the problem?

299
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,300
In the initial paperwork,
you wrote out all 22 CC numbers, right?

300
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
- Right.
- But in the supplemental requests,

301
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,000
you put all the incidents under the initial CC

302
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,600
and then you wrote, "et al," remember?

303
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,900
- So?
- She didn't know what "et al" meant.

304
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,300
And she sorted everything under
the single complaint number.

305
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,000
You don't fuckin' mean...

306
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,300
We have no idea which one of your scenes
any of this shit came from.

307
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,800
We don't have a clue.

308
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,000
Actually, except for this
she's been a pretty good employee.

309
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,100
- Surveillance teams.
- Two each on 12-hour shifts.

310
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,300
I need them to set up on certain locations
common to our cases.

311
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,800
C'mon, Jay. You heard the mayor.
This case is a red ball.

312
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,800
That it is.
You can have Greggs, if you want.

313
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,800
The last time I offered her up, you kicked her
back to her own casework.

314
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,700
Other than a second detective,
you are on your own.

315
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,200
- So it's all bullshit.
- I dunno.

316
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,400
I thought the mayor
gave a very nice speech.

317
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,100
I, for one, was moved.
Much like the bull to which you just referred.

318
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,400
- Tell you one thing...
- What's that?

319
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,900
Motherfucker whose got the connect,
he the one that did Joe.

320
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,400
Oh, no doubt.

321
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,200
Y'all know the co-op took some hits.
Joe. Hungry Man.

322
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,900
Good people, especially Joe.
Their passin' was for real, cold blooded.

323
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,900
I know what you thinkin',
so I'm a put it out there...

324
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,200
I'm responsible.

325
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,600
A week or so back,
I made a move on Omar, with Joe's approval.

326
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,100
The faggot ain't had heart enough to come
at me, so he come at those close to me.

327
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,500
Now I'm doublin' the bounty...

328
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,300
Hundred large for a whiff of that dicksuck.

329
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,500
Two hundred fifty for his head.

330
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,700
- What about the connect?
- I got that covered.

331
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,700
And in light of that fact, I'm a take it upon
myself to conduct this meet.

332
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,500
Slim, I want you take over
Hungry Man's slice of the cake.

333
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,500
Meanin' no disrespect,
but I ain't cut out to be no CEO.

334
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,900
- Cheese, then.
- No problem, man. Got you covered.

335
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,300
Until we settle up with Omar,
I think it's best we suspend these meets.

336
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,600
In fact, I ain't really one for meets no how.

337
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,300
Anybody got a problem here on out,
bring it to me, or sit on that shit.

338
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,500
Those of you on the Westside
who need to re-up, holler at my man Monk.

339
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,400
He gonna handle supply over there.
On the Eastside, Cheese.

340
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
One more thing.

341
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,700
Price of the brick going up.

342
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,400
Thirty more.

343
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,800
All right. Enough of this shit.

344
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,400
What?

345
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,900
Next year for the schools.
From now until December,

346
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,300
we're all about the plight of the homeless.
The great whiting has spoken.

347
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,700
I appealed to Klebanow half hour ago
but he gave me the thumbs down. I'm sorry.

348
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Check it out, people.
Our Metro desk has some national profile.

349
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,700
We're being careful to cooperate
with the investigators in every way.

350
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,300
My newspaper has no desire to get between
the police and the suspect.

351
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,200
But still, wouldn't you agree it's
an incredible moment for any journalist

352
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,300
to come face to face with that type
of pure evil like the son of Sam.

353
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,500
That makes you the
Jimmy Breslin of Baltimore.

354
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,100
Well, no, I wouldn't say that. I mean...

355
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,500
But knowing you have been
in contact with a killer,

356
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,100
are you at all concerned about continuing
to report from the street?

357
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,100
No, not at all.
I mean, this is what we do.

358
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,500
As a reporter, you expect to be
in harm's way at some points.

359
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,500
- It's what we do.
- Agreed. It's what we do.

360
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,000
But very rarely does a reporter end up
being in the middle of a story -

361
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,800
an ongoing story -

362
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,700
about a murderer who is still at large
and posing a severe and deadly risk to the...

363
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,200
You shoulda heard Phelan this morning.

364
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,100
Too scared to tap the newspaper phones
they might shit on him for it.

365
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,900
Fuckin' hack judge.

366
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,500
What would you want with more wires?
We got all we need.

367
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,500
I don't want another wire.
It's the principle of the thing...

368
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
It just pissed me off listening to him.

369
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,800
Oh yeah, no surveillance cars.

370
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,300
They won't go beyond me and Greggs.

371
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,700
You and Sydnor will have to work
it as best you can for right now.

372
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,300
Assholes.

373
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,300
They need another body, don't they?

374
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,100
I'll call our man in the Southern.

375
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,300
I can take it from here.
Y'all can bounce.

376
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,800
All right, boss.

377
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,600
What up, Rick?

378
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,500
Just like ol' times for me and you.

379
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,700
- Whatever you want it's yours, all right?
- Tonight, I'm just gonna take yo' jump...

380
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,600
- And leave you with a little something.
- What's that?

381
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,400
My word in your ear.

382
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm callin' Marlo a straight bitch.

383
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,600
I'm sayin' it don't take much
to shoot down a blind man.

384
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,500
And as for him steppin' to me,
you tell that dude he ain't got the heart.

385
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,900
All right.

386
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,200
You tell that man I'm in the street, waiting.

387
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Just like a little bitch,
he ain't nowhere to be found.

388
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,800
I'll tell him. I will.

389
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,800
Pick up your keys and go on inside, yo.

390
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,400
You kill Joe?

391
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,700
Hungry?

392
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Didn't think so.

393
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,100
What now?

394
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,200
There's more than one way to skin a case.

395
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Already ran them for priors, right?

396
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,300
Priors, yeah. But I'm gonna run
every name you guys developed

397
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,900
through the entire database.

398
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,500
Not just for priors, but for anything at all
in the miles system.

399
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,400
Court appearances, parole, probation,

400
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,000
gun permits, DOC, open bails.

401
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,000
- You're playing long shots, huh?
- Darlin', I'm playin' the hand I've been dealt.

402
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,200
An H-file?

403
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,300
- Who caught the case?
- Worden. Other shift.

404
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Stepfather. Beaten to death.

405
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,700
They interviewed the mother,
but no one else in the household.

406
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,900
Doesn't exactly fit with the others, does it?

407
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,100
A straight up ass-whoopin' in an alley
doesn't seem like Marlo Stanfield.

408
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,100
- No, it doesn't.
- But you're gonna work it anyway.

409
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,100
In the Pentecostal church
where I was given religion,

410
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,100
it would have been said the spirit
was on you yesterday.

411
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,400
- It got good to me.
- Let praises be.

412
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,900
It pissed me off that on top
of everything else I gotta deal with,

413
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,300
some nutjob starts killing homeless guys.
Fuck already, how many shitbowls are there?

414
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,100
He's right though. You were great.
That passion was just the thing.

415
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,400
- You think...
- We step out on this issue,

416
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,300
it could provide some national presence...

417
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,600
Didn't the governor scrap the emergency
medical and housing program last year?

418
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,100
What was it, TEMHA?

419
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,800
Replaced it with T-Dap, which cuts funding to
anyone who doesn't qualify for federal support.

420
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,700
It's worse than that: He froze eligibility
by disallowing new applications,

421
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,700
which put all kinda folks out on the street.

422
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,400
So we slam the Republican
for sticking it to the poor.

423
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,000
It plays. Nationally, you're taking up
the cause of the forgotten...

424
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,400
And no one is ever in favor of homelessness...

425
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,800
Statewide, you're going up
against the fella who tore up the safety net.

426
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,600
Homelessness.

427
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,800
I'll be damned.

428
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,600
- Base to 2306.
- Go ahead, Lester.

429
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,100
- You see anybody using a cellphone?
- Wait one.

430
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,000
Negative.

431
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,900
Hold on. Somebody's here.

432
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,900
Lester?

433
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,700
Can't get used to how empty
this place feels nowadays.

434
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,300
True, but you'd be surprised
what you can get done when no one's looking.

435
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,300
You'll need to serve these.
Running out of time.

436
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,700
I'll get right on it.

437
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,300
There's a couple of loose ends
we should cover as well.

438
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
- Now?
- If not now, when?

439
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,500
The trial date is coming up on us fast.

440
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,800
Right. But it's...

441
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,300
- Is it something I said?
- No...

442
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,300
Sydnor is bringing in a CI.
And if you're here...

443
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh, shit.

444
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,300
I'm sorry...

445
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,800
I'll leave you my list, OK?

446
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,200
No problem. We'll get right on it.

447
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,900
I'm sorry, Lester, if I was intruding.

448
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
You couldn't know.

449
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,700
So why you here?

450
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,400
If this about Michael and what he into,

451
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,100
y'all should know he don't live here no more.

452
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,900
Actually, I'm following up on your man's case.

453
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You spoke to Detective Worden
when it happened.

454
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,900
He was your boyfriend, right?

455
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,800
When he weren't in jail...

456
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,700
Father to my youngest.

457
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,300
But you know how he died.

458
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,100
Beaten bad. Crime of passion, as we say.

459
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Didn't seem like he was home long enough

460
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,200
to get somebody that riled at him.

461
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Unless, of course, it was over you.

462
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,200
You sayin' I know somethin' about that?

463
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,800
Lady, let's put our cards on the table.

464
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,600
I been in this game longer than a little bit,
and there's one thing I know.

465
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,900
A murder like this,
there's a woman at the center of it.

466
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,700
I don't know nothin'.

467
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,200
You know my gut tells me that you do.

468
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,400
And I'll tell you what...

469
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,500
We're gonna take a ride downtown,
let you talk to the grand jury.

470
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
You're not straight with them, they'll give you
a material witness warrant.

471
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,300
And you sit over at woman's
detention for a couple of weeks.

472
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,600
It's amazing what it does
for the grieving process.

473
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,800
- Get your things.
- I ain't goin' nowhere.

474
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,600
It's me or the wagon.

475
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,100
Detective, I swear, I ain't in this.

476
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
It ain't me you wanna talk to.

477
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,600
It's the boy, he know.

478
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,200
- He runnin' with them who did it.
- You just tryin' to put me off the scent.

479
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,900
You gotta believe me.

480
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,100
He told me Devar wasn't comin' home,
'fore we even knowed he was dead.

481
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,800
You said he's runnin' with them?
Runnin' with who?

482
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,300
Chris, Snoop, all them gangsters.
Who else doin' all the killin' around here?

483
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,200
Let me see your camera.

484
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,600
- Add a minute-six to your times.
- Got it.

485
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,100
Here it is. Look at this.

486
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,800
Single ring. Connection. Silence.

487
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,600
What do you have?

488
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,700
I took these three.
They're just hangin' around.

489
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
What time did Monk leave?

490
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,600
1:24. Two minutes later.

491
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,600
It's not what Marlo's sayin',
it's what he's sendin'.

492
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,600
- Look at Monk.
- Yeah. Text message.

493
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,700
Text? Need I remind you, Detective,

494
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,700
these young men are products
of Baltimore City schools.

495
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,700
Besides, look how far away he's holding
his phone. Too far away to be reading a text.

496
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,500
Nah, son. Pictures.

497
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,500
Pictures...

498
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
What the fuck you lookin' at?

499
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,600
You know what they do, right?
They tease you.

500
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,000
They let you get close and just
when you're about to pull the case,

501
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,700
they rip the fuckin' rug out from under you.

502
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm not lying. We got a fuckin'
serial killer on the loose.

503
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,400
You didn't know that?

504
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,300
It's in the goddamn paper.

505
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,800
What support do I get?
One fuckin' detective.

506
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,300
They wanna play their simple-ass games, fine.
But I gotta do what I gotta do.

507
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,900
Excuse me.

508
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,500
Yeah, Oscar.

509
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,700
Beautiful.

510
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,800
Absolutely. Where? On my way.

511
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,100
Man, you can't let it get to you like this.

512
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,300
Why don't we go buy up a bunch
of toys and take 'em to your kids?

513
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,500
You ain't hearin' me. How can I go
near my people with Omar on us?

514
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,400
How he gonna find out about them?

515
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,600
How we find out about the blind man?

516
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,400
Get.

517
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,200
It's Omar!

518
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,100
You too, shorty.

519
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
Omar! It's Omar!

520
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,900
Money a little late today.

521
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,500
That buckshot in your leg should help you
explain yourself to Marlo.

522
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,400
As for them other two they gonna wish
that I'd peppered them a bit.

523
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,400
Now you make sure you tell
old Marlo I burned the money.

524
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,100
'Cause it ain't about that paper.

525
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,300
It's about me hurtin' his people,
messin' with his world.

526
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,200
Tell that boy he ain't man
enough to come down to the street with Omar.

527
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,400
You tell him that!

528
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,100
My sergeant and two side
partners got here before me.

529
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,400
Then the shift commander showed.
Now the duty officer is on his way.

530
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,000
For a DOA?

531
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,800
Well, you and Lester
started some shit here, son.

532
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,500
Now a DOA call
brings everyone in a heartbeat.

533
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,200
God bless.

534
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,500
- Pictures?
- Photographs on cellphones.

535
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,600
Now that means new PC to capture the photos

536
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,800
and new equipment that could do it.

537
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,300
How do I write that into
my bullshit homeless killer's MO?

538
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,800
When we started this, you said all
we needed were some bugs,

539
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,000
a camera or two, and in a couple of weeks,
we'd have them. That's what you said.

540
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,000
So I cranked up my bullshit to pay for that

541
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,700
but no, then you needed a wiretap.

542
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,700
So I went along, I got you the wiretap.

543
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,700
Then you ask for surveillance teams,

544
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,300
but before I can get to that,
you came to me with this.

545
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,300
I mean, what the fuck?

546
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,700
I gotta tell you, Lester,
I don't want to hurt your feelings,

547
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,500
but I can see why Daniels cringed every time
you opened your fucking mouth.

548
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,700
You're a supervisor's nightmare.

549
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,700
I'm just following the thread.

550
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,900
Say we get you the intercept
on your pictures, will that give us Marlo?

551
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,500
It'll be coded, probably,
but I'm sure we can break it.

552
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
That'll tell us how they do business,

553
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,500
and usually, that's enough.

554
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,200
Or not.

555
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,300
But the truth is, I'm running Sydnor ragged

556
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,000
just staying on a couple
of mopes and monitoring calls.

557
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,700
Now, when we're up on their code,

558
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,000
we're gonna need more manpower
to run down a stash or a re-up.

559
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,900
- We can't do it all.
- I can't juke this thing any more than I have.

560
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,000
Last night, half the police department turned up

561
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,700
at Oscar's crime scene
before I could get there.

562
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,900
We can't make another murder.

563
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,200
Thanks for the milk.

564
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,300
What's a donut without milk?

565
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,100
So you were talking about your second tour...

566
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,300
- The bad one.
- Yeah.

567
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,100
Second tour fucked me up good.
But they don't wanna hear it.

568
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,200
Who doesn't?

569
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,900
Mostly, it's command and the senior EMS.

570
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,800
They put it down that marines
don't get P.T.S.D.

571
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,900
But they do.

572
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,200
Can you tell me what happened?

573
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,800
Terry, can you talk about it?

574
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,400
We had a month left on the tour,

575
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,500
working an S-and-A mission outside Fallujah.

576
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,200
I was assistant team leader.

577
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,000
Our M-niner-niner-eights were
retrofitted with up-armor kits.

578
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,300
M-niner-niner-eight?

579
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,900
A humvee, sorry.

580
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,700
They're big on nomenclature.

581
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Anyway we finished our sweep,
headed back in, right?

582
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,600
It was all good. Then, bam...

583
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,400
Our lead vehicle was hit
with an elevated I.E.D.

584
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,200
The blast tore the M-fifty gunner in half.

585
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,300
Flipped the humvee like a matchbox car.

586
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,100
Driver lost both his hands.

587
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,900
Blood shooting out all over.
He's fuckin' laughin'.

588
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Saying over and over,
"Look, Ma, no hands."

589
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,000
It's the laughing I can't shake.

590
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,000
Weird.

591
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
'Cause he's OK, you know?
I mean, he's better than me.

592
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,600
Got himself a couple of prosthetic mitts,
eighty thousand apiece.

593
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,700
What happened next?

594
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,400
Nothing really.
We pushed out, secured the perimeter.

595
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,100
Corpsman did what he could,
an' we waited for the casevac.

596
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,800
I'm not looking to shit on another guy's copy,

597
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,600
I just wanted you to know
this was out there.

598
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,500
I'm at a community meeting
in Bel Air-Edison

599
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,300
to hear about school zoning and this woman
talked my ear off about this.

600
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,300
She said the kids never saw a dime.

601
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,600
I mean, I'm hoping this is all bullshit.

602
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,100
- Hey, Scott. How's it coming?
- Pretty good. You seen the art?

603
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,200
Yeah. Good stuff. Listen,

604
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,900
got a complaint about a story
you wrote a couple weeks ago.

605
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,800
The woman who died
from an allergic reaction to seafood.

606
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,200
- Remember?
- What about it?

607
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,900
Lady knows the dead woman sister says
our story made a lot of money for those kids.

608
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,000
- A scholarship fund we wrote up.
- So?

609
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,400
She says the sister has a history of fraud,
convictions on it.

610
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,900
She says all the money went
to Atlantic City casinos

611
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,600
- And kids never saw a dime.
- Christ, who the fuck...

612
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,400
I know. It's probably some old biddy
talkin' about stuff she don't know,

613
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,900
but maybe you should go
back and check with the family,

614
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,600
see if we don't get took on this, huh?

615
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,000
No, no. Not now. After you file.
Just make a couple calls, huh?

616
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,200
- This is kidnapping.
- Actually, I'm not sure.

617
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,900
I asked him if he wanted
$100 to go some place for dinner and talk

618
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,900
- And he walked to my car.
- You give him the hundred?

619
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,000
Stuffed it in his jacket.

620
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,600
He's fine, Lester. He's great.

621
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,800
- Think he'll find his way back home?
- Eventually.

622
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,800
By then, we'll be done with Marlo,
we'll have shut this thing down.

623
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,900
As far as what happened to this guy...

624
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,300
They'll write it off as some fraternity prank.

625
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,500
- Does he know we're cops?
- No.

626
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,100
Even if he figures it out,
who's gonna believe him? He's nuts.

627
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,000
- How do you know he's nuts?
- First of all, just look at him.

628
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,700
He's fucking bouncing off the walls.
Second of all... I got his scrip.

629
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,000
I called the university ER.
It's an anti-psychotic.

630
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,900
So...

631
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,100
I took his I.D.,

632
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,900
I'll scratch his name off the scrip
and leave him with this...

633
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,700
I got that one from the first
homeless death Oscar gave us.

634
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,500
The one that was too rigored.
Donald somebody or other.

635
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,100
It had him in a Cleveland, Ohio shelter.

636
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,600
McNulty, you are deserving
of serious psychological study.

637
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,000
You need PC
to intercept cellphone photos.

638
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,100
Well here it is, right here.

639
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,100
We send photos of this guy

640
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,100
all ribboned up from a dry cellphone

641
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,800
to that goofy reporter, along with
a message bitching about his stories.

642
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,900
"I ain't no pervert," or whatever.
Now, the killer says,

643
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,600
you ain't gonna find no more bodies.
Only photos of the victims...

644
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,600
Before they disappear.

645
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,600
Look at this poor sucker.
I don't believe we're gonna do this.

646
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,500
He disappears, the city goes batshit.
You get your photo intercepts,

647
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
and when we need to
run down one of Marlo's re-ups,

648
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,500
you got all the manpower you need.

649
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,200
- And Marlo falls.
- Falls hard.

650
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,200
Don't fucking tell me you mislabeled this, too.

651
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,000
I want comparisons between known suspects

652
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,700
and the DNA from this scene.

653
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,200
By the looks of it,
we got a whole lot of DNA outta this mess.

654
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,900
- Now, motherfucker. Right now.
- Top of my list.

655
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,200
As soon as we work through
all the trace from the homeless killings.

656
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,800
That's the priority, Bunk.

657
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,500
- The homeless killings.
- Everything is backed up behind that, sorry.

658
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,900
Your boy McNulty has
everyone's attention right now.

659
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
So it's Larry, huh?

660
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,700
OK, Larry. You're with good people here.
It's all gonna be great.

661
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,400
You're gonna like this place.
It's warm, they got nice beds.

662
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,100
And best of all, I gave you
cash money just for walking in the door.

663
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,400
Come on, Larry.

664
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,900
It's gonna be fine. I promise.

665
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,200
You feel up for trying Clay yourself?

666
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,300
I mean, it's been a while since
you tried a criminal case personally.

667
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,200
It sends a statement, I think.

668
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,500
We should start with our witness list.
See if we can pare that down any,

669
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,500
out of respect for the distracted nature
of a Baltimore jury.

670
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,400
First, there's something else I need to bring up.

671
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,200
- Old grand jury stuff?
- Sealed indictments.

672
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,400
Sealed transcripts. Dozens of them.

673
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,400
Pulled from the desk of a shot-to-death
drug dealer in east Baltimore.

674
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,000
The deputy ops brought me those.

675
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,100
We have a leak.

676
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,800
And he showed up, outside where I work.

677
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,600
He was confused. Lost I think.
So I brought him here.

678
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,800
Donald, where you from?

679
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,600
Tell the lady, Donald.

680
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,000
Baltimore.

681
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,700
But he told me he came from Cleveland.

682
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,300
Donald, do you have identification?

683
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
This does say Cleveland.

684
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,500
Donald, why don't
we get you something to eat?

685
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
It's OK. Come on.

686
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,400
- We're good to go?
- It's great, Gus.

687
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,400
It sings.

688
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,900
- Hey, Scotty boy.
- Hey.

689
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,300
Hey. Great piece.
I mean this one really feels like the real deal.

690
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,400
- It's great work.
- Thanks.

691
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,300
What I like most about it
is that you didn't overwrite it.

692
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,300
No extra color. No puffy adjectives.

693
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:25,100
Just tight, declarative sentences.
You really let this ex-marine tell his story.

694
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,900
- Thanks, Gus.
- Hey, Mr. Slot man,

695
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,400
read it and weep. And I mean that literally.

696
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,300
Oh, Scott. Did you get a chance to drop
a couple calls on that complaint?

697
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,100
It's bullshit.
I talked to people in the neighborhood.

698
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,900
Sister's good people, but there's
another woman up there, unrelated,

699
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,500
keeps getting arrested
for kiting checks and stuff.

700
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,300
She uses the sister's name
every time she gets locked up.

701
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,800
She's done it like three or four times now.
Yeah, it's crazy.

702
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,600
But sister's clean. Everyone says so.

703
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,000
OK.

704
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,300
Is there anything else I can do for him?

705
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,200
No, we've got it.
But thanks for bringing him in.

706
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,800
Most people, they just ignore them.

707
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,200
I just want to get
your paperwork taken care of.
