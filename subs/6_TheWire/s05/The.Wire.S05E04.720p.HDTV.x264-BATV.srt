1
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,100
Fuck is he doing?

2
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,600
Cops still parked right up the block.

3
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,100
What are we, invisible?

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,800
Stupid fucking yos.

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Nah, just fucking with him, man.

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
You want to wait for him
to serve somebody?

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,900
Fuck it.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,200
They're dirty either way.

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,900
Hands on the wall, fuckers.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,700
- We ain't done nothing!
- Seriously.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,300
I was just sitting in my chair
reading a magazine.

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,900
Watching your crew
work a ground stash, you mean?

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,700
What the fuck?

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,900
Asshole!

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,400
Y'all taking a charge for this,
you know that?

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,000
- You're a truant.
- Today's Saturday.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,100
Try Wednesday.

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,800
I'm past truancy,
why y'all locking me up?

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,600
Hey, Colicio.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Officer Colicchio, shitbird.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,900
We need to block every lane here?

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,100
Shut it down.
It's a police operation here.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,100
- Let's back these vehicles up.
- Excuse me, officer.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,000
- I'm not telling you again.
- Tony, calm down.

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,500
Officer, if you could just move
your car forward just a little bit...

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
We're the police!

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,900
What are you doing?
Let me go!

28
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,200
- Fuck!
- Problem?

29
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,200
I spent all day trying to
trace this $80,000 withdrawal

30
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,000
from Clay's personal account,
figuring it was dirty.

31
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,500
Turns out he's repaying a loan
from his mother-in-law.

32
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,400
- A loan?
- Yeah. Has to be.

33
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,500
She gives him the same amount in 2002.

34
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,800
He uses it as a down payment
on a property

35
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
that he buys the same week.

36
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,100
See?

37
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,500
He bought a weekend house
down in Calvert County six years ago.

38
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,800
You pulled the loan application
on the property?

39
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,600
Just a second.

40
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,500
Here you go.

41
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,500
Got him.

42
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,300
The head shot.

43
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,800
What?

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,200
If anyone is suggesting that
I've broken chain of command,

45
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,800
that I've gone behind your back,

46
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,800
that I've lobbied against you in any way,
they're lying.

47
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,900
I don't know who told the newspaper that,
but they were lying.

48
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,100
Yeah.

49
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,100
Respectfully, sir, I don't know
where this shit is coming from.

50
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
Sir...

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
no one has spoken to me.

52
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Not Carcetti, not anyone.

53
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,800
But if I'm approached,
my answer will be to decline the position

54
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,200
and say I serve at your pleasure.

55
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
Sir?

56
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,000
Sir?

57
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,700
Go with the Preakness piece
or this one about the firefighter death?

58
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,300
- What are you interviewing for?
- Metro position, Virginia bureau.

59
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,200
Firefighter, I think.
Got to show something I wrote on deadline.

60
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,700
- Burrell might get the ax today.
- Who told you that?

61
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Desk sergeant in the eastern
says it's all over the department.

62
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,300
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

63
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,100
Got a rumor that Burrell
is gonna get fired today if not tomorrow.

64
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,500
Yeah?

65
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,400
- Work it.
- What about Twigg?

66
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,100
I mean, with his sources?

67
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,300
I can't throw one at a guy on his last day.

68
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,600
No, you work it as best you can.

69
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,500
You are now my new
senior cop reporter.

70
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,000
Unclaimed.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,600
So far this year... 11.

72
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,500
13 if we add the two
in the freezer I ain't I.D.'d yet.

73
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,900
Run it for no fixed address.

74
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,000
Jimmy, it'd help if I knew
what the fuck you were looking for.

75
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,900
Where are we pulling
most of the homeless from?

76
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,400
With or without ODs?

77
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,900
Numbers are way up
since Fentanyl showed up.

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,700
- Throw 'em in. The more, the merrier.
- All right.

79
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,100
Damn!

80
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,200
They're all dead and no fixed address?

81
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,600
Dropping like flies
in the southern lately.

82
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,200
Lester, it's me.

83
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,300
Yeah, in the morgue.

84
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,900
Some 4 to 12, with a lot at midnight,

85
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,100
and a lot of them in South Baltimore.

86
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah. So who do we know working
12 to 8 in the southern?

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,400
2300 at the district. That'll work.

88
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Jimmy, am I missing something here?
How does this help you?

89
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,800
Don't want none of that
phony gangster shit.

90
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,600
He was old-school.

91
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,200
Funny, feel like I should know Butchie,
but I can't place him.

92
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,500
Came up under Teensy.

93
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,600
Caught him a slug early.
Took his sight.

94
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,900
Dabbled now and then but kept it quiet
as a puppy walking on cotton.

95
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,600
This here do just fine.

96
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,100
Have it say,

97
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,200
"Butchie. Woe to them
that call evil good, and good evil."

98
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,900
Sign it, "Your true and loyal friend,
Proposition Joe."

99
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,600
You ain't thinking no kindly note
gonna slow Omar coming at us.

100
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,200
It's how I feel.
He was a good man.

101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,800
- And Marlo?
- Marlo is Marlo, man.

102
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,500
He weren't the one that
put me in this trick bag.

103
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,700
The motherfucker who snuggled up
and whispered in Marlo's ear did that.

104
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,600
I know what you thinking,
and I ain't making a move against no kin,

105
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,200
not till I got more to go on than words.

106
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,800
And knowing my sister's son the way I do,

107
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,300
if the boy got 50 grand in his pocket,

108
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,800
it ain't gonna be long before it jump out
and find itself in some salesman hand.

109
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,000
And that kind of goody, we know.

110
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,400
In the meantime, if Omar coming
for any of us, he coming for me.

111
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,700
And out of respect
for that man's skill set,

112
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,100
I'm gonna take myself out of the lineup
after the meet tomorrow.

113
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,600
Till this shit sort itself out,
Cheese gonna watch the shop.

114
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
You gonna watch Cheese.

115
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,800
Very clean. Very nice.

116
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,100
But, this is unnecessary.

117
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,900
It was not our intent to mislead.

118
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,500
When I spoke before,
about the condition of your money,

119
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,000
I was talking... in symbols.

120
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,900
The money, it came from the street,

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,200
and so I thought you came...
from the street.

122
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,300
I did.

123
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
I do.

124
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,900
It was not the money that concerned me.
You have been more than generous,

125
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,500
and this is a gift
of an honorable man, clearly.

126
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
But, in accepting such a gift,

127
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,100
we would give you
the wrong impression.

128
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,100
You come from the street?

129
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,400
The street... doesn't concern us.

130
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,300
We know a man here,
and we trust him.

131
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,800
But... to know more people,
to learn more names,

132
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,400
to have them learn our names...

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm not here to badmouth Prop Joe

134
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,100
but people depend on me.

135
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,400
Now, last year, there was a robbery.

136
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm saying, you know,
what if this happens again?

137
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,600
- Where do that put my people?
- That's for you to discuss with Joe.

138
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,500
All I'm asking for
is an insurance policy.

139
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,400
You know, something covers me
and covers you.

140
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,300
And covers Joe.

141
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,000
The young man makes a point.

142
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,600
You're right.
These are volatile times.

143
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,800
It is not unreasonable
to carry insurance.

144
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Who can say what tomorrow will show us?

145
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,400
You go.

146
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,100
Be safe.

147
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,300
Your case.

148
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,200
Oh, y'all came a ways.
Put it to expenses.

149
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,700
If we were to tell him no,
he will still come back.

150
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,000
This he shows us.

151
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,900
But he is not Joe.

152
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,400
He is not Joe.

153
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,800
If I follow this, the senator's mother-in-law
gave him $80,000

154
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
that he used as a down payment
on some property.

155
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,500
Later, he paid the money back,
which makes it a loan.

156
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,600
Which falsifies the loan application.

157
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,300
The moment he signs the application,
he's exposed.

158
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,500
Title 18 of the US Code,
chapter 47, section 10-14,

159
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Loan And Credit Applications.
30 years and not to exceed $1 million.

160
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,400
The US Attorney's office,
call it "the head shot."

161
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,300
30 years for something that every college kid
does with a starter home.

162
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,200
Daddy loans you money to qualify;

163
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
a couple years later, you pay him back.
30 years.

164
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,800
With leverage like that,
this case needs to go federal.

165
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,800
Outstanding work, Detective.

166
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,100
Let me have some time to digest this.

167
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,500
Counselor, a moment?

168
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,300
Is there another way to go at this?
How strong are our theft counts?

169
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,100
Straightforward document cases, four counts.
He stole from his own charities.

170
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,800
We convict, that's ten years per count.

171
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,600
Nothing to sneeze at,
even without the bank charge.

172
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,700
You think it might be OK for me
to sit in on one of your budget meetings?

173
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,900
On our good days.

174
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,800
Ed? This is Scott Templeton.

175
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,200
Scott, good to meet you. Have a seat.

176
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,700
Give me a sec.

177
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,200
Next mouth needs fed
is the Right Reverend Isaac Cason.

178
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,700
Christ! All's I'm trying to do is dump Burrell.

179
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,100
You want us to swallow Rawls,
you'd better grease that morsel up good.

180
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,400
Rawls for 6 months, then Daniels.
What, Daniels isn't black enough for you guys?

181
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,000
They don't know him. They know Burrell,
and they could phone when they needed.

182
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Burrell came in here with bad stats.
He lied to my face.

183
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,400
Rawls lied, too,
but you're making him acting commissioner.

184
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,400
Only till Daniels gets groomed.
We can't fire everyone all at once.

185
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,400
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- Only two more left.

186
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,600
Fine. How can I be of assistance
to the good Reverend Cason?

187
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,000
He has property he wants
to convert to senior housing.

188
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,200
Can we accommodate him?

189
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,800
We're broke, but we could steer
some Hud money his way.

190
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,500
That leaves Reverend Myrtle Smith.

191
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,900
She wants to extend parking
to a vacant lot next to her church.

192
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,900
- It's city property.
- That's it?

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,800
- The last is the least.
- A long-term lease, dollar a year.

194
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,100
Then there's the matter
of Mcculloh Homes.

195
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,900
The same Mcculloh Homes that's adjacent to
Andy Krawczyk's $300 million expansion

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,700
- Of the state office complex.
- Over 500 units.

197
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,700
Public housing.
You'll need that Hope VI money for that.

198
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,300
- Is there any Hope VI money?
- It doesn't matter.

199
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,800
All madam president wants
from us is the green light.

200
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,900
You want him gone, right?

201
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,900
It's good stuff.

202
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,500
Some of your feature work
is a little wrought

203
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,100
for what we do here language-wise,
but it all shows initiative.

204
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,100
That's the style they want from me

205
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,500
but to tell you the truth,
I prefer to write it dry.

206
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
- You've been in Baltimore long?
- Two years.

207
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,800
Before that, I was at
the Kansas City Star for three years,

208
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,600
Wichita Eagle before that.

209
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,400
- The Sun's a fine paper.
- Before the cutbacks, maybe.

210
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,900
Well, they still beat us
often enough in Annapolis

211
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,100
for my Maryland desk
to take them seriously.

212
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,000
You have anything to do with
those ground rent stories last year?

213
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,600
It's good stuff, real good stuff.

214
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,300
You wanted to go to
the page one meeting, right?

215
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,000
Another time, maybe.

216
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,500
Anyway, as he says,
we'll keep the résumé on file.

217
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,600
A few more clips, a little more seasoning,
we'll take another look, OK?

218
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,700
You can just toss that.

219
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,300
That's the plan -

220
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,900
let him cut his teeth
as deputy for operations,

221
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,900
and in six months, make him.

222
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,800
He's not the spic-and-span boy
they think he is.

223
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,300
He came up in the eastern district,
part of a bad drug unit

224
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,200
that was skimming seized drug money.
I had the feds...

225
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,000
This isn't about Daniels.
You came in with bad stats.

226
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,900
For the mayor, that was the last straw.

227
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,100
My numbers were clean, they had gone
through staff review. You tell Carcetti...

228
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,800
Ervin, it doesn't matter now.

229
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,700
You're done. Carcetti has moved on you.

230
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,800
You tell him if he does me like this,
I'll do Daniels.

231
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,700
Kill Daniels, and we end up with Bill Rawls
as police commissioner.

232
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,100
The ministers, the caucus, the council -
they'll live with Daniels. Why?

233
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,500
Because Carcetti gave away
the store just to push you out.

234
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,700
30 pieces of silver each, huh?

235
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,000
We'll have your back. I promise you.

236
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,900
Full pension and a job on the mayor's
criminal justice coordinating council,

237
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,400
and from there,
something down in Washington

238
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,700
with one of the police associations
- Six figures guaranteed.

239
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,200
Go the right way, and attention will be paid.

240
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,000
But you go kicking and screaming,
and no one -

241
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
not the caucus,
not the ministers, not me -

242
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
will be there for you.

243
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Your choice.

244
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,300
Press conference tomorrow.
You play out the string.

245
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,200
Carcetti will do the same.

246
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,500
Attention - all unauthorized vehicles
parked on the loading dock

247
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
are now being towed.

248
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,800
- No one's saying anything?
- I thought you might be able to help.

249
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Not even off the record? He told you.

250
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,300
E-dot deadline's creeping up.
Where are we at?

251
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,900
One source at the courthouse says it's true,
he heard it at the hall.

252
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,300
The mayor's office isn't saying anything,
but there's a press conference tomorrow.

253
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,200
- What about headquarters?
- Daniels had no comment,

254
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,900
- And Rawls won't return my calls.
- Fuck.

255
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,200
Where the hell is Templeton?
He could be throwing calls, too.

256
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,200
My last gift to you, Gus.

257
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,100
Stan? It's Twigg, and I'm on a deadline,
so cut the bullshit.

258
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,700
Don't tell me they're firing the police
commissioner and you don't know.

259
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,400
Don't fucking tell me that.

260
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,100
Lucky I signed off on your ass,

261
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,400
or you'd be on your way
out to boys' village.

262
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,900
And look how you do me.

263
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,200
Not coming around,
not letting me see Bug.

264
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,900
Is that how you pay back a mother?

265
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,200
- How should I pay you back?
- By showing a little respect.

266
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,500
That all?

267
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,000
Truth is, things have been
rough around the way.

268
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,900
With you doing so good, thought maybe
you'd throw some ends my way.

269
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,300
Seeing as how I was here for you.

270
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I ain't paying you
to be my mother.

271
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,200
The pros from downtown are here.
What can I do for you gents?

272
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,700
You got a copy of the shift roster?

273
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,000
- Didn't Oscar get a Realtor's license?
- That would be his day job.

274
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,100
My favorite side partner from
my salad days in patrol. Thank you.

275
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,900
Hard to imagine you in patrol.

276
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,200
- Damn, if I can find it.
- That's why they call it a hole.

277
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,200
That there is the sickest idea yet.
You know that?

278
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,800
I'm just gilding your lily, son.

279
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,000
There. Right there.

280
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,900
Go away! I'm on my lunch break.

281
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,500
Excuse me, officer.
Is this the on-ramp to 95?

282
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,000
Socks.

283
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,700
I'll be fucked.

284
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,800
This is my partner, Jimmy McNulty.

285
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,000
You look like a man
in the market for a new house.

286
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
Think about it. It's a buyer's market.

287
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Nice garden.

288
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,500
You have an eye for quality, Socks.

289
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,200
Call me if you decide to move.

290
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,200
- So this isn't a social call?
- I wish it were.

291
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,900
Well, get on with it.
I got a busy day tomorrow, I need my rest.

292
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,800
Oscar, we're in need of a body -

293
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,600
male, homeless, little or no decomp.

294
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,800
Unattended death?

295
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,600
That shouldn't be no problem,
seeing as you homicide.

296
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,300
We need to get to it
before anybody else sees.

297
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,600
You want to open an H-file?

298
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,500
Well, that's got to be a first.

299
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
How do I reach you?

300
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,400
All right.

301
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
You want to know why?

302
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,300
Is that it?

303
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,600
- If he backs up on us...
- McQuayle was in homicide.

304
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,000
He caught one - a botched kidnapping.

305
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,200
He gets there, finds the area chief
sightseeing his scene,

306
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,100
asks him to back off, cites the G.O.

307
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,900
G-3, "Authority and responsibility
to coordinate the investigation

308
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,100
"shall rest with the homicide detective."

309
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,300
Area chief takes umbrage.

310
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,700
Oscar stands his ground,
and there's quite a dust-up.

311
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,100
The next morning,
he's told he's insubordinate.

312
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,200
He's got to work two weeks
extra duty pounding pavement.

313
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,200
He told them to go fuck themselves,

314
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,800
he'll take the trial board.

315
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,700
Well, he eats two weeks,

316
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
and they shitcan him out the unit.

317
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,500
Area chief?

318
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Name of Rawls, as I remember it.

319
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,500
How you still alive, yo?

320
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,700
They needed to send a message.
Tell him.

321
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,600
Said, "Tell Omar he put
his hand in the wrong pocket."

322
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,000
You need to know, Marlo dogs,
they didn't let Butchie go easy.

323
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,600
I'm gonna work them.
Sweet Jesus, I'm gonna work them.

324
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,200
- I want in.
- Nah, this one on me, yo.

325
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,400
But you don't know them people.

326
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,300
As expected, it's Rawls,
with Daniels waiting in the wings.

327
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,900
Did they not know that
I made myself a candidate?

328
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,600
- I feel dissed.
- So Rawls finally has his day.

329
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,900
Not much more than a day it shall be.

330
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,900
- Daniels by year's end.
- Look at this.

331
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,000
- You're not even gonna read it?
- All you do is change the date.

332
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,100
- I'm covering my ass, Jay.
- Consider it covered.

333
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,900
Motherfucker, I am the primary
on 22 bodies more than a year old,

334
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,600
and I still haven't got
trace analysis on 14 scenes.

335
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
The lab can't keep up
with this year's cases.

336
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,700
You want action, show me some traction.

337
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,300
Or buy yourself a chemistry set.

338
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Just doing background on my vics,
looking for a common thread.

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,900
Motherfucker, don't even...

340
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,300
Fuck you, too, motherfucker.

341
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,200
What's wrong with Bunk?

342
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Hard to say. Beneath that gruff veneer,
he's actually very emotional.

343
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,100
Looking for the theme in your homeless case?

344
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Well, wish me luck.

345
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,700
I'm gonna try for an interview with my only wit.

346
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,100
The home invasion?

347
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,300
Fuck him, Tony, the guy was an asshole.

348
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,600
You know who you were beating on
yesterday? You fucking know?

349
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,500
A teacher, from Stuart Hill Elementary,

350
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,400
trying to get around our bullshit
to an after-school program.

351
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,800
- He should have said so.
- He never got a chance.

352
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,800
Boy, I seen some stupid shit
in my day,

353
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,400
but even by western standards,
this rates a whole new category.

354
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
I.I.D. is talking to the major.

355
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,500
They're gonna be looking for statements
in 10 minutes.

356
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Tony, you got to write this smart.

357
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,900
The excessive horn blowing distracted
you from securing juvenile prisoners who...

358
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,800
became volatile due to the noise,

359
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,300
and you warned the driver several times...

360
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Fuck that motherfucker.

361
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,800
- Say what?
- I said, fuck him.

362
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Shitbird lays on his horn.
Fuck his ignorant ass.

363
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,500
Admin lieutenant to the major's office.

364
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,000
Tony, I'm writing you up.
Excessive force, conduct unbecoming.

365
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,500
- You ain't gonna back me?
- I'm charging you.

366
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,400
You charge me, you're a fucking rat.

367
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,300
Then I'm a rat.

368
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,300
No. After what I've been through
to toss him out of the plane,

369
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,400
now you want me to pretty up his parachute?

370
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,400
The commissioner served this city for 34 years.

371
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,700
Any five of which would be enough
to have him indicted.

372
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,700
You should have thought about this
before you put a gun to my head

373
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,100
and snatched up the Mcculloh Homes
for whatever developer you're hiding.

374
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,100
This isn't about me,
and it isn't even about Burrell.

375
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,400
It's about Daniels or whoever else
you want in that department.

376
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,900
- How so?
- 34 years is a long time.

377
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,300
Anyone around that long can put
his hands on a lot of dirt. If they talk...

378
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,100
- Daniels?
- I'm not being specific here.

379
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,400
I'm just making it clear for everyone's sake

380
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,600
it would be better if Burrell went quietly.

381
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,900
We've scheduled a press
conference for this afternoon.

382
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,700
I think Ervin is ready
for a little grip and grin.

383
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,700
With you, with Rawls...

384
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,700
For considerations,
he might even put his arm around Daniels.

385
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,700
Money from a donor to West Side Hoops.

386
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,700
Deposit date.

387
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,200
Withdrawal from that account
to his personal account.

388
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Again... money from a donor.

389
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,700
Thank you for coming, senator.

390
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,800
We've asked you in to answer questions

391
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,600
regarding certain financial irregularities.

392
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,700
We can go to my office and talk first
or get right to it.

393
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,900
Lead on.

394
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,000
If you'll follow me, then.

395
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
He's pretty cool about it.

396
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,000
The coming out tells the tale.

397
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
Devon?

398
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Do you know this story?

399
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,300
Or would you like me to read it to you?

400
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,500
Devon?

401
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,700
Devon?

402
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,600
Now, then, I show you a canceled check
dated 22 January, 2007,

403
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,100
from Sterner, Ernst,
and Bauer Development Group

404
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,000
made payable to
West Baltimore Hoops Incorporated

405
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,100
in the amount of $11,000.

406
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,000
And this dated 23 January, 2007,

407
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,800
a check drawn on the West Baltimore
Hoops Incorporated account

408
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,300
in the amount of $11,000.

409
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,900
And a deposit slip
dated 23 January, same year,

410
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,900
to your personal account
in the amount of $11,000.

411
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,000
I come here to help,
but y'all out for blood.

412
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,600
I'm not answering no more questions.

413
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,400
You are invoking your right
against self-incrimination, sir?

414
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,400
- Damn right.
- Then we'll conclude this testimony.

415
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,300
Damn.

416
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,200
And that was just a love tap.

417
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,200
Imagine if we hit the good senator
with the whole shebang.

418
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,300
Quick on the fifth, huh?

419
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,100
Why did we even grand jury, then?

420
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,600
The answer to that, detective,
is out on Calvert Street.

421
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,800
Senator, we'd like to talk to you.

422
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,000
Senator, please, over here.

423
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,900
Senator, would you care
to make a statement?

424
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,600
- Senator, please, senator!
- Over here, senator.

425
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,700
Did you appear before the grand jury?

426
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,700
Jane, I insisted that I be called.

427
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,800
Senator, aren't you the target of
an investigation into theft and fraud?

428
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,400
No, pardon, no. Some people
are confused about some things.

429
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,100
But that's why I came here,
to set them straight.

430
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,800
Happy to do it, too.
Happy to avail myself of the...

431
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,800
Grand jury's supposed to be secret.
Who called the reporters?

432
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,500
Mr. Bond, our state's attorney...

433
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,300
Laying claim to the senator
before anybody else can.

434
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,200
There just seemed to be
a little bit of a misunderstanding

435
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,400
about my dealings
here in the community.

436
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,400
Yo, as soon as this newspaper
stink get off my ass,

437
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,100
I'm-a unload my club and clear a mil.

438
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,900
I'm gonna snatch up every vacant
I can get my fingers on.

439
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,700
There you go. Like a real player.

440
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,300
It's a whole new world, man.
Buy some property.

441
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Hold onto it till white people show up,
you make a killing.

442
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,000
Milton's into that, except he got a deal
with that bullshit prisoner entry program.

443
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,600
- Got convicts fixing up his house.
- Motherfuckers...

444
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,000
shut the fuck up.

445
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,200
I'm sick of listening to your shit.

446
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,100
Have we got business?
If we ain't, we gonna bounce.

447
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,400
Marlo here seems pressed for time.

448
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,800
So y'all can pick back up
on this after the meeting.

449
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,700
Last up. We got Hungry Man.

450
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,100
Junior here took it upon himself
to make unlawful incursions

451
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,800
into county territory marked for my people.

452
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,500
Incursions?
Ain't you the articulate motherfucker?

453
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,200
Keep talking, you gonna get spanked.

454
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Like you got the heart.
Motherfucker piss like a bitch.

455
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,500
All right, shut it down.

456
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,700
Last I look,
you wasn't no charter member.

457
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,700
I apologize.

458
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,400
My nephew gonna heed the boundaries,
I assure you.

459
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,400
A'ight, meeting's adjourned.

460
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,600
What the fuck up in here?

461
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
- Just like I told you, right?
- Yeah.

462
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,300
I pulled some of it out,
brought it back home.

463
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,000
I was...

464
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,900
I was thinking...

465
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,800
what next with this?

466
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:52,800
You clear some time tomorrow,
I'll open the door for you. That work?

467
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,800
Son...

468
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,900
you need to focus a bit more on
what can be gained by working with people.

469
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,400
That's just a thought, now.

470
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,100
Yeah.

471
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,800
Thanks.

472
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,300
Come to see a dead man walking?

473
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
I hear Carcetti's
gonna do right by you.

474
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,100
Salary with the coordinating council,
then a D.C. Job.

475
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,100
- You deserve it.
- Sure, I deserve it,

476
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,800
but not for doing the job.

477
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,600
What I got, they gave me
for carrying their water all these years.

478
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
To Carcetti, I'm a hack.

479
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Royce was no different.

480
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,000
Maybe I am. But every day
they send over a new priority.

481
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,900
Go after the bad guys.
No, change that.

482
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,100
Make quality-of-life cases.
Get on top of the murders.

483
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,800
On second thought,
run the whores out of Patterson Park.

484
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,400
You think the mayor
tells the schools how to teach kids,

485
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,400
or the health department how to do its job,
or sanitation how to pick up trash?

486
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,200
But get elected, and suddenly,
they know police work.

487
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,300
You might think it'll be different...

488
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,300
when you sit here...

489
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,100
but it won't.

490
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,100
You will eat their shit.

491
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,300
Daniels, too, when he gets here.

492
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,400
I wonder how you get the ladder to go up.

493
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
How do you do that?

494
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,300
This is a wonderful fire truck.

495
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,600
I wonder where all the firemen are.

496
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Think they could fit in here?

497
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,500
I wonder what kind
of siren sound this makes.

498
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Cheryl, hey.

499
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,900
I was thinking I might want
to swing by and see Elijah, you know?

500
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,800
Yeah, I know it's been a while. But...

501
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,100
No, I can get off.

502
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Yeah, tomorrow'd be fine.

503
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,900
Yeah. Sure.

504
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,000
I'll be right back.

505
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,100
- I'm sorry. I just don't think...
- No, it's OK.

506
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,100
Right now, he's too withdrawn
to revisit the event.

507
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,600
How do you come back
from something like that?

508
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,900
You look nervous, Deputy.

509
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,500
I swear I didn't ask for this.

510
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,200
Relax.

511
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,200
You once told me that if I was gonna do you,
you'd be done already. Remember?

512
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,100
Shit, I don't even remember
what was in that file.

513
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,400
Something about the eastern district.

514
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,200
So long ago,

515
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,900
who can remember?

516
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,700
I wanted to say a few words
about public service

517
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,300
and about Ervin H. Burrell.

518
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,500
During my time on the city council,
Erv was no stranger to me.

519
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,300
I chaired the public safety subcommittee,
and I called upon him many times.

520
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,600
We worked closely and when I became mayor,
we formed a strong relationship...

521
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,500
He feared and hated me,
and I merely wanted him dead.

522
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,400
...making Baltimore a safer city.

523
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,500
Don't stray from the inner harbor.

524
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,300
The criminal justice coordinating council
needs new leadership...

525
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,600
It took a while, but I finally
put his ass out to pasture.

526
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,000
If you would. Thank you.

527
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,300
Plaques for hacks.

528
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Prerogative of any big-city mayor.

529
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,500
How much of that insight and analysis
can we get in tomorrow's story?

530
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,400
Little to none.

531
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,500
Twigg could work the department sources,

532
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
and they would shit all over
a dog-and-pony show like that.

533
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,000
What about Price at the hall?

534
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,500
Mayor's office set up the press conference.
They're not gonna tell the truth.

535
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,100
No, a veteran in the cop shop
gets us over on a story like this,

536
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,700
and fuck if we didn't buy ours out.

537
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,000
Gus, I understand that
you're disappointed with the cutbacks,

538
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,800
but civility is important.

539
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,500
I've been meaning to talk to you
about your profanity.

540
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,900
My profanity?

541
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,400
A collegial atmosphere is essential.

542
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,300
Collegial?
I fucking failed out of journalism school.

543
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,200
- What the fuck do "collegial" mean?
- Christ, we don't have this?

544
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,800
Prosecutors would not comment on
a possible grand jury investigation,

545
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,500
but sources familiar with the case say
the senator has been under investigation

546
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,300
- For more than a year.
- Zorzi!

547
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,100
Assistant state's attorney Rhonda Pearlman...

548
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
Clay Davis was grand-juried today.

549
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,300
He's been under investigation for a year.

550
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
I'm a federal court reporter, remember?

551
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,000
We haven't had daily city court coverage
since Doug Strock took the buyout before last.

552
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,700
- This isn't a federal probe?
- I would have had that. This is city.

553
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,500
You want one reporter
covering two courthouses, fine.

554
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,800
Why not shove the broom up my ass,
and I'll sweep the floor while I'm at it.

555
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,400
All right. Just get caught up, OK?

556
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,500
See if you can get a quote from Davis.

557
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,100
Scott, chase a courthouse story with Zorzi.

558
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,400
- What do you need?
- Find the state's attorney.

559
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,600
He set up Clay Davis
outside the grand jury today.

560
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,100
Get hold of Bond,
he'll catch us up on this shit.

561
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
Jesus.

562
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,500
Remember the good old days
when nobody would stage a perp walk

563
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,900
without calling a daily newspaper?

564
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,400
Nowadays, all they care about
is a goddamn video.

565
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,400
- They've forgotten.
- I don't know why we're doing this.

566
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,700
I can write a report
like this in my sleep.

567
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,700
There's no way
Jay checks what I'm doing.

568
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,300
Jimmy, a lot rides on this.

569
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,100
Work it like a real case,
it'll feel like a real case,

570
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,000
and more importantly,
it'll read like a real case.

571
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
I was in the squad room today,

572
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
all the case work laid out
like I'm lost in a career case.

573
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,600
- Landsman barely noticed.
- We crank this up,

574
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,000
Landsman's not the only one who's gonna
be thumbing through this H-file.

575
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,500
We get sloppy, we get cuffed.

576
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,600
What do you want me to do?

577
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,600
What detectives do, detective.

578
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,200
Can I talk to you for a second?

579
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,000
Maybe later.
I got to get ready for work.

580
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,900
- Does your dog bite?
- Got teeth, don't he?

581
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,500
Chip change,
get your ass in here. That's it.

582
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,600
I'm Detective McNulty, Homicide.

583
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,900
Can I ask you a few questions?

584
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,800
Got a card?

585
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,200
You got a card?

586
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
- Card?
- Business card, yeah.

587
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,700
This... That is a card.

588
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,700
No!

589
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,600
We having fun yet?

590
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,900
I need a drink.

591
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,600
I'm gonna ask you once, where Joe?

592
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,900
Skip past the talking.

593
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,500
Do what you feel.

594
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,700
Joe ain't had nothing to do with...

595
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,500
Now, Slim, you gonna
make me hurt you, yo.

596
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,600
Ask yourself, dog,
why would Joe give Butchie up?

597
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,200
If Marlo could make him talk,

598
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,700
he puts Joe inside your big score.

599
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,000
If Joe turned Butchie, I'd tell you.

600
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,300
Shit, I help you, even.

601
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,200
But it just ain't like that.

602
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,800
Come on, yo.

603
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,400
Finish it.

604
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,200
Take a look at the fifth graph.

605
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,700
"The mayor, comma, incensed by
the commissioner's performance..."

606
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,800
- "Incensed" seems over the top.
- I don't know.

607
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,200
Drug legalization fiasco,
the bodies in the vacants,

608
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,900
the bullshit stats. I'd be incensed.

609
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,200
Jay, take a look at Arnold's fifth graph.

610
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,900
OK.

611
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,000
"Incensed" is to inflame with wrath.

612
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,600
It speaks to obsession.
Is this the mayor's state of mind?

613
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,700
Something more nuanced, perhaps.

614
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,700
Galled, vexed, annoyed...

615
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,900
Safer still... displeased.

616
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,200
You'd take the crab out of crab soup.

617
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,100
Hey, Scott, that was good work
by you and Zorzi catching us up.

618
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,000
- Great effort.
- There's an "attaboy" for you.

619
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,600
How'd it go in Washington?

620
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,600
Buyer's market out there.

621
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,000
Metro desk.

622
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,900
Baltimore Sun ain't so bad.

623
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,600
9-Adam-4-3.

624
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,100
43.

625
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,100
Reported D.O.A., alley in the rear
of the old Compton plant.

626
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,800
Copy D.O.A.

627
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
9-46. K-G-A,

628
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,000
Advise 43 I'm close by. I'll handle it.

629
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,000
Copy, 9-Adam-46.

630
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Bunk, are you feeling all right?
She said "D.O.A.," not "doughnut."

631
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,900
I know y'all into keeping
things on the hush-hush tip,

632
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,500
but, damn, Chris,
this CIA shit off the hook.

633
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,200
I...

634
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,300
I ain't done nothing lately
to piss you off, right?

635
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,900
Right?

636
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Man already shit hisself,

637
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,800
and we ain't even get started yet.

638
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,500
He's funky, yo.

639
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,300
It's a gift from Marlo.
But you know how that go.

640
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,800
Give a gift, get a gift.

641
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,500
Yo, Hungry Man, what's up?

642
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,100
- Hello?
- Lester, you can turn around.

643
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,100
- Bad call?
- Yeah, false alarm.

644
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,200
All right.

645
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,100
Won't work. He's too far gone.

646
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,500
I find them, detective.
What you do after that is your business.

647
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,700
Thanks. Maybe next time.

648
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,700
Seeing as how
I'm doing you a favor, detective,

649
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,500
you can write the first
officer's report for me.

650
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,800
My sequence is A-1-15.

651
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,400
I know him. Avon's lawyer.

652
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,200
Yeah, mine, too. Brick uses him.

653
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,700
So does Phil Boy for most of his stuff,
not just the criminal side.

654
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,200
Yeah, Levy excels in putting
our limp-dick money to work.

655
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,800
You want to know what to do
with them bank checks?

656
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,800
This where you need to be.

657
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,500
Joseph, you're looking prosperous.

658
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,500
I get by.

659
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,700
Mr. Stanfield.

660
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,200
Joseph tells me
good things about you.

661
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,700
You ever find that camera?

662
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,700
Cost me the job.

663
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,100
So let's go into the conference room
where we can spread out.

664
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,300
This between you and your attorney.

665
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,100
Carcetti finally dumps Burrell.

666
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,700
Ervin was a year before me at Dunbar.

667
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,500
No shit.

668
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,100
He was in the glee club.

669
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,200
You're killing me. I got to ask.

670
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,300
Stone stupid.

671
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,700
Elijah? Say hi to Aunt Kima.

672
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,000
Anyways, you were right on time with this.

673
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,000
I got a dozen things to get done,

674
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,000
and I got to do them
while working overtime at the station.

675
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,700
- Been busy, huh?
- Yeah. Your boss got fired,

676
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,100
and we've been running ever since.

677
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,600
Bye, Lij.

678
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,000
Go on. We'll be fine.

679
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,000
Wow, that's good.

680
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,100
You staying inside the lines.

681
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,100
Hey, you want to do something?

682
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,000
Go to the park?

683
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,700
Get some ice cream?

684
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,600
What did you say?

685
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
You don't have a house?

686
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,200
What's up with that? A hero needs a house.

687
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,800
Been a long time since I built a house.

688
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,700
Hope I remember how.

689
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,600
Deputy ops.

690
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,300
No, this is Daniels. Cedric Daniels.

691
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,700
He's now in the commissioner's office.

692
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,600
Yes.

693
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,500
He knows he fucked up. He knows this.

694
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,100
He's proud, you know?
He doesn't want to beg.

695
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
It's not about that.

696
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,100
Come on, Carv.

697
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,300
You cannot do one of your own guys.

698
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:19,700
I mean, I know you got rank now,
you're damn near lieutenant, but still...

699
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,900
It ain't about the rank.

700
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I never told you, Herc.

701
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,600
Never said a fucking word.

702
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,500
But when I gave you that kid
to debrief last year?

703
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,200
You were supposed to get him
to Bunk Moreland. Remember?

704
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,600
Yeah. I fucked up. So what?

705
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,300
So it mattered.

706
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,500
What the fuck does this
have to do with Colicchio?

707
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,500
It all matters.
I know we thought it didn't, but...

708
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,900
it does.

709
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,700
So you got to do Colicchio, huh?

710
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,400
Guess you think they had to do me.

711
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,700
Yeah, probably.

712
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
These guys are gonna talk shit
about you for a while.

713
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,400
But fuck 'em, Carv.
You do what needs done.

714
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,000
- I was out on one.
- You worked 8 to 4.

715
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm working a serial killer.
They call me on any suspicious death.

716
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,200
Yeah? Where'd they reach you?

717
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,900
Well, I'm not gonna lie. I... stopped,
had a couple, then I got the call.

718
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,300
I know. I can smell
the Jameson's from here.

719
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,200
Jamie and Listerine, your scent.

720
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,200
Beadie... I'm just...

721
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:34,100
We had something, Jimmy.
You and me, we had something.

722
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,700
When people told me stories about you,
about how you were,

723
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,700
I couldn't believe it. I couldn't see it.

724
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Yeah.

725
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,900
Yeah. 10 minutes.

726
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,800
I got another one. South Baltimore.

727
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,500
- Beadie, I'm chasing a serial killer.
- That's not all you're chasing.

728
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,700
Look, if you don't want to be here...

729
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,000
I got to go.

730
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,900
He changed up.

731
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,400
Marlo's no fool.
He know you be coming at him.

732
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,700
Word is, him and Chris
went to the mattresses,

733
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,700
on the move almost every night.

734
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,100
- Fool enough to kick a sleeping dog.
- That should tell you something.

735
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,600
I got the boy waiting on me,
I ain't go at him straight up.

736
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,700
I go after his people, you feel me?
You hurt enough of them,

737
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,800
that snake gonna stick his head
above that hole.

738
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,900
That one there, you know him?

739
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,400
He's a lieutenant.

740
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,000
We gonna go after him first.

741
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,700
Mark that ride, yo.

742
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,400
Oscar.

743
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500
- Lester.
- Thank you, baby.

744
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,500
- Anytime, man.
- Yeah. All right.

745
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,000
He's perfect. Can't be dead
more than a couple of hours.

746
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,600
Better lose these.

747
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,300
You're a twisted fuck, McNulty.

748
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,300
Defense wounds. Help sell it.

749
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,800
You got nerve calling me twisted.
You came up with the teeth.

750
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,500
You know how these psycho
serial motherfuckers are.

751
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,800
They mature.

752
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
They start simple and crude

753
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,700
and become more and more ornate.
There you go.

754
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,400
Don't tell my mother or my priest
you saw me do this.

755
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,900
Take it to my grave.

756
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,500
- Want me to take that?
- Nah, I got it.

757
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,800
What you see in this hole, man?
All the money you got?

758
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,300
Your great-grandfather,

759
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,600
first colored man to own his own house
in Johnson Square.

760
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,500
That means something,
Something you young'uns lost.

761
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,900
Yeah. Well, we outside
when you ready.

762
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,700
Keep sharp while I'm gone, boy.
Charles say Omar back.

763
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,500
He left Charles standing

764
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,300
but he might feel less inclined
if he get the drop on you or yours.

765
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,400
Ain't got to fret none about Omar.

766
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,200
No need for that.

767
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,400
You ain't come to see me off.

768
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,700
My nephew.

769
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,600
Boy was always a disappointment.

770
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,000
But I treated you like a son.

771
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,200
I wasn't made to play the son.

772
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,100
But my supply - the good dope?

773
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,900
The Greeks, they cool with it.

774
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:34,000
Proposition, then -

775
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I just step out the way.

776
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,900
You never hear from me again.
I just disappear.

777
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Joe, you'd be up into mischief in no time.

778
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,900
Truth is, you wouldn't be able
to change up any more than me.

779
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,400
Close your eyes.

780
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,000
It won't hurt none.

781
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,100
There, now.

782
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,700
Joe, relax.

783
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,700
Breathe easy.
