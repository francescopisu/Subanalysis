1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,900
Now they're online.

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,000
This is masked
as Marlo's cell number?

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,200
How the fuck? How?

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,800
Spoofed to imitate a call stream
like it's a phone-company switch.

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,900
We can put any digits in we want.

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,500
Meanwhile, phone company
paperwork on the case

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,600
has the cell we gave to Sydnor.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,200
It's fairly basic shit.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,300
Now, stick to the script.

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,400
We don't want any tell-tales.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,700
Even with the voice modulator,

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,100
you're exposed here.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,400
Seven-Baker-14.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,700
BGA. Go ahead, 14.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,500
14. I got a vehicle blocking an entrance.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,700
400 Pressman.

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,200
What the...

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Shit.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Templeton.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,200
Hey, you...

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,700
Where do you get off,
you sick little twist?

22
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,000
Sexual? I'm not sexual with them,
I'm not abusive with them.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
How dare you write that in your paper
without knowing nothing about me?

24
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,000
- What?
- Biting's not sex, it's biting.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,700
I'm not sick like that.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,000
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,100
Maybe I should come bite you.

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,900
Would you like that, Scotty?

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,400
I bet you would like that. Am I right?

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,200
You write about me like I'm sick.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,100
You're the sick one, you know that?

32
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,800
Is that why you like me, Scotty?
Is that why?

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,500
Fuck me.

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,600
Yeah, this is Holley,
Baltimore Homicide.

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,700
I need a trap-and-trace on case 08H114.

36
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,600
Cell phone is in use right now.

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,300
I could come bite you,
you tell me how sexual it is.

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,500
OK, hang on.
Who... Where are you?

39
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,200
Here's what's happening now.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,400
You humiliate me like that?

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,300
You mortify me like that
in front of my father?

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
My father's father?

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,300
Listen to me,
smack daddy, crack daddy,

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,400
little baby whack daddy,
here's what's happening.

45
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,200
You ain't never
going to find them anymore.

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
You ain't never gonna
see them no more.

47
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm sending you something right now.
You take a good look at this guy,

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,500
because you ain't never
going to see him no more.

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,200
Hey, OK.

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,300
Don't hang up. Can we...

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,600
Oh, shit. Did you get McNulty?

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,600
- Just his voicemail.
- Oh, Christ.

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
That was... That was him.

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,300
Again!

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,100
Nice Bawlmer accent.

56
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,000
It's my heritage.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,400
...has traced the phone in question
to Pier Five on Pratt Street.

58
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,500
All units respond to that 20
and detain anyone present

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,000
pending the arrival
of a duty officer.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,700
One-Baker-Ten, copy that.
I'm rolling.

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,200
One-Baker-13, I'm almost there.

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,800
KGA to all units.
Be advised that we're looking

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,000
for a 10-30 individual
on a cell phone.

64
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,800
- Anyone on a phone?
- Not that I saw.

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,200
Just people moving through,
it could be anybody.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,900
Let's just fan out and take names.

67
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,200
Go down this road.
Get their names over there.

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,000
Get everybody up in this area now.

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,200
- Stop.
- What the hell is this?

70
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,800
- Hey, let go of me.
- Get your hands up.

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,000
Get on the ground now.
Get your hands up! Step out!

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Get everybody over there
and get their cell phones.

73
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Everyone take out your cell phones
and place them on the table in front of you.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,700
Stop, he didn't do anything.

75
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
What are you doing?

76
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,100
Foxtrot to KGA, I'm your eyeball.

77
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,800
- Sarge, we got him.
- Bullshit.

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,700
- I got him on tape.
- The goof actually called.

79
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,100
Yeah, yeah, it was sweet.

80
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,400
Hey, what'd I miss?

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,600
He went off on a tangent.
Said he wanted to bite me.

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
What? Bite you how?

83
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,200
Scott, are you saying
that he threatened to...

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,100
Wait a minute. Hold on a second.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Holy Christ.

86
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,900
So are we partners or what?

87
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
No, Clay.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,300
I don't pick
so much as a single juror

89
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,000
without the full amount
of my fee being paid.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,100
If you want Billy Murphy
on your case,

91
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,900
you got to pay to put him there.

92
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
I got a taste for you right up front.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
A good, five-figure taste.

94
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,000
But you asking for me to pay
a winner's fee right up front,

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and you know what?
I ain't a winner yet.

96
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,800
Right now, with the sword
hanging over my head,

97
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,500
I don't have the kind of
financial support at my disposal

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,900
that I would ordinarily
be able to rely upon, you feel?

99
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,800
So the money boys
are laying off, huh?

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,300
They thinkin' short when
they should be thinkin' long.

101
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,500
Shameful shit.

102
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,200
25,000, 25,000 more
when you seat a jury.

103
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't work that way.

104
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,600
I know you don't, partner,
I know you don't.

105
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,100
And normally I wouldn't dream
of asking you to suit up for game day

106
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,800
with my tab as it is.

107
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
200,000 when I get you out
from under this mess.

108
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,600
And, Clay, don't fuck me.

109
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,300
Don't even think about
fucking me out of a single part of that fee.

110
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,300
Oh, Billy, you talk
as if you don't know me.

111
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,100
I'm disappointed. I am.

112
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,700
My brother, let's be fair.

113
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,900
I'm providing you with the opportunity

114
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,400
to go head-to-head
with the state's attorney

115
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,300
in a case that's gonna be
front-page news.

116
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,000
For all that profile?

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,800
Shit, partner,
you should be payin' me a fee.

118
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Seriously, dawg, for 20,000 cash
to my campaign committee,

119
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,900
I'll get myself indicted federal,

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,900
let you go to trial on that.

121
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,900
Beat the feds like a stepchild,
an' really make a name for yourself.

122
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Fuck you?

123
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Naw, son, I'm gonna make you.

124
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Motherfuckers gonna be
wipin' they ass

125
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,100
with Johnnie Cochran's memory,
and carryin' your business card

126
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
in every damn pocket
before we done.

127
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,300
No.

128
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,800
I already got more rep
than any lawyer would ever need.

129
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,200
Why don't you save
that silver-tongued bullshit for the jury?

130
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Right.

131
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,700
No, nothing since.

132
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
All right.

133
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,400
Me, Barlow and Kincaid
been sittin' here

134
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,400
like the fucking Maytag repairmen,
growing piles.

135
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
Nothing, not a call. Then, bang.

136
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,500
No luck at the harbor.

137
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,300
We were tracking the GPS
then it just goes dead. Area of Pier Five.

138
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,700
- Where's McNulty?
- Over at the newspaper.

139
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,800
Let's hear that motherfucker again.

140
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Hey, you, where do you get off,
you sick little twist?

141
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,000
Sounds like some gearhead from Dundalk.

142
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,400
And emotionally, how was he?

143
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,300
- He sounded pissed.
- At you, personally?

144
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,200
Like I told you,
he said I humiliated him

145
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,500
by writing that the biting was sexual.

146
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,100
At the end, he offered
to come here and bite me.

147
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,100
- I didn't really respond to that.
- OK.

148
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,900
- Did he sound like the same guy?
- What do you mean?

149
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,400
Did it sound like the voice you heard
on the first call?

150
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Oh, right. Yeah.

151
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,700
No, actually.

152
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,500
Well, yeah. I mean, yeah.

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,300
It was the same,
but this time I noticed

154
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,900
he had a real thick Bawlmer accent.
Real thick.

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,100
- You didn't notice that the first time?
- I guess I did, but I forgot.

156
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,100
- Did I screw up in any way?
- No. Not at all.

157
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,000
Listen, we reserve the right
to make this decision,

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,200
but that said,
would running these photos

159
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,300
in any way impair the investigation?

160
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,300
I don't think so. Fact is,
we need as many eyes as we can

161
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,900
looking for this homeless guy.

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,900
You don't know where this guy is?
He could be...

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,700
- Could already be a victim, sure.
- Jesus.

164
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,000
That's Charles and Conway.
I wonder if he's a regular out there.

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,700
He had to have used
a different phone.

166
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,300
Had to have been a cell phone
if he sent you these.

167
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,600
That's true. But, again,
you can't print anything

168
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,900
about where he's calling from.
We're trying to get up on that cell phone.

169
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,600
What should I do if he calls again?

170
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,700
Keep him on the line
as long as you can. Don't spook him.

171
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,900
Guy likes to rant.
Let him do his thing.

172
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,500
- You OK?
- Me? Yeah, I guess.

173
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
I wouldn't worry.
He's just using you. He needs you.

174
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,800
I kind of resent that, actually.

175
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,400
Oh, I dunno.

176
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,700
It's workin' out pretty well
for both of you, right?

177
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,500
Gentlemen, thanks for these.

178
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,500
Callin' Vincent on his cell all morning,
he still ain't answer.

179
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,300
Ain't got time for this.
Re-up time will come due,

180
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,900
we still ain't picked up the mannitol.

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,500
What the fuck?

182
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,400
Yo, Vincent.

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Where you at?

184
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,400
Manny? Manny?

185
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,500
Shit.

186
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,000
- Omar.
- Why you still alive, then?

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,100
He say tell Marlo
he out in the streets, waitin'.

188
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,800
Say this whole damn city gonna know

189
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,100
Marlo ain't man enough
to come down in the streets.

190
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,900
- He get the stash?
- Yo, Cherry.

191
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,100
He blew Manny up
as soon as he got inside.

192
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,700
- He was gonna do me too.
- How the fuck he get inside?

193
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,700
Manny open up
to go on the food run,

194
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
and this dicksucker was right there.

195
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,800
He knew we was the stash.

196
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,200
Ain't need to be told shit.

197
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
He just knew.

198
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,600
Four K of raw, flushed.

199
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,800
Hey, yo, Cherry.
You gonna untie me, right?

200
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,500
Come on, nigga, untie me.

201
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,300
Seriously, Steven.

202
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,900
If you can't afford it,
that's fine, I understand.

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,800
If you think this clown
is gonna hold me off

204
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,300
and keep the statehouse,
I know you've got to hedge your bets

205
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,000
given how much you're
waiting on from Annapolis.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,300
But if you're gonna choose a side,
do it early. That's all I'm saying.

207
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,700
I hear ya, Tom.

208
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,900
I'm going to write out a check today,
and send it out the door.

209
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,900
That's great, Steven.
Really, I do appreciate it.

210
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,100
Can you...
Can I ask you to consider...

211
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,300
I'll double down on that for my wife too.

212
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,100
For your wife too?

213
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,100
That's just great, really.

214
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
Yeah, thanks for going
the extra mile on this.

215
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,900
No problem.

216
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,400
Photographs?

217
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,000
He messaged digital photos
of the possible victim

218
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,800
to the Sun reporter.
I canvassed this guy's regular corner,

219
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
he has indeed been missing
a couple of days.

220
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,300
We got these photos from the newspaper,

221
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,800
but we want to be able to
intercept any future images.

222
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,600
- Hence the amended order.
- Correct.

223
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,900
Can we catch photos
with our city equipment?

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Actually, no. We're still bumping around
in the 20th century.

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,700
But Howard County
has the right software

226
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,500
- On a couple of their computers.
- You need two?

227
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,000
If one computer goes down,
we got the other one as backup.

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,400
We don't wanna miss our shot at this nut.

229
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,400
Well, good hunting.

230
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Thank you, Judge.

231
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,300
Ronnie.

232
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,500
You briefed your boss?

233
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,400
And he's calling the mayor, right?

234
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,200
And Rawls too, I imagine.

235
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Pretty little fella gets himself elected

236
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
on a law-and-order ticket.
Crime doesn't go down much,

237
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,800
and a couple weeks before he starts
gearing up to announce for governor,

238
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,700
some wingnut starts killing people,

239
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,000
taking photographs,
sending 'em to the newspaper.

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You know something?
You may wanna check the governor's alibi.

241
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
You know?

242
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,800
Thanks.

243
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,500
You couldn't make 30?

244
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
20?

245
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
92.

246
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm gonna tell you something.

247
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,900
A lot of people want Tommy Carcetti
to be their fuckin' governor.

248
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,700
And I can't imagine
what they're thinking.

249
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,700
92, Norman, in a single morning.
It is a new record.

250
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,000
The motherfucker killing homeless guys?
He grabbed one off the street,

251
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,400
wrapped a ribbon on his wrist,
sent a photo to the Baltimore Sun,

252
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
- Saying we won't find the body.
- He what?

253
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,100
The newspaper's
gonna run the photos.

254
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,600
Bill Rawls.
I need him on the line now.

255
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,500
You rascal, you

256
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,100
I'll be glad when you're dead,
you rascal, you

257
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Look at you,
you baby-bumpin' motherfucker.

258
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,100
Look at you.

259
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,800
Let's go.
Deputy wants as much of my squad

260
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
as I can wrangle upstairs right now.

261
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,000
We're going large Richard
on McNulty's serial killer.

262
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm working my cases.

263
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,500
Bunk, command performance.

264
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,700
The deputy wants bodies.
The mayor's spewing over this thing.

265
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm not going.

266
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,800
What? You don't see those
on my sleeve?

267
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,200
- Plain as fuckin' day, Bunk.
- I'm doing police work here.

268
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,200
In fact, I have a fresh angle
on last year's major case,

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,100
on which I'm the sole
remaining investigator.

270
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,800
So fuck your stripes
and fuck McNulty,

271
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
and fuck your big-dick redball.

272
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,300
If you can't work with that,
just write me the fuck up,

273
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,500
and ship my ass to a trial board.

274
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,900
So, Alma stays with the investigation
and detectives downtown.

275
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,900
Don't go home without checking for updates
before the e-dot and double-dot editions.

276
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,500
So the case file is McNulty,

277
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,900
with the rest of his squad
as immediate support.

278
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,400
Lieutenant D'Addario's shift
will man the wiretap.

279
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,300
In addition to Alma and Scott,
Olesker will have a column coming.

280
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,100
Fletcher, I want you on homeless react,
also interviews with advocates and experts.

281
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,600
Melody, you get on the phone

282
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,500
with the whitecoats at
Clifton T. Perkins or wherever,

283
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,900
and work up a sidebar on what it means
when a whackjob kills somebody

284
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,100
and talks to reporters about it.

285
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Greggs, I've been
scanning the casework.

286
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,300
While there have been numerous
field interviews and canvasses,

287
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,000
we haven't done much
with background work on victims and families.

288
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,400
If you could take charge of that.

289
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,000
Colonel Tomlin,

290
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,600
we'll need Tactical
to provide surveillance cars

291
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,700
and undercover decoys
where the homeless gather.

292
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,200
We need to be
in the street, proactive.

293
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,400
This case is as much about
preventing another abduction or murder

294
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,100
as it is about making an arrest.

295
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
We can't work this one with the phone.

296
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,100
We need to be in the street,
at eye level.

297
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,400
We need to keep the media
as part of the equation.

298
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,200
This reporter that's been contacted,
he's in the middle of it.

299
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,200
That may be a way to solve this thing.

300
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,600
You're in the middle of this now,

301
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,000
so while we're presenting this
as a first-person piece

302
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,700
on your latest contact with the killer,

303
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,900
Alma's going to interview
you for the mainbar.

304
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,600
McNulty's preliminary
checks with shelter workers,

305
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,400
and a canvass of Conway and Charles,
indicates that our victim is indeed missing,

306
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,800
but when we get a full ID,

307
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,900
we need to run every connection
to make sure this isn't a hoax.

308
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,300
Chief, we need to
pull bodies from District Ops

309
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,200
to give Homicide
their own surveillance arm.

310
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,400
And having had some experience
in the politics of staffing,

311
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,600
I leave it to McNulty
to pick the people.

312
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,300
For once, people, I am assured

313
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,200
that the resources we need
to work this story will be there for us.

314
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,500
So let's surround this mess
and report the hell out of it.

315
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,700
This one's got legs.

316
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
I am now told,
by the mayor directly,

317
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,200
that there will be no overtime restrictions,
no staffing limits on this case.

318
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,000
So put this case down.

319
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,800
Police work. What do you know?

320
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,500
Good day. Six G-packs so far.

321
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,900
New package be
droppin' them fiends.

322
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,700
Yeah.

323
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Probably need one more re-up.

324
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,500
Rare day on the corner, huh?

325
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
Step off, nigga.

326
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,900
Hey, Mike, check this out.

327
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
"Certified hydrotherapist,

328
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,800
"experience with geriatric patients,
Sinai Hospital outpatient clinic."

329
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Jerry who?

330
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,000
Whatever, how about this -
"Dental front desk,

331
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,300
"high-quality dental office
seeks front desk."

332
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,900
- Like furniture?
- Like a secretary, I guess.

333
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
Man, you ain't even
ever been to no dentist.

334
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,300
"HVAC maintenance supervisor."

335
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,700
What the fuck is a huhvac?

336
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,500
"H-V-A-C."
Maybe they spelled it bad.

337
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,500
"Systems manager in
a deadline-driven environment."

338
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,800
Man, ain't nothing there.

339
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,300
Even if there was, you ain't 16,
and y'all got to pick up Bug after three.

340
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Hey, hang on, hang on.

341
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,300
"Exotic dancer, downtown financial district
lunchtime hours.

342
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,500
"Must be flexible in body and mind."

343
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,200
Now we talking.

344
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Hey, make it rain on 'em.
Make it rain.

345
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,200
Hold up.

346
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,400
Time out.

347
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,100
Fuck did I do?

348
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,000
If we don't know, then you do.

349
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is bullshit.

350
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,700
Yo, don't forget about Bug.

351
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,000
As this is an ongoing investigation,
I'll ask that you direct questions

352
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,800
to the police officials
best equipped to answer.

353
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,100
These new developments in
the case of the homeless slayings in our city

354
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,000
are troubling and tragic
and unacceptable.

355
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,700
We are doing everything possible
to locate and identify the individual

356
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,500
depicted in the photographs sent
to the Baltimore Sun today.

357
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,700
We are endeavoring to protect
other homeless citizens,

358
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,200
and we are pursuing the suspect
with every means at our disposal.

359
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,700
I have made clear
to my police commanders

360
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,500
that they have my full confidence

361
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,100
and the authority to employ
whatever resources they require.

362
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,200
And let me be unequivocal.

363
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,100
This man will be brought to justice.
Thank you.

364
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,900
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!

365
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,000
Voice and digital photos.

366
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,500
He calls again,
you'll capture either one.

367
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,200
I can do these background checks
myself, Jay.

368
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,600
You heard the deputy.
He specifically assigned Greggs.

369
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,200
Greggs has an open triple.

370
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,900
And this squad has your serial killer.
The case is shit-hot.

371
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,000
Jay, I don't need...

372
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,500
You are the point man
on the motherfucker who's missing.

373
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
You don't have time to work
on the older cases.

374
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,800
It goes to Greggs,
end of fucking story.

375
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Now... what else do you need?

376
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,700
I'm gonna need those surveillance teams
as this thing sprawls.

377
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,100
For now, let me pull this guy's ID
as fast as I can. Figure what he's about.

378
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,400
- After that, I'll have more to spin off.
- Voice analysis of the call?

379
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Shit, I don't believe in that shit.

380
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,800
Next thing I know, you'll want me to go
to Quantico with this fucking thing.

381
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,100
As a matter of fact...

382
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,100
You don't believe in behavioral
forensics, Dr. Moreland?

383
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't believe in much
of anything at this point.

384
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,700
It doesn't fucking matter
what any of us believe at this point.

385
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,600
You turned on
the fuckin' tap, Jimmy.

386
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,600
They're finally paying
for police work again.

387
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,300
Proud of yourselves?

388
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,500
We're close to Marlo.
A week or two at most.

389
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,800
How does it feel getting
Greggs pulled off her triple?

390
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,900
How does it feel knowing
that you got surveillance teams out there,

391
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and District units, and Tactical,
all of 'em chasin' bullshit.

392
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,500
We're gonna use the surveillance teams.
They'll help us bring in the case.

393
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,300
I don't even want to know
whose picture you got running in the paper,

394
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,800
or where that motherfucker
actually happens to be...

395
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,300
Names and addresses,
whatever you got.

396
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,600
- Jimmy...
- Don't kill yourself.

397
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,000
Shit.

398
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,800
Don't worry, son.
I got you covered on all this.

399
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,500
Listen, one other thing.

400
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm getting my kid for an overnight.

401
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Where do I get kids' furniture?

402
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,200
Ikea.

403
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,700
See y'all.

404
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,600
Shame on y'all.

405
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,500
I mean it.

406
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,900
- Trace lab.
- It's Moreland.

407
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,400
You just called.

408
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,000
I know, and I'm callin' again.

409
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,800
I need the tracework
on 06H271, and I need it now.

410
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,700
I know, he hasn't been around to it yet.

411
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,900
Tell him I called,
and tell him I'm gonna keep calling

412
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,000
until he feels
my fucking pain, all right?

413
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,300
Gift-wrapped.

414
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
Number one.

415
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,200
Fuck.

416
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
How the fuck do they expect me
to get this shit done on my own?

417
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,500
Broke-ass department ain't even payin'.

418
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,800
You OK?

419
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,600
It's fucked up.
It's all fucked up, OK?

420
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,200
I could make a red go to black
'cept for these cheap motherfuckers.

421
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
What do you got?

422
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
Good snitch put the finger on an eyeball wit
been duckin' me.

423
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,500
He lays up at this one girl's place
at Athol Avenue, right?

424
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,100
Comes in late, but he leaves early.

425
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,100
So?

426
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,600
So I don't mind sittin'
on the place all night long an' not get paid.

427
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,600
But it's a garden apartment.
Parking lots on both sides,

428
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,200
and if he decides to park on the street
and walk across the grass,

429
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,800
he still has the fucking patio doors.

430
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,600
Two more men do it?

431
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,700
Yeah, and two more cars, yeah.

432
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,100
I got more bodies
than I can use on my serial thing.

433
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,500
Let me make a call,
hook you up with two Tac guys.

434
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,900
You tell 'em you're sitting
on a 20 that I gave you.

435
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,100
- I'll write up the hours under my file.
- And you can do that?

436
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,100
Go with God.

437
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,700
Can you make out who that is?

438
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,900
Yeah.

439
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,400
Look at you.

440
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,600
Not even blinking.

441
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,700
Not that I blame you

442
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,400
after what this heinous
motherfucker did to you.

443
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,500
Still, this right here is vicious.

444
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,800
I mean, whoever did this had a real time.

445
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,100
Now you know what I'm saying?

446
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,200
Now, I know it wasn't you,

447
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,200
because with all due respect

448
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,500
you don't have the physicality
to do this kind of damage.

449
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
I mean, whoever did this

450
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,400
had to be a full-grown
and powerful individual -

451
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,300
a fearsome individual.

452
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
You see what I'm sayin'?

453
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,200
You the murder police.
How the fuck would I know?

454
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,500
- Is this spot good for a stand-up?
- Let's go with a wide shot on this.

455
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Goddamn Pulitzers.

456
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,000
Kinda formula, I know.

457
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,000
Anecdotal lead, nut graf, best quote.

458
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,800
It works as a sidebar,
but for tomorrow, let's stretch it some, huh?

459
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,100
Really spend some time with
some of these people, you know?

460
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,600
What I mean is, sometimes,
the weakest stuff in a story

461
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,900
is the shit with
quotation marks around it.

462
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,200
You got a guy telling how rough it is
on the street, it really doesn't have much pull.

463
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,500
But if you can describe him
as he really is, tell his story in moments...

464
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,400
Look, tomorrow,
get back in the shelters and the soup kitchens,

465
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,300
and just be with folk.

466
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't care if you file copy on it.
If something presents itself as a story,

467
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,800
great, but if not, just spend the day
being with people.

468
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,900
I'm not interested in what can be quoted
or counted on this one.

469
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,700
I'm interested in what feels true.

470
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,800
I'm in - 30 inches, with room
for Price's stuff from the hall.

471
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,500
- Scott?
- Five minutes.

472
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,700
- We're coming up on first edition.
- Three minutes.

473
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,400
We had him in that,
what do you call it,

474
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,300
- Rehabilitation.
- Four times.

475
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,800
We're not rich people.

476
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,500
Henry's on disability.

477
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,600
We get him out,
he makes all kinds of promises,

478
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,000
but, well, you know...

479
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,500
I'm sorry.

480
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,900
The last time,

481
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,900
we decided we wouldn't be there for him.

482
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,900
We knew he'd probably die out there,

483
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,300
if the drugs get him, we knew that.

484
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,700
But this thing in the newspaper,
this sex stuff,

485
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,500
the biting or whatever...

486
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Jesus, nobody deserves that.

487
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
You see what I have a problem with, right?

488
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,800
The first-person is one thing.
I know he needs to put himself in the story...

489
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,300
It's essential.

490
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,100
But this business about him being
out there day and night with the homeless,

491
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,700
I mean, this stuff about sharing their
"darkest corners with them,"

492
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,600
He's writing more as an essayist.

493
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,700
We've got a column
from Olesker, front metro.

494
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,600
I mean, it's pretty powerful
without being purple.

495
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,700
But this stuff that Scott's written,

496
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,200
it makes it sound like he's been living
with the homeless for weeks.

497
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
He spends one night under the JFX,

498
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,400
another half-day quoting people
in a homeless shelter.

499
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,900
It ain't exactly Studs Terkel.

500
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
You don't think the piece
should run as it is?

501
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,100
I mean, we have him interviewed about
the call from the killer in Alma's mainbar,

502
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,700
we have his quotes.
But the rest of this stuff,

503
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,400
he's acting like he's
taking his life in his hands,

504
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,700
he walks another highway at night?

505
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,600
I mean, this is our fucking city.
This ain't Beirut.

506
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,400
I respect your concerns.

507
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,100
I'll take the piece
and move it as my own edit. How's that?

508
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,200
OK.

509
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
And while they declined
to talk on camera,

510
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,100
the parents of Jonathan Boland
say they are hopeful

511
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,100
that the renewed attention
to their son's death a few years ago

512
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,100
will lead police to his killer.

513
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,300
For Channel Six News, I'm Cass...

514
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,300
Media's going crazy.

515
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
City Hall too.

516
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,800
But for once, we're getting
what we need to do the job.

517
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,600
- How does it feel?
- Forbidden.

518
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,700
I feel like they're gonna find out how much
we're spending and shut us down.

519
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
You don't have all this in your head yet?

520
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,400
I just want to go over it all again.

521
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,400
We finish voir dire by lunch,
and then it's opening arguments.

522
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,500
- For Mr. Bond. It's on him.
- He needs a strong second.

523
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,200
He needs me to know
this case inside and out.

524
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,500
How much longer, Lester?

525
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,400
If Marlo has a code, we can break the code.
That's a given.

526
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,800
How long?
Depends on the code, doesn't it?

527
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,100
Quicker we bring this in and shut it down,
the safer we'll all be.

528
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,300
Landsman wants me
to go to fucking Quantico,

529
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
let the FBI do a profile.

530
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,900
Might learn something about yourself.

531
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,400
It's not funny, Lester.

532
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,000
This shit's bigger than
I ever thought it would be.

533
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The whole fuckin' city...

534
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,200
Yeah, Jay.

535
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,500
No.

536
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,000
No, I don't need
an academy class

537
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,300
to help with a canvass
near this guy's corners.

538
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,500
Well, I don't need
any additional canvassing.

539
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,600
What? You wanna know why?
I'll tell you why.

540
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,800
Because I already know the name
of the missing smokehound.

541
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,900
Yeah, his name, his DOB, and his last
known address at a city shelter.

542
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,000
Lawrence Butler, 3/10/1951,

543
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,100
400 West Street,
South Baltimore Men's Shelter.

544
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,800
How? Police work.

545
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
When I have more leads, Sergeant,

546
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,800
I'll be able to use the extra manpower
you give me and run this shit down.

547
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,000
But until then, will you back off, Jay?

548
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah, just back the fuck off.

549
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,600
Trouble with making this thing
into a redball?

550
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,100
People start to treat it
like a fucking redball.

551
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,500
Jesus!

552
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,700
Get me out of this, Lester,
as fast as you can.

553
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,100
Senator!

554
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,100
Senator, there have been rumors
of a last-minute plea offer.

555
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
How can I plead to what I didn't do?

556
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,100
What are you reading there, Senator?

557
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,500
This here?

558
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,100
Prometheus Bound, an ancient play,

559
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,000
one of the oldest we have,
about a simple man

560
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,800
who was horrifically punished
by the powers that be

561
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,400
for the terrible crime of trying to bring light
to the common people.

562
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,600
In the words of Aeschylus,
"No good deed goes unpunished."

563
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,300
I cannot tell you how much consolation I find
in these slim pages.

564
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
- One more question, Senator.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

565
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,500
I do believe I have my day in court,
and I will see you inside.

566
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,400
City Hall wants an update.
What do we know about our missing mope?

567
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,800
What else?

568
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,000
Sending a tape of the call
down to Quantico, along with the case file.

569
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,400
They'll review, then meet with us.

570
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,000
You gotta hit every downtown shelter
or mission there is.

571
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,500
- You want bodies for that?
- I'm taking Christeson.

572
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,900
- The rookie?
- Yeah, he'll ask the extra question.

573
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,300
He's hungry. He's...
If I need more bodies, I'll let you know.

574
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,600
Heard what you did with Christeson,

575
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,600
letting him go on his own case, while you
carry him and two surveillance teams.

576
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,900
Your shit is right, Jimmy.

577
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,400
- Thanks.
- So I got another one for ya.

578
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400
You remember
the rape-murder I had? Bolton Hill job?

579
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,100
Brother-in-law of my rapist,
last year wouldn't talk to me,

580
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,500
but now, his wife just got collared,

581
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,400
and if she gets locked up,
his kids go to family services,

582
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,100
so he's desperate to deal.

583
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,200
The problem is,
he's in the New York system -

584
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,400
Elmira, Newburgh, one of those places.

585
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Anyway, I get a road car and expenses,
I can put it down.

586
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,500
Jimmy, he strangled a 20-year-old,
stuffed her under her bed.

587
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,700
OK, give my CC to motor pool.

588
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,900
I'll bury the expenses
and the OT in my file.

589
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,300
Thanks, brother.

590
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,600
Ain't you the little king of diamonds.

591
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,900
Homicide.

592
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,700
Nah, he's on the street right now.
Call back in a couple hours.

593
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,500
On second thought, gonna have Norris with me
on that canvass today, boss.

594
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,500
And with every single transaction
you've described, Detective,

595
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,100
the money was routed through
the senator's personal account

596
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,800
- And then withdrawn as cash.
- Yes, sir.

597
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,800
- Often in the same amounts?
- Often the exact amounts,

598
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,200
sometimes slightly smaller amounts,
but always within a day of the initial deposit.

599
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Thank you, Detective Freamon.

600
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,800
Your honor, no further questions.

601
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Cross-examination, Mr. Murphy.

602
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,700
No questions, your honor.

603
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
- You got a number?
- What?

604
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,300
Number on a slip. If you get a number,
I might could find you a seat.

605
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,300
- It's mac an' cheese today.
- No, I'm a newspaper reporter.

606
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,100
So you got what to eat, then.

607
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,800
Yeah, came down here just to hang out,
and get with some homeless people.

608
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,700
How come whenever y'all be wanting
homeless, y'all come to the soup kitchens?

609
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,100
- You don't serve homeless?
- Serve everybody.

610
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,900
Homeless, poor folks, workin' people
tryin' to make it to a paycheck.

611
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,400
Shit, half the neighborhood be up here
the week before check day.

612
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,800
Hey, you're not...

613
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,300
Homeless?
No, I'm down in my sister's basement,

614
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,500
over at Edmondson Village.

615
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,700
What you need the homeless to say?

616
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Talk about the killings.
The thing going on with the serial killer.

617
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,100
But mostly, I'm just lookin' for a story
about what it's like for them.

618
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
What life is like.

619
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,700
Hard times out here.

620
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,000
I can't imagine.

621
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,600
You gonna write a story
about what life's like, huh?

622
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,200
- Bubbles, man.
- Mike Fletcher.

623
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,800
Sticking for the moment
with the West Baltimore Hoops charity,

624
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,300
what were
your basic responsibilities there?

625
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,300
I can't rightly say.

626
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,500
Yet you drew $40,000 a year
as the executive director.

627
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,900
No. All that money went straight
back to Senator Davis.

628
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,700
What, none for you?

629
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,800
I got paid through the district office
for drivin' him.

630
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,000
That money I kept. An' whenever I would
go out to snatch some money

631
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,400
- For the senator...
- Objection.

632
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,900
...he'd sometimes kick me back a few.
- Move to strike all of that.

633
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,700
Sustained.
Disregard that last comment.

634
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,200
This case is limited to
the charges stemming from

635
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,600
the operation of Senator Davis's
nonprofit charities.

636
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,800
Other matters are not relevant.

637
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,200
Here it is.

638
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,200
What the hell is that?
A meet at 5:50?

639
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm gonna go get up on Monk.

640
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,700
You have a criminal history,
do you not, Mr. Price?

641
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Yeah, I did some years.

642
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,100
And when you last
got out of prison six years ago,

643
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,700
was Senator Davis aware
of your criminal record?

644
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,600
Yes, sir.

645
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,400
And yet he gave you a job,

646
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,400
but today, is this how you repay him?

647
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,600
The testimony you gave
about returning the money you earned

648
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,300
at the senator's charities,

649
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,200
you say you repaid it
to the senator in cash, correct?

650
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,600
Every time.

651
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,800
So there's no proof that the senator
ever received that money.

652
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,100
- Isn't that correct?
- I guess not.

653
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,600
- You guess not.
- I guess not.

654
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,100
Mr. Price, you acknowledged earlier
that in exchange for your testimony,

655
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,400
you received immunity
from prosecution

656
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,200
for any charges related to this case.

657
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,900
Is it fair to say that
testifying against Senator Davis

658
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,400
ensures that you will not
yourself go to jail?

659
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,500
- Goddamn right.
- Mr. Price.

660
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,400
I'm s... Oh, shit, sorry.

661
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,300
- Mr. Price.
- OK, my B, Judge. Sorry.

662
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,600
Mr. Price, do you expect this jury

663
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,800
to take the word
of a twice-convicted felon

664
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,400
over the word of a duly elected member
of the Maryland state senate?

665
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,900
What can I say?

666
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,300
Y'all can play it like you feel
an' leave me be.

667
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,700
I don't get it. He hasn't moved off this spot
for an hour and a half.

668
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,600
All right, well,
come on back, then, all right?

669
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,300
Guy's been hitting the bus shelters
every third or fourth night.

670
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,900
We got two wounded and one dead
going back to that piece since December.

671
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,200
All I'm asking is for hours
to stake this asshole out.

672
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,300
Guy's like clockwork.

673
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,800
Spot me an' Garvey three nights,

674
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,000
and the case is fuckin' down.

675
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,600
- I can give you two nights.
- If he hits on the third?

676
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
- One night.
- OK, OK.

677
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,300
Two nights.

678
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,800
You need to put
my CC number on the OT slips

679
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,300
- And you give those to Jay...
- It's cool. I know the drill.

680
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,100
- You do?
- You're doing good here, boss.

681
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,100
What did you just call me?

682
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,700
- What the hell is that?
- Office reports.

683
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,400
Families of your victims,
debriefed in full.

684
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,500
And believe me, it ruined my week.

685
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,400
- Rough, huh?
- I'm sittin' there explaining

686
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,600
to the salt of the fuckin' earth why their eldest,

687
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,000
who is living on the street because nothing
they did could fix his problems,

688
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,800
but God knows they tried,

689
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,600
why he met his end being bit on
and fucked with by some sick motherfucker

690
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,800
who used him for jerk-off purposes.

691
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,200
How the shit about the bite marks
get in the papers in the first place?

692
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,300
Gotta run. I got shit to assemble.

693
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,700
You didn't tell me that part of it,
did you, motherfucker?

694
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,800
I got one at the corner
of Calhoun and Mosher.

695
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,100
Jesus...

696
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,500
that poor guy.

697
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,300
Wanna take him home with you?

698
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,300
- I mean, shit, take me.
- What?

699
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Just having fun with you, man.

700
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,800
Thanks for bringing me here, man,
showing me around.

701
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,700
Nah. Not about that.

702
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,600
Sure?

703
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,800
Just... write it like it feels.

704
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,500
Fuck.

705
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,200
Shit!

706
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,400
Rodney, you can't press
a regular for his whole tab. It just isn't done.

707
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,500
I used to run a bar. I know how
these things work, remember?

708
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,100
- Gus Haynes in the flesh.
- Well, more of it, maybe.

709
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,400
How you been?
Where you been hidin'? You in Vice still?

710
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,000
Vice? Shit, that does take me back.

711
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,600
I did eight years in Homicide, brother.
Now it's the Western.

712
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,300
Speaking of hiding out, when did you stop
comin' round? Last I saw you was...

713
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,100
I'm not running the districts anymore.
I'm an editor now, so...

714
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,400
Then you can afford to buy a round.

715
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,800
Hey, Dennis.

716
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,200
Let me pull your coat.

717
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,600
Long time, Gus. Don't tell me you knew
I'd be here tonight.

718
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,900
It's a cop bar, you know,
so, if it's not you,

719
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,600
it's some other face
from back in the day.

720
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,500
- Theoretical question.
- Theoretical?

721
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,600
In that case, a double, Rodney -
Gus is buyin'.

722
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,000
Two, Rodney. So...

723
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,000
What?

724
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,600
I seen you at the stash house, yo.

725
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,600
Ain't you used to be
with them Barksdale boys?

726
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,800
- What they call you, yo?
- Savino.

727
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,300
That's right. Savino.

728
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
You ain't never moved no dope.

729
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,300
You was always muscle as I recall.

730
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,300
Now you musclin' for Marlo, huh?

731
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,900
I wasn't there.

732
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,300
When they did the old man like that,
I wasn't there.

733
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,200
Chris an' Snoop, they on that.

734
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,200
I know who was there.
So you innocent, huh?

735
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,000
Let me ask you somethin' though.

736
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,500
Bein' that you muscle for Marlo,

737
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,100
what you was gonna do
if you was there, huh?

738
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,500
Riddle me that.

739
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,900
Yeah.

740
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,900
You know what, yo?

741
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,800
- Did you hear a gunshot?
- Shit.

742
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,400
Ready?

743
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,000
Yeah.

744
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,400
A'ight.

745
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,200
Yeah?

746
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,000
- We got to talk.
- I'll come over to you.

747
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,600
Does that seem possible?

748
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,400
To go through the court system
with a false ID?

749
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,000
Maybe the first time,
if she's got no priors, no prints on file,

750
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,400
but after that?

751
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,700
BPI sheets have
fingerprint characteristics

752
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,700
that are like an FBI bar code.

753
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,500
And it's paired with a photo.

754
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,100
A name's one thing,
but unless these women are twin sisters

755
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,100
and one's been carrying the other one's hand
around in her purse for the last 12 years...

756
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Somebody's yanking your chain.

757
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,700
It's definitely a code.

758
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,400
Definitely not having
much to do with time.

759
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,200
We're at a point where
I'm going to need more bodies,

760
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
surveillance cars, man-hours.

761
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,100
We're gonna have to stay on these guys
'til those clocks start to make sense.

762
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,100
Good news is they're giving me
more manpower than I can waste.

763
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,100
Bad news?

764
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,700
It's all around the office
that I'm giving out hours and money

765
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,200
to people to work other cases.

766
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,300
I can't help it, Lester.
It's the kind of person I am.

767
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,600
- I give and give.
- If you're not careful,

768
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,100
you're gonna get shit on you, on us.

769
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,900
Who's gonna complain?

770
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,700
Guys are working cases
and getting paid.

771
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,400
So what exactly do you need?

772
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,200
Seven men.

773
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,200
No, eight. And cars.

774
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,800
Oh, shit, they offered me men
from the districts,

775
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,600
and a surveillance supervisor
to run the detail.

776
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,300
Anyone in the districts we trust?

777
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,500
Let me think on that.

778
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,300
Yeah?

779
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,500
I don't know how the fuck did you of all people
do this shit, huh? How?

780
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,700
- You got the right Allen wrench?
- Goddamn directions.

781
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,800
What kind of Scotch you using?

782
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,100
Fuck!

783
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,400
Fuck! Fuck!

784
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,900
Piece of shit!

785
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,900
Yo, so you talked to Chris, right?
What he say?

786
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,500
He didn't say shit.

787
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,000
He knows I ain't say
a fuckin' word to no police.

788
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,100
And you heard what Little Dermell said
to the juvenile master?

789
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,300
Lady ask him like,
"Yo, you got a record?"

790
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,100
He's like "Yeah, bitch, I got a record.

791
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,100
"My record's so long
I'm about to put out an album."

792
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,200
Don't touch that dial, young'un.

793
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
This a Stanfield corner, huh?

794
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,600
You know who I am?

795
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,900
You make sure you tell the boss man

796
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,700
that you know who it is
dropped Savino last night.

797
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,700
You feel me?

798
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,300
You tell that man
I'm-a drop all his muscle

799
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,300
until he get the heart to come
down to the street and dance.

800
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
You gonna remone that, sweetpea?

801
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,700
That's Omar? Damn.

802
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,700
Savino dead, yo?

803
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:35,000
Shit, man, if he woulda made me
from Monk's apartment the other night,

804
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,200
I might be laid out my own self.

805
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,700
Gimpy as a motherfucker.

806
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,700
I don't know, Senator.
I want to believe you.

807
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,200
I mean, I'm your lawyer.

808
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,600
But there's all this up on the board
that Mr. Bond has on display -

809
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,300
11,000 to West Side Hoops,

810
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,600
next day, $11,000 drawn,

811
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,000
then $11,000 deposited
in your personal banking account.

812
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,000
You bet it all went into my account.

813
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,100
It made it easier for me to do my job.

814
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,000
And at the end of the day,
not one penny stayed with me.

815
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,100
I need you to do better
than that, Senator.

816
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,100
- Where are your records?
- Records?

817
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,500
Yes, records.

818
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,700
For example,
this check for $11,000

819
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,300
- Dated January 22nd.
- That was last winter, right?

820
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,000
So, some went to pay
everyone's BGE,

821
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,700
'cause half my district was
gonna have the heat turned off,

822
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,900
and then, some went for puff jackets
for them that got children in need.

823
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,800
Let me tell you something, man.

824
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,300
My neck of the woods,
it's a jungle out there.

825
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:42,100
Everybody living hand to mouth,
improvising, hustlin',

826
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,300
make do with as little
as you can imagine.

827
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,500
Hell, that TV show,
what's that, Survivor?

828
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,700
Man, they want some good contestants,
they need to come around westside.

829
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,400
Folks I know?
We'd do great on that show.

830
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,500
Practice every damn day of our lives.

831
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,300
Hell, and Fear Factor?
Don't even get me started.

832
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,200
Forgive me, but I still don't understand
how that justifies...

833
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,200
Let me tell you something, brother -

834
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,300
I don't know how they do it
out in Roland Park.

835
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,500
Maybe Prosecutor Obonda
can enlighten me on that.

836
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,000
But my world is strictly cash-and-carry,
and I am Clay Davis -

837
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,100
my people need something,
they know where to find me.

838
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,100
Let me tell you, brother,
I step out the door,

839
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,500
hit the corner of Mosher
and Pennsylvania,

840
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,700
you better believe my pockets are bulging.

841
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,000
But by the time
I get to Robert Street...

842
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Objection!
Objection, your honor.

843
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,700
Senator! Senator, take a seat,

844
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,700
and refrain from off-hand references
to Mr. Bond.

845
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,800
My apologies, your honor.

846
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,100
But these charities were
set up for basketball leagues

847
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,100
in city rec centers, weren't they?

848
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,300
Yeah, but you give me 20,000 for a basketball
and an air pump,

849
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,700
I am pullin' goodly on that
for whatever, whoever comes at me.

850
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,400
"Senator Clay,
I gots to bury my mother,

851
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,100
"bail out my son,

852
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:14,400
"buy a new shirt
for a job interview,

853
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,200
"pay my child's asthma doctor."

854
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,700
Takes me half an hour
to go a hundred yards,

855
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:26,000
and excuse me if I didn't ask
that old arthritis woman for a receipt,

856
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,500
or that young mother needed
the Similac to sign a damn piece of paper

857
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,000
so I don't have to be up here
in this box right now

858
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,200
explainin' to folks who never been
in our neck of the woods

859
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,200
how things truly are.

860
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,100
And if a jury of my peers, you all,

861
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,100
deem it right and true
for me to walk out of here

862
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,000
an upright and justified man?

863
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,100
I ain't gonna lie to you.

864
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,500
I'm gonna do
the same damn thing tomorrow,

865
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,500
and the day after that
and the day after that,

866
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,500
until they got me laid out
at March's Funeral Home,

867
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,300
and truck me off to Mount Auburn.

868
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,500
Silence.

869
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Silence in this courtroom.

870
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,800
What about trailers? Like FEMA.

871
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,600
We set up trailers to act as
temp housing for some of the...

872
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,300
some of the shelter population.
Put 'em down in War Memorial Plaza.

873
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,900
Do you know how much
FEMA pays per trailer?

874
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,700
A dozen trailers for the homeless.

875
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,300
We've got three to four thousand
on the streets, at least.

876
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,800
It's symbolic.
You know, we're doing what we can

877
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,200
with a civic disaster -
like New Orleans.

878
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Abandoned by the state,
ignored by the federal government.

879
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,700
It's bad enough you want to keep
the city shelters open 24/7.

880
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,400
That puts the health department
a couple hundred thousand in the red.

881
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,700
Add that to the overage
for letting the police department run wild

882
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,700
- With overtime and investigative costs...
- There's no choice anymore.

883
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,000
This thing has a lock
on everyone's attention.

884
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,400
When another victim disappears,
we're gonna be even more on the spot.

885
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,000
I'm just telling you, if this goes on more than
a month, with what we'll be spending,

886
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,400
you're looking at cutbacks
throughout the agencies,

887
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,900
maybe even teacher layoffs
come the end of the fiscal.

888
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,900
- Teacher layoffs?
- By a gubernatorial candidate.

889
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,100
- In an election year.
- Lovely.

890
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,900
Hold up, hold up.

891
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,200
I just want to say that despite
all the false accusations made against me,

892
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,500
the people who I continue to serve
have spoken.

893
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,400
What the fuck just happened?

894
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,300
...as long as I can to serve the people.

895
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,400
Whatever it was,
they don't teach it in law school.

896
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,600
45 inches of Clay Davis
playing not just the race card,

897
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,800
but the whole deck, coming at ya.

898
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,200
Got it. Thank you.

899
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,700
Someday you're going to have
to explain all this to me, Gus.

900
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:01,100
After watching that verdict come in,
I feel very white.

901
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,100
Well, start with some James Brown records
and work up from there.

902
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,700
It's embarrassing, ain't it?

903
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,700
I can't believe nobody had
sense enough to tone this down.

904
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,400
The hype is bad enough, but what gets me
is that I can't trust the guy.

905
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,900
I send him back out on the street
to own his mistake,

906
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,200
he comes back with some bullshit
about stolen identities.

907
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,800
I don't give a fuck he gets took.
Everybody gets took now and then.

908
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,200
I know I did.

909
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,200
It's about not owning up to it.

910
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,900
Gus, this thing with
the woman and the crab cake?

911
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,200
You think the first time you catch him
is the first time he does it?

912
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,500
A lot of guys'll try to duck a correction,

913
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,800
but he was standing on an outright lie,
and if he'll lie about a correction...

914
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,500
Then will he lie to make a story better
than it ought to be?

915
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,400
I keep thinking about that kid in the wheelchair
out in front of Oriole Park.

916
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,800
The one that only had a nickname.

917
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,900
A black kid from the westside,
crazy for baseball?

918
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,600
Basketball, yeah.

919
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,500
Football, sure.

920
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,500
I don't wanna call
another reporter a liar.

921
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,200
I really don't.

922
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,700
What's the matter, baby?

923
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,500
You can't sleep?

924
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,600
Let's see.

925
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,700
Let's say good night to everybody.

926
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Good night, moon.

927
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,800
- You say it.
- Good night, moon.

928
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,900
There you go. Good night, stars.

929
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,800
Good night, stars.

930
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,900
- Good night, po-pos.
- Good night, po-pos.

931
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,700
- Good night, fiends.
- Good night, fiends.

932
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,400
- Good night, hoppers.
- Good night, hoppers.

933
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,000
- Good night, hustlers.
- Good night, hustlers.

934
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,800
- Good night, scammers.
- Good night, scammers.

935
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,100
- Good night to everybody.
- Good night to everybody.

936
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,200
Good night to one and all.

937
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,000
Good night to one and all.
