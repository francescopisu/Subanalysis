1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,400
Freezing my balls off.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,300
It ain't so bad. Loosen up.
Couple more months, it's gonna be spring.

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,700
Spring, huh?

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,700
Listen, you gotta realize the bosses
did you a favor sending you down here.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,300
- Citywide to Marine Unit.
- 7672. Go ahead.

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,700
Distress call from a private craft.
60-foot white vessel. Engines are dead.

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,200
What's the location, Citywide?

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,000
In the channel near the bridge.
About 2,000 yards off the Armistead pier.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,100
10-4, we're responding.

10
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,500
My father used to work there.

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,700
- Beth Steel?
- In the shipyards there, yeah.

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,200
I had an uncle who was a supervisor there.
Got laid off in '78, though.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
'73 for my dad.

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,700
- Party boat?
- Pretty one, yeah.

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,900
- More than one engine, right?
- Probably an electrical problem.

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,400
Is that a police boat?

17
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,600
How are you tonight? Good to see you.

18
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,200
Henry, how are you?

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,500
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

20
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
- You're the Captain?
- Yeah.

21
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,200
- Harbormaster?
- No, City Police.

22
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,500
- So you're dead in the water?
- Think it's the starter.

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,600
- You're not a mechanic, are you?
- Me? No.

24
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,800
I can't tell the aft from the stern.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
Best I can offer you is a tow line.

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,200
Claude, looks like they're gonna need a pull.

27
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,100
- 10-4, we'll tow to Henderson's.
- That'll work.

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,900
Any chance you can hold off
on bringing us in?

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,300
Lot of partying going on now.

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,100
I wouldn't wanna cut it short
for a little engine trouble.

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,500
You're in the shipping channel.

32
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,200
You tow us somewhere out of the way,
and the band plays on a while longer.

33
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,400
...because you see what I'm saying, right?

34
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,900
I mean, three years in auto theft
and I didn't learn anything.

35
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,100
I didn't care.

36
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm telling you,
I didn't even wanna be a police anymore.

37
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,500
I honestly didn't.

38
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I think that was why
I shot up my car like I did.

39
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,100
But this thing we did on Barksdale,
the wiretap and all...

40
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,100
that felt like something.
That felt like something I wanna do.

41
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,000
So I was thinking, you know,
narcotics, maybe.

42
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,500
Major, you want this stuff where?

43
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,500
Just in here.
Up against the wall over there.

44
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,200
If there aren't any openings
in the regular narcotics shift...

45
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,800
maybe assets forfeiture
or something like that.

46
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,200
Easy. Everything breaks.

47
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,600
I mean, with this Barksdale thing...

48
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,600
Lester Freamon had us deep into the money.
Real deep.

49
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,700
We could've seized real estate, cash,
vehicles, all kinds of stuff.

50
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,700
If the bosses, I mean,
if command had let that case go forward.

51
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
We were on it.

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,700
- Look at that. It's the dove.
- Right.

53
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,700
- So what do you think?
- What do I think?

54
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,200
I think you're gonna take
the Sergeant's Exam next month.

55
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,400
And because I have Andy Krawczyk's ear...

56
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,100
and because he has City Hall's ear...

57
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
you're gonna make Sergeant.

58
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,600
Then you're gonna come out here
to the Southeast...

59
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,000
where, because I'm your father-in-law...

60
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,700
you're gonna be assigned a daytime shift
in a quiet sector.

61
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,400
Then you're gonna take the Lieutenant's
Exam where you'll also score high.

62
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
I don't want to make rank.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,400
I want to work cases. Good cases.

64
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,600
Roland.

65
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,900
Listen to me.

66
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,700
You did good with the drug thing.
You buckled down, you did the work.

67
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,400
And except for that thing
with the Grand Jury...

68
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,400
you helped take
some of the stink off yourself.

69
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,600
Now if you'll just shut up and listen to me...

70
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,700
you might actually have a career
in this department.

71
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,800
- This radio ain't working that well.
- We're losing it.

72
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,100
- We're losing the station, man.
- What you mean?

73
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,100
We done gone so far from Baltimore,
we're losing the station.

74
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,400
- Try a Philly station or some shit like that.
- The radio in Philly is different?

75
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,600
Nigger, you gotta be fucking with me, right?

76
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,800
You never heard a station
outside of Baltimore?

77
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,800
I ain't never left Baltimore
except that Boys' Village shit one day.

78
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,900
And I wasn't trying to hear no radio
up in that bitch.

79
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,600
Come on, man. You're killing me. Stop.

80
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,400
It's been perfect tomato weather out there.

81
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
These wonderful hot, humid days,
and then rain at night.

82
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,500
- This a Philly station?
- How the fuck would I know?

83
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,100
Why would anybody wanna leave Baltimore?
That's what I'm asking.

84
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,100
Yo, that be the exit. Take that shit.

85
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,000
So far they on it.

86
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
Ahoy, matey.

87
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,100
The girls always tell me
about the little man in the boat.

88
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,000
- Now I know who they talking about.
- Come on board, man.

89
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,300
- Come on, I wanna show you.
- Fuck, no.

90
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,500
- What's the matter?
- The Bunk can't swim.

91
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,900
I ain't too good at floating, either.

92
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,500
So what brings you to the water's edge?

93
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,400
Ilene Nathan called.
Gant case is coming up in four weeks.

94
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,600
She wants to start doing preliminaries
on our witnesses.

95
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,200
That means the old lady from the projects,
which is no problem.

96
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,800
And your man Omar, who's in the wind.

97
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,500
You got a line on Omar, Jimmy?

98
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,800
- Well, he's not to starboard.
- That's port, fool.

99
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,100
- How the fuck would you know?
- Come on.

100
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,400
Let me buy you lunch
and we can think on this shit together.

101
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,300
I leave, I gotta tell my Sergeant.

102
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,400
That reminds me. Landsman wants his $10.

103
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,900
- What for?
- For betting that you'd ride the boat.

104
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,400
You tell that motherfucker
he's not gonna see that money...

105
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,300
especially since it was probably him
told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.

106
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,000
- Ain't the same up there without your ass.
- No?

107
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,500
Better, actually.

108
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,000
Hey, come on, now.

109
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,000
The canal gets dredged...

110
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,000
it means we all work.
Your people, my people.

111
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
The canal's the key, Nat. You know this.

112
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,500
Yeah, but you know how much money
you're gonna spend...

113
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,300
to even get them talking about that shit?

114
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,600
We don't take a shot,
we might as well roll over and die right now.

115
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,800
No, you get them to rebuild the grain pier.

116
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,700
- You got a 100 ships right there.
- That's break-bulk, Nat.

117
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,900
Best you'll do is one or two
extra gangs a week on them blowers.

118
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,800
That's six or seven-man gangs at best.

119
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,700
But you try for that, you might actually
come away with something.

120
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
You go down to Annapolis
asking for the goddamn canal...

121
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,600
you gonna come back with nothing but
your little shriveled-ass dick in your hand.

122
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,500
What's more,
if the grain pier don't get fixed up soon...

123
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,200
some asshole's gonna fuck us
by building condominiums all over it.

124
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,800
- Nat, if the canal were 2 feet deeper --
- Fuck the canal.

125
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going to the District Council.

126
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,900
I'm gonna tell them
to push for the grain pier.

127
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,400
- You feel me?
- Nat, calm the fuck down.

128
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,100
Goddamn Checkers Local always acting
like you're the king of everything and shit.

129
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,500
Nat, listen to me. If we --

130
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,900
Y'all need to crawl back down
in them holds...

131
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,200
and remind yourself of who you is
and where you come from.

132
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,600
Damn, Frank.

133
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,100
We just sat here and watched Nat Coxson
take a shit all over you.

134
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,700
And shrivel-dick motherfucker
that you are, you take it.

135
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
For your information...

136
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,200
I wake up every morning
with an angry, blue-veined diamond-cutter.

137
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,800
I was gonna enlighten the president
of Local 47 on this particular point...

138
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,800
and he chose to depart.

139
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,100
- Blue steel, gentlemen.
- For Christ's sake.

140
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,100
Three-and-a-half inches of hard blue steel.

141
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,400
- Nicky boy, you working today?
- As a lasher for Big Roy's crew.

142
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,000
Attaboy. Make the family proud.

143
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,300
First day they give me in two weeks.

144
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,800
- Is Ott around?
- On his ass as usual.

145
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,100
Worthless fuck still owes me $20
for them lotto tickets.

146
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,300
Hey, Nick.

147
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,200
You need to see the Greek
and get a number. He's got one on the way.

148
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,900
- Today?
- Tomorrow.

149
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
The Atlantic Light over at North Point.

150
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,700
All right.

151
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,900
- Yo, Frank.
- What's up?

152
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,700
You gotta get with Ziggy, man.
He's all over the place.

153
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,900
I'm here since 8:00.
You know I been here since 8:00.

154
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,700
- Hold your horses.
- You fucking goose.

155
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,100
I'm gonna find it for you.
Just shut the fuck up a minute.

156
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,600
How we doing?

157
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,900
- Ain't a problem, Chief.
- The fuck it ain't.

158
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,300
I'm down here since 8:00
for crane-to-chassis...

159
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,500
- And Tweety Bird here lost the can.
- It ain't lost.

160
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,300
It's right here on the manifest as a hot box.
Where is it, Zig?

161
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,800
- It's either in Bay 7, or --
- Bay 7 is empty, man.

162
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,500
Or it ain't. In that case...

163
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,300
it's definitely somewhere in the stacks.

164
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,500
Jesus fucking Christ.

165
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,200
You're killing me here, Ziggy.
You are fucking killing me.

166
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Get me a number for your shipping agent.
I'll call and try to square it.

167
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,100
And you.

168
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,800
You clock out today and leave your box,
and don't ever come the fuck back.

169
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
You hear me, Zig? You're fired.

170
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,900
Later for you, goofus.

171
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,000
Fucking guy.
He loses his job and he couldn't care less.

172
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,100
- He ain't fired, man.
- No?

173
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,800
That's his father.

174
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,500
How fast you need this?

175
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,300
Case goes to trial in a month.
Got to start prepping it this week.

176
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,700
Officer Burns.

177
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,800
Detective.

178
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,400
I heard they posted you down here.

179
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,600
But, I mean, you know, damn.

180
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,300
These motherfuckers don't play, do they?

181
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,800
So what brings you downstairs?

182
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,200
I was pulling evidence on the Gant case.

183
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,300
You know, trial date for Bird is next month
and Ilene Nathan wanted to be ready.

184
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,100
You give him my love.

185
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,000
- Who?
- Bird.

186
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,700
- No evidence.
- What do you mean, no evidence?

187
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,000
Submission slip says
"Row BB, Section 14, Shelf 3...

188
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,900
"Four, Right rear." It says that.

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,700
- So?
- No such thing.

190
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,400
BB has 12 sections. This says 14.
You see what I'm saying?

191
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
No evidence.

192
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,200
Winters kill off
the weaker varieties of caterpillars.

193
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,200
- Fuck me.
- ...that's of an entirely different breed...

194
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Fuck.

195
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
...protection against caterpillars,
they eat right through it.

196
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,500
But it is a sort of a warning system.

197
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,500
They here.

198
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,700
Franoosh, you made it.

199
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,300
Right, Father. Got you covered here.

200
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,600
Come on.

201
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You wanna see your window?

202
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,000
Only Franoosh Sobotka would send
all the way to Esslingen for stained glass.

203
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,600
The Germans are hard-headed,
but you can't beat them for craft.

204
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,200
I was glad to do it, Father,
for the church, you know.

205
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,000
Truth is I need to ask you
something in return.

206
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,700
Anything I can do.

207
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,100
- I need some face time with the Senator.
- Barbara?

208
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
She comes to the early mass on Sunday,
the one in Polish.

209
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,900
We got nothing but problems, Father.

210
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,300
We need to see something happen
with the C&D Canal...

211
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,400
and the grain pier's been down for a year.

212
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,300
I got tough guys coming in
to confess things I never heard before.

213
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,200
I don't need you to tell me
how bad things are at the docks.

214
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,100
So you'll set something up
with Mikulski soon?

215
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,000
You didn't need a German window
to ask me for that, Francis.

216
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,900
And what's more...

217
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,400
you've made offerings
way above what it would take...

218
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,600
to get that window up there.

219
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,500
How long since your last confession?

220
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,200
I'll see you, Father.

221
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,300
This shit might be somewhere else, man.

222
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,400
Yo, the shit is always up in the door, man.

223
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,600
Motherfucker, you been
standing there watching us.

224
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,900
You see any shit come up out of there?

225
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,900
You seen we ain't take shit up off this car.

226
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,100
- All right.
- You seen it.

227
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,000
Who gonna believe us? This shit is missing.

228
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
And fuck what you're saying.

229
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,200
All he's gonna hear
is that this shit is fucking missing.

230
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,400
Yo, check it again.

231
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,300
Yo, the shit ain't there, man.
Call your man and say so.

232
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,000
Nigger, what you say?

233
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,600
- I said check it again, God damn it!
- Whoa, chill.

234
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,200
Yo, man, cut that shit the fuck out.

235
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,200
What the fuck is going on today, man?

236
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,800
Taking their time, ain't they?

237
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,300
What the hell is going on?

238
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,300
Come on, man.

239
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,500
Damn!

240
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,400
- Ain't anywhere in this section either.
- Start on the next row.

241
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,000
Lieutenant, those two bags could be
anywhere in this damn basement.

242
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,500
You're right.

243
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,300
- We could be here all night.
- Right again.

244
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,400
So that's overtime, right?

245
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,100
Fuck me. I still cannot type.

246
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,300
Fucking white boys, I love them.
I fucking love them.

247
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,100
- Yeah?
- Dumb as a box of rocks.

248
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,500
- Who?
- White boys.

249
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,300
Talking about the brain-deads
in my Kane Street case.

250
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,800
I call him up,
I tell him I wanna buy some drugs.

251
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,200
You know what he says?

252
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,000
"Okay, I'll sell you the drugs.
How much drugs do you want?"

253
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,900
I swear to God, Kima, they don't code it,
they don't ask for a meet, nothing.

254
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,100
And then when you make the deal,
there's no runner, no bullshit.

255
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,400
It's the guy himself
walking up to you, saying:

256
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,800
"I brought the drugs.
Did you bring the money?"

257
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,600
I'm not kidding.
I have much respect for black people...

258
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
after working with these idiots
for two weeks.

259
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,900
If white boys wanna sell drugs in Baltimore,
they have to make different laws for it...

260
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,500
like even it out for them.

261
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,700
- Affirmative action.
- Leave no white man behind.

262
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,900
- What the fuck do you want?
- I need you to do the seizures.

263
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,300
You got titles, deeds, registrations?
What do you have for me?

264
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,000
Thought you did that.
You're the Forfeiture Unit, right?

265
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,100
I write all the affidavits
and the filing for the City Solicitor.

266
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
But you've gotta give me the information
on what we're taking.

267
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,100
That's a fucking hassle.

268
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,900
You want the property, do the paperwork.

269
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,900
You gotta step up, Herc.
You don't have me or Carver to lean on here.

270
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
No?

271
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,100
How about you come
on the raids tomorrow?

272
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Take a few doors with me
for old time's sake.

273
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
You taking doors?

274
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, two houses and a bar on Kane Street.

275
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,400
Come on, Kima, mount up with us.
I know you miss it.

276
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm done rolling around the gutter.
I am inside now.

277
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,700
- You're a housecat now?
- I made a promise.

278
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,000
I gotta say, Kima. If you were a guy...

279
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,200
and, actually, in some ways
you're better than most guys I know.

280
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,600
If you were a guy, your friends
would buy you a beer and let you know.

281
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,700
- Let me know what?
- You're fucking whipped.

282
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,800
- Whipped?
- Pussy-whipped within an inch of your life.

283
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,400
I kid you not.

284
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,400
So...

285
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
So?

286
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
So where do we find Omar?

287
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,300
Who?

288
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,300
- He say anything else?
- No.

289
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,300
Just to come back. All of us.

290
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,900
How he say it?

291
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,200
You know, he just said it.

292
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,900
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

293
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,000
Shit.

294
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,300
- They holding to it?
- So far.

295
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,000
All right.

296
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,900
They got the times right?

297
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,300
How about the mileage?

298
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,300
All right.

299
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,100
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

300
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,800
- You never saw him out the car?
- No.

301
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
- You stayed with him the whole time?
- Every minute.

302
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,700
How long before he came out
the parking garage?

303
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,500
- How long was he on his own?
- Not enough time to do shit, String.

304
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
He was in and out, like, in three minutes.

305
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,900
Chill.

306
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,100
- This shit is fucked up.
- Look --

307
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,500
You follow the directions?

308
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,000
- I did just like you told me.
- Wrote down the mileage?

309
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,700
- Yeah.
- Let me see.

310
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,300
See, right there.

311
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,300
No, you're three-tenths of a mile long, dawg.

312
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,200
And if you followed directions,
you wouldn't be.

313
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,800
String, I did everything like I should, man.
I swear.

314
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,300
You got answers?

315
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,900
You didn't have to take a detour
in Camden...

316
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,100
when they shut down a couple of blocks
on the Boulevard?

317
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,800
You hurt your foot?

318
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,500
- My foot?
- You know, the way you kicked that tire jack.

319
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,700
- You was on us the whole time?
- Who, me?

320
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,000
Y'all had people following us.

321
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
So where it at?

322
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,100
You know, you should take me with you.

323
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,700
I should meet these guys.
If I meet these guys...

324
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,700
we can figure out ways to do business.
You know what I'm saying?

325
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,200
- Zig, these guys are real.
- What, I ain't real?

326
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,300
Six degrees.

327
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,800
Everybody's going home
to sauerkraut and Santy Claus...

328
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,200
and here comes a gang of us
walking the other way...

329
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,700
Little Big Roy with his wooden leg.

330
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,200
- Christ, them wooden shovels.
- Yeah.

331
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,400
You children don't know nothing
about them wooden shovels, do you?

332
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,700
Can't have no sparks
when you working grain.

333
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,200
- Kaboom.
- It's more like kaput.

334
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,000
You never gonna see another grain ship
here in Bawlmer, my friends.

335
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,300
Zig, you believe these fucking dinosaurs?

336
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,700
They sit around all day talking shit about
how they used to off-load with shovels...

337
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,100
and carry fucking railroad cars
on their backs.

338
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,500
Shit, and drink whiskey through a fire hose.

339
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,200
Go home and fuck their wives till breakfast.
There was some heroes back then.

340
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,400
Shit is thick in here tonight, gentlemen.

341
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,100
What can you do?
This generation, they just don't know.

342
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,800
- Ain't never gonna be what it was.
- No, indeed.

343
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,600
Every night with these old fucks.
It's like 1952 and shit.

344
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,000
Boys, you know, when I was your age,
I unloaded ten ships a goddamn day.

345
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
You know, I'd do it with one arm...

346
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,700
after a 300-pound bag of Polish dildos
fell on me.

347
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,000
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?

348
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,400
Actually, at my house, it's a ring of kielbasa.

349
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,800
Christ, here we go again.

350
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,400
Bring out pretty boy.

351
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,800
But, you know, where you boys hail from,
I'm sure any old breakfast link will do.

352
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,300
You know he's gonna
pull out his dick, right?

353
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,000
That boy ain't right.

354
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,400
It was just me...

355
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
and my old wooden leg,
and my old wooden shovel...

356
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,500
and my glass eye, and my Polish pencil.

357
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,800
Like anyone from the Checkers Local
ever used anything but a real pencil.

358
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,600
Shit, they don't even push
one of them no more.

359
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,700
Talking trash about 1514.

360
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,600
Jesus H. Christ, you know what?
All hands starboard.

361
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,600
Come on.

362
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
The old tub is listing. Can you feel her?

363
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,100
You wanna know why?

364
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,400
'Cause them old fucks
done unloaded so much bullshit...

365
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,000
that this whole motherfucker's
gonna capsize.

366
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Brace yourselves, we're sinking.

367
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,300
God damn it, Ziggy.

368
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,800
You're not taking your dick out
in here again.

369
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,200
Let me show you old gents some bulk cargo
that none of you could ever handle.

370
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,300
Who says they don't make them
like they used to?

371
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,700
Pretty boy is on the town tonight.

372
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,100
Fucking Ziggy, man.

373
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,800
- Bring her in the boat?
- Hell, no.

374
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,900
- She'll fall apart if we try to bring her in.
- What's the plan then?

375
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,500
We'll hook her real good.
We'll tow her slowly over to the pier.

376
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,000
- What's she look like?
- What do you mean?

377
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
- How long you think she's been in?
- She's fresh.

378
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,700
- Legs are broke, though.
- Probably a jumper from the bridge.

379
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,600
All right, Ma. Shit.

380
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,900
Kitchen's closed.

381
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,800
There's no service for drunks
who can't get up in time to catch a ship.

382
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,000
What ship?

383
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,700
Your father says the Talco Line is in today.

384
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,400
That makes two ships at North Point.

385
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,100
It's the Atlantic Light.
Ain't due until this afternoon.

386
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
That still is no excuse.

387
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,100
Good morning, Mom.

388
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,900
Couple of goddamn drunks I got.

389
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,100
And don't leave
without taking your cousin with you.

390
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,200
I gotta clean in there,
and I ain't gonna do it around his carcass.

391
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,500
You keep us guessing, don't you, Stan?

392
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,800
At Sunday mass, you can't be found.

393
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,600
But early on a Tuesday,
you arrive with an army.

394
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,500
$2,500 from myself and every other Polack...

395
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,300
in three districts and four firehouses.

396
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,700
- And to what do we owe such generosity?
- A surprise.

397
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,800
We ordered up a window
for where you renovated the nave.

398
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,000
A memorial. Let me see that.

399
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,000
To Polish police and firefighters.

400
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,900
Found this craftsman down in Glen Burnie
that you would not believe.

401
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,100
- For the nave?
- Yeah, for the nave.

402
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,800
We could use another window
on the second floor of the rectory.

403
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,500
- The rectory?
- The upstairs hallway.

404
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,200
How much did them dock boys offer
for this spot?

405
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,300
- I can match it.
- Offerings are confidential, Stan.

406
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,100
- And as you can see --
- I can go as high as $4,000.

407
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,400
Just tell me if they went higher than $4,000.

408
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,500
More than $4,000? From the docks?

409
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,300
How the hell...

410
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm sorry, Father.

411
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,500
- Who came to you with the offer?
- Francis Sobotka.

412
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,200
Frank Sobotka has that kind of money?

413
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,900
- It was from his local.
- The Checkers?

414
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,500
- They don't have 100 guys left paying dues.
- It's a parish of givers, Stan.

415
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,600
Maybe you talk to Frank.

416
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,200
Work it out somehow.

417
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah, we'll talk.

418
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,600
Major?

419
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,200
Well, if it isn't Barnacle Bill, the sailor.

420
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,500
Ray, how you been?

421
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,800
I got nothing but red ink
under my name this year.

422
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,600
Landsman's become an asshole with teeth.

423
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,200
- Fish your wish, huh?
- Jumper, probably.

424
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,300
- This close to the bridge.
- Probably, yeah.

425
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,400
- Pretty, though.
- She is, yeah.

426
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,100
I go into the men's room this morning.

427
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,700
Guess who's in the next stall
puking his guts out.

428
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,200
Bunk Moreland.

429
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,700
- How'd you know?
- Useless fuck can't hold his liquor.

430
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,200
- What's happening, man?
- What's up, Fam?

431
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
All right.

432
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,300
- You ain't heard from Roberto yet?
- Not a goddamn word, man.

433
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,300
Billy still got our money though, right?
So you need to get down to New York, man.

434
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Fuck kind of game this nigger playing?
You sure of our people?

435
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,600
I broke down all their stories
and they came back clean.

436
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Besides, I had some good people
watching them.

437
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,600
- Who?
- Tank, Country.

438
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,800
- How long that motherfucker been home?
- A month.

439
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,700
Still on parole. He said, "fuck that."
Straight back in the mix.

440
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,900
All right.

441
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,200
So good, it ain't on us. It's on Roberto.
Set it straight. You know what I mean?

442
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,200
So when you go hard on them,
take it light, but be firm.

443
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,000
They got our money
and we ain't got the product.

444
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,700
So, you feel me? The shit ain't right.

445
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,900
How you fixed in here otherwise, B?

446
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,700
This ain't no thing, man.
You know what I mean?

447
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,800
You come in here, man,
you get your mind right.

448
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,000
You get in here and you do two days.
It's the day you come in this motherfucker --

449
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,500
- And the day you get out this motherfucker.
- That's right.

450
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,000
Exactly.

451
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,200
- What's up?
- How you doing?

452
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,500
- Coming from the hiring hall?
- I'm working the Atlantic late today.

453
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,300
- How's it looking for Local 47?
- You're shit out of luck.

454
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,600
ROIROs isn't going to anybody
lower than a G-series.

455
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,100
Best you can get,
maybe half a day doing break-bulk...

456
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,000
on an aluminum load at Locust Point.

457
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,700
- Half a day, huh?
- Seniority sucks.

458
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,400
- Yeah, if you ain't senior, it does.
- Yeah, you got that right.

459
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,600
- I'm out of here.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

460
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,900
- The fuck you ain't wake me up for?
- Just getting up now, fuck-face?

461
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,300
No, actually,
your ma makes a good breakfast.

462
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,900
- No fucking way.
- Bacon and eggs, baby.

463
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,400
You going down to see the Greek, right?

464
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,100
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna fuck it up for you.

465
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,800
For Christ's sake,
will you just get in the car already?

466
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,500
Come on. Let's go.

467
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,200
I swear to God, Ziggy.
You open your mouth, I'll fucking kill you.

468
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,700
- Nicky, from the docks.
- Spiros.

469
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
How are you? Good?

470
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,000
- Who's your friend?
- This is Zig, my uncle's kid.

471
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,300
- Your uncle? Frankie?
- Yeah.

472
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,000
Ziggy's his oldest.
My car broke down, you know. He drove.

473
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,800
So you must be the Greek.

474
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,300
Well, I'm Greek anyway.

475
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,100
Boris Badanoff.
I know you from around the way, right?

476
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,900
Why am I Boris? I don't understand this.
Everywhere I am Boris.

477
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,200
- Shit, you're Russian, right?
- No, Ukraine. Kyiv is Ukraine.

478
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,500
- It's the same difference, though.
- No, you're wrong.

479
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,600
What's the matter?
You don't like being called Boris?

480
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
Sergei.

481
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,200
No way, man. Boris is way better.
It's like the guy from the cartoon.

482
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,700
Boris and Natasha?

483
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,800
Bullwinkle, man. Rocky and Bullwinkle.

484
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,200
- You want some coffee, pie?
- No, I'm good.

485
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,000
- Actually, what kind of pie you got?
- Hey, Zig.

486
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,200
Shut the fuck up, huh?

487
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
Malaka.

488
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,300
No, it's cool. He's cool.

489
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,400
- That's Frank's kid?
- Yeah.

490
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,200
He's in the Union, you know.

491
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,800
But he's like an L-series,
so he ain't getting any hours.

492
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,000
- Same deal, same rate.
- All right. Who's driving?

493
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,200
Again?

494
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,500
You want to mix it up a little more.

495
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,500
Make it so customs doesn't put
no names to faces.

496
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,500
You trust a man, you stay with him.

497
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,200
- Okay.
- All right.

498
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,000
Boris it is.

499
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,000
- Sergei.
- Yeah, whatever.

500
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,200
Come on, fucknuts. Let's go.

501
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,100
- How's the open-face turkey?
- It's shit. Let's go.

502
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,300
See you guys later.

503
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,800
- Bullwinkle?
- Polacks.

504
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,500
You fucking embarrassed me in there, man.

505
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,600
You embarrassed yourself, Zig.

506
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,500
You seen my nephew anywhere?

507
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Nick? Not yet.
I don't think he got any hours.

508
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,200
- Hey, Frank.
- Hey, darling.

509
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,000
Just so I can finish my paperwork early,
what are your people gonna steal today?

510
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,400
I don't know.

511
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,300
Couple luxury sedans,
some color TVs, wide-screen.

512
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,100
Maybe a couple cans of vodka,
maybe a whole container ship.

513
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,700
Okay. Y'all have a good one.

514
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,900
You let her fuck with you like that?

515
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,500
She's all right. I like her.

516
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,500
I checked the computer.
It's Bay 9, Cell 11. It's right on the bottom.

517
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,500
- You working the light, ain't you?
- I'm on it, yeah.

518
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,600
- Did they say anything else?
- No. Just that it's the same money to us.

519
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,000
Let's go.

520
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,600
All right, Uncle Frank.

521
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,100
- Winona.
- Jimmy, where you been?

522
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Look who it is. Sailor Boy.

523
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
- You owe me $10.
- Fuck you.

524
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,200
You told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.
You made it happen, Jay.

525
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,400
- I told him where you didn't wanna go.
- Yeah, and they sent me there.

526
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,200
I knew Rawls was pissed,
I didn't know how pissed.

527
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,000
What can I tell you?

528
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,000
- Where's Bunk?
- Out on a call with Crutchfield.

529
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,200
What's up with the girl?
She come off the bridge or what?

530
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,900
Doc Frazier posted her today.
Blunt-force trauma to the head and chest.

531
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
He says she's dead
before she hits the water.

532
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,300
What about the defense wounds?

533
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,800
Bruising on three fingers?
We saw that as soon as we picked her up.

534
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,700
You missed the defense wounds?

535
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,200
I wasn't looking.
Thought she went off the bridge.

536
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,500
Also, she's in the drink
with no coat or shoes.

537
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,100
Maybe that stuff comes off in the water,
maybe not.

538
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,400
I don't see her going to the bridge in winter
dressed like she was.

539
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,400
But then that's just me.

540
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,200
Tell Bunk I was here, will you?

541
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,500
Have fun.

542
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,200
We already had our fun.
Dumping her on Baltimore County.

543
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,800
On the County?

544
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,600
You fished her out east of the bridge.
That's Baltimore County. She's their stat.

545
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,800
- You sold them on that?
- Rawls did.

546
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,200
He called up the Colonel and said:

547
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,100
"You got one hell of a murder
on your hands."

548
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,400
It's all about self-preservation, Jimmy.

549
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,400
Something you never learned.

550
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,300
Hey, Norris. State Police, Line 2.

551
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,800
A little to the right!

552
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,400
Good, bring her down!

553
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,000
It's there whenever they want it.

554
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,500
Now that you are my client, Mr. Bell...

555
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,400
we are protected
by the attorney-client privilege.

556
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,500
- I thought Roberto would be here.
- Not likely.

557
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,500
This, I'm afraid, was in Monday's papers.

558
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,200
It seems Roberto Castellano y Silva
has been targeted by the DEA.

559
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,100
That's why we didn't do the business?

560
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,600
Right now, Roberto and his people aren't
going to be getting involved in anything...

561
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,000
that could further complicate the situation.

562
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,400
You know, usually, when you take a fall,
you get right back in there...

563
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,700
- 'cause you know nobody's watching, right?
- Sometimes.

564
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,600
And sometimes you wonder
how it is you got caught in the first place.

565
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,300
And you decide to change the pattern.

566
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,900
He took our money?

567
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,100
Your advance payment arrived
as our problem did.

568
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,100
And I'm told the money
is on the way back to Baltimore.

569
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,700
You know, I get the feeling
that you're blaming us...

570
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,300
for Roberto's predicament.

571
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,600
Perhaps your problems in Baltimore
and my client's problems here...

572
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,300
are coincidental.

573
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,300
- But right now --
- Listen to me.

574
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,600
He was the first to know that we took a hit.

575
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,900
He knows no one came close
to rolling over us...

576
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,400
and all the documents from the case.

577
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,100
Nonetheless, we have a legitimate concern.

578
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,100
Considering the scope
of Mr. Barksdale's operation...

579
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,800
his sentence was, to say the least, mild.

580
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,500
But if the possibility exists,
however unlikely...

581
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,300
that the leniency he received
was the result of cooperation...

582
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,500
You understand our position, I'm sure.

583
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,600
Frank, it's sitting out there waiting...

584
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,800
and this Russian fuck
won't take it off the pier.

585
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,900
I ain't blind.

586
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,200
I don't like it
sitting out in the open that long.

587
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,800
The customs seal is broke.
Somebody's gonna see it.

588
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,100
Our asses are hanging out here.

589
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,500
- Yeah?
- Nicky, what the fuck? It's still here.

590
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,200
- Shit.
- Yeah.

591
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,800
- Where's Sergei?
- He's parked at the end of the lot.

592
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,500
- What's he waiting for?
- I got no fucking idea.

593
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,700
But the ship's almost empty.
They need to shit or get off the pot.

594
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
- I'll look into it.
- Yeah.

595
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,700
Okay, I understand.

596
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,000
Fuck it. Get it on a fifth wheel
and lose it in the stack. We're at risk.

597
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,800
I ain't lying when I say
this paperwork is kicking my ass.

598
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,900
Maybe so. But the end of the day,
you come through the door in one piece.

599
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,800
You like to think so.

600
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,600
But all these paper cuts
are starting to take their toll.

601
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,400
You big, nasty detective. Come here.

602
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,700
Let me give your little boo-boo a kiss.

603
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,000
- All this?
- I'm just getting started.

604
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,500
$1000 for the doctor.

605
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,500
$1000 each time, girlfriend.
Every month till I'm pregnant.

606
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,300
There's gotta be a better way.

607
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,700
That would be on you, sweetheart.

608
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,100
Come up with a suitable donor
and we pay a lot less.

609
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,000
Not with your pussy
would I fuck anyone of these guys.

610
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,300
What did you just say?
No, you didn't just say that.

611
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,900
Sergeant.

612
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,200
Your floater's come back.

613
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,100
County boys are putting her
on our side of the bridge.

614
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,100
- No fucking way.
- Yeah.

615
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,300
Some useless fuck in our Marine Unit
faxed them a report...

616
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,900
on the early morning tides
and wind currents.

617
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,500
Shows the body went in the water
west of the bridge and drifted out.

618
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,200
McNulty.

619
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,300
Fucking Jimmy.
Fucking with us for the fun of it.

620
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,700
I gotta give the son of a bitch
some credit for wit on this one.

621
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,500
- Cocksucker.
- Motherfucker.

622
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
The count is right. What's on the shelf?

623
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,800
Mace carrying 10 down here.
So, Moe Man holding about 38 up top.

624
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,800
I checked the stash, and we way low.

625
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,900
- Moe Man taking our shit.
- What he holding?

626
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,100
He say he holds about 30-something,
but I know that ain't right.

627
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,700
I'm gonna fuck him up.

628
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,900
First thing you think to do
is fuck a nigger up.

629
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,700
When your brick brain gonna realize
there's more to this...

630
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,900
than just thumpin' on niggers?

631
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
- What Moe supposed to be holding?
- 38, thereabout.

632
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,000
- Ain't you the damn fool?
- But then we low.

633
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,100
Look, nigger, if we low,
it 'cause String want us that way.

634
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,900
When he wants us up, we be up.
String is on top of the shit.

635
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,300
He on top of everything.

636
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,100
Go back to your spot, man.

637
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,900
Fucking McNulty.

638
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,700
The Prince of Tides.

639
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
- Brother, you feeling strong today?
- Yeah.

640
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,500
See if you can get his ass out of that chair.

641
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,200
He said it was fine
if you wanted to hit him, too.

642
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,200
What's the first thing a guy from Local 47
does after he gets laid?

643
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,200
- What?
- Wipes the pepper spray from his eyes.

644
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,400
Hey, Frank. Something's going on.

645
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,100
- It's fucking girls, man. Young ones.
- There's a dozen of them.

646
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,000
Dead? They're dead?
