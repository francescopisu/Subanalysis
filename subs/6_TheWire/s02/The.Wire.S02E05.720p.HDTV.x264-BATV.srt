1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,800
My man.

2
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,900
Ain't but $290 here.

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
Goddamn it, Frog,
when you work a g-pack for a guy...

4
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,500
a kickback's supposed to be $500.

5
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,000
Stash got hit, yo.

6
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,900
I ain't hearing that shit!
I want my fucking money!

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
You'd best know
I ain't playing, motherfucker.

8
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,300
Okay, that's how you want it? Fine!

9
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,500
But when I roll back past here tomorrow,
money gonna be right, or you gonna see.

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,100
You gonna see who you're fucking with!

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,500
Do I look like a fucking punk?

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Yo, shorty.

13
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,700
Get me a Snapple
and a bag of crab chips from the corner.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,300
What the fuck is your problem, asshole?

15
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,400
Fuck, this is bad shit!

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Fuck, this is really bad.

17
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,700
Shit.

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,100
Get your ass out that car.

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,200
All right!

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,400
Shut up.

21
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,200
Where the money at? Check his socks.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
You got something for me here, Zig?

23
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,400
You got some dough for me, man?

24
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,100
Jesus, jackpot.

25
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,500
Man, hold up, man.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Ain't enough here to really
call this shit money, man.

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,300
Cheese, take it easy, I'm working on it.
But my people, you know...

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,700
What the fuck you think this is, man?

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,400
What, you think this supposed
to get played some other way?

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,700
Is that what you think, man?

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Damn it, son of a bitch, that hurt.

32
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,700
Yeah, I know it did.

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
All right, look, how about the coat?

34
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,900
Take the coat, all right?

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,800
I paid two large for it...

36
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,900
so that, plus the cash I gave you...

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,300
and then I can get $700 more
by the end of the week.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,100
You know I will!

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,600
You know right there, you can fix that.

40
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,000
$2,000?

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,700
For this?

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Not even a black man could style that shit.

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,100
You know what I'm saying, man?

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,400
What you laughing at, man?

45
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,200
Chill, be cool about it.
I'll get your money by Friday.

46
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,100
Then you'll see there's no need
to get all fucking dramatic out here!

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Look, man, if I ain't paid by Friday,
you dead by Saturday, man.

48
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,200
Yo, take my man's ride.

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,400
Fuck, I need that! I fucking need that!

50
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,300
Fuck you!

51
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Why me?

52
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,300
You don't want the posting,
I'll take someone else.

53
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Valchek gave me the pick of his district.

54
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,100
I'm not saying I don't want it.

55
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,100
I'm asking why you would choose me
after what happened last go around.

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Yeah, I thought about that, too.

57
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
Looking at the list of names
on the southeastern roster...

58
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm saying to myself:

59
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,900
"Why take a man
who already burned you once...

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,300
"who already proved himself disloyal?"

61
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,900
Now, why would I do that?

62
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,700
I have no fucking clue, Lieutenant.

63
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,500
Because if I caught him once...

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
he might be the last
son of a bitch to try it twice.

65
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,400
I'm guessing you got enough
shame from the last time...

66
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,400
so that it won't happen again.

67
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,100
No, sir, it won't.

68
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,500
One other thing...

69
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,100
as far as I'm concerned,
those stripes on your sleeve aren't earned.

70
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,500
Your paycheck may say "sergeant,"
but on this detail...

71
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Det. Greggs runs your team.

72
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,900
Same as it ever was.

73
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Well?

74
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm in.

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,500
Come here, you sweet bitch.

76
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Motherfu --

77
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,900
Don't be grabbing my dick, faggot.

78
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,000
I raised him on the radio.
He's on his way in right now.

79
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,600
Appreciate that, Officer. Nice day.

80
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,200
Summit Silver 450.

81
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,900
Top of the line, right here.

82
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,600
Over there?

83
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,100
Yo, Bubs.

84
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,900
McNulty, the sailor man? Watch the front.

85
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,100
Here. Stick that on that thing there,
will you?

86
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,300
The cleat? Ain't you know nothing?

87
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,100
Look at you, I don't know,
maybe it's just me...

88
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,900
but something's way the fuck
wrong with this picture.

89
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,800
What the hell is that?

90
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,000
A Baltimore knot.

91
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,800
What the hell is a Baltimore knot?

92
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,700
I don't know, but it's never
the same thing twice.

93
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,900
What can I tell you?
My detecting days are over.

94
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,200
What the fuck you have me
hunt up Omar then for?

95
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,200
That's old business. You remember Bird?

96
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,500
His trial's up next week.
Omar's got some witnessing to do.

97
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,100
He said you can reach him
here at this number.

98
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,800
You can leave a message.

99
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,600
Good work, Bubs.

100
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,200
As always. Here.

101
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,700
Cab fare.

102
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,700
You say tit-for-tat,
and we let slide on a little county caper.

103
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,200
I got to think that, you know,
you need to think about...

104
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,700
what you had me
endeavoring to accomplish.

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,300
I mean, what the fuck, man?

106
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,100
I'm not out there asking about
no random-ass, who-give-a-damn nigger.

107
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,000
No, sir. I'm making inquiries in your behalf...

108
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,400
in regards to that fucking unforgiving,
motherfucking Omar, man.

109
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,800
Why? He play you hard?

110
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,100
I go at him respectable...

111
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,700
he put that goddamn
shotgun in my face, man.

112
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,900
I'm looking at two tubes
of the harbor tunnel...

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,500
staring right at me, each one about yea-big.

114
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
I damn near pissed in my pants...

115
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,200
and he stood smiling like this shit is funny.

116
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,600
It ain't funny.

117
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,700
McNulty, I know I'm paying
taxes on some things...

118
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,500
I got to believe this
is more aggregation than:

119
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,100
"Good work, bubs, " and a little bit of this.

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,300
For your pains.

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,900
Where are we at with the Jane Does?

122
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,800
Taking a hard look at the port,
we're gonna drop a grand jury summons...

123
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,800
on every stevedore who worked the ship,
keep rattling cages.

124
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,600
How's the port police broad
working out for us?

125
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
She knows the docks okay.

126
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,800
No detective, though.

127
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In that case, you need someone fresh.
Cole, maybe, Massy or whoever's up.

128
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,600
You need to get over
to the southeastern today.

129
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,500
You're detailed temporarily.

130
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,000
Colonel, respectfully,
did you just fuck me over...

131
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,200
without giving me even half
a chance to clear this case?

132
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,500
Let's be clear, Det. Freamon.
When I fuck you over, you'll know it.

133
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
You'll be so goddamn certain,
you won't need to ask the question.

134
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,500
And you, Det. Moreland,
are now all alone with 14 red names.

135
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
How's it feel?

136
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,200
And the parking pad in the rear
is invaluable for Federal Hill.

137
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,900
The deck has a harbor view?

138
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
Yes, in two directions.

139
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,400
Go on up, take a look. I think you'll love it.

140
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,100
- This ain't Federal Hill.
- Excuse me?

141
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,000
This is the Point, Locust Point.

142
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,800
As far as real estate goes,
anything that is below Montgomery Street...

143
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,600
and above the water
is now called Federal Hill.

144
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,300
Are you two house hunting?

145
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,600
We just started.

146
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,300
If you're interested in this area,
I could run some listings for you.

147
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,900
- This particular house --
- Is my aunt Treesey's.

148
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,000
Really, your aunt?
Is she a relation to the McDonalds?

149
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,700
Nope. She's a relation to me.

150
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,900
She died, like, four years ago.
The family sold the house right after.

151
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,800
Is that the price?

152
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
That's the listing, yes.

153
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,800
They ain't gonna get that much, right?

154
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,800
I can't say for certain, but one just like it...

155
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,400
in the 1200 block
sold for $340,000 last week.

156
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
$340,000?

157
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

158
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,200
Maybe we should rent.

159
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
We're here because Valchek wants us here...

160
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,400
because he believes this man
and his down-at-the-heels union local...

161
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,700
has too much money.

162
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,500
To start with, you and Freamon
are gonna put some DNRs...

163
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,100
on the union hall phones.

164
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,500
Also, run what you can on the
union finances and on Sobotka personally.

165
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,800
We put that together, copy it to the major
to show him we're on it...

166
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,700
and buy ourselves a little time.

167
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,100
Meanwhile, you three, do what you do best.

168
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Find out where port folks like to cop
on a Friday night...

169
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,100
set up some hand-to-hands,
maybe a reverse or two.

170
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,300
A lot of these port guys are white,
aren't they?

171
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,800
I mean, some of the southeast
street dealers, too.

172
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
So that means
you're gonna need a white boy...

173
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,900
to go down to some of these
southeastern corners, right?

174
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,900
So Kima, Carv on the rooftops.
It's my time to front.

175
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,500
I'll show you how it's done, homes.

176
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,600
Cool Lester smooth.

177
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
What's happening?

178
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Same fuck-ups in the same shit detail...

179
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,800
working out of the same
shithouse kind of office.

180
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,400
You people lack for personal growth,
you know that?

181
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,700
It's a temporary posting.
Rawls gets you back at the end of the run.

182
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,600
If he wants me.
Last I looked, I was high on his shit list.

183
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,500
- Then we did you a favor.
- I wouldn't go that far.

184
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,500
But fuck it. Who we chasing?

185
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,300
Frank Sobotka?

186
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,500
- How fucking good is he?
- You know the man?

187
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
Me and Bunk Moreland
were fucking with this guy last week...

188
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,200
working that case about
dead girls in the container.

189
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
He a suspect?

190
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,500
No, just someone who know what's
getting done on the port terminals.

191
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,000
- Why are you on him?
- My father-in-law hates his guts.

192
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,400
Which, in the southeastern,
goes for probable cause.

193
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,700
Valchek thinks he has too much cash.

194
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,100
So you're thinking drugs?

195
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,500
In this fucking town,
what other crime is there?

196
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,200
You know I would've been
down here sooner, it's just...

197
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,500
with Terrell being sick and all...

198
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,200
But, Dee, I got everything we need paid for.

199
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,000
When you come home, Stringer's
saying they gonna hook you up...

200
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,000
with something out of the mix.

201
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,700
Like running a club,
or straight business, like.

202
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,000
String say they gonna
keep you apart from it...

203
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,300
and give back some time for family.

204
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,000
For you and me and Terrell.

205
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,900
Family?

206
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,000
They thinking about
how they can do for you.

207
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,400
They making all these plans...

208
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,300
even though you been
playing cold with your uncle.

209
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Stringer says so, anyhow.

210
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,100
Why you be like that?

211
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Throwing them off
when they looking to do for you?

212
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,700
They playing you with that
"We're family, and it's all about love."

213
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,900
That's how they do.

214
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,900
When they got no more use for you,
that family shit disappears.

215
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,100
It's just about business, Donette.

216
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,200
Dee, they gonna be there for us.

217
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,500
What's up, man? You got that Death Grip.

218
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,900
- You know Stony got that check.
- Slow down, fool.

219
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm saying you need to spend that shit here.

220
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
- Death Grip be the fucking bomb, yo.
- I ain't got no ends.

221
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,500
Motherfucker said it ain't shit.

222
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,300
No, I ain't say that.

223
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,700
That's enough, yo, let that shit be.

224
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,400
- Fuck you all.
- Yeah, motherfucker?

225
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,200
Yo, B.

226
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,600
Shit jumping off in the Pit, yo.

227
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Damn.

228
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,500
What the fuck was that?

229
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,500
Fiend badmouthing our shit,
saying Death Grip ain't all that.

230
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,800
Now we're beating niggers
over speaking the truth?

231
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,700
I ain't hit him, the young'uns, yo.
You can't tell these fools nothing.

232
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,500
We stomping niggers over bullshit, man.

233
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,700
Somebody got to pull Stringer up on this.

234
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,200
Zig, what's up?

235
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,400
Jesus, Zig, what the fuck happened?

236
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,300
Fucking niggers got me.

237
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
What?

238
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,000
Took my money, and they got Princess, too.

239
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,300
You hear me? They got my fucking car.

240
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,300
If I had a gun, I swear to God...

241
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,900
I would've capped every one
of those motherfuckers.

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
- You call the cops?
- Can't.

243
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,900
It was over some dope.

244
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,100
You bought a fucking package, didn't you?

245
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,000
Serves you right, you stupid fuck.

246
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,100
From who? White Mike?

247
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,800
This nigger Cheese,
up on Wolfe and Ashland.

248
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,600
- A few ounces, you know?
- Why not White Mike?

249
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,400
Fuck Mike, you know how he be.

250
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,200
Why the fuck would I know how he be?

251
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,100
Nicky, it ain't my fault, all right? It ain't.

252
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,800
Look, business has been slow,
package ain't turned around yet.

253
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,300
But the fucking hoodleheads ain't hearing it,
so I get jumped.

254
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,400
They got Princess, man.
They're holding her for fucking ransom.

255
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,900
And now they're telling me...

256
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,200
if I don't have the money by Friday,
they're going to kill me.

257
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,600
I need $2,700.

258
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,700
So?

259
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,100
You're a drug dealer,
go sell some fucking drugs.

260
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,900
You fucked up the package, didn't you, Zig?

261
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,600
I ain't giving you the money.

262
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
They're gonna kill me.

263
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,300
I gave my money to Aimee for an apartment.

264
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,300
Security deposit and some
furniture over at Littlepages.

265
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,800
I ain't got it for you, Zig.

266
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,900
You cocksuckers.

267
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,500
- Major in?
- Yeah, just knock.

268
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,700
Yeah?

269
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,500
We're about to make some
hand-to-hands around the port.

270
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,800
Lt. Daniels said I should see you about
a surveillance van.

271
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,900
The van?
The van's on loan to the southwest.

272
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,800
Okay.

273
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,900
Fuck with my ass, will you?

274
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,800
Bringing us back to our old friends,
supply and demand.

275
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,300
All right, your research papers are here.

276
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,500
Remember Friday, take-home test.

277
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,800
Well done, Mr. Bell.

278
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,800
- Mr. Lucas, you got five minutes?
- Absolutely.

279
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,500
There's something
maybe you can help me out with.

280
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I'll try.

281
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,900
What are the options
when you got an inferior product...

282
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
in an aggressive marketplace?

283
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,400
If you have a large share of the market,
you can buy up the competition.

284
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,800
And if you don't?

285
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,800
Reduce price to increase market share.

286
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,500
That assumes low overhead.

287
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,100
Of course, otherwise,
you operate at a loss...

288
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,900
and worse, as your prices drop...

289
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,400
your product eventually
loses consumer credibility.

290
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,300
You know, the new CEO of WorldCom
was faced with this very problem.

291
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,700
The company was linked
to one of the largest fraud cases in history.

292
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,500
- So he proposed --
- To change the name?

293
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Exactly.

294
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,600
Which one?

295
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,600
He's got a weenie in his hand.

296
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,900
On this case, ain't that you?

297
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,300
Thomas Pakusa, come on down.

298
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,800
What the fuck is that?

299
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,400
Grand jury summons.

300
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,900
Grand jury?

301
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,700
You lie to us, you hurt our feelings.

302
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
You lie to them, it's perjury.

303
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,700
And one more I just dropped
on your barbecue chef outside.

304
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,800
You used to be a lot more fun,
you know that, Bea?

305
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,700
That's John Spamanato right there.

306
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,500
Johnny Fifty. How you doing, Officer?

307
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Johnny Fifty?

308
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,900
What the fuck is that?

309
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,300
Son of a bitch drinks 53 beers
on his 25th birthday.

310
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,700
So as to be, what do you call it,
poetical, we rounded it off.

311
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,400
"Grand jury for the circuit
court of Baltimore City."

312
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,700
You worked the Atlantic Light, right?

313
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,900
Everybody on that ship testifies.

314
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,100
About what?

315
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,100
About them girls in the can.

316
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,200
The detective here thinks
we know something about that mess.

317
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
He thinks we'd leave them there
on the dock...

318
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,100
in a box, dying there in the dark because...

319
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,900
Because why, Detective?

320
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,800
What reason would we have
to want girls to die like that?

321
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,000
Why would any of us leave them in there
if we knew anything about it?

322
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,300
I got a wife and three sisters.

323
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,300
And they got daughters.

324
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,000
And I got too much respect for women
not to be pissed off...

325
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,600
at what's in your heads right now.

326
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,000
Of all the cans on the terminal,
that's the one you lose in the stacks.

327
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,900
We didn't know shit, goddamn it!

328
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,700
You want us to dance
with a grand jury, we will!

329
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,700
What do you say, Johnny?
What do you say to any question?

330
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,100
I take the fifth commandment.

331
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,500
And if they offer you immunity
to testify against your union brothers?

332
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,500
- I don't remember.
- Don't remember what?

333
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,700
Nothing.

334
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,200
What you're forgetting
is that every I.B.S. local on the East Coast...

335
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,700
has had its ass in front of a federal
grand jury two or three times already.

336
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,000
You want to throw your summonses?
Throw them.

337
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,200
You want to subpoena our records?
You don't need a subpoena no more.

338
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,100
Our books were open
to the Justice Department for eight years.

339
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,700
We're here through
Bobby Kennedy, Tricky Dick Nixon...

340
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,500
Ronnie "The Union Buster" Reagan,
and half a dozen other sons of bitches.

341
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,500
We'll be here
through your weak bullshit, no problem!

342
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
These four ain't working today.

343
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,700
You wanna leave the papers here...

344
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,700
I'll make sure they get them
and go downtown on them.

345
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,300
Come on.

346
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,500
- Today?
- Now!

347
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,200
You described the weapon
used to kill Mr. Gant...

348
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,200
as a .380 semi-automatic.

349
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,900
You provided the size,
and even suggested the manufacturer:

350
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,300
"Australian, or one of those 'A' countries."

351
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,200
Is that correct?

352
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,400
Indeed.

353
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,000
And you were approximately
50 feet from the shooter?

354
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,600
Yes, ma'am, you know, give or take.

355
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
Mr. Little, at that distance
how were you able to determine...

356
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,800
who manufactured the weapon?

357
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,400
I wasn't.

358
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,400
Then how were you able
to relate that information...

359
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,900
to the detectives?

360
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,600
Bird showed it to me.

361
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,200
He showed you the weapon
before the murder?

362
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,100
Which murder we talking?

363
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,200
Bird committed more than one murder?

364
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,000
Fish got to swim,
you know what I'm saying?

365
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,300
Like I said before, Bird was
showing that thing to everybody...

366
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,700
talking about this deed and the next.

367
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,500
I didn't pay him no mind until you all came
and showed him some interest.

368
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,300
Mr. Little,
if you wouldn't mind waiting outside...

369
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,900
I'd like a few words with Officer McNulty.

370
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,300
I thought he did good.

371
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,500
Imagine the mileage
Maury Levy gets out of me...

372
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,800
putting that sociopath on the stand.

373
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,100
You got to admit, it'll be different.

374
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,600
Dress him up at least.

375
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,400
I can't have him on the stand
looking like that.

376
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,500
Here's a voucher for court clothes.

377
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,600
Anything with a tie.

378
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,200
I'm saying, Dirt...

379
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,900
you wanna be my nigger,
you got to be with me for real.

380
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,900
You see what I'm saying, yo?

381
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,500
Well, I'll be.

382
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,400
All the time I be telling you, be on post.

383
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,800
But damn, homes,
you all the time up in some damn crib...

384
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,200
trying to play house with them bitches.

385
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm saying, you all be seriously
fucked up because I'm out here...

386
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,900
getting done what needs done.
Feel me, nigga?

387
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,200
Thieving motherfuckers
take everything, don't they?

388
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,800
You know what I'm saying, Dirt.

389
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,200
You wanna be my nigger,
you gots to deliver for real.

390
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
How'd we do, Charlie?

391
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,300
I've almost got one of them ready to swear
that the docks are actually near the water.

392
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,500
They don't scare, them guys.

393
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,300
What now?

394
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,600
You telling me you never had
a CI down there, right?

395
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,300
A CI?

396
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,200
An informant.

397
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,700
You ain't got no informants on the dock?

398
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,000
Someone you could go to on this?
Someone you got a history with?

399
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,700
They say a police is only
as good as his informants.

400
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,500
Meaning, we ain't about much.

401
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,000
The voucher says $150.

402
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,200
Look on the clearance rack.

403
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
- It's a look.
- No, it ain't.

404
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,700
You figure it out for yourself. I'm going
across the street to the federal building.

405
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,600
I'll see you in about a half-hour.

406
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Look, man, if I ain't here, I'm round
the way on Howard Street, Liddell's.

407
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,600
Either that, or I'll be with Muffy at the club.

408
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,600
Where's he at?

409
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,700
Said he had to go get his props.

410
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,700
12-08.

411
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
12-08.

412
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Request lateral with 12-10.

413
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,000
KGA, he can meet me on 6.

414
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,400
Do you copy, 12-08?

415
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,200
10-4, on 6.

416
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Yo, dickhead, where you been at?

417
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,400
When you're working deep cover, Carv,
you got to get into the part.

418
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,300
What's up? You need a little help?

419
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,000
Maybe, bro. You got any raw up in here?

420
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,400
- You got it to spend?
- For sure.

421
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
All right, then we good.
Go and holler at my niggers round back.

422
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,300
Yo, Carv. You copy this?
It's all in the props, baby.

423
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,000
All in the props.

424
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,000
Feel any different? Me neither.

425
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,300
- Special Agent Cleary.
- Jim McNulty, from the city.

426
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,900
How can I help you?

427
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,900
Found floating off the Key Bridge.

428
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,600
We think she's linked to the dead girls
found in the container at Patapsco.

429
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,500
Your people were just here,
asking for a trace on the can.

430
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,100
- Homicide fellows.
- Black guys, Moreland, Freamon?

431
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,000
- Yeah, you working with them?
- Sort of, I fished her out.

432
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,800
I kind of feel like it's on me
to find her people.

433
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,800
You're kidding, right?

434
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,800
No, I thought maybe
if you guys have, you know...

435
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,800
been pulling in any women who've
been over here on the circuit.

436
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,000
Step into my world, Virginia.

437
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,800
A grand jury?

438
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,700
They snatched up some of our guys,
drove them downtown.

439
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,500
But you know nothing.

440
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,500
Yeah, no shit, we know nothing.

441
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,100
The only guy they got that even knows
you had a can that day was Horse...

442
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,600
and he ain't gonna say shit to nobody.

443
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
You sure?

444
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,300
Horse is a rock.

445
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,500
Don't ever worry about him.
My uncle neither.

446
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,200
But you say he wants to stop.

447
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,700
Yeah, for a little while.

448
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,300
He wants you to stop moving
cans through our docks...

449
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
at least until this shit chills.

450
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
These were local police, right?

451
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
Yeah.

452
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,900
Their interest is in the girls.

453
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,400
That happened on the ship,
the ship is gone.

454
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,700
A dead end.

455
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
The malaka they want,
we already got to in Philly.

456
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,800
Another dead end.

457
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,800
The police are going nowhere.

458
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,200
But, more important,
we address Frank's concerns.

459
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,100
You tell your uncle I will meet with him.

460
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,500
He says he wants to meet with the Greek.

461
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,900
Anything he can say to the Greek,
he can say to me.

462
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
Says he wants the Greek.

463
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,600
Says you tell him when and where.

464
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,100
Niko.

465
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,700
About that other business, the chemicals...

466
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,000
What do you need them for?

467
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,100
It's just business.
Everything is just business with us.

468
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,100
Buy for a nickel, you sell for a dime.

469
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,900
Yeah?

470
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Who wants a dime's worth
of fucking chemicals?

471
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,000
So these are undocumenteds
from just this field office?

472
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,500
Maryland and Delaware only.

473
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,700
Any of them still in your custody?

474
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,300
I'd love the chance to show
some photos, maybe get lucky.

475
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,000
Everyone in that book was deported.

476
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,300
You can guess,
some of them are already back.

477
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,700
Any field office have anything active?

478
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,800
That's what I'm looking at right here.

479
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,300
You got some girls in custody
in San Diego, also Seattle.

480
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,800
Anything I can drive to?

481
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,600
Closest is a case up in Jersey,
Hudson County.

482
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,100
Raid on a couple clubs up there
put 12 in their bullpen four days ago.

483
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,400
That'll work.

484
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,400
So you really gonna go up there
on your own time?

485
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,900
I'll take a day, yeah.

486
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,100
What's between you and this girl?

487
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,800
You seen what happens down
at the morgue, when they can't ID a body?

488
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,000
I have.

489
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,100
Mau. How you been?

490
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,700
- Same old.
- Yeah?

491
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,200
You getting some days?

492
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,700
Pretty much.

493
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,800
I'm in the tower now, working the lanes.

494
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,400
You want to come in?

495
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,300
I got, I don't know, some beers,
maybe some Bacardi around.

496
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,100
Maybe we could just go
for a cup of coffee and talk, you know?

497
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,300
Let me get my jacket.

498
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,600
So I tell him,
"Dee, why you acting like that?"

499
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,000
He just sit there
like I didn't say a damn thing.

500
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,600
He off the damn hook.

501
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,600
You tell him about the plans, right?

502
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,800
I told him you all was gonna
set him up and everything.

503
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,900
And he know how you all been
doing for me while he away.

504
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,400
He knows some.

505
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,900
I mean, damn, he don't need
to know about it all, right?

506
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,400
Anyway, I'm saying I'll
get down there next weekend...

507
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,900
and he look at me like I ain't saying shit.

508
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,100
He say just leave him alone.

509
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,900
Got to turn that roast.
You gonna see, String, for real.

510
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,300
Little Donette know how to burn.

511
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,700
Your father bucking us, little man.

512
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,600
What you think about that?

513
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Yeah. I think you're right.

514
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,900
What you looking at?

515
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,100
Fucking Ziggy, man.

516
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,600
I'm about to get my ass
shot behind his bullshit?

517
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,600
We're reasonable, they're reasonable.

518
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,000
Fuck that, maybe on your side of town.

519
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,000
What's up?

520
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,000
Came to see a man about a car.

521
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,900
Maybe tell Cheese we're here.

522
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
Yo, Cheese. White boy.

523
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,400
Yo, you got my money, man?

524
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,400
That's what we came to talk about.

525
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,500
Yo, you got to a lot of heart...

526
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,700
coming up in here
without my fucking money.

527
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,200
We thought maybe
we can work something out...

528
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,900
so you can get what's yours.

529
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,500
How you plan to do that?

530
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,300
You give the car back,
I'll get him to sell it off.

531
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,700
Camaro with a 350 in it,
it's got to be worth more than $3,000.

532
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,200
That's right clever. Right clever, I got to say.

533
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,400
And I appreciate you all
coming all this way so much...

534
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,800
I'll give the boy another week to pay.

535
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,700
Of course, that ride ain't
worth nothing near $3,000.

536
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,500
You don't believe me?

537
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,800
Have a look.

538
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,500
You show up at my door,
I'm thinking better thoughts than this.

539
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
And you counted on that?

540
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,900
Who else am I gonna ask?

541
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,700
I ain't no snitch, Beadie.

542
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Not even for you am I a snitch.

543
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,800
I'm not thinking about it like that.

544
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,900
I'm thinking, here's a guy,
and we had some times together...

545
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,600
and even though, you know, it didn't
get to where he might have wanted it...

546
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,000
he's still a good guy...

547
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
someone I can talk to about this.

548
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,400
How come it didn't go nowhere?

549
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
You did good. Who knows?

550
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I don't know, you never know.

551
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,100
I could show you pictures of how they died.
Broken fingernails, blood on the walls.

552
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,100
All of a sudden, you're a cop.

553
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,600
Help me with this, Mau.

554
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,300
You didn't get shit from grabbing up
Horseface and them, did you?

555
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,400
It's kind of funny when you think about it.

556
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,600
I mean, you running around
like your head's all chopped off...

557
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,800
looking for someone to clue you in...

558
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,500
when a lot of what you're asking about...

559
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,100
is right there for the taking.

560
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,300
How so?

561
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,900
Used to be us checkers did
everything with paper and a pencil, right?

562
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,600
Every move on a ship, we wrote it down.

563
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,600
When that ship sails,
and there ain't no problems...

564
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,800
then that paper gets tossed.

565
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,900
That don't happen today, right?

566
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
Nothing gets tossed anymore.

567
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,000
The computer.

568
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,000
Thanks, Mau.

569
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Well?

570
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,300
Good news and bad, Zig.

571
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,500
Those fucking niggers.

572
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,400
Give me the bad.

573
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,600
They're still gonna kill you.
They're gonna wait a week.

574
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
What the fuck can be good?

575
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,500
You can cancel your car insurance.

576
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,700
Let me get two red tops.

577
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,600
There we go.

578
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,100
I hope you guys are taking notes.

579
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,800
Shit.

580
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,100
One-and-one.

581
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,400
One more time with that toothpick,
I'm going to stab his eye with it.

582
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,800
Ashamed he should be to be Greek
and call this a diner.

583
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,700
A talk would ease his mind.

584
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,900
Ease my mind first.

585
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,300
This business with the grand jury.

586
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,700
We checked the courthouse.
There is nothing special.

587
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,000
Just the regular panels.

588
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,700
They're trying to scare
the men on the docks.

589
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,100
- And?
- Nobody talks.

590
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,900
But Sobotka, as I said, he's upset.

591
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,600
It is more attention than he expected.

592
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,200
He will need money for his lawyers.

593
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,700
Double his fee.
But I don't need to meet with him.

594
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,100
Let the money talk.

595
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,900
Everything we get from
Atlanta been walked on.

596
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,500
Each one weaker than the other.

597
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,400
And this nigger Roberto
is on the shelf to us right now.

598
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,800
I mean, it's getting hard
to hold onto the Towers...

599
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,000
without our name all over
the product is what I'm saying.

600
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,200
Who got the good shit?

601
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Eastside.

602
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,300
Eastside, who?

603
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,900
This nigger Milton got a small cut,
Prop Joe...

604
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
this Jamaican cat who got
the strip off Gay Street.

605
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,700
You talking about Petey, Petey Dixon.

606
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,700
You go over to the expressway
at lunchtime...

607
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,100
you can watch the fiends
traveling from west to east.

608
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,200
Damn!

609
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,800
I mean, I'm cutting shit with shit right now,
trying to cheat, but sooner or later.

610
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,900
I hear you, man, I'm on it.

611
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,700
You working it out with Dee?

612
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,000
Boy got to find his own way.

613
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,900
I'm saying, you know...

614
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,100
I think we should keep
reaching out to this kid.

615
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,000
Give something to him and his girl.
I don't know, show them we got a plan.

616
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,600
Take some real estate, put it in Dee's name.

617
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,100
He has something to come home to.

618
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,500
Do it.

619
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Thing is, String, what happened happened,
you know what I mean?

620
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,400
Push come to shove,
I've been fair to him, ain't I?

621
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,600
You've been fair.

622
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,800
Too fair.

623
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,900
- Where's the Greek?
- He sent me.

624
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,800
Fuck you, and fuck him.

625
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,100
Frank, he sent me to tell you
that we're doubling your fee...

626
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,700
to help with any legal troubles.

627
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,700
He also told me to tell you he regrets...

628
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,900
that you're still having problems
on our behalf.

629
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,600
They're throwing my people
in back of police cars...

630
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,800
and this asshole can't even talk
face to face?

631
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,400
I'm done. I'm out.

632
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,300
I need nothing more to do with you people.

633
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,100
I don't need the trouble or the money.
I got a union to run.

634
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,800
They used to make steel there, no?

635
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,100
Smoke from the stacks.

636
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,400
But inside...

637
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,000
Potassium permanganate.

638
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,400
Spell "permanganate."

639
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,000
F-U-C-K.

640
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,500
You even know what the fuck
you're doing there, Zig?

641
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,000
I'm in the checker's local, right?

642
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,300
You know, while you Local 47 boys...

643
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,700
were having bulk cargo
dropped on your heads...

644
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,700
we was out grabbing the future by the balls.

645
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,900
So you just type that shit in there
and ask it for an answer?

646
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,700
Let me ask you:

647
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,200
Why do we give a fuck what the shit is for?

648
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,900
If they want it, they want it.

649
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,400
I mean, besides,
if I don't get some money soon...

650
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,200
I'm fucking toasted.

651
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,700
I don't know who you've been talking to...

652
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,000
but we don't have
that kind of stealing going on down here.

653
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,400
- It's not like the old days.
- No?

654
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,800
A little here and there,
but for the most part...

655
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,700
the new technology
has changed everything.

656
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,500
Look, see this little box right here?

657
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
You fucking mind?

658
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,700
Ring's a little stressed right now...

659
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,900
having misplaced a frozen can
full of Japanese tuna steaks...

660
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,100
supposed to be at the Jessup
wholesale market by yesterday.

661
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,300
Bite me.

662
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,200
- Frank, these officers are --
- I know who they are.

663
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,000
Frank here helped set this system up.

664
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,100
He probably can explain it better than I can,
if he doesn't mind.

665
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,800
No problem, chief.

666
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,000
In a nutshell, what this shows...

667
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,300
is the Aqua Verde at Berth 4.

668
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,500
The plan calls for 85 moves.

669
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,000
That's cans, containers, coming off the ship,
and others going back on.

670
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,200
Now, look at the screen.

671
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,500
Every time a can goes on or off,
the computer creates a record...

672
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,100
and puts it in the permanent database.

673
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,400
He was saying the computer makes it
hard to steal off the docks.

674
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,600
Did our port manager tell you
that right now...

675
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,200
we got 160 boxes missing
off the Patapsco terminal alone?

676
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,000
Or that last time
we inventoried the truck chassis...

677
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,900
we came up 300 light?

678
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,600
No, I suppose not.
That's management for you.

679
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,800
160?

680
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,300
Not that all of them are stolen.

681
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,400
You can lose a can by accident, no problem.

682
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,200
For one thing,
these hand-helds use radio waves.

683
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,800
With all the equipment
and container stacks out there...

684
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,300
sometimes waves get knocked down.

685
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,100
That happens, a can don't get entered.

686
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,800
Or, just as easy,
a checker makes the wrong entry.

687
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,700
Either 'cause he's lazy, he's sloppy,
or he's still shitfaced from the night before.

688
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,900
Or, simpler than that, you got fat fingers.
No offense.

689
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,400
So imagine February on the docks.

690
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,600
You're wearing Gortex gloves,
trying to punch numbers on that thing.

691
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
You're saying
that's what happened to the can...

692
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,500
with the girls in it?

693
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Beadie, darling,
I don't know what happened there.

694
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,700
I'm just saying, if you go by the computer...

695
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,000
it might look like
there's some dirt going down...

696
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,200
when it's really just a glitch in the system.

697
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,400
The customs seal was broke on that box.
Shouldn't that get noticed?

698
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,000
You're offloading a ship
the size of a small town.

699
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,200
You might notice a broke seal,
you might not.

700
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,300
Look, you wanna keep
pulling our chain, you can.

701
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,500
But it ain't like it's just
that one box that went missing.

702
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,200
We lose them sons of bitches all the time.

703
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,000
- Frank give you everything you need?
- He did, thanks.

704
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,600
They're playing us.

705
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,900
You drove all the way from Baltimore
on a hope and a prayer?

706
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,700
Yeah, I'm dead-ended on this.

707
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,500
Is there anything we can offer
any of them for cooperation?

708
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,400
You could marry one of them,
make her an American housewife.

709
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,200
Short of that, they're going back the fuck
where they came from.

710
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,200
- Where do you hold them?
- County detention.

711
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,000
We keep the undocumenteds
out of gen pop.

712
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,300
You all heard of WorldCom?

713
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,600
All right, let's try this.

714
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,200
You all get jacked by some knockos.

715
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,000
But you all clean.

716
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,900
You all got an outstanding warrant,
like everybody in here.

717
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,500
What do you do?

718
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,000
Give another name.

719
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,100
Why?

720
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,100
Because your real name ain't no good.

721
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,100
All right, it ain't good and...
Follow through.

722
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,700
All right, Death Grip ain't shit?

723
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,100
Then change up the name.

724
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,400
What else?

725
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,900
Yo, I got it, change the caps
from red to blue, right?

726
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,300
Make it look like we got
some fresh shit, boom.

727
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,700
You know what else we might could do?
Give each tower its own name, right?

728
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,300
And then we do, like, some fake competing.

729
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,300
So, a fiend gets some bad shit from one,
he'd go back to the other.

730
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,300
There's a thinking man, right there.

731
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,500
See, nigger,
ain't that what the fuck I just said?

732
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,400
You and my uncle talk?

733
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,000
How'd it go?

734
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,900
No problem.

735
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,500
Three boxes.

736
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,500
All of them on the Wilhelmina.
And you should tell your uncle...

737
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,300
that it's three times the usual fee for each.

738
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,000
We checked on those chemicals.

739
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,600
We looked into that.

740
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,700
I was worried, you know?

741
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,700
Before I deliver, I wanna know
what you need it for.

742
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,000
A bomb or some shit?

743
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,200
I ain't down for that.

744
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,800
You use that shit
to process drugs, don't you?

745
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,000
Cocaine.

746
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,000
You still want it,
I got it on the Fairfield piers.

747
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,500
No problem.

748
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
When?

749
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,900
End of the week.

750
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,800
Maryska.

751
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
She's good with English.

752
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,000
They're dead.

753
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,200
All I'm trying to do is
get word to the families.

754
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,300
What did she say?

755
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,700
She wants to know,
if she knows a girl, does she get to stay?

756
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,000
You want a good restaurant for dinner,
or are you headed right back?

757
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,900
A computer?

758
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,200
To run a trace on the missing containers
in the port administration's database.

759
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,400
You're looking for what?

760
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,500
A pattern for our case. We need to know
who left those girls on the dock and why.

761
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,600
We're supposed to be on Sobotka
and the checkers union anyway...

762
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,300
so folding one investigation
into the other makes sense.

763
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,200
Not to me, it doesn't.

764
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,100
I'm not bringing your open murders...

765
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,700
anywhere near this detail,
that's a loser for us.

766
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Lieutenant!

767
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,600
We bring in a few drug rips,
and show that we gave Sobotka...

768
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,900
and his union a quick, fair look,
it's more than enough for Burrell.

769
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,300
He returns the favor,
and I'm out of the basement...

770
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,200
and running an investigative unit again.

771
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,400
You dirty me up with murders I can't solve.
It doesn't play like that.

772
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,900
Homicide's not the place
to sprawl a case, Lieutenant.

773
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,000
Rawls, Landsman...

774
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,200
they have no patience for anything
but a quick shake.

775
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,300
We got enough room for it here, anyway.

776
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,400
You can set up here at the off-site...

777
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,000
and we can share information.

778
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,600
But the murders stay with Homicide.

779
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,100
Unless, of course, you find a suspect.

780
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,100
Three ROIROs, four containers.

781
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,700
I got all my cards up,
including long numbers...

782
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,100
and we're still short.

783
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,200
- A good day.
- That it is.

784
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,200
Everybody works today,
even you, my little j-series wonders.

785
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,500
Even you.

786
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,500
Is Horse working the Wilhelmina today?

787
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,100
I told that motherfucker we were done.
I told him!

788
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,600
He said he talked to you.
He said it's triple-rate for every can.

789
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,300
Triple?

790
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,200
Call Horse in the tower.
Tell him he's working the Wilhelmina.

791
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,600
It's now or never for us, I got no choice.

792
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,600
Today we got ships, Uncle Frank. Today.

793
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,500
But the writing's on the fucking wall.

794
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,600
Fuck the wall.
