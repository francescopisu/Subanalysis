00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,426
This is the second time this week...

3
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:34,403
I had to pay for a sitter
'cause he was workin' late.

4
00:00:34,506 --> 00:00:37,202
With all that money he make,
you can afford it.

5
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:51,686
Lord.

6
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:01,896
What's up, Bubs?

7
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:05,024
Hey.

8
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:09,073
There you go.

9
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,901
- What you got?
- I got some starters.

10
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:10,253
My fault, A.

11
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:14,323
- Should've never left you alone, homie.
- No, shit.

12
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:16,762
Man, you ain't pull up when you did,
I'm gone.

13
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:20,634
Listen, what I want to know is how
we fucking come back on this cocksucker?

14
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,968
We don't. Not now.

15
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:24,469
You feel me?

16
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:27,374
Listen, Stringer,
your advice was good advice...

17
00:03:27,478 --> 00:03:30,072
you know what I'm saying?
I wanna let you know that.

18
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:32,513
What I want you to do now
is put the word out there.

19
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:35,711
I want you to let him know
we willing to squash this, if he is.

20
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,447
And then what the fuck if he ain't?

21
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:42,015
No, this nigger live in the town, too.
He gonna listen, if we parley.

22
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:44,918
And then when he creep out
of his hole, and shit.

23
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,018
- Boom.
- Okay.

24
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,394
- Smoke him.
- Say no more, got you.

25
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,626
- Put that out there, yo.
- All right.

26
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:56,407
About them police, though,
they was on your ass after the game?

27
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:59,399
Yeah, man, it was like two cars.

28
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:02,745
See, if they on you, then they got a name.

29
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,543
If they got a name,
then they know you got no license.

30
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,710
But they don't want no traffic charges,
you know what I'm saying?

31
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,287
They don't want no humble shit.

32
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:12,879
I think they was trying
to see where I might go.

33
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:15,016
Where the fuck was you
gonna take their asses?

34
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:18,323
I was taking them to the barbershop.
I was going to get a haircut.

35
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:19,828
Get a fade?

36
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:24,098
I know, B, but these motherfuckers
are on us. Fuck.

37
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:27,638
They always have been on us,
we just gotta be careful.

38
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:30,966
You not been talking on any phones.

39
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,170
And you not been touching any drugs.

40
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:36,075
And from now on,
you are not doing the money runs.

41
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,546
Me and Bey, we gonna take care
of that shit...

42
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,515
until this whole thing cool off.

43
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:43,678
- Let me get that pager.
- What's up, you serious?

44
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,916
Serious. I'm gonna get you
a New York supply number only.

45
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:49,216
Any of these motherfucking local cats...

46
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:51,761
wanna talk to you, they gotta talk to me.

47
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:59,062
We gotta build a wall around you, B.

48
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,171
Another month on a fresh phone?

49
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:06,334
They ripped out the pay phones
in the low-rises.

50
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:08,105
Now they're walking a block or two.

51
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:10,442
How much longer
until you bring this case in?

52
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:13,483
The quicker you can the better
for everybody. Yourself included.

53
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:16,178
Look at this.
Judge Gwynn sends his regrets.

54
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,915
He can't make lunch.
Like I suddenly got the plague.

55
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:21,014
There's your new phone. 30 days.

56
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,056
A few weeks ago, when Burrell
wanted to take down the wire...

57
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:26,027
you were the one breaking off on his ass.

58
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,324
Jimmy, there's a lady here.

59
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:29,992
Rhonda talks more trash than both of us,
Your Honor.

60
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:33,332
I have never been
anything other than ladylike, Your Honor.

61
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,167
Detective McNulty is going out of his way
to insult an officer of the court.

62
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:40,335
- McNulty, I hold you in contempt.
- Who doesn't?

63
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:44,509
What's with him?

64
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,207
- You haven't heard?
- No.

65
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:52,785
- What's wrong with the picture?
- Don't know.

66
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,392
- Phelan isn't in it.
- What, he's up for election?

67
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:59,360
I thought judges had 15-year terms.

68
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:02,024
They do, but Phelan was named
to finish Halpern's term...

69
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,464
which only had two years left.

70
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:05,433
So he has to run on his own in the primary.

71
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:07,026
What, he's not on the ticket?

72
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:08,537
Why the fuck not?

73
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:11,475
Maybe it's the company he keeps.

74
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:13,701
Fuck.

75
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:17,574
No, see, you ain't thinking about
how much room the baby gonna need.

76
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,909
Specially when he get to growing...

77
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,415
'cause there are things we got to have.

78
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,182
Like a real crib, a play desk...

79
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:28,315
and you know, he got to have
one of them Little Tikes cars.

80
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:30,656
I'm not saying your place
ain't nice enough...

81
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:34,958
'cause for you, it do just fine,
but if we gonna be a family...

82
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,929
we need at least one more room, if not two.

83
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:42,438
So you add the bedroom set,
a nice bedroom set like the one they got...

84
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,601
down at that baby store on Howard Street,
and that's a room right there.

85
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:49,546
And I think we might
get some better furniture...

86
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:52,115
and put your stuff in the other bedroom...

87
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,917
like it was a den...

88
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,077
'cause the sofa you got seen better days...

89
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:57,950
I think you know that much.

90
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,693
Dee, where you goin' at?

91
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:08,059
I told you I need money
for the new bedroom set. Dee!

92
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:10,962
- Why you holler at me?
- Yo, man, we getting down to it.

93
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:13,059
I get to you when I get to you.

94
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:15,501
That's the main stash house.

95
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:16,996
Say what?

96
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:20,703
The incoming call is the guy who runs
the main stash for Barksdale's people.

97
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:22,473
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

98
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,174
So, y'all are just guessing
he's on the stash, right?

99
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:26,614
No, he's on it.

100
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:30,050
Lester was checking the logs
when he picked up the pattern.

101
00:07:30,154 --> 00:07:32,486
Every time they get down
to the ends on a package...

102
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,524
somebody in the tower
hits that pager number.

103
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,855
Then, within a half-hour
every fucking time...

104
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:40,624
a call comes back to the tower pay phone
from that number in Pimlico.

105
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:41,822
Which is?

106
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:45,697
It's a pay phone at a Mondo Mart
in Reisterstown on Cold Spring Lane.

107
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:47,799
You see it now?

108
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:56,407
When the supply gets low,
they page this mope...

109
00:07:56,647 --> 00:08:01,277
who always calls back from a pay phone
way the fuck out in north-west.

110
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:04,019
Same phone, same pattern.

111
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:06,589
So y'all think that
he's taking the re-up order...

112
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:09,524
and that the stash is somewhere
near the Mondo Mart, right?

113
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:13,461
- You are on it, Detective Sydnor.
- Okay, so what do you do with this?

114
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:15,031
What do we do?

115
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:19,769
We're gonna be sittin'
on that phone in Pimlico...

116
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,964
all day and night
waitin' on Mr. Mondo Mart.

117
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:24,041
- Herc, too.
- Herc's out this whole week.

118
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:26,541
- In-service training.
- That's too bad.

119
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:31,711
So, instead of three eight-hour shifts,
you two are gonna have to pull 12 hours.

120
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:35,209
Just fucking kill me now.

121
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,847
- Heard from Omar?
- Nope.

122
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:42,592
I'm gonna go try to scare him up.
Where you gonna be?

123
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:45,020
Everyone on the wire keeps talking about...

124
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:47,563
how this kid's all tore up
about the dead stickup boy.

125
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:49,792
- I'm gonna see for myself.
- All right.

126
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:52,929
- You need us, we're on the radio.
- Okay.

127
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,565
Hey, what up, man?

128
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:34,503
This first time,
I can go four ounces of rock...

129
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:38,514
but hey, if the shit is right,
then next time I can step that up.

130
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,617
Almost ain't worth it for four.

131
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:43,251
Just this first go-round.

132
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:46,084
You do right by me,
I'll turn around and come back on it.

133
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,885
Where your money at, man?

134
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:58,763
We good.

135
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:03,336
So, where the shit at?

136
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,587
Ain't nobody been there but you.
Nobody came in my house but you.

137
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,783
Everybody.

138
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:59,454
Nobody but you. You're the only person
that came in my house.

139
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:02,666
So, what you got goin' for you?

140
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,763
Ain't got nothing left, burnt it away.

141
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:07,832
Family?

142
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:11,139
Mother dead. Father, who the fuck know.

143
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,165
Brothers, sisters?

144
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:17,374
A sister, she lets me stay in the basement...

145
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:19,776
but she lock the door so I can't go upstairs.

146
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:21,943
About the best she can do for me.

147
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,377
Got a kid, a son.

148
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:26,980
Imagine me bringing life into the world.

149
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:29,286
- What's his name?
- Keyshawn.

150
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:34,022
His mother took him up Jersey way,
said I wasn't fit to be with the boy.

151
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:35,962
- I didn't disagree.
- Well...

152
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:39,736
at least you got your health.

153
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:42,137
Here's to health.

154
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:47,334
I got the bug.

155
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:50,743
Had it since '94.

156
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,618
Gave that shit to my old lady.

157
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:58,111
Worried about passing it on to my baby girl.

158
00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:01,049
No, I was spared that at least.

159
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,487
Damn, how do you carry it?

160
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:08,894
- You ask her forgiveness?
- Of course.

161
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:13,369
- What she say?
- What she needed to say.

162
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:16,663
Look, forgiveness from other folks is good...

163
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:19,901
but ain't nothing but words
coming at you from outside.

164
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,844
You wanna kick this shit,
you got to forgive your own self.

165
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,811
Love yourself some, brother.

166
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:34,152
And then drag your sorry ass
to some meetings.

167
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,749
- Meetings?
- What the fuck you wanna hear?

168
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:39,455
That you're strong enough
to do this by yourself?

169
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,723
Getting clean's the easy part.

170
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,431
Now comes life.

171
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:51,340
It's this one here with the orange cord
coming out of the back.

172
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:53,433
They're pirating juice from the other house.

173
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:56,775
You fucking gotta be kidding me.
Now I'm policing for BGE?

174
00:12:57,248 --> 00:13:00,843
They're not there yet,
but when this kid here posts, snatch him up.

175
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:05,081
Park our asses outside this shit-hole and
wait for some little project yo to raise up?

176
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,453
Mrs. McNulty raised no fools.

177
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,216
Four Faidley's crabcakes in the bag...

178
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,022
24 Dutch beers in the box.

179
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:14,787
Faidley's? You all right, McNulty.

180
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:18,827
I don't care what all them
other fucks downtown say about you.

181
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,994
11-35, what's up?

182
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:23,539
Our friend wants to meet. Same spot.

183
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:27,441
- Copy that, 15 minutes.
- What's the deal with the yo-boy?

184
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:30,343
- What'd he do?
- Stumbled into my world.

185
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:02,641
- Five minutes, come on.
- I have to go.

186
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:04,577
- Shardene.
- I said, I have to go.

187
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:07,116
- I can't have five minutes?
- No, not right now.

188
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:12,416
Fuck!

189
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:20,361
How close did you get?

190
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:24,662
Y'all be chalking that nigger if Wee Bey
ain't pop up at the last second like...

191
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:26,633
Remember when we last talked?

192
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:29,169
You were gonna lay back,
let us work our case.

193
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:30,968
I said, I'd do what I can.

194
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,936
Still, I thought I might let y'all know
Avon's people got in contact...

195
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:37,343
talking about they want to end the beef.

196
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:41,009
- They offered me some kind of amnesty.
- Amnesty?

197
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:45,020
Look, I chill out on the manhunt
and stop hitting them in the head...

198
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:47,989
for their product,
they gonna call off the bounty.

199
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:49,889
Take the truce, Omar.

200
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:52,690
I might, if they ain't trying to play me.

201
00:14:53,797 --> 00:14:56,527
- They said they want to parley on it.
- Parley?

202
00:14:57,268 --> 00:15:01,227
Look, I don't know, man, but right now
I need some assistance from y'all.

203
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:15,448
Yo, son, I go to the ER,
and word get back to Avon...

204
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:19,318
you know he gonna have his henchmen
waiting in the parking lot for me.

205
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:27,257
Look, I know y'all friendly
with a couple of doctors, right? Right?

206
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,552
He says he can buy weight.
Says he runs with some decent-size locals.

207
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:54,281
- Like who?
- Avon, something... Barksdale.

208
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:56,591
Avon Barksdale?

209
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:01,356
Run it through the DECS and HIDA.
See what comes back.

210
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:07,603
I'm gonna check around,
see if anybody's working...

211
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,002
these names you gave us.

212
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:11,574
If you full of shit, pal,
I'm gonna know it quick.

213
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:13,768
But what happens to me
while you checking?

214
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:16,277
Eager Street. City jail, motherfucker.

215
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:23,778
Blue came home last week.
I ain't seen him since.

216
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:26,144
Yeah.

217
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:29,449
I can't believe it.

218
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,809
- Damn, Carv, you's triflin'.
- Yeah, I admit it, I'm disgusting.

219
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,979
Cheese puffs and fucking Ring-Dings?

220
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,247
Yeah.

221
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,780
- Yeah.
- The big fuck from the high-rise...

222
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:31,150
- what's his name?
- Little Man.

223
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:33,723
- Yeah, him.
- All right.

224
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:46,261
- Yo.
- Be ready, we're on it.

225
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,573
Look at this pretty motherfucker.

226
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:05,184
Too fucked up to drive home, McNulty?

227
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,495
Hey, Bunk.

228
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:26,839
Kid gave us a murder.
More than that, he's put in Stringer Bell.

229
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:28,471
Yeah?

230
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,775
Picks out Wee-Bey, Bird
and Stinkum from photo arrays.

231
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:33,440
Puts them all up at the Greek's...

232
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,316
the night they grab up Omar's boy, Brandon.
Puts Bell in the truck, too.

233
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:40,688
Says, "Stringer told me
to point out the stickup boy."

234
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:44,751
- Jeez, what do you have over him?
- Not a fucking thing.

235
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:47,459
Kid was ready, barely had to push him.

236
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:50,097
- Whose case?
- Norris's.

237
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:53,999
- How old?
- 16.

238
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:57,396
Lives in a shit-hole vacant over on Argyle.

239
00:18:57,508 --> 00:19:00,341
When I grab him up,
I swear he's halfway into a nod.

240
00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:01,536
Using?

241
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:06,549
When they kill the stickup boy
the fuckers dump the body in the alley...

242
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,108
behind where this kid and all the other
low-rise hoppers lay their heads.

243
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,517
Can you imagine?

244
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:14,448
All he can think about.

245
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:16,985
You tell him he's gonna have to testify?

246
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:20,894
Not yet, we'll get there.
Problem is, what do we do with him now?

247
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:40,580
- Yeah.
- Big boy picking up.

248
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:42,543
Okay.

249
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:48,988
- You holler at me, right?
- Where you at, man? We on our way down.

250
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:51,026
First thing tomorrow, man.

251
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:57,761
- Yeah?
- It's him, stay on it.

252
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:58,892
All right.

253
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,988
I didn't do nothing, man, get me outta here.

254
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,603
The 2-2, grounded slowly towards third,
and it gets through at the last moment.

255
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:36,363
Where my phone call at?

256
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,598
Suzuki's at the plate, here's the pitch.

257
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:45,413
Line drive, up the middle,
a base hit for Suzuki.

258
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:49,781
Suzuki's very patient at the plate.

259
00:20:50,153 --> 00:20:52,144
Yeah, man, it's me.

260
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:54,320
Guess who's up in here.

261
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:57,685
Pimpin'-ass Orlando, from the club.

262
00:20:58,195 --> 00:21:00,823
Yeah. Courtside.

263
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:32,719
- So, how long you been slingin'?
- Since I was, maybe, 12.

264
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:36,589
And how long were you
with Barksdale's crew in the low-rises?

265
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,101
With D'Angelo? Not long.

266
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:43,769
He came down from the towers
at the beginning of the summer.

267
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:45,774
Before that I worked for Ronnie Mo.

268
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:49,107
D'Angelo ever talk to you
about what happened in the 221 building...

269
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:50,804
with Pooh getting shot?

270
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:53,812
How about anything else like that?

271
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:57,080
- Like what?
- Killings, murders.

272
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:03,386
He say anything about a girl getting shot
in an apartment up on the Eastside?

273
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,884
He...

274
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:11,862
No, Dee, he was good to me. He all right.

275
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,671
But D'Angelo, he was who you called
that night when you saw...

276
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:17,706
the stickup boy at the Greek's, right?

277
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:19,571
Yeah, but he didn't go up there.

278
00:22:19,676 --> 00:22:21,667
It was mostly those tower boys.

279
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:24,872
And Stringer.
You said Stringer was in the truck.

280
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:28,542
He called you over,
asked you to point out the stickup boy.

281
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:37,122
All of it corroborated by the beeper logs...

282
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:39,752
and the pen registers
from the project pay phones.

283
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:42,730
Stinkum's dead.
We've already got Bird for the Gant killing.

284
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,892
- This ties them all in.
- D'Angelo, too.

285
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:47,367
Maybe, but since he didn't show
at the Greek's...

286
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:50,565
he tells the jury
he didn't see the murder coming.

287
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:52,073
It's enough to charge him, anyway.

288
00:22:52,175 --> 00:22:53,005
Parents?

289
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,203
Alcoholic mother.
In the wind, no fixed address.

290
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:57,644
Says he's got a grandmother
on the Eastern Shore...

291
00:22:57,748 --> 00:22:59,079
but he hasn't seen her in years.

292
00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:01,582
- How about a hotel room?
- On whose dime?

293
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:04,848
No way the Deputy approves the manpower
to stash a 16-year-old...

294
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:06,286
much less the room service.

295
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:07,981
McNulty, Line 2.

296
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:20,693
How about you run this up to front office?
See if the state's attorney will kick in.

297
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:22,971
He's a kid, Cedric.

298
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:26,336
Even if we clear the money,
do you really wanna put a juvenile...

299
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:29,310
in a hotel for six months
waiting on a trial date?

300
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:33,177
I think you all need to get
with Grandma down on the shore.

301
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:37,076
Now? She's doing this right now?

302
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:41,220
They don't have to set a hearing date
or something like that?

303
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:47,359
Christ, yeah, okay. Yeah.

304
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,960
I fuckin' need a fuckin' lawyer.

305
00:23:57,507 --> 00:23:58,667
What?

306
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:01,902
Still, you can see that
they got the security bars...

307
00:24:02,312 --> 00:24:03,540
and look there.

308
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:08,446
Cameras that see over the yard
out to the street.

309
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:12,019
And I checked with Verizon,
there's no phone service at that address.

310
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:13,851
That's a telltale right there.

311
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:16,517
So what? We try to write a warrant
for this place, right?

312
00:24:16,626 --> 00:24:17,593
Right?

313
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:31,104
- What are you seeing?
- No pattern, really.

314
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,472
Except this cluster of old storefronts...

315
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,909
and warehouses
on the west side of downtown.

316
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:39,243
Around Paca, Utah, Howard Street, mostly.

317
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:42,079
- Storefronts?
- Vacants, usually.

318
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,512
Three different holding companies.

319
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:47,816
- Detective Pryzbylewski.
- What?

320
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:51,325
You have a gift for the paper trail.

321
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,591
Tomorrow calls for some street work,
though. Are you street ready?

322
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:04,703
You know the Lieutenant has me in-office.
I don't have my gun until the grand jury.

323
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:07,299
- You won't need one.
- On the street? No gun?

324
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,208
No gun. Not for this.

325
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:15,148
Furthermore, Mr. McNulty,
having utilized his sons...

326
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:19,211
in an act of police work
involving a criminal suspect...

327
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:23,122
actually lost track of them
in a crowded municipal market.

328
00:25:23,326 --> 00:25:25,760
This is simply unacceptable, Your Honor.

329
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:28,854
Be that as it may,
an emergency ex parte order...

330
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:31,263
is an extraordinary request, Mr. Palmer.

331
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:35,395
You actually want me to limit visitations
to afternoons only, and you want...

332
00:25:35,505 --> 00:25:38,133
Mrs. McNulty present at all visitations?
Come on.

333
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,732
It is not a single lapse, Judge.

334
00:25:40,844 --> 00:25:45,281
Mr. McNulty has time and again
failed to properly care for the children...

335
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:46,974
when they're in his custody.

336
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:51,247
I have a list of recent events, Your Honor,
that justify an order.

337
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:54,755
Ms. Pearlman, you have a response
you'd like to offer up here?

338
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:57,084
Nope.

339
00:25:57,928 --> 00:25:59,122
Nothing?

340
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:05,400
If this were possession with intent,
I'd be a prosecutor with a plan.

341
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:09,802
But a domestic order hearing?
Your Honor, I'm officially clueless.

342
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:14,102
In fact, as an employee of the state,
I should not actually be here.

343
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:16,868
All right, listen up, people...

344
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,813
before you have me make a ruling
on an emergency petition...

345
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:22,282
everybody here just needs
to take a deep breath.

346
00:26:22,385 --> 00:26:23,818
Literally, come on.

347
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:28,356
Now, then, is Mr. McNulty capable...

348
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:31,222
of having a civil conversation
with Mrs. McNulty?

349
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:32,621
Yes, Your Honor.

350
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:36,927
And is Mrs. McNulty equally capable
of having a conversation with Mr. McNulty?

351
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:40,292
- Yes.
- Good, then I'm going to lunch.

352
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:43,099
Let's see when I return
if we can't busy this court...

353
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:47,336
with something just a little more engaging
than the problems of the McNultys.

354
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:50,675
Look, the charge is on me.
I understand that, I'll carry that.

355
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,179
But the least our people can do...

356
00:26:52,282 --> 00:26:54,682
is throw down a little something
to pay the bondsman.

357
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:57,048
That's the deed of transfer for the club.

358
00:26:57,153 --> 00:27:00,680
The other thing is a license transfer
application for the liquor board.

359
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,623
They're both backdated
and notarized for last week.

360
00:27:04,094 --> 00:27:05,186
What?

361
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:08,423
A front has to be clean.

362
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:12,701
And right now, you ain't that. Sign.

363
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:20,272
I want my bail paid.
You send me a bondsman, I'll sign.

364
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,971
Is that what you want me to tell him?

365
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,547
That I asked you to sign and you wouldn't?

366
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:43,892
You wanted to be in the game, right?

367
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:47,694
Now you're in the game.

368
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:51,707
Unbelievable. You show up with her?

369
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:53,935
Elena, you went for an emergency ex parte.

370
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:56,069
I grabbed whatever lawyer
was standing around.

371
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:00,411
She was standing?
Ask her if she wants the pictures back.

372
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:04,009
Let's see, I've got her at the restaurant
with you pulling out her chair.

373
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,851
I've got her at the motel parking lot
with you opening the car door for her...

374
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:10,118
because you're such
a fucking gentleman now.

375
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:12,126
I can't believe you hired Buckman.

376
00:28:12,228 --> 00:28:14,526
Son of a bitch never made
a case that counted.

377
00:28:14,631 --> 00:28:16,690
He caught your cheating ass.

378
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:22,161
Elena, why are we here?

379
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:26,265
Because you can't have
Sean and Michael around criminals.

380
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:29,504
You can't lose them
in a Baltimore market. That's why.

381
00:28:29,612 --> 00:28:31,341
He wasn't a criminal.

382
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:36,775
I know the guy.
It was a game we were playing.

383
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:40,515
It was daylight on a crowded street.
They could've been following AI Capone.

384
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:43,251
It would've been fine.
Look, Elena, these are my sons.

385
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,953
I love them. Do you hear, I love them.

386
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:48,053
I'm not gonna let them get hurt.

387
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:53,527
I love you, too.

388
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:57,003
Still do.

389
00:29:03,613 --> 00:29:07,014
Does she know
about the detective and the pictures?

390
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:09,551
No, why would I tell her about that?

391
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:13,215
And are the two of you still...

392
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:14,688
No.

393
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,057
Yes.

394
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:24,693
A little.

395
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:36,876
Come on, let's make nice for the judge.

396
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:40,279
Okay.

397
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:49,719
We know we have a month more to go
and we're not gonna let up.

398
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:53,426
We are going to raise more,
we are going to spend more...

399
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,226
and on Election Day,
we are going to be out there...

400
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,630
pushing the vote in every precinct.

401
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:00,329
You ready?

402
00:30:06,442 --> 00:30:08,637
Come on, we'll get dinner first.

403
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:11,377
Ain't so hungry.

404
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:14,377
Come on.

405
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:27,993
How much were you using?

406
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:34,501
I'm asking if you're gonna be sick in my car.

407
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:37,370
A cap now and then.

408
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:39,603
You just snorting?

409
00:30:43,913 --> 00:30:47,041
You'll be all right in a day or two. Come on.

410
00:30:56,993 --> 00:30:58,824
This nigger coming or what, man?

411
00:30:58,928 --> 00:31:02,159
Said he would, if I guaranteed a parley.
And I'm here on it.

412
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:06,057
Of course, he said you would be
paying my fee rather than his own self.

413
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:07,067
Your fee?

414
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,536
I'm doing like one of them
marriage counselors.

415
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:13,075
Charge by the hour to tell some fool
he need to bring some flowers home.

416
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:15,167
Then charge another hour telling the bitch...

417
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,111
she ought to suck some cock
every little once and a while.

418
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:20,739
To keep a marriage strong like that.

419
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:23,816
Speaking of cocksuckers.

420
00:31:26,189 --> 00:31:29,352
- Don't believe we met.
- Proposition Joe.

421
00:31:31,294 --> 00:31:34,058
You ever steal from me,
I kill your whole family.

422
00:31:34,397 --> 00:31:39,096
All right. You all both here on my guarantee,
so respect that shit and say what you feel.

423
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:41,463
I'm up out of here.

424
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:51,380
I got a man who say he gonna
give you your life back.

425
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,739
Who, Barksdale?

426
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,841
My man say, "Tell that motherfucker that...

427
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:58,682
"if he can find a way
not to dip in our pockets...

428
00:31:58,788 --> 00:32:00,813
"we're gonna call this shit even."

429
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:05,594
You all aced Bailey,
and what you did to my boy?

430
00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:10,325
So, y'all think after what you did to Brandon
we supposed to find some even on this?

431
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:14,062
I don't know shit about shit, all right?
I'm just the messenger.

432
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:15,668
Whatever, man.

433
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:19,273
You know there's dead on both sides, right?

434
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:22,276
And there's gonna be a whole lot more
if this beef keep up.

435
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:26,109
But the truth be told, there be more soldiers
on one half than the other.

436
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:27,910
You know what I'm saying?

437
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:33,512
Look here, son, you tell Barksdale...

438
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:36,456
that he's been paid back
for what he did to my peoples.

439
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,086
But as for his product,
a man's got to earn a living, you know?

440
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:42,630
I don't know nobody called Barksdale, B.

441
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:47,964
The man I'm talking about can't have
his shit taken like that. That won't do.

442
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:52,434
All right, tell him to throw me
some cash then, and we'll see...

443
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:54,938
About $5,000 or $10,000.

444
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:58,214
You know what I mean,
for my retirement, homes.

445
00:32:58,348 --> 00:33:02,250
- $5,000 if you can keep quiet about it.
- Send my money through Joe, man.

446
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:05,879
You go through Joe,
you're not gonna see $2,000 of that.

447
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:08,817
- Why don't you tell my man where you at...
- No.

448
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:11,485
We gonna figure
something else out, you hear?

449
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:14,662
I'll be in touch, homes.

450
00:33:19,302 --> 00:33:21,770
How careful is Stringer Bell?

451
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:24,032
"I don't know no one named Barksdale."

452
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:25,532
Shit.

453
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:28,303
Still, we got him tied to the Brandon killing.

454
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:30,971
That can be enough for one day's work.

455
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:41,982
Did what I could for y'all.

456
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:05,410
You sure, right?

457
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:07,983
Yeah, I spent a summer here
when I was nine.

458
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:11,780
When was the last time they saw you?

459
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:13,581
When I was nine.

460
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:20,261
- What's that?
- What?

461
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:21,858
That noise.

462
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:24,197
It's crickets.

463
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:28,368
- Cricket.
- Crickets.

464
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:37,302
- He try to go in my pockets again?
- This nigger is talking about $5,000, B.

465
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:38,937
Shit.

466
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:45,547
What's up, baby?

467
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:48,089
Antwon said to bring these up.
You want anything else?

468
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:49,180
No, we cool.

469
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:51,658
I'm saying though,
how we supposed to pay that?

470
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:54,696
He talking about going through Joe,
but I'm like, fuck Joe.

471
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:58,460
Thank you, you know what I mean?

472
00:34:58,568 --> 00:35:01,401
You look good and your services
are appreciated.

473
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,234
Keep them tips,
I hope you making them, baby.

474
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:09,372
Make the motherfucker come down to the towers...

475
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:11,743
to get the rest of his money,
know what I'm saying?

476
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:14,817
If he's stupid enough to come
to the towers, he gonna get got.

477
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,408
It's a wrap. How we supposed to pay that?

478
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,647
All right.

479
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:26,921
Y'all think you can hang, but, look.

480
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:34,764
No, you see, I went to journalism school.

481
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:38,500
All right? Northwestern.
So you all can't stay with me on this...

482
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:42,044
Girl, you talking like
you some crusty old reporter.

483
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:45,136
- Excuse me?
- Bitch, you work at a TV station.

484
00:35:45,248 --> 00:35:50,015
It's the same thing, all right?
Look, come on, stop talking.

485
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,984
Here we go.

486
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,188
- Bring it.
- Come on, Kima.

487
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:00,418
I gotta work tomorrow.

488
00:36:02,632 --> 00:36:04,623
Candy ass.

489
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:07,028
That's all I have to say.

490
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:11,938
- Okay, you see?
- I'm with you.

491
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,401
All right.

492
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:16,342
Look at Tanya.
And she run a damn art gallery.

493
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:20,811
You see, police in this town ain't about shit.

494
00:36:23,686 --> 00:36:26,018
- Guess not.
- Thank you.

495
00:36:26,756 --> 00:36:28,485
Can't hold a liquor.

496
00:36:29,992 --> 00:36:31,584
Can't hold a donut.

497
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:38,527
And if you ask me, I guess we...

498
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:40,796
ain't good in bed, either.

499
00:36:40,903 --> 00:36:44,999
Don't go there, Officer. Don't go there.

500
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:50,540
Kima, how did you know
you wanted to be a cop?

501
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:53,809
I mean, how did you choose that?

502
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:58,285
When you were little,
did you think about it at all, or...

503
00:36:59,355 --> 00:37:01,915
Come on, Kima.

504
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:06,755
I remember when I was in the Northeast,
still field-training as a cadet.

505
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:09,927
I didn't know if I was gonna
stick with it or not.

506
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:12,364
And then we got this one call.

507
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:16,228
We chased this purse-snatcher
up into these apartments.

508
00:37:16,706 --> 00:37:19,334
I got separated from my FTO.

509
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:21,239
Shit, I ain't even no police yet.

510
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:25,804
You know, I'm just a trainee. And I'm alone.

511
00:37:27,483 --> 00:37:32,250
Anyway, I mean,
I don't know how, but I find the guy.

512
00:37:32,855 --> 00:37:37,019
So I catch him and I hold on to him
and I manage to get to my radio.

513
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:41,558
We in the middle of this parking lot
and we're rolling around...

514
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:45,464
and this motherfucker's
steady kicking my ass trying to get away.

515
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:50,672
I look over and I see these black patents
and these uniform blue pants.

516
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:55,374
I look up and it's Charlie Smoot...

517
00:37:57,246 --> 00:38:01,012
Charlie fucking Smoot.
You know, this guy's a legend.

518
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:05,075
He looks down at me and he smiles,
you know real quiet-like.

519
00:38:05,187 --> 00:38:08,782
And he drops his cuffs.
He says, "Here you go, rook."

520
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:12,791
That's all he says.

521
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:15,320
"Here you go, rook."

522
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:19,958
And then he dropped
the bracelets and walked away.

523
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:26,773
I mean, I know you don't like it.

524
00:38:28,678 --> 00:38:31,613
But shit, I was proud.

525
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:44,158
God damn.

526
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,007
Lester says we ain't gonna
write a warrant on this place.

527
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,944
- How do we not with all this PC?
- We're on the main stash, right?

528
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:39,378
Why would we kick the door in...

529
00:39:39,482 --> 00:39:41,973
when all we have to do
is park a van down the street...

530
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:44,951
follow the entire Westside drug supply
in and out of the place?

531
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:47,750
We're gonna start picking up
pieces of Barksdale's world...

532
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:49,222
we never even knew about.

533
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:50,883
Been hell looking for you people.

534
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:53,393
What the hell's the name
of this unit anyway?

535
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:56,056
Shit, Kima in the house.

536
00:39:56,165 --> 00:40:00,864
What's up, Wig?
State police, CID, out of Pikesville.

537
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,762
Name of Troy Wiggins,
but pay no attention to the man...

538
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:08,571
because he about 90-95% pure bullshit.

539
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:12,308
Kima, she just talk like that
because I had her when she was good.

540
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:15,577
Shit, you the ugly-ass motherfucker
turned me the other way.

541
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:20,087
Shit, all right.
Here's the thing, boys and girls.

542
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:23,217
I'm doing a reverse buy-down
in Arundel, right?

543
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:26,351
And I get this Westside asshole
nibbling on four ounces, right?

544
00:40:26,462 --> 00:40:29,124
- A whole four ounces?
- I know, he ain't much, but...

545
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:31,631
I get him in the boat
and he starts flopping around...

546
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:35,363
saying he can buy weight from some
motherfucker, name of Barksdale.

547
00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:38,962
I never heard of no Barksdale.
But I put the name into DECS.

548
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:43,443
And the computer has Avon Barksdale
entered as an active Baltimore city target.

549
00:40:43,546 --> 00:40:47,778
So I go down to City Narcotics, and Dawson,
he sends me down here to see y'all.

550
00:40:47,883 --> 00:40:49,942
So what's the name of your fish?

551
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,514
Wendell O., as in...

552
00:40:52,621 --> 00:40:55,920
oh-shit-l-tried-to-buy
from-a-state-police Blocker.

553
00:40:56,325 --> 00:40:59,055
That wouldn't be
Wendell "Orlando" Blocker, would it?

554
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:01,629
Yeah. You on it.

555
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:05,361
Orlando.

556
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:07,025
They keep that back room locked.

557
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:11,573
And even if I do get back there
on an errand, then they kind of shut down.

558
00:41:11,674 --> 00:41:13,301
They get real quiet.

559
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:15,570
You said you heard one say
something about...

560
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:17,805
making someone come into the towers.

561
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:20,607
- Yeah.
- Which one was talking?

562
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:24,183
He was tall, I think.

563
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:26,754
All right, but who else was there?

564
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:32,454
I don't really see that well
without my glasses.

565
00:41:32,728 --> 00:41:34,662
Where are your glasses?

566
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:42,395
You can't see faces without those?

567
00:41:45,107 --> 00:41:48,338
You don't wear those while you're working,
do you, darlin'?

568
00:41:48,444 --> 00:41:51,902
Would you? I gotta live off drinks and tips.

569
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,145
- No way.
- Why not?

570
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:58,948
Because a player wouldn't be
the name on the liquor license.

571
00:41:59,054 --> 00:42:00,817
He'd have a connect for Barksdale's coke.

572
00:42:00,923 --> 00:42:02,388
He wouldn't walk into state troopers.

573
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:04,586
He got a charge and now
he's talking out his ass.

574
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:08,220
You're never gonna get Avon
or Stringer in the same room as the dope.

575
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,357
- We make this case on their voices alone.
- So maybe he can't buy from Barksdale.

576
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:14,527
Maybe he can only buy
from Savino or Wee-Bey.

577
00:42:14,637 --> 00:42:15,865
Fuck him, then.

578
00:42:15,971 --> 00:42:20,067
We already got Wee-Bey tied to a murder,
and Savino's the runt of the litter.

579
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:27,715
We can take what Orlando
gives us about the club.

580
00:42:27,816 --> 00:42:30,649
The money laundering, maybe, or the girls.

581
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:34,484
For that kind of cooperation,
I'll drop a few years and call it fair.

582
00:42:36,492 --> 00:42:38,824
- Daniels in here?
- Yeah.

583
00:42:38,928 --> 00:42:42,295
Call from Deputy Commissioner for you.
You want it in here?

584
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:45,224
No.

585
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,325
He doesn't miss much.

586
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:02,240
- I need some help here.
- Come on, Bubs.

587
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:05,718
You got me coming across town
in the middle of a fucked-up workday...

588
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:08,221
just so you can hold $10,
that shit ain't right.

589
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:10,588
Hold on, I don't need $10, okay?

590
00:43:10,693 --> 00:43:13,389
I don't know. I need a place of my own.

591
00:43:14,296 --> 00:43:17,424
All right? Some bed,
some sheets, some clothes.

592
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:19,660
I definitely need some new clothes.

593
00:43:21,136 --> 00:43:22,797
How long you been clean?

594
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:25,937
Three days.

595
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:29,770
You serious about it?

596
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,111
Who knows?

597
00:43:36,485 --> 00:43:39,045
What the fuck am I gonna do
with a clean informant?

598
00:43:39,154 --> 00:43:40,849
Did you think about that?

599
00:43:46,562 --> 00:43:48,723
All right, I'm on it with you.

600
00:43:50,466 --> 00:43:52,491
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

601
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:57,737
What the fuck, give me some love.

602
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,001
Okay, I mean, I think I can get,
you know, a mattress, my own place...

603
00:44:02,111 --> 00:44:04,978
everything for like a couple hundred dollars.

604
00:44:05,714 --> 00:44:08,740
All right. We'll talk.

605
00:44:09,151 --> 00:44:12,587
I gotta be somewhere tonight,
so hit me on my page tomorrow.

606
00:44:14,223 --> 00:44:15,417
Tomorrow?

607
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:17,992
I got you.

608
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:26,590
- The cooperator says he can buy weight.
- Not from Barksdale or Bell.

609
00:44:26,702 --> 00:44:28,397
How can you be sure?

610
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:31,996
How much dope or coke do you think
gets Avon Barksdale into the room?

611
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:35,099
A kilo? 2 kilos? 20 kilos?

612
00:44:36,445 --> 00:44:38,913
We are not going to buy
our way up the ladder here.

613
00:44:39,014 --> 00:44:42,575
These people do not touch the drugs.
They don't go near the drugs.

614
00:44:43,218 --> 00:44:45,345
The wire is what gives us Barksdale.

615
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:47,621
It gives us the whole crew.

616
00:44:47,723 --> 00:44:51,022
Day by day, piece by piece.

617
00:44:55,097 --> 00:44:57,725
Buy-bust, Lieutenant.

618
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:03,270
It's what I asked you for months ago.
It's what we do successfully...

619
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:06,664
time and again to make these cases.

620
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,243
Why New York?

621
00:45:16,985 --> 00:45:21,046
Must be something happening out there.
Too big a town, you know what I mean?

622
00:45:21,223 --> 00:45:24,522
- You don't believe in the truce?
- That's why I asked for that money.

623
00:45:24,626 --> 00:45:27,390
If he had said,
"We ain't paying, just be happy to live"...

624
00:45:27,496 --> 00:45:29,259
I'd have been like, they keeping it real.

625
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:33,095
But he say, come on down for $5,000.
I'm, like, man, please.

626
00:45:34,636 --> 00:45:39,096
Look here, homes, I ain't asked for much,
but I'm a little light on traveling money.

627
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:44,072
I'm saying, I could go around the block
and get myself paid, but I'm thinking.

628
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:51,085
You keep in touch with my pager.
We're gonna need you for the Gant trial.

629
00:45:52,154 --> 00:45:53,553
Go easy, Omar.

630
00:45:58,193 --> 00:45:59,785
Stay free.

631
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:06,864
You be picking me up outside
the cut-rate on Lex and Fulton.

632
00:46:07,202 --> 00:46:09,227
I be up there after 10.:00, right?

633
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:10,936
That'll work.

634
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:12,964
Listen up, people.

635
00:46:13,442 --> 00:46:17,003
We've got $30,000 in buy money,
courtesy of our friends over at DEA.

636
00:46:17,112 --> 00:46:20,047
But the thing is,
they can't have that money walking on them.

637
00:46:20,149 --> 00:46:21,446
Definitely not.

638
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:25,284
So Kima will be in the car for the buy,
fronting as our Cl's girl.

639
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:27,116
Looking the part, too.

640
00:46:28,924 --> 00:46:30,551
Now, where's your weapon gonna be?

641
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:33,127
He might pat me,
so it has to stash in the car.

642
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:35,719
I figure when Savino
gets in the car at the cut-rate...

643
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:39,062
I'll be going in back.
It'll be up under the rear seat.

644
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:42,804
And we probably can't be close enough
for an eyeball on this...

645
00:46:42,905 --> 00:46:44,372
but the car will be a live wire.

646
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:47,806
And Kima will be throwing us
20s whenever she can. Rhonda.

647
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,071
I only want to remind Mr. Blocker here...

648
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:53,171
that his plea agreement
is contingent on cooperation.

649
00:46:53,282 --> 00:46:56,547
And a buy-bust on Savino Bratton
is less cooperative...

650
00:46:56,652 --> 00:46:59,485
than a buy-bust from someone
higher up on the food chain.

651
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:02,148
If you can get Savino
talking about Avon or Stringer...

652
00:47:02,257 --> 00:47:04,418
that's better for us and better for you.

653
00:47:04,526 --> 00:47:07,791
They already know that he got jacked
on a reverse buy, right?

654
00:47:07,896 --> 00:47:11,992
- Why wouldn't they assume he's snitching?
- I need money for a lawyer, right?

655
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,590
That's the story.

656
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:16,535
He got popped and now he needs
to get right back into it...

657
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:18,936
to pay the bondsman and the lawyer.

658
00:47:19,374 --> 00:47:22,138
All right. Let's make this work.

659
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:27,647
Careful. That's my career
you're holding there.

660
00:47:29,051 --> 00:47:31,110
- You got a unit?
- Parked in the mezzanine.

661
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,246
- Give me the keys, man.
- No, I'm driving, motherfucker.

662
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,152
Come on, man.

663
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:15,257
Death row here.

664
00:48:17,399 --> 00:48:18,661
Ain't up.

665
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:21,430
Death row.

666
00:48:50,265 --> 00:48:52,563
My girl. Half the money's hers.

667
00:49:05,847 --> 00:49:07,644
Baby, since we going down North Avenue...

668
00:49:07,749 --> 00:49:10,650
stop by the carry-out
so I can pick me up some cigarettes.

669
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:12,913
They're going up North, stay loose.

670
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:21,490
Shit. It's too loud.

671
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:41,639
Does any unit have the eyeball?

672
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:44,214
Negative, 11-35.

673
00:49:45,187 --> 00:49:48,122
Come on, Greggs, tell us
where the fuck you are.

674
00:49:49,524 --> 00:49:51,116
Pull in there.

675
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,792
- What?
- Pull in there.

676
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:18,377
Don't fuck with this count.

677
00:50:20,422 --> 00:50:22,788
I'll be right back with your shit.

678
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:35,436
Where are we?

679
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:38,472
That sign said Longwood,
but I could swear this was Warwick.

680
00:50:38,573 --> 00:50:41,599
Hoppers be turning the sign poles
to fuck with you all.

681
00:50:44,379 --> 00:50:49,009
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick,
in an alley...

682
00:50:49,117 --> 00:50:52,575
I don't know, shit.
Half a block west of Longwood, maybe?

683
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:54,382
I hope you all copy that.

684
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:58,425
Yeah, that puts us about eight blocks away.
I'm pushing in a little closer.

685
00:50:58,527 --> 00:51:00,017
All units be advised.

686
00:51:00,128 --> 00:51:03,757
Warwick near Longwood
in the north side alley. Or near that 20.

687
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:05,856
This got the right feel for you?

688
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:08,836
You creeping closer?

689
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:23,342
He better not be long,
because I don't know where the stash is...

690
00:51:23,452 --> 00:51:25,886
and if they dragging us all over
this part of town...

691
00:51:25,987 --> 00:51:28,956
- What's that?
- What?

692
00:51:29,057 --> 00:51:30,388
Something ain't right.

693
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:32,824
- What?
- Shit ain't right.

694
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:37,591
You snitching motherfucker.

695
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,724
Signal 13, signal 13!

696
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:40,859
Gunshots...

697
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:44,735
Gunshots. Go city-wide. 11-35.

698
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:47,302
Signal 13. Warwick...

699
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,172
near Longwood, officer down.

700
00:51:49,277 --> 00:51:52,440
Two males, black hoodie,
both of them, one is...

701
00:51:53,248 --> 00:51:56,979
Signal 13, Warwick, near Longwood,

00:51:57,853 --> 00:52:00,083
Northside, 2800 block. Nothing.

703
00:52:01,323 --> 00:52:04,383

705
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:12,365

00:52:17,472 --> 00:52:19,599
11-71, does anyone have a visual?

709
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:21,369
Does anyone have a visual?

710
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,007
- Foxtrot.
- What are we looking for?

711
00:52:24,112 --> 00:52:25,579
11-35 to KGA.

712
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,910
We can't find the officer down.
We need Foxtrot...

713
00:52:28,016 --> 00:52:32,917
looking for a green Lincoln Town Car with a
brown vinyl roof, parked in those alleys.

714
00:52:33,021 --> 00:52:35,990
Foxtrot en route, 3-1-4.

00:52:54,843 --> 00:52:57,573
SUV, west on Warwick, make the next right.

721

Any unit on scene?
Do you have a description of the suspect?

731
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:12,883
That's a 10-47.
