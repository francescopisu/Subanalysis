1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,052
To cap a motherfucker, put a pistol
to his head,

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,554
say, "pow," he tagged, but when Chris...

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,265
It ain't working, Na'.
You making this up.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,353
Word to my mother. Lex ain't dead.
I seen him in an alley last night

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,022
- near the playground.
- Everybody know Lex is dead.

6
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,400
Nah, there's dead, and there's special dead.

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,568
Yeah, Chris working that juju shit.

8
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,488
Nah, man, what I'm saying is they zombies.

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,991
Why you think he take them into vacants?
He need time to change them.

10
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,870
- You don't believe me, it's on you.
- They funnin', ain't they, Michael?

11
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,958
I don't know about voodoo shit, man,
but Chris is definitely doing something -

12
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:45,545
get a nigger to walk up in there
knowing he about to get capped.

13
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,255
Chris, he different. You can tell

14
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:50,425
by his coon-ass country clothes.

15
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:55,471
- Nine?
- Nah, too much bark.

16
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,681
Probably a .40-cal.

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,561
- Yeah, man, this is serious business.
- So you saying Lex is a zombie?

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,480
Pookie, Byron, all them niggers.

19
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,483
- And Chris?
- Yeah, Chris - Zombie Master.

20
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,570
I knew this wasn't going away.

21
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,906
That's what we've been saying, yo.
Chris got the power.

22
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,869
He tell them to come, and they gotta come -
like the devil do with the damned.

23
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,537
What you think Chris got them doing?

24
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,957
They're probably spies, man.

25
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,460
Can't figure any other way
Marlo knows so much.

26
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,880
Yeah, that's it. Like in this movie,
Zombie Killer or something.

27
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,673
They came out at night, hunting.

28
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,217
- Hunting?
- Yeah, man. They...

29
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:42,018
Yeah, and in that movie they was
snatching people up, stealing their warmth.

30
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,891
When you walk through the garden

31
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,976
Watch your back

32
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,687
Well, I beg your pardon

33
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,482
Walk the straight and narrow track

34
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,568
If you walk with Jesus

35
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,237
He'll save your soul

36
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,951
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

37
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,453
He's got fire and the fury

38
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,248
At his command

39
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,125
Well, you don't got to worry

40
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,461
Hold on to Jesus' hand

41
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,422
We'll be safe from Satan

42
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,092
When the thunder rolls

43
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,220
But you gotta keep the devil

44
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,138
Down in the hole

45
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,271
Oh yeah, mm

46
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,443
We'll be safe from Satan

47
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,533
Gotta keep the devil

48
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,119
Down in the hole

49
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,373
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

50
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,209
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

51
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,837
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

52
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,339
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

53
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,050
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

54
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,052
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

55
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,566
St. Jude, patron of lost causes.

56
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,360
Tell me you ain't been on bended knee

57
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,196
whispering in his saintly ear
each and every night

58
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,656
before you close those peepers.

59
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,910
I know you have, Tommy,
catch a break like this.

60
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,413
- Stan, you're sure about this?
- On my mother's soul. It's a lock.

61
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,042
Assigned a rookie - a broad, no less -
as lead detective.

62
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,044
Pulled a good man off too, I heard.

63
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,174
Tom. Tommy, remember -

64
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,718
anything you need.

65
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,975
- He's a piece of work.
- Valchek?

66
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,437
Comes with the territory.
You want the First District council seat,

67
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,773
you make nice with whatever
Polish or Greek commander

68
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,192
- they dump in the southeast.
- Not Italian.

69
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,652
Ain't enough of us there.

70
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,112
- You think he's this right?
- That Royce tampered with the case?

71
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,280
No way the mayor knows.

72
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,242
You're right. This one has Ervin Burrell
written all over it.

73
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,955
Fuck if the mayor knows or not. If it's true,
we get it out there quick and bang him hard.

74
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,082
- Go public?
- They can't spin this.

75
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,750
They sabotaged a criminal case.

76
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,712
No spin on a knuckle ball,
you still can't tell how it's gonna break.

77
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,098
We feed it to Tony Gray.
We keep ourselves out of the line of fire,

78
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:11,310
sting Royce, and as an added bonus,
give Gray's campaign a boost

79
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,896
which comes at the expense
of the mayor's base.

80
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,236
I'm a devious motherfucker
once I get going.

81
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:25,491
So, all told, we're looking at 13 warrants
and six locations.

82
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,327
And, given my staffing situation...

83
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,912
Not a problem.

84
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,999
I can give you my DEU,
Flex, and Ops squads.

85
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,584
- A sector of uniforms if you need it.
- Great.

86
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,005
The problem is, you're wasting a wiretap
on street-level arrests.

87
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,173
We do these raids right,
we might catch Marlo

88
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,676
or one of his lieutenants
at one of these locations,

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,845
- get them with dope on the table.
- Marlo Stanfield,

90
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,014
in a room, with dope on the table?

91
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,892
I've kicked down doors
and surprised bigger players than him.

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,063
Well, let me warn you, Lieutenant -
I am not about to litigate a wiretap

93
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,982
for a handful of street rips.

94
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,901
Well, that's on you, Counselor.

95
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,903
No, it's not.

96
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,031
Major, see you tomorrow.

97
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:18,127
- Floaters - you had any more?
- No more than usual for the season.

98
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,005
What about decomps?
What do you got in the decomp room?

99
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,090
- Two or three unidentifieds.
- Found in Baltimore?

100
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,593
No. Two from Prince George's,
one from Dorchester.

101
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,555
- He wouldn't drive that far.
- So you're looking for extra bodies,

102
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,059
no one in particular, other than this kid
you already put on the teletype.

103
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,310
Yeah. You on it.

104
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,313
You fellas don't have enough work?

105
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,694
If you do your classwork,
homework, you earn stickers.

106
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,655
Dag, yo, every day you be changing it up.

107
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,325
You got us confused, Mr. P.

108
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,453
Behave in class, that's another sticker.

109
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,916
At the end of the week, the four
with the most stickers get a prize

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,336
and are eligible for a grand drawing
at the end of the month.

111
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,755
Don't do your work,

112
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,007
misbehave in class...

113
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,178
..your name goes here.

114
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,599
Detention - a full hour after school,
no exceptions.

115
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,393
So it's up to you - stickers for prizes

116
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,938
or stay with me after school.

117
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:23,192
- Yo, Mr. P, why you do me detention, huh?
- You interrupted the class, Namond.

118
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,278
Yo, when you first came here,
you was treating us straight up

119
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,950
and now you just dog me before I even know
the rules. That ain't right, man.

120
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,083
When you're right, Namond, you're right.

121
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,794
Hey, Mr. P, I want me some of them stickers.

122
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,004
Zenobia, you have to do your work.

123
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,174
I want to but I ain't got no pencils.

124
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,642
I don't want no damn welfare pencil.

125
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:15,077
It seems to me there are two kinds of kids
walking in this building -

126
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,997
stoop kids and corner kids.

127
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,083
- Excuse me?
- Stoop kids stay on their front steps

128
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,003
when their parents tell them.
The others go down to the corners.

129
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,548
They can't sit still in the class.
The others can and do.

130
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,426
- So, separate the two.
- That's tracking.

131
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,928
- Excuse me?
- Tracking students.

132
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,849
It's a nasty phrase in educational circles.
The grouping of children

133
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,351
- based on expected performance.
- What's wrong with it?

134
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,563
It says you have reduced expectations
for certain students,

135
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,815
that you expect less from them academically.

136
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,987
So you pretend to teach all these
kids. Truth is, you ain't teaching any of them.

137
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:54,158
What if the stoop kids could be in classrooms
where there was no disruptions?

138
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,702
- And the corner kids?
- They're the ones you're after, right?

139
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,748
- That's why you got the grant money.
- If it doesn't involve warehousing children,

140
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,125
I'm for anything that allows me to do my job.

141
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,421
Every teacher here will say the same. The trick
for you is to come up with a program

142
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,090
that actually addresses itself
to the corner kids.

143
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,260
We pull kids out of classes -
won't they be stigmatized?

144
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,222
There's no stigma in being booted
out of class every day?

145
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,642
Question is, how do we identify
the corner kids?

146
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,645
That won't be a problem.

147
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,980
OK. OK.

148
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,158
You understand the work?

149
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,331
Come on, this is easy. I know you can do it.

150
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,964
You're not giving me a choice.
You have detention.

151
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,341
Yo, Na', Mrs. D shaking bushes.

152
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,510
Back to your seats.

153
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,265
Motherfuck! She got my blade, yo.

154
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,308
I said, back to your seats.

155
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,568
Yo, Mrs. D be stealing shit.
I ain't never gonna get my blade back.

156
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,700
Yo, what are you all up on me for?
I do my work.

157
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,369
I'm not your yo. Show me your work.

158
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,042
Yeah, I see.

159
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,879
Yo, my head hurting from all this learning.
You got some Tylenol?

160
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,176
- What I got for you is detention.
- Oh!

161
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,679
- Fuck you, Prezbo.
- Oh!

162
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,056
Fucking gimpy-assed, big-girl motherfucker.

163
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,808
That's it. You're out of here!

164
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,355
Go!

165
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,782
Get your police stick
out your desk and beat me.

166
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,409
You know you fucking want to.

167
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,910
Ooh!

168
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,834
- Everyone, back in your seat.
- The fuck you looking at, bitch?

169
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,880
- Oh, Ms. Sampson, I...
- Namond Brice,

170
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,674
if you weren't headed
to the main office, you are now.

171
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,343
Yeah, I was just...

172
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,514
One of the corner kids, huh?

173
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,393
Yeah, they do step up
when you need them, don't they?

174
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,604
Look, what?
You want me to say you right?

175
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,688
You right.

176
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,649
I should have had protection
at the card game.

177
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,859
Done is done.

178
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,236
Now we need to decide
what we're gonna do about Omar.

179
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,863
You make the price right,

180
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,282
somebody gonna get a whiff
of that bushwhacker's ass.

181
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,160
Now you take it from there.

182
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,995
You think so?

183
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,832
I ain't saying Omar can't be got.
Any nigger can be got.

184
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,461
But once we put word to ear
and he learn that we pricing out his head,

185
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,338
he's gonna be trying us like we're trying him.

186
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,467
- You saying I should let it slide?
- Nah.

187
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,677
Nah, we get at him another way,

188
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,014
get at him without no bounties,
no bullshit like that.

189
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,850
Barksdale turned this town
upside down hunting him.

190
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,020
- All he ended up looking was weak.
- I ain't no Barksdale.

191
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,147
I'm just saying talk is cheap.

192
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,442
We sit on it,
figure out a way to get that faggot.

193
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,279
But till then we don't say a mumbling word.

194
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,245
I got me six now,

195
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,914
and I'll give you the four later, all right?
Come on!

196
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,667
- Nah. I'm gonna need the whole ten now.
- Sherrod!

197
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,004
- You ain't in school?
- Half a day - teachers' meeting.

198
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,841
I told you about those lame excuses, man.

199
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,593
- I was talking to him first.
- No need for physical contact.

200
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,346
- You got $4 for me? I'm short $4.
- What the fuck...? Oh!

201
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,767
Got a cart full of shit, nigger.
What you got for me?

202
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,020
I know you holding.
Where's it at? You ain't hear?

203
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,024
OK. It's in my shoe...my shoe.

204
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,908
Don't need the four now, son.

205
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,924
Damn, yo, where the shovel at?
Bury that nigger, man.

206
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,492
Here you go, sir. Tommy Carcetti,
running for mayor.

207
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,535
- Good luck, Tommy.
- You got my vote.

208
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,914
- Thanks. Tommy Carcetti. Here you go.
- Good luck, Councilman.

209
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,041
How you doing?
Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.

210
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,251
OK, Councilman,
time to hit the West Side.

211
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:13,685
Pretty motherfucker - he's gonna
make me go to my game face.

212
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:21,193
OK, I'll take 25 of the honeysuckle incense
cones - they'll keep me healthy for next week.

213
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,112
- Tommy!
- Excuse me.

214
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,243
Tony Gray's people
say 20 minutes at their place.

215
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,039
Shit, Clarence.

216
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,125
Look like you did in '98
when you surprised the hell out of everyone.

217
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,628
- Bring 'em on.
- Huh?

218
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,050
Why give it to us?
Why don't you stick it to Royce?

219
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,177
Because after what Tommy did at the debate,

220
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,179
it'll seem like more of the same
if it comes from him.

221
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,976
And if we use it to take four or five points
out of Royce's base,

222
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,311
it helps him as much as us.

223
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,605
Once bitten, twice shy.

224
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,316
With Tommy Carcetti,
I got to always think a step ahead.

225
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,819
Look, Tony, you ain't gonna win.

226
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
So the only question is

227
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,949
whether you wanna lose
with 24% of the vote or 28%.

228
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,618
You bring the numbers up,

229
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,745
you look good for the legislature -

230
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,164
maybe a congressional run.

231
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,918
- Albert Stokes.
- Here. Mr. P, can I go?

232
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,504
My mom told me
to go straight home after school.

233
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,047
- Mine, too.
- Mine, too.

234
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,385
You should have thought of that
before you smeared ink all over my desk.

235
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,512
Weren't my fault. My pen exploded.

236
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,808
Michael. Michael Lee?

237
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,978
Mr. P, please, can I go?

238
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,023
I ain't eat no lunch
and my stomach making all these noises.

239
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,277
Look, I won't ever disrespect
your pencil again, I promise.

240
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,114
- Zenobia, it wasn't about the pencil.
- Please, Mr. P.

241
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,124
Come on, Mr. P.

242
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,754
- OK, OK, all right.
- All right.

243
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,922
Just this one time, I'll make an exception.

244
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,219
But next time, expect to stay the full hour.

245
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,526
- Why are you here?
- Came to say sorry.

246
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,654
I didn't mean to get
all up in your face like that.

247
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,240
I appreciate that, Namond.

248
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,034
It takes courage
to admit when you're wrong.

249
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,871
I can't understand - I've seen you
in Ms. Sampson's class, working.

250
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,707
- Why can't you do the same in here?
- I mean to, I do.

251
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,711
It's just the evil get in me
and before I know it, I go off.

252
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,592
Well, tomorrow we'll see if we can't do better.

253
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,261
Can't tomorrow. Mrs. D put me out.

254
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,098
I gotta bump. Later, Mr. P.

255
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,436
If you can wait outside...

256
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,647
It's OK. He can stay.

257
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,361
Thank you.

258
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:14,282
Mr. P, you know Michael
can't make it to detention.

259
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,159
I know he didn't. Now it's doubled.

260
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,037
- He's got two days to serve.
- Nah, I mean, he can't.

261
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,206
He got to go pick up
his little brother from school.

262
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,667
He'll have to find somebody else to do that.

263
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,047
It ain't like that.
I mean, Michael would come if he could

264
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,466
but wouldn't have nobody else
to pick up his little brother Bug.

265
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,511
You know, his mother, she on that stuff.

266
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,103
We walking home. You coming?

267
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,898
No, I'm waiting on Alpo.
Ms. Sampson got him doing detention.

268
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,735
- You gonna be here till five o'clock.
- She a hard lady.

269
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,572
- Don't ever give a brother no play.
- All right. I'll holla at you later.

270
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,823
All right, yo.

271
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,619
So you're not gonna be in the NBA?

272
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,205
Then it must be the NFL?

273
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,417
I thought all the boys in class
were gonna join the pros.

274
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,210
Nah, that's just something we say.

275
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,254
So what about you?

276
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:14,509
- What do you wanna be when you grow up?
- I'm gonna own my own store.

277
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,178
That's smart.

278
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,013
You're gonna need
to know a lot of math.

279
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,894
You left them in there.

280
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,356
Hey, don't worry, Mr. P.
We got you.

281
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,691
Hey, Donut!

282
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,445
- Yo, yeah.
- Donut's crazy with cars.

283
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,363
- He can open anything.
- Hey.

284
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,241
- What up, man?
- Yo, he locked his keys in there.

285
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:46,208
- It's OK, I can call AAA.
- Oh, no problem, chief.

286
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,127
Feel the need to work them corners, huh?

287
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,507
You don't need to be doing
what you're doing.

288
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,509
I need to learn some shit on my own.

289
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,011
I'm trying to help you, Sherrod,

290
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,430
but you making it so I can't.

291
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,599
I didn't even know the man
who beat on you, Bubs.

292
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:48,395
He was short of money on the corner.
I swear he wasn't nothing to me.

293
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,522
But when the shit start,
there's nothing to be done, right?

294
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,942
What would I have done
if he started whaling on you?

295
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,319
Same kind of nothing, see?

296
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:58,822
That's how the corners be.

297
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,450
They going to use you up, Sherrod.

298
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,251
You welcome to stay tonight
but you ain't in school tomorrow morning,

299
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,962
this partnership need to be done.

300
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,660
These two precincts are the bellwether
for the Fifth.

301
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:49,080
If you can take even 18%
out of Carcetti in these,

302
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,541
it's a good guess
he won't have the numbers citywide.

303
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,211
Who are we ticketed with here?
The NDO, I hope...

304
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,922
..because...

305
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,510
This amid allegations
that high-ranking police officials intervened

306
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:06,348
to have a veteran police detective removed
from the controversial case.

307
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,768
The Braddock murder became
a focal point in the mayoral campaign

308
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,688
when Councilman Thomas Carcetti alleged
the West Baltimore man was killed

309
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,690
because he was a witness in the case.

310
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,568
They were afraid the police would prove
what they most fear,

311
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,529
that Fredro Braddock was murdered
because he was a witness

312
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,616
and the city failed to protect him.

313
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,327
It's on all three channels.

314
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,038
And the Sun and the Post
are both calling for comment.

315
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,629
My sources in the department say
rank-and-file officers are appalled

316
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,799
- by this blatant political manipulation.
- Damn, turn it up.

317
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:45,929
- Hey, Greggs, you're famous.
- ..is to remove a highly-decorated veteran

318
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,140
with 15 years' experience
as a murder investigator without reason...

319
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,226
- That'd be me.
- ..replaced with a rookie

320
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,311
yet to handle a single
homicide investigation...

321
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,105
- That'd be you.
- ..then we need to rethink...

322
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,816
The fuck I ever do to him?

323
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,739
- You gonna make it too heavy, yo.
- It might work if we make it bigger.

324
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,492
It'd work with balsa wood.
It's light and strong.

325
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,244
Man, you so full of...

326
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,162
Oh, shit.

327
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,920
Zombie Master.

328
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,678
Need to take us a little walk.

329
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,597
Nah, I'm good here.

330
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,559
Yo. Young 'uns need to move along.

331
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,354
Sure, Chris, we'll bump.

332
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,031
- Yo, Snoop, your sister in my class.
- What the fuck? You high, nigger?

333
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,701
You boys be smoking that shit?

334
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,665
Hearing good things about you.

335
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,084
Say you straight up, take care of your people,

336
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,836
not begging no handouts.

337
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,381
Motherfucker,
you hear the nigger talking to you,

338
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,008
giving you praises and shit.

339
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,802
- You standing here looking fucking stupid.
- Yo, chill.

340
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,433
- Sometimes she get a little hot.
- I'm just saying the boy ain't right!

341
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,603
Yo, we always in the market
for a good soldier.

342
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,231
When we see one we like,
we take care of the situation -

343
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,234
take him in, school him, make him family.

344
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,570
And if you're with us, you're with us,

345
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,739
just like we'd be with you all the way.

346
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,866
You have a mind, you're in.

347
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,994
Look, man. I already got a family -

348
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,247
my moms and my little brother.

349
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,832
Yeah, heard that.

350
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,251
But think on it.

351
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,508
We'll be around if you need something.

352
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,734
He saw me, yo. I knew it.
I knew Chris was asking Michael about me.

353
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,487
I knew it, man. I'm dead.

354
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,241
- Yo, man, good looking-out.
- Yeah.

355
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,118
- I thought he was gonna...
- I know.

356
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,453
What he ask about me?
I know he asked about me.

357
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:16,955
- What did you tell him?
- Calm down.

358
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,581
- It weren't even about you.
- Yo, for real,

359
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,625
you need to tell me.
What did he ask you?

360
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,547
Yo, you right, man.
Chris was all up in your business.

361
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,591
He down on you for some deep shit, man.

362
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,093
I don't even know what.

363
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,140
Nah, I'm just fucking with you, man.

364
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,933
He didn't even speak your name.

365
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,859
Oh, man.

366
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,989
So, Erv, what's next?

367
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,074
Your officers gonna shoot
a couple of tourists?

368
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,910
Maybe fly a helicopter into Harbor Place?

369
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,706
What can we expect the last week
of my re-election campaign?

370
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,958
Sir, I did what you asked - no more, no less.

371
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:06,171
- Hamsterdam - legalized drug zone?
- He takes responsibility for that.

372
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,256
- The subpoenas all over town.
- That, too.

373
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,676
The leak about the witness murder.
That was his shop too, right?

374
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,053
- Hell, yeah.
- And now this last thing,

375
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,515
transferring detectives off the case.

376
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,100
What is that? What is that?

377
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,436
- Scuttling the investigation.
- Yeah, right.

378
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,147
- Yeah, that's awful. Jesus!
- Mr. Mayor, you asked me

379
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,815
to slow that investigation down.

380
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,776
Subtle, Ervin. Mm?

381
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,196
You hold a few facts for a few weeks.

382
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,199
You put a report or two in a desk drawer.

383
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,452
But the transferring of people off a case?

384
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,372
Look, you told me...
You specifically wanted me to not...

385
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,791
Ervin, you may leave.

386
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:48,463
- Mr. Mayor...
- That will be all, Commissioner.

387
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,099
Uh...

388
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,646
No, I need a word or two
with your deputy, Ervin.

389
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,910
Have a seat.

390
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,336
I tried to warn him.

391
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,880
If it leaked out
of Homicide about the dead witness,

392
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,840
why wouldn't it leak
that we bumped a detective?

393
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,009
Why didn't you come to us beforehand?

394
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,846
I'm a loyal subordinate, Mr. Mayor,

395
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,017
and Ervin is a good man
working under considerable pressure.

396
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,310
He's a hack.

397
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,813
You're not bothered by the pressure, Deputy?

398
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,606
Not in the least.

399
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,406
I need you to make this go away, Bill.

400
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,616
I won't forget, believe me.

401
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,048
Another thing -
Slim Charles got up with me.

402
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,635
- Said the fat man want a sitdown.
- No. I did that already.

403
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,389
Slim say the fat man knew
the card game was gonna get took.

404
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,057
He did, did he?

405
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,018
Set it up.

406
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,564
- Why you always be back here?
- Quiet. And I can see what comes.

407
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,318
- But you out in the weather and shit.
- Don't like to speak in no rooms.

408
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,654
- Yeah.
- Yo, you ain't staying long.

409
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,410
So you know, I almost got that for you.

410
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,997
- I just need a couple of days more.
- You can keep my money for now.

411
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,083
- I got something needs doing.
- Anything, Marlo, your call.

412
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:53,087
Omar gonna come in your store,
stick it up, rob you.

413
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,590
You gonna call the police,
make a report.

414
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,550
You feel me?

415
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,219
Yeah, that'll work,
but you know when he get out,

416
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,930
he's coming right at me.
I ain't scared or nothing.

417
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:04,640
- I'm just saying, you know?
- He ain't gonna get out.

418
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,400
A man make bail on robbery.

419
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,320
Make it no bail.

420
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:24,285
If you have a problem,
like you can't make it to detention,

421
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,204
you need to tell me.

422
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,289
That's your responsibility.

423
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,543
People will be more than willing
to help you out but it's up to you to ask.

424
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,340
You can go back to the cafeteria...

425
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,051
or hang up here.

426
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,814
Duquan, could you come here?

427
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,912
I thought maybe you could help me out -
I packed too much.

428
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,852
Take this down to the cafeteria
and get yourself something

429
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,228
to drink from the machine.

430
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,355
Thank you.

431
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,241
Crystal, you got a second?

432
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,621
What's up with Duquan?

433
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,957
I gave him some new clothes.
I was expecting...

434
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,208
He might have lost them.

435
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,419
That fast?

436
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,047
It weren't that.

437
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,800
His people take his clothes,
sell it on the corners.

438
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,886
- You're kidding.
- No, sir.

439
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,220
Everybody knows.

440
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,395
Which brings me to what we're proposing -
different kids, different approaches.

441
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,898
You tell us who we need to touch
at North Avenue to get the go-ahead.

442
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,191
The Puzzle Palace?

443
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,986
Look, if y'all still wanna
jump in and help, I'm fine with it.

444
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,489
That's about all the OK you need in my house.

445
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,910
The Stricker Street situation
is waiting in the office.

446
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,122
Neighborhood squabbles,

447
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,916
and my babies bring it in here.

448
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,544
Two fights yesterday - all because
the mothers can't get along.

449
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,421
I gotta go.

450
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,465
Mrs. Donnelly'll work out
the nuts and bolts.

451
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,928
But just so you hear it, thank you.

452
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,640
It'll be the only time anyone
in this system will think to say it.

453
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,605
- He's a good man. You need to protect him.
- Protect him?

454
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,066
Principal Withers just went out
on a limb for you,

455
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,443
and in this system they know
how to handle a chainsaw.

456
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,029
Excuse me?

457
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,282
Anyone has a problem with what we're doing,
it's on him.

458
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,161
So, you specified eighth-graders?

459
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,624
We have 256 on roll.

460
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,043
241 attend on a regular basis.

461
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,171
Of those, 40 or so would fit your bill
of corner kids.

462
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,881
40?

463
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,134
Pretty workable.

464
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:33,057
- What would you suggest?
- Start with ten or so.

465
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,767
Ms. Sampson has enough to get you going.

466
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,143
One of them named Namond Brice?

467
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,645
Pick of the litter.

468
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,147
But you'll have to wait.
He's on a three-day suspension.

469
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,995
Remember when I was a cadet,
I was up here on a cadaver search.

470
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:58,374
Instructor gets on the radio to say,
"We're looking for one body in particular.

471
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:04,046
"If you go grabbing everyone you see,
we'll be here all day," he says.

472
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,173
Leakin Park...

473
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,467
where West Baltimore brings out its dead.

474
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,012
Not any more, from the look of things.

475
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,681
Not by the roadside, anyway.

476
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,854
If he's dumping them here,
he's dumping them deep in the woods.

477
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,275
Come on.

478
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:28,112
At each raid site, we're anticipating dope

479
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,364
or cash or guns.

480
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,536
All warrants are for prime locations
linked to high-level violators.

481
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,539
Weeks-old addresses linked
to low-level corner boys.

482
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,042
We'll also be sweeping drug corners
at these locations.

483
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,794
Wagons will hold in this location here.

484
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,172
Jump-off time - 1500 hours.

485
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,634
We take our position
ten minutes before the assault here.

486
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,969
The go is on my say-so.

487
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,723
Questions? Excellent.

488
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,933
We'll hold in the rec room
till it's time to stage.

489
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,609
Warrants are one thing,

490
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,487
but street sweeps on Marlo's crews?
Are you guys serious?

491
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,989
Carv, you give these hoodleheads
too much credit.

492
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,366
Trust me on this, Boy Wonder.

493
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:18,496
Never mind this horseshit.
What've they got you doing for your man?

494
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,122
Who, the lieutenant?

495
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,918
No, Royce. Herc, the mayor's your meal ticket.

496
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,462
He gets another four years,
you're liable to wear the gold braid.

497
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,964
Shouldn't you be out
waving a campaign sign or some shit?

498
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,723
And so ends the last crusade
of the Major Crimes Unit -

499
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,892
with a whimper.

500
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,229
Lester would cry to see his wiretap
cannibalized for that crap.

501
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,982
Street sweeps on Marlo Stanfield?

502
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,280
- So what else you got cooking?
- Narcotics cases?

503
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,366
CID has the Burman indictment
coming in.

504
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,450
Nothing past that.

505
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,871
As wars go, this drug thing
seems to rate less and less.

506
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,959
If Demper wins and manages
to forgive my trespasses,

507
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,545
maybe I'll go in and beg for something new.

508
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,173
I don't know. Just feels like enough's enough.

509
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:16,011
Crutchfield, line two, Intake.

510
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,309
- Sergeant, you were looking for me?
- I was, yeah.

511
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,978
Curly fry?

512
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,481
Chicken doohickey? Sit down.

513
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,948
Norris is back on the Braddock case.

514
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,326
It's by order of the deputy ops.

515
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,454
In fact,
we're going with a story that says

516
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,248
he was never off the case,
that you and he are partnered,

517
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,667
a task force of two, working it together.

518
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,505
Fuck you, fat man.

519
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:55,176
Not original, but succinct.
I like your approach.

520
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,179
Y'all humiliate me once
by dropping me into this thing,

521
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:01,265
and now you're gonna shame me again
by bringing Norris back.

522
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,615
This is Homicide, Detective.

523
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,326
This is not some boiler room unit
where no one pays attention

524
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,328
to whatever the fuck it is you call police work.

525
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,289
The bosses? They know our names up here.

526
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,751
Now I didn't like it when they came to me

527
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,670
and told me to dump Norris,
but dump him I did.

528
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,672
And it's not like I wanna carry water for them

529
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,383
now they're pretending they never told me
to do any such thing,

530
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,843
but carry the water I will.

531
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,053
And in the end,

532
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,889
when everyone else
in this unit is buried and beshitted,

533
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,725
this detective sergeant will still be standing.

534
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:52,274
So get the story straight -
Norris was always the primary,

535
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,610
and you are now assisting
on an investigation

536
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,570
which is progressing even as we speak.

537
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,240
Does the colonel know about this?

538
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,243
He's in the hospital.

539
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,411
Chemo didn't work.

540
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,168
Press conference is upstairs in half an hour.

541
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,629
- So don't be late.
- Press conference?

542
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,172
Mm-hm.

543
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,347
I ain't mean to laugh at you none.

544
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,809
I know it sound crazy but I ain't joking.

545
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,103
For real, Lex a zombie.

546
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,438
I knew it way before
what Na' and them was saying.

547
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:36,569
Listen, they had me tell Lex to go up
to the playground.

548
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,779
I told him to go up there and see some girl.

549
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,948
He ain't never come back down.

550
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,076
So what they gonna do to me
when they get mad at me?

551
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,997
It makes sense Chris taking them
into the vacants - to change 'em.

552
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,916
- And you know what else?
- That ain't what he doing,

553
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,377
Chris in the vacants?

554
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,504
Changing them?

555
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,840
He ain't changing them, he killing them.

556
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,843
- That's all. They're getting killed.
- How you know?

557
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,181
Can't tell nobody.

558
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,602
I seen it.

559
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,231
I seen them walk a boy
up into one house over there on Calhoun.

560
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,567
You seen that?

561
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,486
Yeah.

562
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,822
That's just false.

563
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,158
Detective Norris has been
working this case nonstop

564
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,410
and, given her narcotics expertise,

565
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,164
Detective Greggs was assigned
to augment rather than to replace him.

566
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,542
But for two days sources
inside the department were saying...

567
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:36,295
I'm inside the department,
and I'm telling you that's not true.

568
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,340
We do not play politics
with a criminal investigation.

569
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,842
And how do you explain
Councilman Gray's allegations?

570
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,345
I think you should ask
Councilman Gray that question.

571
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,229
- Police! Search warrant!
- Take the back.

572
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,941
- On the ground, now!
- Police! Search warrant!

573
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,776
Two upstairs.

574
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,114
- Don't move!
- Check that back room.

575
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,450
- Get your ass on the ground. Get down!
- Get down!

576
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,172
- This is the 1300 block, right?
- No, this is the 12.

577
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,715
Are we on the right corner?

578
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,512
- We had this as a stash house?
- According to the wiretap.

579
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,597
How long ago? They move 'em around.

580
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,483
Zeroes on the warrants.
Minor arrests on the designated corners, sir.

581
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,610
- They were tipped!
- You think?

582
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:44,655
For us to come up this empty
at all these locations, it has to be.

583
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,907
This cocksucker Marlo
thinks he's smarter than us?

584
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,702
He is not. Sergeant, I want
to know where he hangs.

585
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,914
- You mean like him personally?
- He moves around, Lieutenant. He floats.

586
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,083
But I have seen him
in the concrete park behind Fulton.

587
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,253
- In a park?
- He sits out there, holds court.

588
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:02,172
He's got people covering every approach
so there's no creeping up on him.

589
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:05,551
My guess is that he likes to talk outdoors
so no one can drop a microphone on him.

590
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,345
Sergeant, what can we do with that?

591
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,939
I admit I've made some mistakes,

592
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,275
Burrell being one of the biggest.

593
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,694
But he's got a job for about ten more days.

594
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:28,115
After the primary, he's gone, believe me.

595
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,118
And that last stunt - pulling a detective.

596
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,620
- What'd you expect?
- Not that.

597
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,917
Hey, I had nothing to do
with that nonsense.

598
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,210
That's a straight-up lie.

599
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,212
I was at that damn meeting
when you told him,

600
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,798
- "Slow the case down."
- I didn't mean...

601
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,134
Who the hell knows
what you mean any more, Clarence?

602
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,803
Look at this.

603
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,222
Look at it!

604
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,770
You gave me your word on this -
your word, Clarence.

605
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,565
But here you are ticketed up
with Eunetta in her best precincts

606
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:05,819
and then ticketed up with my girl Daniels
where she's running strong.

607
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,613
Odell, this is the first I've seen this.

608
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,450
Come on, now! This is probably
Eunetta's people pulling this shit.

609
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,161
With a "Citizens for Royce" authority line?

610
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,748
Look at you, Clarence. Just look at you.

611
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,335
You've forgotten your agenda.
You've forgotten your base.

612
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:25,881
You think a shave and some Marcus Garvey
posters are gonna get you over?

613
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,718
You think that's gonna make up for
jumping in bed with every damn developer?

614
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,847
Shit. You're even on Clay Davis's tit.

615
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,892
Don't go getting all self-righteous
with me, Odell.

616
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,269
Campaign runs on dollars - you know it.

617
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:40,437
Whose dollars?

618
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,606
Those sons of bitches
you got around your card table

619
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,483
every month feeding your kitty?

620
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,694
Oh, yeah, I know about that too.

621
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,030
You - trouble with you...

622
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:54,368
Fuck you, Clarence.
I'm gonna sit what's left of this one out.

623
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,453
- I'm gonna sit it out.
- Sit it out.

624
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,206
- The primary?
- Sit it out!

625
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,292
Odell. Odell!

626
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,129
Who the hell do you think you are, huh?

627
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,631
Come November, I'm still gonna be
the only game in town!

628
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,134
Turn your back on me now, I won't forget!

629
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,552
We can't afford this.

630
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,680
We need his organization on Tuesday.
Go after him!

631
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,308
Fuck that holier-than-thou motherfucker!

632
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,103
Delegate Watkins.

633
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,063
Delegate Watkins!

634
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,357
Wait, sir.

635
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,569
I'm sure we can work this out.

636
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,529
You and the mayor can talk this through.

637
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,250
Deputy Rawls, please.

638
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,378
It's Lieutenant Hoskins at the Hall.

639
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,277
You're gonna use the hole in the wall, right?

640
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,071
Yeah, I'm gonna rub some dogshit
on the front of this thing.

641
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,781
I don't want nobody touching it.

642
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:19,953
Got it?

643
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,631
You need to raise it a bit.

644
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,391
Yeah, that's good. Right there, that works.

645
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,065
- Thought I heard something.
- Rats.

646
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,692
- How we doing?
- We need to go.

647
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,611
He ain't nothing but a skanky-ass bitch
to begin with.

648
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,114
And besides, he ex-police.
So you know what that like.

649
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:42,160
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Bey, you need to talk to him.

650
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,331
Visiting hour ends in 30 minutes.

651
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,001
- Visiting hour...
- Yo, Daddy, don't even go there,

652
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,004
with you all the time telling me
how you dropped out in the sixth grade,

653
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,172
went up on the corner with Avon and Stringer,

654
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,800
earned cheese for the family,
saying how it made you a man...

655
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,218
All right, all right. You right.

656
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,804
Can't throw rocks. But I'm just saying,

657
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,348
you know how your mother be,
with all the fussing.

658
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:07,019
Maybe you just need to slow it up.
You know what I'm saying?

659
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,438
Yo, you heard how Marlo punked Bodie?

660
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,065
Said he either got to work for him
or give up his corner.

661
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,900
Don't you know, his sorry ass buckled.

662
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,445
You'd have gone about it different?

663
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,697
Yeah, I'd have stood tall, like you.

664
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,325
Got my nine - fuck Chris and them.

665
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,744
Listen to you, all spit and fire.

666
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,246
You'd have gone to the mattress
all by your lonesome

667
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,206
and went up against half of the West side.

668
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,585
You got it where it counts,
and I respect that more than anything.

669
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,088
But shit out there now ain't like
it was when we was coming up.

670
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,884
Back in the day,
a punk nigger like Marlo steps out,

671
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,554
breaking the rules and shit,
he find himself in the back of a car trunk

672
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,723
on the way to Leakin Park. No doubt.

673
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,642
We did that shit right. Word was your bond.

674
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,854
Man looked out for his own,
knowing he in a family.

675
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,816
Dig where I'm coming from?
But today it's all fucked up.

676
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:13,919
These steps.

677
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,963
- Thank you, baby.
- You're good to go.

678
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,268
Hi.

679
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,491
Say "Omar".

680
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,493
Omar.

681
00:45:58,631 --> 00:45:59,673
Nothing?

682
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,553
We checked both sides of the street
from here up to Monroe.

683
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,055
- Nothing?
- Nothing that don't belong in no sewer.

684
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,849
Thanks.

685
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:16,982
Other ideas?

686
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,193
Woo!

687
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,491
Blood, bump me off that nigger
up the skreet.

688
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,577
Motherfucker in the Bruick?

689
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,662
That'd be him. I be saying,

690
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,331
no motherfucker gonna
run off with my hairon.

691
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,208
This is fucking great.

692
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,795
Get somebody who reads lips,
this motherfucker's history.

693
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,548
Is this legal - I mean,
intercepting what they're saying?

694
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,175
Don't go Freamon on me.

695
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,637
Shit. I got to run.

696
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:51,683
What about some fucking relief?
I been here all morning!

697
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,917
You heard? They making movies.

698
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,169
Yeah. How you wanna play it?

699
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,381
I ain't sure. Let's see the fat man.

700
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,426
How'd the other thing turn out?

701
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,595
All good.

702
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,685
- Yo.
- What up, boy?

703
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,270
- If you want somethin', I got Reese's.
- Nah, man.

704
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:41,107
- You trying to make some real cheese? $5?
- What you need?

705
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,193
Me and Paul gonna get it on with Tiff.

706
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,988
Keep an eye out.
I don't want Mrs. D creeping up. Feel me?

707
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,991
I feel you, but I got some sixth-graders
waiting on a special order.

708
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,452
Let them wait, man.
It ain't like we gonna be all day.

709
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,583
All right.

710
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:04,381
No, ma'am, it says right here -
His Honor had the Bureau of Solid Waste

711
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,299
conduct a clean sweep along Tivoly.

712
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,301
It took six months
before they showed up.

713
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,345
Well, yeah, OK, but nobody's perfect.

714
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,931
But hey, listen. I wouldn't be
sitting here if I didn't believe

715
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,976
Clarence Royce wasn't truly committed
to this city and its people.

716
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,812
- And crime in our neighborhood?
- That's another good point.

717
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,940
But, lady, between you and me,

718
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,527
I can tell from your voice you're black
and you can tell from my voice I'm white.

719
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,404
So I gotta ask you,

720
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,574
when do you think the last time
a white man voted for a black man

721
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,617
when there was another
white man in the race?

722
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,744
I don't know,
but you must really believe in him.

723
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,581
Ain't that what I been saying?
He's just the best candidate.

724
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,375
- So you'll go with my man?
- I'll think about it.

725
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,586
That's great. Thank you for your time.

726
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,129
- Bye-bye.
- All right.

727
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,766
- I have a hall pass.
- Yeah, good for you.

728
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,313
- Mine's down.
- Attaboy.

729
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,069
You need bodies, Lester? Here you go.

730
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:55,909
We got a warrant and a teletype
for my boy Lex.

731
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:59,704
So dead or alive, he's on file.

732
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,831
And beyond that,
it's time for you to shine

733
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,168
that mighty intellect of yours
on some real murders.

734
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,504
Give up the hypotheticals and shit.

735
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,340
Yeah, I suppose.

736
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:16,888
This is my issue - crime, and I understand
completely what you're saying.

737
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,557
And if you give me the opportunity,
I will be able to do something

738
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:22,602
to help you out and, you know,
other people in this neighborhood.

739
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,735
Mr. Ricks, thank you for your time
and for your attention.

740
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,654
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

741
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,783
Pretty brazen, shaking hands
with the enemy in broad daylight.

742
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,745
- Werner's Deli this isn't.
- Definitely not.

743
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:43,581
Though here you are, Councilman,
leaving no door unopened.

744
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,208
Shoe leather - our secret weapon.

745
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,627
You surprised me.
You've made this a horse race.

746
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,339
So what makes me think you didn't
just happen by and find us here?

747
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,177
Watkins is breaking with the mayor.

748
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:58,096
How do you know?

749
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,014
I know.

750
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,809
I've carried the mayor's water
because I had to, Councilman.

751
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,769
I'd love to see some new blood in this city.

752
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:09,524
And I'd love the chance to do the right thing
for this police department for a change.

753
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,421
Wait until he turns the corner.

754
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,886
District office for Watkins -
Gilmore Street.

755
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:39,929
And fuck them red lights, man.

756
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,190
Not a place you expect to find any gangsters -

757
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,609
police, for that matter.

758
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,822
- Heard you knew something I didn't.
- Told you before,

759
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,700
I make it my business
to keep an ear to the ground.

760
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,161
I make it my business to do business.

761
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,371
We doing business, or are we just talking?

762
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,165
And if it's talk, I'm-a walk.

763
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,666
I heard the people pulling security

764
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,461
at the card game weren't too keen
on their wages.

765
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,005
I figured it was only a matter of time

766
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,800
before they found a way
to get their due compensation.

767
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,052
And you didn't think to tell me?

768
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,013
A man learns best when he get burned.

769
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,016
How do I know you ain't making this shit up?

770
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,602
You don't. Things happen on the street.

771
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,979
Proof is hard to come by.

772
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,736
Go ahead, open it.

773
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,744
Off the street, there's all kind of proof.

774
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:49,916
They planning on executing those Friday -
time it with the election, I guess,

775
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:54,420
show they doing their job,
cleaning up the city, taking down a kingpin.

776
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:56,464
How did you come by this?

777
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:59,425
Told you before, I keep my ear to the ground.

778
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,428
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Maybe nothing.

779
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,390
Charlie's not part of the co-op.

780
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,060
Or maybe I tip him for a fee.

781
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,565
What do you think a man
with a whole lot of money would pay

782
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,441
for his freedom?

783
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,362
You know, lately...

784
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,074
I come to find out someone trying
to take pictures on me.

785
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,743
- Pictures?
- Video.

786
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:28,788
You heard anything about me
through your travels?

787
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,208
Had no incentive to listen.

788
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,463
You do now.

789
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:57,901
It's one thing to sit out the primary.
It's another for me to turn on Clarence Royce.

790
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,904
- Granted.
- And if I did jump,

791
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:03,072
why not land behind Tony Gray?

792
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,909
At least he's from my side of the tracks.

793
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:07,452
Tony can't win.

794
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:08,912
I can.

795
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:15,835
Look, the truth is, whatever I can do for you,
the mayor can match or double.

796
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:20,048
I have a pretty good grass-roots organization
but nothing even close to his kind of money.

797
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,675
Now, I'll ticket up with anyone
you want me to.

798
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,803
I know you want Daniels in the 11th
and Stokes in the 10th.

799
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:28,806
I'll keep away from any tickets
you think I might harm.

800
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,060
I know I'm not everyone's idea
of a bargain on your side of town.

801
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:35,897
But right now, a week from the primary,

802
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:39,359
the fact is, Royce and I both need you.

803
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,527
After the election,

804
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:44,155
the equation changes
for him but not for me.

805
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,200
I'm a white mayor in a majority-black city,

806
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,535
and if I'm gonna do anything - and, Delegate,

807
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,496
I am so serious about fixing this city -

808
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,665
I'm gonna have to govern by consensus.

809
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,751
If you support me, you will have
a voice within my administration

810
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,628
simply because I'm gonna need it.

811
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,384
Last poll that Clarence showed me,

812
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,552
he was up by seven points.

813
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,556
Bullshit. I'm within four.

814
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:19,232
- You won't be needing that.
- I know.

815
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,736
- Here?
- Yeah, here.

816
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,443
Dag.

817
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,486
Yo, turn it off - the bulb might
have got too hot.

818
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,613
Or the battery's dying.

819
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,783
We should go back.

820
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:17,999
- Yo, man, it stinks, man.
- Ain't like it was.

821
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,599
See, he ain't move.

822
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,187
Yeah.

823
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:42,440
Blood still stuck to his hair.

824
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,525
He dead?

825
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:46,736
He dead.

826
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:48,988
Lex too?

827
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,157
He dead. They all is.

828
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,326
Feel better?

829
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,162
Donut wrong, yo.

830
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,498
Ain't no special dead.

831
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,586
There's just dead.
