1
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,881
Anybody in plumbing,
please go to aisle four.

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,960
God damn!

3
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,962
Ah, I see you got
the DeWalt cordless.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,560
Your nail gun--
DeWalt 410.

5
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:36,968
Yeah. The trouble is,

6
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,131
you leave it
in a truck for a while,

7
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,107
need to step up
and use the bitch,

8
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:43,007
the battery don't hold up,
you know?

9
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,012
Yeah, cordless'll do that.

10
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,810
You might want to consider
the powder-actuated tool.

11
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,648
The Hilti DX 460 MX
or the Simpson PTP--

12
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,778
these two
are my Cadillacs.

13
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,484
Everything else on this board
is second-best, sorry to say.

14
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,119
Are you contracting, or just doing
some work around the house?

15
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:03,562
- No, we work all over.
- Full time?

16
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,361
No, we had about
five jobs last month.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,799
Ah. With that rate,

18
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:10,895
the cost of the powder-actuated guns
justifies itself.

19
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,099
- You say "power"?
- Powder.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,631
- Like gunpowder?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:19,339
The DX 460 is fully automatic,
with a.27-caliber charge.

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,577
Wood, concrete,
steel to steel--

23
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,642
she'll throw a fastener into anything.
And for my money,

24
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,985
she handles recoil better than
the Simpson or the P3500.

25
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,923
Now, you understand
what I mean by recoil?

26
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,858
Yeah, the kickback.
I'm with you.

27
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:36,385
- That's right.
-.27 caliber, huh?

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,863
Yeah, not large
ballistically,

29
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,229
but for driving nails,
it's enough.

30
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,996
Any more than that,
you'd add to the recoil.

31
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,995
Man, shit. I seen
a tiny-ass.22 round-nose

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,440
drop a nigga
plenty of days, man.

33
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,876
Motherfuckers get up
in you like a pinball,

34
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,003
rip your ass up.

35
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,274
Big joints, though--

36
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,544
big joints, man,
just break your bones,

37
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,178
you say, "Fuck it."

38
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,621
I'm gonna go with this right here, man.
How much I owe you?

39
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,954
$669 plus tax.

40
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,293
No no, you just pay
at the register.

41
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,959
Nah, man, you go ahead
and handle that for me, man.

42
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,505
You earned that buck
like a motherfucker. Keep that shit.

43
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,490
- We good?
- Yeah, man.

44
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,495
The man said if you
want to shoot nails,

45
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,690
this here is
the Cadillac, man.

46
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,824
He mean Lexus,
but he ain't know it.

47
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,334
- Hold the charge better?
- Man, fuck the charge.

48
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,930
This here is gunpowder-activated,
.27 caliber,

49
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:55,499
full auto, no kickback,
nail-throwing mayhem, man.

50
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:57,135
Shit right here is tight.

51
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,669
Fuck just nailing up boards.

52
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,511
We could kill a couple motherfuckers
with this right here.

53
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,110
You laughing. I've been schooled, dog.
I'm trying to tell you.

54
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,313
- All right, all right.
- For real.

55
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,691
Seven and counting.

56
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,960
All of them
caught on the wire.

57
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,467
We're not above the corners yet,
but we soon will be.

58
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,130
- They're not dumping phones?
- Every month or so.

59
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,731
Sloppy enough that we may be able
to track a phone or two

60
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,742
up to Marlo or the people
he keeps close.

61
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,903
Truth is, if they're
still using cell phones

62
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,878
in this day and age,
they're mine.

63
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,881
And if Marlo Stanfield
is on a cell,

64
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,440
- he'll be mine too.
- Cool Lester smooth.

65
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,248
That's not trash talk, darling.
That's simple fact.

66
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:23,620
Marlo Stanfield may have a lot of heart
and a lot of corners,

67
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,919
but he's a babe
in the woods

68
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,755
when it comes
to this right here.

69
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,991
I was proud to be chasing those
Barksdales, but this Stanfield kid...

70
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,827
Not as fierce
as we thought.

71
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,698
For months now, there hasn't been
a body we can put to him.

72
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:38,000
- Hmm.
- You two sound disappointed.

73
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,269
This unit needs good, hard targets,
or it'll go soft.

74
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,276
Be that as it may,
I'll assume you want

75
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,403
- another 30 days on your taps.
- At least.

76
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,971
And we've got subpoenas
to go out this week as well.

77
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,678
- Subpoenas?
- Asset investigations.

78
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,552
- On Marlo Stanfield?
- Come here.

79
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,017
All this is
from the Barksdale money trail.

80
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,892
We've been running
down all the paper

81
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,727
we pulled out of
Stringer's apartment

82
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,596
and the B & B
office downtown.

83
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:11,036
- I miss Prez, man. I do.
- I hear you.

84
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,733
The truth is, those guys had
money going everywhere--

85
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:17,642
investments, political donations,
consulting fees...

86
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:18,975
You want to do this now?

87
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,606
I wanted to do
this a year ago,

88
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,616
but fresh cases
got in the way.

89
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,244
And your lieutenant's gonna
okay this kind of paper?

90
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,449
Our lieutenant has
a fearless heart.

91
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,753
- This will get you started.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

92
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,523
Wait wait wait.
Wait right there.

93
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,258
My coupons.

94
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,163
You were gonna give
this lady my coupons.

95
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,428
Been clipping them
for two days,

96
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,368
and you damn near sent them out
with your mess.

97
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,928
Well, why are they
in my pile?

98
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,496
Why is your pile
in my workspace?

99
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,030
Because I'm doing
real work!

100
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,305
Working my nerves
is what you've been doing.

101
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,813
Four weeks before
the Baltimore City primary,

102
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,287
you hand me a stack
of drug-money subpoenas

103
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,984
that hit a dozen
key political figures.

104
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,361
There's an election:

105
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,454
Who's running?

106
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,328
...and they think I can't.

107
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,301
Shit, I don't think we can
take four more years of this guy.

108
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,893
This city's in the toilet.

109
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,996
That's what they said
during my term, too.

110
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,734
Yeah well, you got
dealt a bad hand,

111
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,174
- I mean, with the riots and all.
- Yeah, sure.

112
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,768
Anyway, I think
I'll squeeze in

113
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,803
if Tony Gray draws off
25%, 26% of the vote,

114
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,838
because most of that's
out of Royce's base.

115
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,908
25% is a big number for Gray,
don't you think?

116
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,182
I don't know.
Royce's negatives are up--

117
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,155
even among black voters.

118
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,317
Yeah.
In a minute, Norman.

119
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,019
You know what
I think, Tommy?

120
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,153
No matter what,
you got your name out there,

121
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,857
and it'll help you
down the road

122
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,229
if you ever want to step up
to the legislature.

123
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,359
But as one paisan to another,

124
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:51,394
the day of the white mayor
is over in this town.

125
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,905
Excuse me,
Your Eminence.

126
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,101
You're due at the Baylor-Edison
Senior Center,

127
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,235
and I don't want to be lying
to a roomful of wrinkle-assed voters

128
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,336
because you wanted to talk shop
all the damn morning.

129
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,109
Seniors, huh?
They vote, Tommy.

130
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,049
Got to run. Sorry.

131
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,020
The candidate's on your clock.
Don't ever let him forget it.

132
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,217
No, indeed.

133
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,995
Need your sig
on vehicle logs

134
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,727
and a corrected court report

135
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,167
and office memo
subpoena requests

136
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,366
and a requisition due
to City Purchasing for a large fan.

137
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,964
A fan, huh?

138
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,839
Caroline says it stays hot

139
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,004
in the wire room
with the door closed.

140
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,511
Oh. It's beautiful,
Lieutenant.

141
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,575
- I've never seen a beach house so fine.
- You think so?

142
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,610
Shit. Makes me think
about retirement,

143
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,849
and I only got
nine years on.

144
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,858
When do you break ground?

145
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,087
Next March,
if I have my permits,

146
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,856
which reminds me--
on Tuesday,

147
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,262
I have to get over to Delaware
and see my contractor.

148
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,356
Oh, no problem.

149
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,960
Me and Lester, we'll cover for you
on that. No problem at all.

150
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,950
Cake.

151
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,425
You know what
I'm saying, yo?

152
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,724
That's my baby's mother
we talking about, yo.

153
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,560
But y'all been broke up,
right?

154
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,156
Man, I ain't living
with her or nothing,

155
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,531
but I still be giving her
a couple dollars here and there,

156
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,196
you know,
stop and pass.

157
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,229
Pandemic! Pandemic!

158
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,468
Look at this.

159
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,477
Hey, Nay.

160
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,308
- Namond!
- Hmm:

161
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,712
What the fuck am l
paying you for, nigga?

162
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,841
Oh, my fault, B.

163
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,317
Damn!

164
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,513
Yo man, and do something
with that ponytail.

165
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,545
Cops can make his ass
from a mile away.

166
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,117
Braid it or something!

167
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,186
Yeah, you know, me and Patrice
been together for a long time.

168
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,027
Yeah, but you say she running
with the boy Fruit now, right?

169
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,694
Yeah. If he don't back
the fuck off,

170
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,795
I'm gonna fill his ass
with some hot ones, yo.

171
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,500
Shit. You don't
think I will?

172
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,304
I got that pandemic.

173
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,440
Man...

174
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,947
do what you gonna do.

175
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,609
- Bodie.
- What's up, big man?

176
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,914
You ain't real with us
all week, man.

177
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,717
You stepping
on that package or what?

178
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,223
Yo, man,
everything's slow.

179
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:27,090
It been slow since we moved
down here from Fayette Street.

180
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,357
Yeah, well,
Marlo wanted Fayette.

181
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,490
Man, I do not like backing down
from niggas, man.

182
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,830
I feel like a punk.
I feel like doing shit.

183
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,995
Ain't like
the old days, dog.

184
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,369
Mayor Barksdale left.

185
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,465
You out here
on your own, dog.

186
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,435
Give it up.

187
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,913
B, let's roll.

188
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,950
Hey, Lex, man,

189
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,923
I'm gonna give you the truth
because you need the truth.

190
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,017
That boy Marlo got
the world by the ass.

191
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,051
And Fruit,
he work for Marlo.

192
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,359
So I'm saying,
fuck that bitch.

193
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,990
Pfft.
And move on.

194
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,161
- That's just the way it is.
- Yeah.

195
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,171
- That's just the way it is, man.
- Pandemic!

196
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,465
Thank you, sir.

197
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,303
Just one moment,
ma'am.

198
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,331
You seen Hoskins?

199
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,072
Lieutenant went
upstairs already.

200
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,574
Step through, please.

201
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,557
Madam President.

202
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,691
Council president's
hot as balls.

203
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,728
- I'd fuck you to fuck her, man.
- Yeah?

204
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,138
You'd fuck a guy for a chance
to fuck a hot broad?

205
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,574
You don't think that makes you
a faggot or nothing?

206
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,544
It's just
an expression, man.

207
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,554
Been on this detail
how long?

208
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,754
Eight months.

209
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,195
Eight months
with Clarence Royce.

210
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,661
So let me ask,

211
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,932
are you ready to take a bullet
for the Mayor of Baltimore?

212
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,208
Lieutenant, sir.

213
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,220
Is the truck okay,
or do we want to call one?

214
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,551
No, the truck works.

215
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,552
He said he needed
just 10 minutes.

216
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,254
No, not now.

217
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,663
Maybe tomorrow.

218
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,298
Is that Krawczyk again?

219
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,894
Every time he writes
another check,

220
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,872
he turns around
and calls for something

221
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,067
just to see that he can.

222
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,303
Getting calls
from Carcetti's people, too.

223
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,539
They want one debate
for crime and safety,

224
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,810
the other on economic stuff
and schools,

225
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,441
Tony Gray crying
the same blues.

226
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,179
Like they're gonna
get the whole night

227
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,743
to smack me
with the crime rate.

228
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,948
I told "The Sun" paper
we're open to any format,

229
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,616
which we'll be
for another couple days or so,

230
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,422
in which time we'll say,
"Fuck you. One debate."

231
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,485
Two debates. Shit!

232
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,096
That lost-ball-in-high-grass
motherfucker Carcetti.

233
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,661
He needs to get used to
life in the wilderness,

234
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,332
and not just
the downtown areas,

235
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,604
but your communities here
on the East Side.

236
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,043
We stand
or we fall together,

237
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,276
and I'm here today to ask
for the chance to stand with you.

238
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,442
Thank you
for your time.

239
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,214
Questions?

240
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,316
Yes, ma'am?

241
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,887
Is it the Salisbury steak
for lunch today,

242
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,296
or is they doing tacos?

243
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,967
Because it's developments
like this one,

244
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,441
planned residential towers

245
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,741
with waterside retail space
and restaurants

246
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,113
that grow Baltimore's tax base
and help rebuild our city.

247
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,608
I want to thank Ed Bowers
for his vision,

248
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,646
but more important,
for his commitment--

249
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,090
for his commitment
to the City of Baltimore.

250
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,320
Ed.

251
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,428
Mr. Mayor,

252
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:07,634
I want to thank you
and your administration,

253
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,472
for making this next stage
of redevelopment

254
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,274
for Baltimore's harbor
a reality.

255
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,951
You talk about vision
and commitment--

256
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,816
Mayor Clarence Royce.

257
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,032
Pandemic! Pandemic!

258
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,800
What up, Nay?

259
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,865
Yo, what up?

260
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,173
- What you got?
- Nothing.

261
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,679
It's just a story about
A.J. from North & Woods.

262
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,739
Yo, you know
they gave him 700 years?

263
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,842
Read this shit, son.

264
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:55,013
This corner is dead, man.
You still working?

265
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,216
Yeah, because we was gonna
gonna go under the road

266
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,316
- and catch some fresh birds.
- I don't know.

267
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,224
Let me see if I can bounce.
Hold up.

268
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,666
- Hey, B.
- What's up?

269
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,225
I wanted to know
if I could leave early

270
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,032
because me and the fellas
want to go down to Mondawmin

271
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,470
for some back-to-school stuff.

272
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,268
What you need
back-to-school stuff for?

273
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,774
Your ass stay suspended.

274
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,299
Come on,
stop playing, B.

275
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,039
Hey, if it wasn't
for social promotion,

276
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,604
your ass would still be
in pre-K, motherfucker.

277
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,014
Probably daycare
up this bitch.

278
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,608
Pandemic right here!

279
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,749
Fuck it.
Hey, yo, man.

280
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:32,121
Pay this late-to-work, early-to-play
nigger out for five hours, yo.

281
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,184
Yo, you owe me extra time
tomorrow, though.

282
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,026
Lex! Did you hear me?

283
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,397
Damn, y'all!

284
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,130
Young'uns don't got a scrap
of work ethic nowadays, man.

285
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,331
If it wasn't for his pops,
I wouldn't even bother.

286
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:49,468
Yo!

287
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,067
Make sure you come
early tomorrow

288
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,636
because it ain't always
gonna be this slow.

289
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,478
Pandemic!

290
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,381
At least
I hope it ain't.

291
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,579
Mr. Mayor.

292
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,383
Mr. Mayor, excuse me.

293
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,287
I just want to make sure
we're still okay

294
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:07,122
for that median cut
on Boston Street.

295
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,958
I really need that access
to make the site viable.

296
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,226
Right. I'll get
my people on it.

297
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,596
Thank you, sir.

298
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,331
Something going on
with his median?

299
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,004
Not once he ponies up.

300
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,209
I think he can do a lot better
than the 4,000,

301
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,807
don't you?

302
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,750
I don't even
want to know.

303
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,246
No, Chris, please, man.

304
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,225
We're low
on quicklime, man.

305
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,921
Doesn't matter.

306
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,828
We got vacants on both sides.
He'll stink is all.

307
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,165
Chris, please.

308
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,604
Don't fret, boss.
I got you covered.

309
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,336
Quick and clean,
I promise.

310
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,278
Chr--

311
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,497
Man, shit like that don't even
work in them cartoons.

312
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,059
The roadrunner just snatch
the birdseed and book.

313
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,503
- We ain't in no cartoon.
- Yeah, you is.

314
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,336
Shh! Be still.

315
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,001
Yeah, you scaring away
the birds.

316
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,135
I'm talking to both y'all.

317
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,703
Took me off the clock
for this craziness?

318
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,341
- What the fuck is you thinking?
- We're serious, Nay.

319
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,975
This bird could be worth
like 300 or 400.

320
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,576
Nigga, please.

321
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,952
Yo, you know the boy Nemo
who worked Marlo's pigeon coop?

322
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,219
Said he got 400
for a white homing bird.

323
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,624
- And that's a homer?
- I mean, it's white.

324
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,595
- So that makes it a homer, right?
- It could be.

325
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,530
Damn! Son, you need to put
some hamburger meat in that trap.

326
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:26,964
That shit would've been got.

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,399
Shut your mouth,
it'd have been got.

328
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,876
I'm gonna fuck
this nigga up.

329
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,714
Hey yo, what the fuck
is wrong with you,

330
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,739
throwing bottles
and shit, huh?

331
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,341
You just cost us cash money,
you know that?

332
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,943
I ain't done nothing.

333
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,614
You're a seriously backwards dude.
You know that, right?

334
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,248
Playing with bugs
like he's still in Pampers.

335
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,849
That wasn't even necessary.

336
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,587
Nah, you don't want
any Pampers.

337
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,889
Put them over
that mouth you got.

338
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,260
Catch all that shit
you be flushing.

339
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,356
- Ohh!
- Ooh!

340
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,394
Y'all be stinking
like rat fart.

341
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,460
There you go!

342
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,166
- Oh oh!
- Get him!

343
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:09,835
All right, all right.

344
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,106
Come on, come on,
come on. Come on.

345
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,772
Y'all acting like
little bitches.

346
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,337
Yo, you seen
my man Duke?

347
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,905
Clocked him, got him
upside his head.

348
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,747
Only because I didn't
want to get too close

349
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,218
and touch
the dirty motherfucker.

350
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,084
Could have come up with AlDS
or some shit like that.

351
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,986
Dukie fight
like a bitch, yo.

352
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,620
I would have whipped that ass
if I didn't feel sorry for him.

353
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,694
Duke, man,
you scared away the birds.

354
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,960
I blew me up
a bug bomb.

355
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,592
You want to come
and see the pieces?

356
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,035
Nah, I'm good.
I got to go.

357
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,868
All right.

358
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,635
Hey hey, Randy.

359
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,437
That pigeon
wasn't a homer.

360
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,774
Homers got them metal things
around their leg.

361
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,110
That way you can tell them
from the other birds.

362
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,671
How you know that?

363
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,581
You know Nemo let me clean
out his coop sometimes.

364
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,415
So... he was schooling me.

365
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,360
...which leaves us
a total of 54.

366
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:12,166
No surprises on who's coming back--
all the regulars.

367
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,503
We lost Mr. Parker
and Ms. Bowles.

368
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,872
- Gregory's leaving?
- Hired by the county.

369
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,036
And Bowles, I knew
she wasn't coming back,

370
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,774
the way they tore up
her classroom.

371
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,874
So we're short two in math
and four in science.

372
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,310
Man at the door.

373
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,151
No system l.D.,
but says he's new here.

374
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,953
Well, buzz him in before
something changes his mind.

375
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,629
All the way
on the left.

376
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,292
Pull it hard.

377
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,202
- Hard!
- It's locked.

378
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:46,830
All right.
I'll be right down.

379
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:49,967
Not a goddamn thing up in here
works like it should.

380
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,170
Well, you turn to
the cafeteria assignments,

381
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,736
and you see that's gonna leave
Ernest alone for second period,

382
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,408
and he can't handle it alone.

383
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,952
You tell them, because I ain't even
gonna try to pronounce it.

384
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,854
Roland Pryzbylewski.

385
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:07,052
Everyone just
calls me "Prez."

386
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,061
Claudell Withers.
I'm principal here.

387
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,653
New in math.

388
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,995
I won't have my certificate
until next year,

389
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,624
but with the resident
teachers' program,

390
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,635
they said I'd be
getting classes

391
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,863
because of staff shortages?

392
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:21,271
Jesus.
Lambs to the slaughter here.

393
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:25,266
What did you do before you decided
to teach, Mr. Pryzbylewski?

394
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,280
I was a police...
in the city.

395
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,643
Marcia Donnelly,
Assistant Principal.

396
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,882
Welcome to
Edward Tilghman Middle.

397
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,824
That leaves Tullman,
as I see 'em, for the 12th.

398
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,828
You think he can handle
the whole shift?

399
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,420
Now, which one's
Tullman, again?

400
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,126
Goofy redhead, kind of
looks like Opie from Mayberry,

401
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,463
but less fierce.

402
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,262
Jimmy,
Major wants to see you.

403
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,875
Jimmy, come on in.

404
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:05,212
I know I offered
when I first came over here,

405
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,776
and I know your answer then,
but I'm still asking.

406
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,549
Can I get you
out of a radio car?

407
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,147
No thank you, Major.

408
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,052
McNulty, I'm short
two men in Ops,

409
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:18,120
and my follow-up squad
couldn't make a case to save its life.

410
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:20,428
You're too damn good
to be humping calls.

411
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,024
Thanks for the offer,
though.

412
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,032
You don't think I asked him 10 times
when I was acting commander?

413
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,908
He's in the wrong
fucking place.

414
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,344
For us, yeah.

415
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:37,782
For him...

416
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,822
Yo, po-po, man.
Po-po. Shut it down.

417
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,554
Where is the love, Bodie?

418
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,464
Where is the motherfucking love?

419
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,298
I go back so far
with this kid,

420
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,860
I was chasing him
through juvie.

421
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,805
But does any of that matter
when we roll up here?

422
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,001
I get so much as a wave,
a nod, a smile?

423
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,031
Nothing.

424
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,775
- How about just hello?
- Hello.

425
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,284
See? That wasn't
so hard, was it?

426
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:16,054
Lex, my man,
how's your day going?

427
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,680
Not to criticize
or anything,

428
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,520
but I think you missed
a spot there.

429
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,618
Little Kevin,
how's it hanging?

430
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,822
Reesey, you look like
someone just shot your dog.

431
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,728
You all right, man?
You okay?

432
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,630
Reesey still messing up
the count?

433
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,793
You hear what he said?

434
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,894
Yo, dog, you send him up
to Lamelle next month.

435
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,928
I'll make sure Ms. Davis
puts him in remedial math,

436
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,234
and we'll have done
some good here today.

437
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:38,503
Fucking cop, man.

438
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:43,941
Everything good?

439
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,712
Yeah. Just words.

440
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:48,276
Mr. Entrapment,
how you doing?

441
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,222
Don't look like that.
I'm still dining out on that story.

442
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:54,055
You know how he beat
the wiretap a year ago?

443
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:57,551
Claimed entrapment when he was clocking
in Bunny Colvin's Hamsterdam.

444
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,155
Shit you not.

445
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,291
Smart kiddo.
I loved it.

446
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,666
When I roll back in an hour,
this corner's bone-dry.

447
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,500
Your people are done
for the day.

448
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,168
Okay.
So let's try this again.

449
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,236
I say, "Have a good evening,
Mr. Broadus."

450
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,206
And a good evening to you,
Sergeant Carver.

451
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:21,379
See?
We're right here.

452
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:27,420
And a very good evening
to you, Officer Colicchio.

453
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,587
Fuck yourself with a 40,
shitbreath.

454
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,794
What the fuck
was all that about?

455
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,302
- You can't bust every head, Tony.
- I can't?

456
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,464
Bust every head, who are you
gonna talk to when the shit happens?

457
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,745
Hi, Rachel.

458
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:58,089
- Tim, thanks for doing that yesterday.
- Yeah, no problem.

459
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,029
You ran late all morning--

460
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,828
Late for the seniors, late for
the Stonewall meeting with Della.

461
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,494
Late for the Gay-Lesbian Alliance.

462
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,503
Them seniors,
they talk slow.

463
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,937
Bullshit. It was breakfast
with Young Tony

464
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,203
when they sat there swapping
stories over cold coffee.

465
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,904
- Young Tony, huh?
- I was getting sage advice--

466
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,072
- From a one-term mayor?
- It wasn't his fault.

467
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,445
He takes over in '67,
sees the city burn.

468
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:24,881
That was an opportunity.

469
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,477
Spiro Agnew made his whole career
on the '68 Riots.

470
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,112
- Agnew?
- One man's shithead's

471
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,713
another man's vice president.

472
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,088
- True today as it ever was.
- Hey, is that polling data?

473
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,184
Raw numbers.
It's incomplete.

474
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:38,321
Right now, you need to be
in the call room dialing for dollars.

475
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:41,128
Aw, fuck!
I can't do it anymore!

476
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,761
I hate it. I hate it
more than anything.

477
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,896
- I fucking hate it!
- You don't do this,

478
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,963
you don't have the money to pay
for the damn TV spots

479
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,201
in the last two weeks.

480
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,472
Aw, mothersucking
cockfuckers.

481
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:55,309
Oh, Jesus.
I fucking hate this.

482
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,539
Hey there, Jim.

483
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,677
Tom Carcetti here,
remember me?

484
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,244
We met at your sister's house--

485
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,916
you know, the one that's married
to that Republican cunt.

486
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,083
I know you
don't remember me.

487
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,391
I know you don't have any use
for fucking politicians,

488
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,057
and frankly, I don't give a flying fuck
about what you think

489
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,828
or what your concerns are.

490
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,097
But I do care about what
your cute little blonde wife

491
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,626
thinks about so many things.

492
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,935
But, Jim, the reason
I'm calling is because

493
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,204
I want you to write me out
a check for $4,000,

494
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,040
the maximum allowed by law.

495
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,308
Because we don't trust you
to actually mail that check,

496
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,872
we're gonna send over a couple
of furloughed DPW workers

497
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,214
to beat the check out of you.

498
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:36,016
All finished?
You need $30,000...

499
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:38,580
in the next three hours.
No bullshit, Tommy.

500
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,149
You hit your number
or die in this room.

501
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,751
Yeah, whatever.

502
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,011
So what are you
watching, then?

503
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,543
Anything on the tube?

504
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,451
No fucking way.

505
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,923
They got enough power
in the middle of the lineup.

506
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,721
What they need is pitching.

507
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,225
What you looking at?

508
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,358
Fucking crazy.

509
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,733
Oh, like I'm really gonna give
that motherfucker a ride to Woodlawn.

510
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,261
Shit.

511
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,532
Help! Somebody help!

512
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,974
What's up, Patrice?

513
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:49,748
You're letting it ring,
right?

514
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,723
You're not hanging up
after a ring or two?

515
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:53,384
I'm making
the calls, Terri.

516
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,552
I don't know what to say.
Nobody's home.

517
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,619
30,000, Tommy.

518
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,703
You mean Lex, the boy
who used to go with Patrice?

519
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:15,270
Lester!

520
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,372
He her baby's daddy.

521
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,746
He ain't the first one
to get his spurt.

522
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,546
You ain't got to
talk like that.

523
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,986
Nigga just walked up to him outside
of the Paragon and served him up.

524
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,546
One to the face.
Whap!

525
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,491
Shoot.
He was real cute.

526
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,586
Lex and his nine took all the cute
out of that lazy-eye motherfucker.

527
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,096
Anything on Fruit's phone?

528
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,827
Nothing. I've gone
for two hours.

529
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,835
- Sure.
- It's no problem, though.

530
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,929
Sure. I really
need your help.

531
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:43,169
- Put me down for four.
- Yeah.

532
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:44,506
What about your wife?

533
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,170
Think she can
come up with four?

534
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:48,339
- I don't think we can do eight.
- The kids?

535
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,938
They're in strollers.

536
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,472
I know they're in strollers.
I was kidding.

537
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,643
That's funny.

538
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,312
Yeah, never mind.
4,000 is good.

539
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,445
- Thanks.
- No problem.

540
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,149
One to the left temple.

541
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,055
Close range in a lot
full of club trash,

542
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,425
- but of course, nobody sees a thing.
- Hmm.

543
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:06,954
- We hear your shooter goes by "Lex."
- Lex?

544
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,160
We were up
on your victim's cell phone, too.

545
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,692
We'll go back through the calls,
send you whatever's there.

546
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:14,103
Got this from his pocket.

547
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:17,040
You can pull the numbers from that
as a consolation prize.

548
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:20,307
This fucks you guys up, don't it?
Losing a guy you had wired?

549
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:23,281
Nah. We're up on several phones
on the street level.

550
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:26,648
With or without Mr. Fruit,
we're on our way.

551
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,448
You know, it's strange.

552
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,819
We're not seeing bodies.

553
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,222
This is the first drug hit
in months,

554
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:35,227
and it's Marlo's boy who falls.

555
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:38,628
- I thought Marlo was the new power.
- He is.

556
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:42,430
Shit, he's got everything
from MLK to Fulton now.

557
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:44,436
How do you hold
that much real estate

558
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,405
without making bodies?

559
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,431
You hear anything more about
this murder on your wire, Lester,

560
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,273
the Bunk expects a call.

561
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,302
Yeah, I know he does.

562
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:57,213
Oh! The hell with Norris.

563
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,116
You're my real partner, Lester.
My life partner.

564
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,120
Don't tease, bitch.

565
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,781
Look at that
bowlegged motherfucker.

566
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,315
I made him
walk like that.

567
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,898
So who the fuck
is Lex?

568
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,477
Dontrelle's cousin.

569
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,104
Used to be with
Cantel's people.

570
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,775
He working some corner
over the Hilltop now.

571
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,841
He ain't more connected
than that?

572
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:34,375
And he coming near
one of mine?

573
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,081
Wasn't about no business.

574
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,089
Pussy, man.

575
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,648
Yo, Fruit was into something
that Lex thought was his own.

576
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:43,560
You say the word, we take off
that whole motherfucking corner

577
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:44,960
every last one
of them bitches.

578
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:47,090
What corner are we
talking about, again?

579
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,032
Rag-tag shit up
on Pacer.

580
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,763
Man, they get
their shit from Joe,

581
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,668
but they're
mostly independent.

582
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:54,798
They gone, Marlo.
Just say so.

583
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,604
That what you think?
Just do them all?

584
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,338
And take their
fucking corner, too.

585
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,241
What do I want with
some off-brand Hilltop corner?

586
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,652
And why I need
to be stacking bodies

587
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,952
when there ain't no one
trying to war with us?

588
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,619
Just Lex.

589
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,821
He did one of ours,
so he got to fall.

590
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,348
Get out, Tommy.
You're done.

591
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:44,680
Get up, Tommy!

592
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:50,395
Come on, pretty boy.
Come on.

593
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,659
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

594
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,292
- Come on. Let's go.
- That's home?

595
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,859
Yeah. That's it.

596
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,371
There we go,
little trooper.

597
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:09,771
6:30 tomorrow morning.

598
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:13,114
Don't make me drag you out of bed
like you did yesterday.

599
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,642
Mm-hmm.

600
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,795
Damn, boy,
what happened to you?

601
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:30,098
Terrace Boys banged me

602
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,365
coming across the tracks
over there by Ramsey Street.

603
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,703
Teron, Manny, Herbie.

604
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,470
Man, all them
Terrace niggas.

605
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,340
They can't whoop on
Dukie like that.

606
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,812
Yeah, I know. Only we can
whoop on Dukie like that.

607
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,781
We've got to step it up,
even this out.

608
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:46,216
Nah. Fuck even.

609
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,185
We gonna hurt them
twice as bad.

610
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,450
Give 'em a whoop-ass
they ain't gonna never forget.

611
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,150
If we straight-up fight them,

612
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:55,490
there's as many of them
as there is us-- more even.

613
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,358
So what you saying?
You scared?

614
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:58,488
Nah, I'm just saying.

615
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,431
If we're gonna hurt them,
we need to think on it.

616
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:03,594
Do something go past
beating on each other.

617
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,933
You talking guns and shit.

618
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,802
Nah, I ain't talking guns.

619
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,735
What?

620
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,474
Aw, shit.

621
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,379
Randy got an idea.

622
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,685
Hey, Norman.

623
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,813
You know what I had
for dinner last night?

624
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:25,847
Tuna sub.
I ate in the car.

625
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,688
When I'm finished
writing my memoirs,

626
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,284
that shit'll be in there,
no doubt.

627
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,592
You see what I just ate?
In the car?

628
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,461
A fucking tuna sub.

629
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:35,694
In order to prevent distemper,
Norman,

630
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,634
you must vary
the candidate's menu.

631
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,034
If you're done chewing,

632
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:41,631
Iet's give these new
radio spots a listen.

633
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,278
We've seen what Tommy Carcetti
can do at City Hall

634
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,644
as a councilman.

635
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,478
While the current administration
bent to special interests,

636
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:52,984
Tommy Carcetti
sponsored legislation...

637
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,748
- What?
-...that is protecting jobs at the fort

638
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,085
by preventing the overdevelopment
of our waterfront.

639
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,489
300,000. Great.

640
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:01,618
Thanks for sharing.

641
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:06,295
...that prevented budget cuts
to vital city services...

642
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,492
Three and five zeroes--
mayor's latest TV buy,

643
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,126
and it's four weeks out.

644
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,603
- Turn that shit off!
- You don't like the spots?

645
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:15,266
I read the copy before the studio mix.
I think they're strong.

646
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,241
They're bullshit!
Weak bullshit!

647
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:19,107
I wouldn't vote for me.

648
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,044
Fuck!

649
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,910
Fuck Royce!
Fuck Tony Gray!

650
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,779
Fuck me!

651
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:28,776
Where am I going again?

652
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,913
One of those neighborhoods
between Oliver and Middle East.

653
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:34,255
Middle East. Now, that's
a good name for it-- fucking Fallujah.

654
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,955
Command performance.
Ms. Victorina Simmons.

655
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,020
She holds sway over
two big vote precincts,

656
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,998
no matter who the EDC
is lying down with--

657
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:44,434
Fucking Royce!
300,000 like it's fucking water.

658
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,437
Then there's also
the Reverend Garnett.

659
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,302
What are they complaining
about today?

660
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,501
Fucking shithole of a city.
Whining bastards,

661
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:54,205
bitching about the trash
or the crime or this or that.

662
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,271
It's my fucking fault
it went to shit.

663
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:57,543
These motherfuckers.

664
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,381
- Boss.
- They can bite my bloody ass.

665
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:06,953
Ms. Simmons.

666
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,725
Reverend Garnett.
Good to see you again.

667
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,229
I had a meeting going on,

668
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,630
but I'm here now, and I know
there's things to see.

669
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,497
We called
and called downtown,

670
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,298
and ain't nothing gets done.

671
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:19,463
Okay. Show me.

672
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,096
Right this way,
Councilman.

673
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,902
The first thing I want you
to take a look at...

674
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,941
See, you've got to drink a lot.

675
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:31,779
Think about
the water running.

676
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:33,284
And that way,
you know--

677
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,752
How the fuck you know what
water running be like, Duke?

678
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:38,278
Water been off in your house
since last year.

679
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,918
- Man, that's cold.
- Yeah, that's cold, Nay.

680
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,655
Oh, shit.
I'm ready.

681
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,607
Can't go with
niggers watching, yo.

682
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,553
When we call,

683
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:15,116
he'll send somebody,
most of the time,

684
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,618
and they write it all down
just like he doing now.

685
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:21,292
But nothing ever gets done.

686
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,166
Come here, Councilman,
I want you to see this.

687
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,999
Now, see them drug boys?

688
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,801
They block
the alleys like this

689
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,466
so the police won't
chase them down there.

690
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,100
- All this trash.
- Mm-hmm.

691
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,304
Rats everywhere.
Houses vacant.

692
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:36,678
We keep trying to get them
down here and clean this up.

693
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,343
I guess that's
too much like right.

694
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:42,717
Well, truth is,
Royce won't let the city agencies

695
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,052
take any of
my constituent calls.

696
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,956
But let me see
what I can do.

697
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,759
Come on, let me show you this
down here. Come on.

698
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:03,233
Yo.

699
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,737
Y'all Terrace niggas know that boy
who go by the name "Deez"?

700
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,906
- Deez?
- Yeah, Deez nuts.

701
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:12,041
- Aw, fuck.
- Shit.

702
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,915
Yo yo, come on,
come on, come on.

703
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,688
Yeah, come on, get him!

704
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,673
Damn! I knew those bitches
was gonna set us up.

705
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,741
Yeah, fucking say it, bitches.

706
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:48,582
Don't ever disrespect Terrace.

707
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:51,614
Damn!

708
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,216
- I fucking pissed myself.
- Fuck!

709
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,331
Over here!

710
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,170
Kick him right behind.

711
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,272
Randy!

712
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:20,175
This way.

713
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,551
Hey yo,
he went in there!

714
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,460
Remember that phrasing
is a cornerstone

715
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,865
in communicating
with your students.

716
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:39,996
This applies not only
to the questions you ask

717
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,336
or their comprehension
of the lesson,

718
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:45,775
but how they perceive
you as an educator.

719
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,438
And where does that begin?

720
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:50,710
Out loud
and enthusiastically.

721
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:55,311
I.A.L.A.C.

722
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:58,754
Let's go.
Once again.

723
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,420
I.A.L.A.C.

724
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,124
And what are we
telling ourselves?

725
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:11,033
I am lovable and capable.

726
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:13,401
Now I see
those smiling faces.

727
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:16,100
...where the listing
on the lower half of the page

728
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:19,440
indicates some typical
soft-target locations.

729
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:23,107
An officer alert to the terrorist threat
must ask himself,

730
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,639
"Do I know the location
of my soft targets,

731
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:29,814
those where large numbers
of civilians congregate?"

732
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:34,815
--Train terminals,
office buildings, stadiums.

733
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,489
Another hot zone in the classroom
is the pencil sharpener,

734
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,623
where children tend
to congregate and--

735
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,293
I had a pencil sharpener
in my class once.

736
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:46,964
Antoine Granderson ripped it
from the wall and threw it at me.

737
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,200
I'd like to know what
your lesson plan suggests

738
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,641
when Harold Hounchell sends
a full set of textbooks

739
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,668
through a closed window.
Thank you.

740
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,748
Settle down, everybody.

741
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:03,947
And for emergency procedures

742
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,719
in the event of
biochemical agents,

743
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:09,124
you can refer
to Appendix B.

744
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,128
No disrespect
to your appendix,

745
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,426
but if them terrorists
do fuck up the Western,

746
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:16,127
could anybody even tell?

747
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,226
Some Al-Qaedas were up
on Baltimore Street

748
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,238
planning on blowing up
the chicken joint.

749
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:22,399
But Apex's crew jacked them up,
took their camels and robes,

750
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,600
buried their ass
in Leakin Park.

751
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:25,542
At least
that's what I heard.

752
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:28,740
Hey, y'all want some real terrorists?
You go up on Pencey and Gold.

753
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:33,141
Hey, guys,
let's maintain our--

754
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,548
You're doing
one heck of a job.

755
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:39,056
Not another fucking word.

756
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,184
Thank you.

757
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,627
Ahem. So...

758
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:45,960
Mmm.

759
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:48,495
You beast.

760
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:51,661
I can't help it.
You stirred my manhood.

761
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:53,466
Little Boy Blue.

762
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:55,405
What the fuck
are you doing here?

763
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,702
I caught one.

764
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,801
Got a street dealer
who goes by the name of Lex.

765
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:01,175
Lester heard it
on the wire.

766
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:02,804
Lester's up on the wire:

767
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:05,338
Shit, boy, you are
out of the loop.

768
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,510
You know this mutt?
Goes by Lex?

769
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:09,816
He is familiar.

770
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:13,187
You know who
you should ask? Carver.

771
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:16,660
- Naw...
- He'd love the job, man.

772
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:19,289
All right.
Carver it is.

773
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,231
I still feel the need
to pull your coat.

774
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:25,225
- For what?
- The taste, Jimmy. The taste.

775
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,501
How about you and me hit
a few of our favorite spots?

776
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,475
You know, me on the Glenlivet,
you on the Jamey?

777
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,500
Go see if that train
is still on the track.

778
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:36,105
Why don't you come round
some night for dinner?

779
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:39,412
Say hey to Beadie
and the ankle-biters.

780
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:40,611
Dinner:

781
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,881
...Iocated
in high-rise structures,

782
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:45,947
as well as residences

783
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:47,925
are detailed alongside...

784
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,187
Thanks, Santy.

785
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:53,396
This horseshit?
You serious?

786
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:55,524
Back to school
for the kids.

787
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,301
Hey. Yo, Namond,
I'll pay you back.

788
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,973
You ain't never
gonna have no money.

789
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:15,510
Yo, Michael,
they got you?

790
00:44:15,553 --> 00:44:16,952
Ain't nothing
but a scuffle, man.

791
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,853
Everybody made it back,
though, right?

792
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,825
Naw, man, he had to the boss
to get some stitches.

793
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,088
He got hit with a brick.

794
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:24,527
I see you changed
clothes already.

795
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:26,359
He had to.
Yo, he was stinking.

796
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:29,492
Yo, Randy, man, that was
the stupidest thing you ever thought of.

797
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,729
But it was kind of funny
when it happened, though.

798
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,397
You know what I'm saying?

799
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:39,235
Yo, you want something
before he bounce?

800
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:40,801
I'm buying.

801
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,710
One for every soldier
that stood tall.

802
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:45,375
- I was down there.
- Yeah, fuck you, Duke.

803
00:44:56,428 --> 00:44:57,952
So you get out
all right?

804
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,897
Yeah. Hurt my ankle going
around the corner, but--

805
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:02,331
But you got away, then?

806
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,402
The lieutenant governor
is up in arms

807
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:15,004
because two Democratic
National Committees...

808
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,104
I know we're way late--

809
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,240
Ain't no thing.
You did good here.

810
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:20,410
Turn that bullshit off.

811
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,853
You really think they're gonna
vote for the white guy?

812
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,092
Black folk been voting white
for a long time.

813
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:37,795
You come correct,
we listen.

814
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:40,430
It's y'all that don't ever
vote black.

815
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:42,406
Shit, you got
my vote, anyway.

816
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,566
I don't have your vote,
Norman?

817
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:50,943
You're my deputy
campaign manager,

818
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:52,415
and I don't have your vote?

819
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,977
Last white man I could vote
for was Bobby Kennedy,

820
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,989
and you ain't no Bobby K.

821
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:00,547
I thought you just said--

822
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,652
I was speaking in general about
the kindly nature of black folks.

823
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:06,596
In particular,
I ain't all that kindly.

824
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,792
So you're gonna take
my fucking check

825
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,630
and run with
my fucking campaign--

826
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,499
Well, I do know
who pays me.

827
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:14,903
Yes, sir!
Oh yes, sir, boss!

828
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:18,966
Who are you gonna vote for?
Royce? Tony Gray?

829
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,468
One of them brothers.

830
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:27,180
Yeah yeah yeah.

831
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:38,792
Don't make me
tell you again.

832
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,593
It's 9:00 sharp, boy.

833
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:43,533
And I'm smelling
what has to be urine.

834
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:46,230
What you been at, boy?

835
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,866
Well, we were playing
with Dukie today.

836
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:52,376
You know how he be
with his clothes and all.

837
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,039
Well, it's good that child
has friends, I suppose.

838
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,605
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get in there.

839
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,446
Come on, now,
give me a break--

840
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,852
Come on, Dougie.
I know it's late,

841
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,446
but I got to come
backdoor like this,

842
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,718
or the agencies
won't do shit.

843
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:08,123
You know that
as well as I do.

844
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,251
Come on, Tommy...

845
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:11,489
Come on, Tommy.
Hustle.

846
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:12,962
This is ridiculous.
Come on, give me a break--

847
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,430
Look, Dougie. Yeah.

848
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,558
I'm sorry to bug you at home,
but this asshole Royce

849
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,296
won't handle a thing
out of my office,

850
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,065
and I need a couple
of alleys cleaned.

851
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:22,902
Yeah. 1200 block of
Federal Street, both sides;

852
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,602
and then Chester
and Collington

853
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:27,372
- run in either direction off that.
- Jesus, Tommy.

854
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:29,380
I know, you're gonna be out
there again in a couple days.

855
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,438
Can you call Frankie
in Special Services

856
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:31,846
and have him send
a cold patch truck?

857
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:33,510
Federal street's
a fucking tank trap.

858
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:34,540
Yeah yeah yeah.

859
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:36,520
Great. Thanks.
Love to Denise.

860
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,613
Hustle up, Tom.

861
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:40,214
How you doing?
Good evening.

862
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:41,384
Hi.

863
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:43,189
You're over
two hours late, Tommy.

864
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:45,890
You ain't gonna win
disrespecting your base.

865
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,261
Hold up, Tony.

866
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,397
Look, man.
We got to talk.

867
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:51,902
I feel the bad about the way
things have turned out,

868
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:53,631
but right or wrong,
if you're elected,

869
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,662
then I'm gonna do whatever
I can to help you,

870
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:58,574
and if I get in,
I'm gonna need your help.

871
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,875
I mean, it's not
personal, Tony.

872
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:03,881
Fuck you, Tommy.

873
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,111
So this is me?

874
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:44,278
This is you.

875
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,931
Pandemic!

876
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:02,963
Pandemic! Got that
pandemic right here!

877
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,580
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

878
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,106
I got all this from the Koreans
today at a discount.

879
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,779
When school start, I'll be selling it
for three times that.

880
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,685
Tell you what,

881
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,314
Iet me get them Skittles.

882
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,233
Naw. Do me a favor
for the rest.

883
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:31,758
Go up the block
and tell Lex

884
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,600
there's a girl
that want to see him

885
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,333
- at the playground behind Fort.
- Girl?

886
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:38,467
Tell him Patrice say he should come
to the playground after 8:00.

887
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:39,737
Why don't you
tell him yourself?

888
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,438
Look, dog,
I don't want to be taking

889
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,674
none of Bodie's shit today
about cutting work.

890
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:45,683
All right?
Just do me that favor.

891
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,618
Pandemic!

892
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,053
Pandemic right here!

893
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:54,286
For a skinny motherfucker,
he sure do sweat some.

894
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,952
We got to keep
an extra change in the car

895
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:58,326
so we don't have to come home
in the middle of the day.

896
00:49:58,363 --> 00:50:00,695
Well, we're way past
late now, so...

897
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,995
- Damn it!
- Here, let me.

898
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:09,069
Hey, Norman.

899
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:11,769
Maybe I'll go to clip-on
for a while.

900
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:13,800
Hey, Terri got in
new polling data.

901
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,574
Did you get a bump?

902
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,706
She won't show me anything
till it's all broke down,

903
00:50:17,749 --> 00:50:20,081
but, yeah, I deserve
a bump, don't l?

904
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,252
Four more weeks, Jen.

905
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,661
Quality time
with the wife and kids.

906
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,298
That's what,
four minutes?

907
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,241
More like six.

908
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:46,800
Six.

909
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:48,471
Shit, I could have got laid.

910
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,170
Yo. Yo, Chris, l--
I didn't--

911
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:20,677
Yeah. It's good.

912
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,214
Pandemic!

913
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,052
Pandemic right here!

914
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,958
No Lex.
Where's that skinny mope?

915
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:37,517
He was here earlier.

916
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:38,859
Well, fuck it.
We'll come back,

917
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:40,659
Jack him tomorrow,
no problem.

918
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:41,824
All right.

919
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,543
Share the sodas, too.

920
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,851
- What's up? What's up?
- Hey.

921
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,589
What's up?

922
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,390
Let me holla at you
real quick.

923
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:12,657
What up?

924
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,693
- You did like I said?
- Yeah.

925
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:18,326
Yeah, you must have,

926
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:19,893
because the nigga
went up the block.

927
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,666
He ain't never
coming back down.

928
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:25,403
Chris and Snoop-- pow!

929
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:26,432
What?

930
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:30,607
Look. Just be cool,
all right?

931
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:36,082
Our heroes
back from the wars.

932
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,951
Those poll numbers
tallied up yet?

933
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:39,581
Not too bad, either.

934
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:42,718
Royce, 35;
you, 26; Gray, 20.

935
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,058
19% undecided.

936
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:48,122
We're fucked if we haven't moved
any more than that. I need to be at 30,

937
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,430
and I need Tony taking
25 of his points.

938
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:52,197
Royce's negatives
are way up.

939
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:55,637
Like what, 34% unfavorable
to 43% favorable?

940
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,662
He's vulnerable.

941
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,572
Geri, understand this.

942
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,338
In order to win,
I need Tony Gray

943
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:02,744
to take a huge bite
out of Royce's lead-- huge.

944
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,145
Tony's moved, what?

945
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,843
Two points
in the last month:

946
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:09,341
That poll says one in five voters
hasn't decided anything yet.

947
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:12,618
Yeah. The first batch of radio spots
worked magic, didn't they?

948
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:14,352
How much money
we piss away on those?

949
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:17,122
Look at these First District figures.
I mean, that's my base,

950
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:20,597
and I'm polling 37%
with 24% undecided?

951
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:21,962
Fuck me! I'm done!

952
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,796
Tommy, nobody's focused
on this race yet.

953
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:25,131
We're gonna own
the First.

954
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:26,932
Christ, look at what Royce
is polling in the Fourth.

955
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,565
No doubt, Tony's got to get
some traction in West Baltimore.

956
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:31,939
Yeah, he needs
to be rounding 25%

957
00:53:31,976 --> 00:53:34,809
and headed for 30.
And, by the way,

958
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:38,611
who can tell me when the fuck did
the Sixth District become 64% black?

959
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:41,083
About five years ago
in the last redistricting,

960
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,107
mostly as I recall,

961
00:53:42,153 --> 00:53:43,586
to give your ass
more white votes

962
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:45,350
over there in the First.

963
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,687
What the fuck
was I thinking?

964
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:51,559
A hell of a lot can happen
between now and election day.

965
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:54,030
I've been ahead further
than Royce is and lost.

966
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:00,003
I can't win this.

967
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,207
Tommy, where the fuck
you going?

968
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:06,210
I'm your ride home, man.

969
00:54:12,316 --> 00:54:14,614
The man can
read a poll.

970
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:27,121
You been drinking?

971
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:28,625
I'm fine.

972
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,457
Well, you need to be fine
somewhere else.

973
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:32,985
Park curfew
is midnight.

974
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,554
City's averaging
a murder a day,

975
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:38,056
and here you are with
Rec and Park rules?

976
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:39,399
What are you,
a smart ass?

977
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:42,565
Sorry.
I didn't mean nothing.

978
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:49,141
Don't I know you?

979
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,343
I'm running for mayor.

980
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:55,819
Tommy Carcetti,
First District.

981
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,549
I'll be coming back through
in about 20, Councilman.

982
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:01,023
Do me a favor
and take it down the road.

983
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:03,146
Randy?

984
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:04,984
Yes, ma'am.
