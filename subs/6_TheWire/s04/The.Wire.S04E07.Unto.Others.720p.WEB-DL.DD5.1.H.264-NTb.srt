1
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,326
- They got Honey Nut Cheerios in here?
- Shit.

2
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,380
Yo, back the fuck up, motherfucker!

3
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,174
My man here saved my spot, yo.

4
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,268
Shame we hadn't more time together.

5
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,520
We could have made us a couple of babies.

6
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,418
Ain't nobody see shit.

7
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,428
- How's that for a message?
- Not bad.

8
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,306
Except the price on your head
ain't for four figures, it's for five.

9
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,892
For that kind of money,
I should have done you my own self.

10
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,019
So who's doing the bounty?

11
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,438
A West Side player by the name of Marlo.

12
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,024
Marlo? Can't say I know the man.

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,777
- He know you.
- Can you get me a phone call?

14
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,445
I can do you one better than that.

15
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,451
Who you calling?

16
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,205
- Police.
- The police?

17
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,166
Man owe me a favor.

18
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,810
When you walk through the garden

19
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,937
Watch your back

20
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,565
Well I beg your pardon

21
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,401
Walk the straight and narrow track

22
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,237
If you walk with Jesus

23
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,239
He'll save your soul

24
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,661
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

25
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,622
He's got fire and the fury

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000
At his command

27
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,961
Well, you don't got to worry

28
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,380
Hold on to Jesus' hand

29
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,383
We'll be safe from Satan

30
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,927
When the thunder rolls

31
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,264
But you gotta keep the devil

32
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,391
Down in the hole

33
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,356
Oh yeah, mm

34
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,738
We'll be safe from Satan

35
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,452
Gotta keep the devil

36
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,038
Down in the hole

37
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,292
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

38
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,128
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

39
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,505
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

40
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,425
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

41
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,094
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

42
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,096
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

43
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:40,488
Crime, violence, drugs,
drug addiction, failing schools.

44
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,867
All of these social problems in Baltimore City
over and over again.

45
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,329
And on June 8th, when I had to write
a column for the next day,

46
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,791
some statistics had just come out
from the FBI

47
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,085
showing an uptick
in some of Baltimore's crime.

48
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,798
And we also had a spate of five killings
in a two- or three-day period.

49
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,926
And, you know, the idea of sitting down again

50
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,555
and writing another column on this subject,
I don't know if it is important,

51
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,641
yet here I am, a citizen of Baltimore,

52
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,269
and I take my citizenship as seriously
as I take my credentials as a columnist.

53
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,731
I said, "What am I gonna say?
What can I say about this?"

54
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:21,028
If the killings continue -
between 250 and 300 homicides a year...

55
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,572
- Top of the world.
- Top of the world.

56
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,492
I knocked off an incumbent mayor, Tony.
That ain't easy.

57
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,036
National party has to take notice.

58
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,665
Young and pretty as you are,
I'm sure they've got ideas.

59
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,751
All you have to do now is run the city.

60
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,671
Tony, I've got to ask you something.

61
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,798
Why didn't you run again after the first term?

62
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:45,094
I mean, nobody had
the name you had, the organization.

63
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,430
Let me tell you a story, Tommy.

64
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,809
The first day I became mayor,
they sit me down at the desk,

65
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,311
big chair and dark wood,

66
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,731
lots of beautiful things.

67
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,443
I'm thinking, "How much better can it get?"

68
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,238
There's a knock at the door
in the corner of the room,

69
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,240
and Pete comes walking in

70
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:11,704
carrying this gorgeous Sèvres silver bowl,
hand chased.

71
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,622
It was this big.

72
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,250
"It's from the unions," he says.

73
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,877
So I think it's a present,

74
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,963
something to commemorate
my first day as mayor.

75
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,924
And he walks over, puts it on a desk.

76
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,509
I look down at it.

77
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,389
It's disgusting.
I said, "What the hell is this?"

78
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,350
He said, "What the hell's it look like?"

79
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,312
I said, "It looks like shit.

80
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,148
"What do you want me to do with it?"

81
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,859
He says, "Eat it."

82
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:48,407
"Eat it?" He says, "Yeah.
You're the mayor. You've got to eat it."

83
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,537
So, OK, it was my first day,
and Pete knows more than I do.

84
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,206
So I go at it.

85
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,918
And just when I finish,
there's a knock on the door.

86
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,546
And in walks Pete carrying
another silver bowl,

87
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,423
and this one's from the blacks.

88
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,177
"This too?" And he nods. I start eating.

89
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,389
And when I'm finished,
there's another knock and another bowl.

90
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,517
This one's from the Polacks.

91
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,978
Then after that, one from the ministers.

92
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,898
And you know what, Tommy?
That's what it is.

93
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,902
You're sitting, eating shit
all day long, day after day,

94
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,403
year after year.

95
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,530
When I realized that,

96
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,242
I decided being a downtown lawyer

97
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:35,454
and seeing my family every night
made for a fine life.

98
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,873
Just a fine life.

99
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,461
Got that dark horse right here, man.
Dark horse.

100
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,843
Dark horse.

101
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,303
Man, everyone knows
his nigger ain't about to cop, is he?

102
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,432
Spider, Spider, hold on now.

103
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,227
Come on, man.

104
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,814
Why you ain't come past my gym no more?

105
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,191
I been waiting on you for weeks now.

106
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,237
- Talk to me, son.
- You ain't my fuckin' father.

107
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,533
What happened between me and your mom

108
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,369
ain't got shit to do with you
taking advantage of the gym.

109
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,249
Now, man, I'm just saying
you one of my best, boy.

110
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,711
- If I thought it was gonna hurt you...
- Fuck you!

111
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,880
Ain't nobody gonna hurt me. Fuck you.

112
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,965
So step up and step off, unc.

113
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,593
I got customers backing up.

114
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,764
Dark horse.

115
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,683
Dark horse.

116
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,103
Five, and five more.

117
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,981
Shit. That's what that does.

118
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,443
Principal Withers, please, to the cafeteria.

119
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,945
- Last card down. Remember?
- Oh yeah. My bad.

120
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,287
Hey, guys.

121
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,540
You know I don't mind you
coming up here most days to eat lunch,

122
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,293
but I said you can't be gambling.

123
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,339
Yo, Mr. Prezbo, the quarter's
only a, you know, reminder

124
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,633
to remind me that I got 25 shells.

125
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,385
That's all.
Come on, let's see what you got.

126
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,138
Dang. Flush.

127
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,515
- But it don't beat your three nines.
- Yeah, it do.

128
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,768
- It do?
- It do.

129
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,103
It does.

130
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,189
You should have been more
cautious with your bet.

131
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,315
Figure the odds.

132
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,277
- It's our lunch break. Don't be schooling us.
- Hold on. Let him talk.

133
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,323
Well, for starters,
you have to get a count on the diamonds.

134
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,867
You know how many diamonds
there are in a deck?

135
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,410
13.

136
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,747
13, that's right.
Cards is all about knowing the numbers.

137
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,624
With the numbers,
you can calculate the odds.

138
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,294
- Now, Michael had four diamonds showing.
- Hold on. Wait.

139
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,837
What about dice?

140
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,340
I mean, does dice have odds too?

141
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,218
Cos mostly that's what we play.

142
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,720
Dice? Yeah. Sure.

143
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,098
So, can you show us the odds of dice?

144
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,141
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, man. Teach us dice.

145
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,227
- That'd be hard, man.
- For real.

146
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,396
Here comes that Jailhouse Rick.

147
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,065
The Braddock case?

148
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,860
I take it we now have permission
to solve this fucking case,

149
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,238
seeing as everyone's finished voting.

150
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,949
Solve away, you bold centurions.

151
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,542
You don't have work to do?

152
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,713
Not till I catch a fresh call, no.

153
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:35,259
- How much can you sell that one for?
- Mint condition, 300.

154
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,929
Fuck me. I need a hobby.

155
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,560
I tried, but he bucked on me.

156
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,147
I just thought he might have
come back past once or twice.

157
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,316
Sherrod's on a truant list, Mr. Cousins.

158
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,651
He hadn't been back
since you last brought him in.

159
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,574
Well, if he does come back past,
you tell him I'm looking for him at home,

160
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,076
and he can come home if he want?

161
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,079
I apologize for taking your time.

162
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,835
I see you up here undercover.

163
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,338
All right. Don't worry, dawg. I'll keep it close.

164
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,677
Mrs. Donnelly?

165
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,014
Does the school have any kind
of collection of board games?

166
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,767
Parcheesi, Trouble, Monopoly?

167
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,894
You're still teaching math, right?

168
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,437
Trying. Yeah.

169
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,154
The book room downstairs.

170
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,365
Stay on the curriculum, Mr. Pryzbylewski,

171
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,950
or you'll have an area
superintendent on our backs.

172
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,162
Remember this, yo?

173
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,209
Not in my case.

174
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,796
Them boys working the case
ain't really in the mood to listen.

175
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,715
As you can see,
I still got the lady-lawyer marker,

176
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,219
and if I recall, a police gun
got fired a while back.

177
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,513
The only reason I'm here
is because of that gun.

178
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,681
As far as Ilene Nathan goes,

179
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,519
she promised a get-out-of-jail-free
on a small felony or two.

180
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,482
This here is a taxpayer murder
with an eyeball witness.

181
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,276
The eyeball witness is lying, yo.
Come on now.

182
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,486
When have you ever known me to put my gun

183
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,071
on anybody that wasn't in the game?

184
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,824
- Omar!
- Old Face Andre is lying on me here.

185
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,076
The store owner...now why would he lie?

186
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,786
Andre working a package out the store.

187
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,663
Folk like that,

188
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,499
they tend to bear a certain resentment
toward folk like me.

189
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,835
If you didn't do this one, you did others...

190
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:37,339
Shit, I got files on two open doubles last year.

191
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,800
Shotgun shells at both scenes.

192
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,721
What about that stash-house gunfight?

193
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,432
Hm?

194
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,643
What about Stringer Bell
and his muscle dead in the warehouse?

195
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,522
If this one ain't on you,
another dozen probably are.

196
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,693
And if this one goes to court,
you can tell that jury how wrong it is.

197
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,824
I'll be seeing God long before I swear to him
on the stand.

198
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,203
You leave me at courtside and I'm done.

199
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,913
- You know that.
- Yeah?

200
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,290
So you ain't making friends.

201
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,710
I got a bounty on my head, man...five figures.

202
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,801
If I would have known
I'd be sharing quarters with all these boys,

203
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,679
I probably wouldn't have
robbed so many of them.

204
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,183
Aw yeah. That golden rule.

205
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,728
Well, since you feeling all Biblical
and righteous and all,

206
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,896
you think on this.

207
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,566
If Omar ain't killed that delivery lady,
somebody else did.

208
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,403
But you giving him a free walk
right now, though, ain't you?

209
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,948
A man got to have a code.

210
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,435
What's up?

211
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,270
Just the dice.

212
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,272
Grab the dice from any game that has them.

213
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,327
We're using that third edition, right?

214
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,499
- I don't know.
- We're using the third.

215
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,710
What are the new fifth editions
doing sitting down here in a box?

216
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,241
No way.

217
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,203
Big red, y'all. Big reds over here.

218
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,255
What's up, man?

219
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,840
Got your big yellow.

220
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,550
What's up?

221
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,176
Big yellow for you.

222
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,847
Look at you, all business and shit.

223
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,475
Big yellow bird.

224
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,478
Yo, who you bumping with?

225
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,105
Ain't no bump.

226
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,275
They got their corner, I got mine.
Ain't no thing.

227
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,069
You going up the gym today?

228
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,989
I might see you later.

229
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,868
Big yellow.
Big yellow birds over here.

230
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,163
- Well, maybe they with Marlo.
- Ain't with no one.

231
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,081
They're just young 'uns playing in this shit.

232
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,791
So what you want to do?

233
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,252
Don't want to mix here
and bring the police to our shop.

234
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,129
When they step off, you follow.

235
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,506
- Bank 'em good.
- What if they strut?

236
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,634
Yellow, big yellow.

237
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,554
Ain't no need to pop no one,
but they need a warning.

238
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,389
Make sure they know we for real.

239
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,059
Brokeback, man. Brokeback right here.

240
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,685
Fresh from the street. Brokeback.

241
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,980
- Big yellow. Big yellow bird.
- Brokeback.

242
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,107
Tried to bring out who was on me.

243
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,902
Led him to the train station.

244
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,821
How that work?

245
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,158
Had the railroad police on me.

246
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,120
Couldn't smoke.
Guy was pulling the strings.

247
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,666
You need a name.

248
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,544
You get that, I can run it down for y'all.

249
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,549
- I'll get a name.
- Camera still there?

250
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,762
Steal that motherfucker.

251
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,641
No one speaks to it,
then it's the feds sniffing you out.

252
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,646
It's only federals who'd be rich enough
to lose a camera and not go to crying about it.

253
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,983
You steal that bitch
and someone comes knocking, it's local.

254
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,529
Steal that bitch.

255
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,823
See what comes.

256
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,620
Hey, you know the boy used to be
with me running these carts,

257
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,372
go by the name of Sherrod?

258
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,624
I'm...I'm looking for him
with some good news.

259
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,544
So if you spot him, you know,
tell him to come see me.

260
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,214
That's, uh, that's $9 for two, ten for three.

261
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,633
That's ten too. That's a good product.

262
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,843
Ain't none of that alley shit.

263
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,554
People walking in front of the camera
waving hello.

264
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,055
Them Chinese made that shit.

265
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,640
- Yeah.
- You know?

266
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,103
Hey, bro. Much obliged.
It's a good deal, good deal.

267
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,314
- Remember to holler at my boy if you see him.
- A'ight.

268
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,900
All right, here we go!

269
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,486
Bubbles' Depot for my people.

270
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,156
Bubbles take care of your troubles.

271
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,574
Ain't no trouble yet.

272
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:58,994
All right, all right.

273
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,955
- Take it easy, OK?
- I know you remember me.

274
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,040
All right, be cool with it.

275
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,042
Give it up, nigger.

276
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,044
That's what I'm gonna say to you
every time we meet.

277
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,338
Money or pills, don't care which.

278
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,216
All right, all right. Cool.

279
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,385
I'm getting it.

280
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,805
See?

281
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,520
Smackdown, yo. Ace in the hole.

282
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,284
Motherfucker bad for business, man.

283
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,496
Y'all don't take care
of your neighborhood store?

284
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,879
Officer!

285
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,717
Officer.

286
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,888
How you doing, Officer?
Can you help me out?

287
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,348
I just got robbed.

288
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,809
Thank you, man. They all saw it.

289
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,936
Everybody was here witnessing everything.

290
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,899
- Took your money?
- Yeah, man. Same guy every day.

291
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,401
He went down the alley to Payson Street.

292
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,111
You can cut him off on Lafayette...

293
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,614
You can't sell on the street without a license.

294
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,910
And these movies...
It's copyright infringement.

295
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,080
- Come on, man.
- That's a hefty fine.

296
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,255
That's my ten...

297
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,550
Are you gonna rob me too?

298
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,885
That's what you're gonna do?
Rob me also?

299
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,638
Baltimore's finest right here. Thank you.

300
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,109
Everybody gather up, all right?

301
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,405
Everybody take five and gather up.

302
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,128
Mike, get in here too.

303
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,755
I want everybody that uses the gym
to hear this now.

304
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,471
Most of y'all know I came home
after being in a long time.

305
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,641
And some of y'all...

306
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,186
Shit, all of y'all probably
seen me welcoming the attentions

307
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,689
of some of the ladies who've come past.

308
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,275
Easy.

309
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,072
Now, I realize that some
of these ladies is your relations.

310
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:46,161
I ain't mean to disrespect y'all
or have any feelings hurt.

311
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,208
All y'all come in here to learn a sport
and better yourselves.

312
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,170
Ain't no need for me to get in the way of that.

313
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,300
All right.

314
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,267
If your witness is in the game,
and Omar jacked him up good...

315
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,353
- What the fuck is this?
- I'm just asking.

316
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,896
Is he kin to you or what?

317
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,106
Vernon, you ran the sheet
on that Old Face, right?

318
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,067
Yeah. He was an asshole. So what?

319
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,401
So what? What's the history?

320
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,364
Do we come behind your casework
talking this kind of shit? Do we?

321
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,449
- Come on.
- No. Fuck you, Bunk.

322
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,659
Fuck you.

323
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,035
Fuck you.

324
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,135
Soon as he come out the gym,
yo, bank his ass, man.

325
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,221
Make sure that nigger's shook.

326
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,267
He thought I wouldn't handle it.

327
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,895
Said he needed some more proof.

328
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,649
- I don't know about all this beefin', man.
- What, you scared, nigger?

329
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,070
We need to pump
your ass up some more.

330
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,501
Game on.

331
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,636
You coming round the way tomorrow?

332
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,930
I think you should stay off that spot.

333
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,598
Bitch, I'm talking to you!

334
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,142
Man, fuck you.

335
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,476
Fuck!

336
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,065
Mouthing don't work for you, nigger.

337
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,403
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

338
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,114
Y'all got to take this shit
out of the front of my door.

339
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,580
Namond, go inside.

340
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,998
Man, fuck you!

341
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,332
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

342
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:00,253
Hey, I feel you, man.
Ain't no beef here, though, all right?

343
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,634
Go inside, man.

344
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,683
Yo, what happened to your boy?

345
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,269
What the fuck happened to you?

346
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,563
Ain't nothing.
You need to see how the other nigger look.

347
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,608
- Who was that?
- I can handle that fool.

348
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,568
- You ain't have to step to.
- Shit, no!

349
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,321
You had everything under control.
Look at your face!

350
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,407
Course, I recognize the other boy
was high as all hell.

351
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,451
Anything can jump off when it's like that.

352
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,120
He'd have been on his ass
if you ain't mixed in.

353
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,507
What's going on? He into something?

354
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:47,675
Ain't none of my business.

355
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,844
Yours either.

356
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,978
Seriously, you guys ran a hell of a campaign,

357
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:00,897
no let-up, a lot of heart.

358
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,981
I'll second that.

359
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,193
I liked the shit when you trotted out
that witness story in the debate.

360
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,487
What about the fucking last-minute flyers

361
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,448
and me and the slum lord doing a tango
on the courthouse steps?

362
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,993
Wait. Parker, who was behind that?

363
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,579
- I didn't see no Royce authority line.
- Well?

364
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,588
Tommy, enough of the bullshit.

365
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,007
What the hell are we waiting for?

366
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,844
Bring your ass around here
and try out the big chair.

367
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,970
Come on.

368
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,723
- Come on around here.
- I'm not even mayor-elect.

369
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,767
General election's still a few weeks away.

370
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:42,438
You don't beat Crawford in a city where
we outnumber Republicans nine to one,

371
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,650
you don't deserve the fucking job,
now, get on around here.

372
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,698
If I lose the general election,
I'll just blame Norman.

373
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,577
- He's taking over from Terri D'Agostino.
- She did good for you.

374
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,871
She did. The national noticed.

375
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,790
She's back at DCCC looking
to target red-state delegations.

376
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,168
After what she pulled off,
I hope she got a bonus.

377
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:06,421
Hell, yeah. They gave her my share too.
Wouldn't you know it?

378
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,883
Tommy, whatever you need

379
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,595
going forward for the general election,
for the transition...

380
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,182
I want to hit the ground running,
so I need to learn the agencies, the budgets,

381
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,267
the problems...all of it.

382
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,936
Wherever you want to go,
whatever you want to look at. See to it.

383
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,939
It's a hell of a goddamn job.

384
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,192
Halfway glad to get out.

385
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,903
I'm gonna miss it.

386
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,924
Braddock case running you in circles?

387
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,927
Whole day was a waste of time.

388
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,970
Why not talk to Wardell himself?

389
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,645
Ask him if he killed the witness against him.

390
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,731
If he read the newspapers,
he already knows he's a suspect.

391
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,651
Will he take a polygraph?

392
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,987
Tell his lawyer they're about to shift
the narcotics case

393
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,282
to the federal court
because a state witness was murdered.

394
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,452
Tell him if his client doesn't cooperate,

395
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,247
he's looking at mandatory minimums
and no parole.

396
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,958
The feds don't want drug cases anymore,

397
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,419
especially not one that's gonna
fall apart without a key witness.

398
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,587
Bluff.

399
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,798
What have you got to lose?

400
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,509
Maybe he blows the box. Maybe he passes.

401
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,637
But he talks a bit either way,

402
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,391
and you, Detective, get to listen.

403
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,270
The fuck am I looking at here?

404
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,233
Birds...I think.

405
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,111
You see that there?
I think that's a wing flapping.

406
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,254
Shit. Fuck!

407
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,223
Fuck it anyway, man!

408
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,396
- Mr. Bond?
- Hey. Call me Rupert.

409
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,231
Thanks for coming over.

410
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,942
Try to get a running start,
meeting my unit chiefs.

411
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,277
No problem.

412
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,156
Congratulations on the election result.

413
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,074
You'll be coming in with quite a mandate.

414
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,409
Maybe so.

415
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,580
So, how can I help you with the transition?

416
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,751
There's not a lot of high-end
narcotics cases in the pipeline,

417
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,795
- and major crimes...
- Wasn't carded for political reasons.

418
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,591
Once the polls put me up there with Demper,
people started whispering in my ear.

419
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,761
And I also heard about your subpoenas...

420
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,388
Andy Krawczyk, Clay Davis.

421
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,265
Sir, I didn't intend...

422
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,810
To go after Royce's money men
four weeks before a primary election?

423
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,105
Yeah. I think you're wasted in Narcotics.

424
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,111
- Let me guess...
- How about VCU as unit chief?

425
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,491
- What?
- Violent Crimes Unit.

426
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,743
How about you take that over for me?

427
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,996
Carcetti ran on a platform
of dropping the murder rate,

428
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,208
so VCU is where the sparks
are gonna fly, right?

429
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,128
You're putting me in charge
of all homicide prosecutions?

430
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,927
- What about Ilene Nathan?
- She's moving up to second deputy.

431
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,185
I came in here ready to get bounced down
to misdemeanours or worse.

432
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,311
Why would you think that?

433
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,232
The subpoenas and the fact that Demper...

434
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,900
Demper lost the election.

435
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:57,777
I won.

436
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,779
And I admire your courage,

437
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,406
if not your loyalty.

438
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:03,908
Lester.

439
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,618
Excuse me?

440
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,995
Forgive me.

441
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,665
VCU is great.

442
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,835
I'm more than ready
to work murders for you, Mr. Bond.

443
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,503
Good.

444
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,463
Rupert.

445
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,426
But now she's told police sex was consensual

446
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,928
on Paul and Monnel only. So...

447
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,098
- So, Randy...
- He'll be back tomorrow.

448
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:30,184
- And the thing with the police?
- It's out of my hands.

449
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,769
Turn it down, ladies.

450
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,565
Quanice, lose the gum.

451
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,862
OK. Settle down.

452
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,115
Mr. Prezbo! What's Dukie
doing with a computer?

453
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,034
We're gonna have a computer
in the class for special projects.

454
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,496
- And another thing...
- They all new and shit.

455
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,207
Leave the old ones on your desks,

456
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,501
and put your names in the box

457
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,378
on the inside cover of the new ones.

458
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,006
OK. Did anyone have any trouble
with the homework?

459
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,801
- Charlene?
- I didn't get it.

460
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,095
- Didn't get what?
- None of it.

461
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,309
Michael?

462
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,650
That's great. Good job.

463
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,367
Is this your work?
Cos it looks like someone else's.

464
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,785
No, I did my work.

465
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,998
OK. Next time, try to remember
not to copy Quanice's name at the top.

466
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,169
Did everybody get a new textbook?

467
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,462
Yes.

468
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,589
Great. OK.

469
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,383
Well, for now at least,
you can get those out of sight.

470
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,514
Namond, why aren't you in uniform?

471
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,684
Why did you decide not to wear it?

472
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,104
I ain't in my right class,
so ain't no need for a uniform.

473
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,606
Interesting.

474
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,943
Why you always write down
everything we say?

475
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,945
Trying to get inside our heads or something?

476
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,696
You trying to get into mine?

477
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,492
Chandra, do you think this is
a beauty salon or a classroom?

478
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,164
Darnell, why didn't you wear your uniform?

479
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,042
I meant to. I did.

480
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,002
Yeah, but after a quart of vodka,

481
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,630
it'd be hard to know what color shirt to wear.

482
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,424
And you find that funny, Namond?

483
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,968
Man, fuck you.

484
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,804
Darnell has a drinking problem

485
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,974
and Namond suffers
from conduct-disorder issues.

486
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,810
- Fuck you.
- Yeah, he's got a mouth on him.

487
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,729
Is it necessary to comb your hair in class?

488
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,231
Fuck you, cheese-faced bitch!

489
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,900
- I should tell you...
- You ain't tellin' nobody nothing!

490
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,861
I was wondering why she was in the class.

491
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,906
- Chandra...
- Oppositional defiant personality.

492
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:52,159
- Get the fuck out of my face, bitch!
- I'm sorry you're having a bad day,

493
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,829
but you're gonna take a walk
with Miss Mason.

494
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,291
Come back when you've
pulled it all back together again.

495
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,876
Damn. It's bye-bye time for my girl Chandra.

496
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,878
Yeah, you think?

497
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,342
Then to reiterate,
this is a polygraph examination,

498
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,510
non-admissible.

499
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,430
The answers to all questions
are regarded as a proffer

500
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,600
- with a limited grant of immunity.
- Agreed.

501
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,853
OK. To begin, please answer yes
to a series of questions

502
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,355
regardless of whether or not
that answer is correct.

503
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,276
- Is your name Anthony Wardell?
- Yeah.

504
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,194
And you're from Baltimore?

505
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,864
Right now I'm at City Jail,
but I'm from East Side.

506
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,575
- So your answer is?
- Yeah, I'm from Baltimore.

507
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,035
Are you female?

508
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,413
Fuck is wrong with... My bad.

509
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,999
Yeah, I'm a bitch.

510
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,382
- Hey, sweet thing.
- Chandra.

511
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,052
We're working on our short essay.

512
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,345
If you...

513
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,221
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

514
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,973
Need to get down to lay down.

515
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,434
Namond, if you don't stop,
I'll have to ask you to leave class.

516
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,688
See you sad-ass motherfuckers
in three days.

517
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,399
- You're leaving class, not school.
- What?

518
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,072
What about now, bitch?

519
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,698
Huh?

520
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,410
- That's not necessary, Namond.
- You gonna suspend me?

521
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,079
We're gonna have a little talk.

522
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,415
Man, fuck y'all. I know the rules.

523
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,460
You got to suspend me.
School got to have rules.

524
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,755
- He's right.
- Can't just be throwing that shit out.

525
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,799
The point is,
I can call it like you want.

526
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,842
You want him to pass? He passed.

527
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,095
You want him to come up inconclusive,
he's inconclusive.

528
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,180
What the fuck kind of science is that?

529
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,349
Come on. Did he blow the box or not?

530
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,142
I'm here for you, Detective.

531
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,398
You know what we use the polygraph for?
Leverage.

532
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,942
To get him in here and fuck with him.

533
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,321
No wonder this shit's inadmissible.

534
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,038
Let me guess.

535
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:05,042
Swatowski is telling them
that he can make it go any way they want.

536
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,920
If you think that's how we play it,
why let your client...

537
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:12,133
Because you know there's not much case left
now that your witness is dead.

538
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,553
I don't need to expose him
to a federal charge if I can avoid it.

539
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:19,473
And because even if Swatowski
bends it for our ears,

540
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:24,186
he's let you know that Mr. Wardell
here did not blow the box.

541
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,188
Yo, I wouldn't kill me.

542
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,316
Even if it flips on me,
I ain't gonna do shit to the man.

543
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:30,526
Why not?

544
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,611
My moms and his...they're, like, cousins.

545
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,822
Came up together in the Latrobe, you know?

546
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:38,325
I've been knowing him since,
like, Head Start and shit.

547
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,827
But he was gonna testify.

548
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,455
What am I looking at on a first conviction
on this kind of waive?

549
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:46,000
Seven, eight?
Shit, I'll be out in three and a half.

550
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,962
You think I'm gonna kill my mom's
cousin's boy for three and a half?

551
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:55,593
I know that man helped get himself elected
claiming that I did me like that, but please.

552
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,183
Bum-ass motherfucker
was gonna testify against me,

553
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,643
and I swear to God I feel bad he's dead.

554
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,313
I do.

555
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,234
Hey, Ilene, I've been looking all over for you.

556
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,573
Omar Little.

557
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,409
From Bird's trial a couple of years ago.
The stick-up boy.

558
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,662
He's in City Jail on felony murder.

559
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,040
Store robbery, West Side.

560
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,418
When I gave him the card,
I told him it was for a light felony at best.

561
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,422
Yeah, of course,
but he needs to get writ out of BCDC

562
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,425
and put in protective custody
somewhere else.

563
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,803
He's sharing his address
with about 800 others

564
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,721
who have seen the business end of his gun.

565
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,724
- Why do you care?
- I'm pretty sure he's being set up.

566
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,936
How does that play with
the rest of the guys in the squad room?

567
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:50,272
All I'm asking is that you move him
to some county detention center

568
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,234
at least until I have a chance
to work back up on this thing.

569
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,862
Now, this card ought to buy him that much.

570
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,743
Is Hartford County Detention Center
quiet enough?

571
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,496
- Yeah.
- Go pick up a writ in my office

572
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,290
and tell Mr. Little my debt's paid.

573
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,337
The fact is that homicides are
off 14% in the Western this year.

574
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,340
But I'm not gonna stand here
and take credit for that

575
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,259
when all other UCR felonies are up.

576
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,428
- Why not, Major?
- A wise man once told me years ago

577
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,847
when I wasn't even a sergeant

578
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,641
that you should never take credit
when the crime rate drops

579
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,060
unless you want
to take the blame when it rises.

580
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,108
Ten-hut. Mayor-Elect is on deck.

581
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,570
Please, back to what you're doing.
I'm just here to observe.

582
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,363
At ease, gentlemen.

583
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,616
Major Daniels, continue your presentation.

584
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,662
In any event, rather than allow
my post cars to patrol at random,

585
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,582
I put two-man cars in the posts
with the worst drug corners,

586
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,459
Edmonson Avenue, Poplar Grove,

587
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,795
Fayette and Baltimore Streets,

588
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,881
North Avenue.

589
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,510
Now, if nothing else,
a two-man car is more aggressive,

590
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,972
and that helps push it away
from the most volatile corners,

591
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,474
- which may be having an effect.
- Just pushing it?

592
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,603
I'm not devoting my resources
to cheap street arrests.

593
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,148
Instead,
I'm trying to bring every officer I can to bear

594
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,150
on making quality felony cases.

595
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:20,487
I could do more but it's my opinion
that not enough of the troops I have

596
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,157
are sufficiently trained to properly
investigate such cases.

597
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,201
Major, you just insulted your command.

598
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,122
Respectfully, sir, too many
of my people have spent years

599
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,584
chasing street-level arrests
where they grab bodies and make stats.

600
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,669
But that doesn't teach you
how to write a proper warrant

601
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,213
or testify properly as to probable cause,

602
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,674
or use and not get used by an informant.

603
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,718
I wish it were otherwise.

604
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,470
But if I'm chasing felony cases,

605
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,889
I can only bring a minority
of my officers to bear.

606
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,682
You've got all of it already!

607
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,560
Make a nigger work. You like that shit.

608
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,395
Ain't that right, motherfucker?

609
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,525
You can't hide, son. Don't care where it is.

610
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,403
In a nigger's ass crack, I'll still find you.

611
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,251
Damn. Fucked that man up.

612
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,879
- Yeah, boy.
- All right.

613
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,215
So we starting later than I wanted.

614
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,051
You said you was gonna
creep out of school after lunch.

615
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,803
I tried. They won't put me out.

616
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,389
Shit. Ain't no school
gonna hold me if I want to go.

617
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,391
It's this new class they put me in.

618
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,560
It's all fucked up, yo,
they working all backwards and shit.

619
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,314
All right, let's get to this.
Yo, Bobby, you working the stash.

620
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,566
Why aren't where we was yesterday?

621
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,819
- The spot was right.
- This is good here?

622
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,322
The fuck is wrong with you?
He was on this strip yesterday.

623
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,740
This ain't shit.

624
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,077
If you don't want to sell my shit,
fuck you, Kenard.

625
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,996
I keep my money.

626
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,748
- This spot is just as good as the other.
- Shit...

627
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,838
Carv, do you know how much
that video camera cost?

628
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,256
4200,

629
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:05,092
which makes our adventure
with Fuzzy Dunlop

630
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,927
look like a fucking walk in the park.

631
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,303
To get the camera from ISD,

632
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,431
you had to get authorization
from your supervisor.

633
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,434
A member of the MART squad
to the front desk.

634
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,146
You lost it doing police work.
Your lieutenant will understand.

635
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,399
Marimow?
You know what that asshole understands?

636
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,818
Burning motherfuckers
for petty shit like this.

637
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,529
- Help me, Carv.
- This is not my problem.

638
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,157
Don't fuck me, Carv. Don't fuck me now.

639
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,786
You know what this is?
This is one of those enabling relationships.

640
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,246
Enable me, Carv.

641
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,958
Enable me to find my fuckin' camera.

642
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,757
- You're seeing pigeons?
- Last night we did.

643
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,260
Me and Sydnor ran the West Side
looking at every pigeon coop we could find.

644
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,555
This morning, nothing in the monitor.

645
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,807
- Did you check the pawnshops?
- Every one.

646
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,518
I know this asshole Marlo has my camera.

647
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,271
- Ah, fuck me.
- What?

648
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,148
You just reminded me.

649
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,650
I had to brief this kid last week
who knew something

650
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,402
about a murder that Marlo's people did.

651
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,821
- I meant to call Bunk.
- Bunk caught the case?

652
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,033
No. Actually, he had a warrant
for the guy who supposedly got killed.

653
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,993
I rode around with him on it a while back.

654
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,873
What about me? I got problems here, man.

655
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,462
The only thing you can do is get some wood
on Marlo Stanfield or his people.

656
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,839
Scare him enough to send the camera back.

657
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,883
What do you have on Marlo?

658
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,510
I know he's a drug dealer.

659
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,553
I can't prove it or nothing, but I know.

660
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,348
Detective Pitts, pick up 2594. Pitts...

661
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,141
OK, listen.

662
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:38,602
How about I let you debrief the kid first?

663
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,979
- See what he gives you.
- This gets the camera home?

664
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,483
Maybe not, but maybe the kid
gives you some shit on Marlo.

665
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,485
Maybe even gives you a murder.

666
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,029
Before you call Homicide,
you walk it back to Marimow

667
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,989
like the cat with the mouse in its teeth.

668
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,700
You bring him the murder,
he forgives the camera.

669
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,247
Lumen, line 5.
Lumen, pick up the fucking phone.

670
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,460
Looking for Detective Moreland.

671
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,756
Could you have him call Sergeant Carver
at the Western, please?

672
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,218
Carver? Western? Hm.

673
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,929
Got it.

674
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,223
Hm.

675
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,352
Jeez.

676
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:24,898
Fuck the Bunk.

677
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,362
- Thoughts on your cabinet?
- Lots of them.

678
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,240
But top of the list,
Ervin Burrell's ass is gone.

679
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,577
I told Royce to dump him
more than a year ago,

680
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,914
but Clarence didn't want to piss off
the ministers until after the primary.

681
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,499
Primary's over. He can do it now.

682
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,918
You think Royce is gonna do you that favor?

683
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,337
He's thinking about taking a poke at Elijah

684
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,798
and running for the Seventh District
congressional seat.

685
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:53,218
He's gonna need every black minister
in town to lay hands upon him.

686
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,095
- Fine. I'll do it myself.
- You won't.

687
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:59,558
Royce can fire a black police commissioner,
but the newly elected white mayor cannot.

688
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,144
Brothers who voted
for you'll be at your throat.

689
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,521
What if I got a black commissioner
to replace the son of a bitch?

690
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,358
Under Burrell, the only black deputy
is Cawthorne, and he's 70.

691
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,903
After that, it's just majors and lieutenants.

692
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,447
We go outside, nationwide search.

693
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,783
Deputy chiefs in New York or LA
make more than their police commissioner.

694
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:20,495
If you're talented and black,
why would you be in Baltimore?

695
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,750
I have often asked myself that very question
on a number of occasions.

696
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,795
So I'm stuck with Burrell. Fuck.

697
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,635
Have a seat.

698
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,805
Don't keep him late.
He's got school in the morning.

699
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,808
- I thought he was suspended.
- They're letting me back in.

700
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,644
Miss Anna'd want me to be home by nine.

701
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,355
Send him on to Bunk after you're done.

702
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,482
Look after him. He's a good kid.

703
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:54,821
You hungry?

704
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,325
- Yeah.
- Let's eat.

705
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,331
Hey, kid, let me ask you right off the bat,

706
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,168
you know what a police
surveillance camera looks like?

707
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,755
You sure you don't want to ride
with Lieutenant Grace?

708
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,674
She'll be in command of the ship.

709
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,801
What's the point of a ride with the bosses?

710
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,970
I need to see what the troops see.

711
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,555
I love the idea of a mayor
who knows what we're up against.

712
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,516
Officers McFarlane and Ginter,

713
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,602
the mayor-elect will be riding
with you in sector three.

714
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,104
- How you doing?
- Hey.

715
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,188
Don't let him get captured.

716
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,442
I didn't know nothing about it
in the beginning.

717
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:36,446
Little Kevin just told me to tell Lex
to go up to the playground behind Fulton

718
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,282
cos his girl was up there.

719
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,285
- And Lex got killed?
- Yeah.

720
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,703
Where'd he get killed?

721
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,456
So you weren't there to see him killed?

722
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,294
I told you. Little Kevin told me
to tell Lex to go up to the playground

723
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,878
and see this girl Patrice.

724
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:56,049
Later, Kevin come up to me
and tell me Chris and Snoop killed the dude.

725
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,677
- What's Kevin's last name?
- I don't know.

726
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,263
- You don't have his name?
- Little Kevin is all I know.

727
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,892
So you told the guy to go somewhere,
and then you heard he was killed,

728
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:09,730
but you don't know where and you don't
even know if anyone found the body?

729
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,232
- How do you know Lex is dead?
- Everybody know it.

730
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,735
- Who is everybody?
- Everybody from around the way.

731
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,364
People be saying that Chris and Snoop
be turning niggers into zombies for Marlo,

732
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,241
but I know that ain't true.

733
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,076
When you dead you dead, is all.

734
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,411
Zombies, huh?

735
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,121
You know what this is?

736
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,081
This is bullshit.

737
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,417
- You're bullshitting me.
- No, sir.

738
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,253
You were right there
when this Lex fellow got dropped.

739
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,755
- No.
- You were.

740
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,674
You're an eyeball witness
who can get me Snoop and Chris both.

741
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:38,967
- I told you...
- Look, kid,

742
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,886
if you were there, you can say so.

743
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,179
We can do a lot for you,

744
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,556
maybe help you out
with this problem at school.

745
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,308
I ain't got a problem no more. I'm good.

746
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,101
- You were there, right?
- Herc.

747
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,603
Just say you were there!

748
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,397
How do you like being mayor?

749
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:53,940
I've still got to win the general election

750
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:58,195
and the inauguration's not till December,
so what do I know?

751
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:01,281
Well, you can't do any worse than Royce.
City's going to shit.

752
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:05,786
Yeah.
Well, what do you guys suggest I do first?

753
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,288
An air strike.

754
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,376
Drop white phosphorus on everything
between here and North Avenue.

755
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,045
Seriously. That shit works.

756
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,090
My brother's a marine.
They use WP over there in Fallujah.

757
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,510
Signal 13, shots fired.
200 North Calhoun.

758
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:22,803
Bang. There it is.

759
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,847
Now you're gonna see some shit,
Mr. Mayor. Pardon my French.

760
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,147
You know what's fucked up?
No one hears the gunshot.

761
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,566
On the canvass,

762
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,735
no one even claims to hear the shot.

763
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,531
So look, our next move is
to work back on Wardell's visiting list.

764
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,538
If the sergeant asks, I'm on the street.

765
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,672
The fuck is that 13 on Calhoun Street?

766
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,258
I don't know,
but they 10-32'd it ten minutes ago, sir.

767
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,760
You're not dropping me off
at my crib, are you?

768
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,347
You can leave me a block or two up from here.

769
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:08,849
I could walk the rest of the way.

770
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,017
Don't want to be seen with the police?

771
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,186
Yeah.

772
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,772
All right, boss. I'll pull over right here.

773
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,413
What the fuck was Carv thinking?
This kid can't give me a murder.

774
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,040
We go right at Marlo.

775
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,586
Fuck the back door when we can
go in the front, you know?

776
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,675
I want a detective at University in case
the guy that comes out makes a declaration.

777
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,594
Have someone in the room with him.

778
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,804
Officer Leach is being transported to you.

779
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,682
Service weapon's with Detective Hollister,
on their way to ballistics.

780
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,560
No. No, looks like a clean shoot.

781
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:57,606
I've got spent shells from two suspect
weapons, different calibers, both recovered.

782
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,860
No, I'm not out here at the scene.

783
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,322
But call the PIO and have him issue
a statement from downtown.

784
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:09,451
Tell the SAO that if they want to survey
the scene, they need to move now.

785
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,496
Crime Lab is finishing up
and the OCME van is here waiting.

786
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,498
Yeah....

787
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,751
- Isn't that the Western District commander?
- Yeah, Daniels.

788
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,461
He's the duty officer tonight.

789
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,546
Seems to know his business.

790
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,757
He ain't as bad as some.

791
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,409
Police.

792
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,921
Baltimore Police.

793
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:16,388
OK. There's still 85 eligible from September
who need an October day.

794
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,098
That'll work, ma'am.

795
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:21,267
I'm counting on you fellows to get it done
before the end of the month.

796
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,228
I can keep you on salary till then.

797
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,481
You know what? This ain't for me.

798
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,235
I thank you for the opportunity,

799
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,738
but it ain't so much to just bring
a man for a day or two.

800
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:39,244
I mean, if you had something
where I was working with these kids...

801
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,418
Anyway, thanks again.

802
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,387
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

803
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,805
Thought you was at Ida Wells.

804
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:00,849
Language arts position opened up here.

805
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,434
I came over last year.

806
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,603
- Hey. What's up, Coach?
- Hey.

807
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,649
You come over for your boys?
Some kind of program?

808
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,444
Nah. Something else. Didn't work out really.

809
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:18,575
Be well.

810
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,421
You mind if I give him a go?

811
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,506
- Sure.
- Fuck you.

812
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:37,927
OK.

813
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,642
- But you're still in this room.
- Fuck you.

814
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,026
You're not going back
till you learn to behave.

815
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,987
- Fuck you.
- Until you show you can handle it,

816
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,406
you're not going back to your regular class.

817
00:51:58,741 --> 00:51:59,866
Fuck you.

818
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,870
And you damn sure ain't going home
cos there ain't no more getting suspended.

819
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,709
Mr. Colvin, sir?

820
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,005
Fuck...you.

821
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,721
Cos I ain't feel like it. That's why.
This is bullshit.

822
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:26,059
I ain't reading no motherfucking book either!
I don't even know nothing about it.

823
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:29,062
And you always getting on my ass
and shit about some book.

824
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,398
Fuck you, you cheese-faced bitch!

825
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,276
Albert, Albert, settle down now.

826
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,405
- This gonna be harder than we thought.
- It's fascinating, isn't it?

827
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,367
- Class...
- This ain't no different than the other class...

828
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,035
Clinically speaking.

829
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,668
- Yo, your points are full.
- I'm hot. Come and get it.

830
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,670
All right. I'll cover that.

831
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,256
- Me too.
- I'm betting with my boy Randy.

832
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,842
You about to get your money taken.
Come on.

833
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,428
- Get up. Thank you.
- Thank you.

834
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,847
Pay up, sucker.

835
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,724
Randy, what are you doing?
Didn't we go over this?

836
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:10,019
- How many ways can you make a four?
- Not enough for his black ass.

837
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,646
Look who's talking.

838
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,859
He just come today, so he missed
the whole thing about the odds.

839
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,068
Right.

840
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,611
Randy,

841
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,781
there's only three ways
to make a four,

842
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,992
- but to make a seven...
- Six.

843
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,619
That's good.
So what should have been your play?

844
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,371
Should have bet against the roll.

845
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,165
Good to have you back, Mr. Wagstaff.

846
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:35,795
- Come on, roll 'em, man.
- I got 40. I got 40 on it.

847
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,562
Trick them into thinking
they aren't learning, and they do.

848
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,992
Been looking all over for you.

849
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,577
You found me.

850
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,373
Look, I been thinking, Sherrod...

851
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:18,046
We're going about our thing all wrong.
You know, I made the mistake.

852
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,257
I was thinking I knew you better
than you knew yourself.

853
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:29,599
This corner mess will bring you down fast.
You know.

854
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,602
I think you need to come home, right?

855
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,438
You come by tonight,
and we work this shit out.

856
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,941
Why don't you just step right now?

857
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:39,943
I don't get paid till eight.

858
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,862
Eight, huh?

859
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,454
You all right?

860
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:54,040
Just a little tired, that's all.

861
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,380
So I'm gonna see you tonight, right?

862
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,781
You want to help me take his statement?

863
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,241
Braddock case is down.

864
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,369
Room two.

865
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,793
You veteran crimefighters
got a name for this, right?

866
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,212
"Murder weapon" or some shit like that?

867
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,558
- No fucking way.
- Slug from autopsy matches

868
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:56,269
two more I pulled from
that smoke hound's back yard,

869
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,688
block into the alley
from where Braddock fell.

870
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,148
Our guy's dead from a stray?

871
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:04,402
He was shooting at 40s
and Clorox bottles blocks away,

872
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,404
using potatoes for a silencer.

873
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,156
Bite me. That's ridiculous.

874
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,201
So our guy's dead
because a bullet misses a bleach bottle.

875
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,329
And this fuck Carcetti gets to be the mayor
behind this stupidity.

876
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,624
I fucking love this town. I do.

877
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,129
Nice pull, Greggs.

878
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,465
Soft eyes.

879
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:37,810
Sherrod!
