1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,300
<i>And not only do we hear and appreciate</i>
<i>your input, but we are fully committed...</i>

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,400
<i>to giving 110% in our efforts</i>
<i>to fight this war against drugs...</i>

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,400
<i>and take back your streets.</i>

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,100
<i>But we can't do it alone.</i>

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,500
<i>So when you see illegal activity,</i>
<i>we need you to pick up the phone...</i>

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,800
<i>- and call it in so that we can get...</i>
- Man, that's bullshit!

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,700
<i>Please hold all your questions...</i>

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,000
I near wore out my phone
dialing 685-DRUG, and for what?

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,900
Those boys is back on the corner
the next damn day!

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
<i>The fact remains that</i>
<i>the Police Department can't do it alone.</i>

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,400
<i>We need your cooperation.</i>

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
My cousin Willy Gant cooperated.
He went downtown and testified.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,600
- He deader than 2Pac today.
- Damn shame.

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,800
<i>Look, I know the problem</i>
<i>seems insurmountable...</i>

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,900
<i>but we are making progress.</i>

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,300
<i>Take a look at this chart.</i>

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,200
<i>This line here represents...</i>

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,600
<i>- I have the microphone, ma'am.</i>
- Let the woman speak.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,400
My kids, they can't play outside no more.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,900
Some nights, when we hear these pops...

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,400
- we got to sleep under our beds.
- Right on.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I come home from <i>work...</i>

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,200
I can't even get up my front steps...

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,500
'cause they're occupied
by the drug dealers.

25
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,800
That's right, you tell him!

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,600
Is that in that picture you got up there?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
<i>I'm Major Colvin.</i>

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,300
<i>I apologize for giving you</i>
<i>the wrong impression tonight.</i>

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,200
<i>We mean no disrespect.</i>

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
<i>I know what's going on</i>
<i>in your neighborhoods.</i>

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,800
<i>I see it every day.</i>

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,400
<i>Ma'am, it pains me that you cannot enter</i>
<i>your own front door in safety...</i>

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,200
<i>and with dignity.</i>

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,200
<i>The truth is...</i>

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,100
<i>I can't promise you</i>
<i>it's gonna get any better.</i>

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,700
<i>We can't lock up the thousands</i>
<i>out there on the corners.</i>

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,100
<i>There'd be no place to put them</i>
<i>even if we could.</i>

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,300
<i>We show you charts and statistics</i>
<i>like they mean something.</i>

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
<i>But you're going back</i>
<i>to your homes tonight...</i>

40
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,400
<i>we're gonna be in our patrol cars...</i>

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
<i>and them boys still gonna be</i>
<i>out there on them corners...</i>

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,300
<i>deep in the game.</i>

43
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>This here is the world we got, people.</i>

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,500
<i>And it's about time</i>
<i>all of us had the good sense...</i>

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
<i>to at least admit that much.</i>

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,500
So, what's the answer?

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,900
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,100
<i>But whatever it is, it can't be a lie.</i>

49
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,500
First time I ever heard
a cop say something like that.

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
It's all yours, Sergeant.

51
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,300
As I was pointing <i>out...</i>

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,700
Who gave him a can of gasoline
and told him to put out the fire?

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,600
<i>- We are making progress...</i>
- Tommy Carcetti.

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,500
- Marla Daniels. I'm running for...
- Gonna take a run at Eunetta Perkins.

55
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,900
I know who you are.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,700
I've seen you with Delegate Watkins
a couple of times already.

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,500
Well, Councilman,
this is not your home district.

58
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
What brings you to the West Side?

59
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,700
I got the Public Safety Subcommittee...

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,700
so here I am.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
Anyway, good luck with Eunetta.

62
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,600
And welcome, Miss Daniels,
to the noble calling of public service.

63
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,000
<i>Further west in your neighborhoods...</i>

64
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,100
<i>the numbers of crimes against merchants</i>
<i>are way, way down.</i>

65
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,400
<i>We believe we're making significant...</i>

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,900
- What the hell was that?
- Tired of the bullshit.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,200
Tired make you lose your mind?

68
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,200
So, what you need from Bubs?
I mean, exactly?

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,700
The lay of the land.

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,000
Who has what corners,
now that the Towers are down.

71
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,800
We wanna know what happened
to the Barksdale people, especially.

72
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,400
And this pay how much?

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,800
Let's treat it like a real job. Say $5 an hour.

74
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,400
$30 on a day, max.

75
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,200
That's less than minimum wage.

76
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,200
But there's no withholding, Bubs.
It's tax-free.

77
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,600
All right.
It feels good to be out here, you know?

78
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,200
I mean, gainfully employed.

79
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,000
- Thought your boy was coming, too.
- Johnny?

80
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,600
He don't think much of this here with y'all.

81
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,700
Besides, he happens to be...

82
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,300
one of the laziest white boys
to ever shit between two shoes.

83
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,900
Me, I've been working since I was a kid.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah? What's your résumé read like, Bubs?

85
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Just curious.

86
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,500
Well, I ain't claiming no payroll jobs, Kima.

87
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,900
It's been a while since I punched a clock.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,400
When was that?

89
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,200
Long time ago.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,700
Before I had a sheet.

91
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,400
Shit, I <i>was...</i> I was still clean.

92
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,000
I got one of those stock boy jobs...

93
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,900
one of those
"cheapest guys in town" stores.

94
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,000
Unloading appliances...

95
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,700
taking air conditioners and shit
out to the customers' cars.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,300
Like that.

97
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
"How many you want?"

98
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,300
What happened?

99
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,900
I put a clock-radio in the trashcan one day,
trying to be cute, got caught.

100
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,200
I didn't even need a clock-radio.

101
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,000
See, that's me, though. Born fuck-up.

102
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
All right, you know what?

103
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,000
$5 an hour, $30 on the day.

104
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,600
That'll work.

105
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,200
And this here is
your "get out of jail free" card.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,900
On this card
is my full name and phone number.

107
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,700
A police officer was shot in this
neighborhood a couple of weeks ago.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You all know the incident
I'm speaking of, right?

109
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,500
I'm looking for the officer's gun.

110
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,900
A Glock 9...

111
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,600
which happened to misplace itself
during this incident.

112
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Now, I don't care...

113
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,600
I don't care who has it now.

114
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,100
I just need it to find its way home.

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,000
Y'all don't happen to know a fellow
by the name of Peanut, right?

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,200
I didn't think so. Well, anyway, gentlemen,
you know, one hand washes the other.

117
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,800
You give me a good word on that gun and
I can make almost any charge disappear.

118
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Any questions?

119
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Huh?

120
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,100
Get them out.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,100
Shit, I had to try something.

122
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,600
One each. One each.

123
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,200
Keep it moving. Little boys.
Yellow tops all day long. Right here.

124
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,100
All right, all right. Come and see him
and get that knockout shit, all right?

125
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
Much obliged. Good looking.

126
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,100
- Yo, he down across Fremont?
- Yeah.

127
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
Now we're on this side.

128
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,200
Oh, and Barksdale is down the way.

129
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,400
Got the red tops, y'all, red tops!

130
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,900
Spider bags here!

131
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,200
My nigga.

132
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,700
Yo, spider bags!

133
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Come get the red tops, red tops!

134
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,200
- Major crimes unit.
- Look at that.

135
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,100
- It's <i>slowly...</i>
- He's not in right now.

136
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,800
- All right.
- To what do we owe the honor?

137
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,400
Just checking in.

138
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,800
Why? You got something going on?

139
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,300
Nothing too sexy.
Just pushing a case uphill...

140
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,800
inch by inch on Kintel Williamson...

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,700
our stated target.

142
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,400
We're working, too, Lester.

143
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,400
Yeah, on your own thing.

144
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
You even listening to me, McNulty?

145
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
I got a real case to bring in.

146
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,200
Fellow name of Stringer Bell.
You might have heard of him. I don't know.

147
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
You got a mouth on you, boy.

148
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,200
He's still out there, Lester.

149
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,900
He's got his corners, his money.

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,100
Fuck it. By now, for all you know,
he's got all that downtown real estate.

151
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,100
Motherfucker probably owns
half of Baltimore...

152
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
- without us even knowing it.
- That ain't the point.

153
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,000
Do you even know what happened
to all that real estate, Lester?

154
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,000
All that downtown property
Bell has title on?

155
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,600
Fuck, no.

156
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,000
He's probably laughing his balls off
right now. At you, me, Daniels, all of us.

157
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,800
You even pretending to speak
for anyone other than yourself, McNulty?

158
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm speaking for the job.

159
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,200
You wanna talk about police work?

160
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,800
I was doing the job
when you was just dreaming on it.

161
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,000
Daniels was out there, too.

162
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,300
Now, you gonna fuck him
when he pulled you off a goddamn boat?

163
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
He's a boss. Fuck the bosses.

164
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,000
Maybe Daniels plays a few games
to get by...

165
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,500
but he's cost himself plenty
for the sake of the job!

166
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,100
He's earned some loyalty.

167
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,800
Fuck loyalty and fuck you, Lester.
I never thought I'd hear...

168
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,000
that chain-of-command horseshit
come out of your mouth.

169
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Motherfucker, I've spent a lot of time
in a lot of weak units.

170
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
More than you.

171
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,700
Now, this here may not be perfect,
but it's a chance to be police.

172
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,400
Well, then be one.

173
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,500
You're not even worth
the skin off my knuckles, junior.

174
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
Jimmy, don't.

175
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,700
You put fire
to everything you touch, McNulty...

176
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,100
then you walk away while it burns.

177
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,000
I got nothing more to say to you.

178
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,300
Nothing.

179
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,100
And you...

180
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm surprised at you, girl.

181
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,400
Daniels raised you from a pup.

182
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,900
Gotta get with Bubs.

183
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,600
Check on those fucking properties.

184
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Well, Major Colvin, what do you think?

185
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,900
Well, it all sounds good.

186
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,300
But before I give you a final answer,
I need to speak with my wife.

187
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm not talking about the position.

188
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,000
Your cheesecake.

189
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,300
The cheesecake's fine.

190
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,200
They bring it in from Michael's,
out on York Road.

191
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,800
It's got a little cinnamon in the crust.
None better.

192
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,200
Of course, I'd like to think
our offer's pretty damn good, too.

193
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,400
Excuse me while I go
to the little boys' room, gentlemen.

194
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,100
I need to tinkle.

195
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,700
Tinkle?

196
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,000
I never understood
why a grown-ass man gotta talk like that.

197
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,300
He need to take a piss,
whether he know it or not.

198
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,700
You'll get used
to these academic types, Bunny.

199
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,300
Especially when you get
that first paycheck.

200
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,300
I mean, 80 K is nothing to sneeze at
for a number-two security job.

201
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,600
Full bennies on top of your pension.

202
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Yeah, it's generous.

203
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,800
And dull. In a good way.

204
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,200
I mean...

205
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,200
the worst you'll ever see is a rape.
A date rape, maybe.

206
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
You're ready to take it down a notch,
aren't you?

207
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,800
Hell, yes.

208
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,800
Yeah, that's how I felt.

209
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,300
My only regret was
that I didn't tell the Deputy Ops...

210
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,800
to stick it in his ass
on my way out the fucking door.

211
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Hey, Johns Hopkins wants you, Bunny.

212
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
And they wanna pay Johns Hopkins money.

213
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,300
But what? You gotta ask your wife?

214
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,100
Oh, man, I ain't gotta ask her nothing.

215
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm just letting Mr. Jenkins stew a little,
is all.

216
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
Wonder what's keeping him.

217
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,200
All he had to do was tinkle.

218
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,000
I guess he felt the need
to make a dookie, too.

219
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,200
They got corners up on Argyle...

220
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
and along Fremont up top.

221
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Avenue corners belong to everybody.

222
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Some who were with Barksdale,
and some independent-like.

223
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,200
McHenry Street got
some of Barksdale's people, too.

224
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,500
But Gangster Webster's crew
is right beside them.

225
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,100
What about the Lower Avenue corners
and the Poe Homes?

226
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,700
They belong to this young boy
named Marlo.

227
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,900
- Go by the name of Black.
- Marlo?

228
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,600
Young boy.

229
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,200
Got all that good real estate
near downtown.

230
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,700
Got himself the lunchtime trade.

231
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,700
If Bell and Barksdale
were gonna hold anything...

232
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,400
they'd hold on
to the Homes and Avenue corners.

233
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,900
Marlo one of Barksdale's people?

234
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,300
Marlo what?

235
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,300
Come on,
you got anything else on this guy?

236
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
You got another tip, maybe?

237
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
So much for the hourly wage.

238
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,700
107M703. Yeah.

239
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,800
That's the tag on the truck he ride.

240
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,700
107M703.

241
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,200
Did you prime it?

242
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,900
That little rubber ball right there,
next to the spark plug.

243
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
You gotta push it in three times
before you try to start it.

244
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,200
Gets the gas going to the carb.

245
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,000
You want the truth?
I ain't never used one of these.

246
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,300
Never had no call to.

247
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,900
Yeah, well, I didn't pick you up
for your landscaping skills.

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
All these Spanish? They own paper, too.

249
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,500
I only use people like y'all.

250
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,300
Sometimes it comes back on me,
sometimes it works out fine.

251
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,200
- For how long you been uptown?
- 10 years.

252
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,300
Hotter than a motherfucker out here.

253
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah, it's hot. Every day.

254
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,500
You gonna be riding in the back
of that hard truck, bouncing around...

255
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,800
every day.

256
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,600
And your back's gonna be yelling at you
every day.

257
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,700
I used to drive an SL.

258
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,300
Pretty gold convertible. Nice rims.

259
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,400
I don't even think on that car no more.

260
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
You put it behind you, huh?

261
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,100
Some can.

262
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,100
I'm just saying,
you wanna stay on the straight...

263
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,300
ain't gonna be no big reward to it.

264
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,200
This is it, right here.

265
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,400
Prime that bitch three times.
She'll start right up.

266
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,000
- Miss Pearlman?
- Cedric.

267
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
How goes Kintel Williamson?

268
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,900
- Anything there for me yet?
- No, not yet.

269
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
We'll get there.

270
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,400
Is that all you came by to tell me?

271
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,300
Just keeping the lines of dialogue open.

272
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,800
So, what's on your plate?

273
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Oh, there's plenty of surprises around here.

274
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,800
Parole hearing. This soon?

275
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,900
He fingered a dirty guard
up at Jessup, apparently.

276
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,100
Got a big gold star next to his name.

277
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,700
That's some bullshit.

278
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,300
Yeah, well, not to worry.

279
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,600
They send me the hearing notifications
for a reason.

280
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,400
"Mr. Barksdale ran a continuous
violent criminal enterprise...

281
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
"and was a major drug trafficker.

282
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,300
"During the years 1999 to 2002...

283
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,400
"he was strongly suspected
to have ordered or caused...

284
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,600
"the deaths of over a dozen individuals."

285
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,800
Parole Commission's not gonna walk him
on his first trip to the plate.

286
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,600
Not after a letter like that.

287
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,100
- Good work.
- I have my moments.

288
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,000
Nice suit, by the way.

289
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
Thanks.

290
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,300
I see you dress left.

291
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,800
Every day.

292
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,700
<i>The number you have called</i>
<i>is no longer in service.</i>

293
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
<i>If you feel you've reached this recording</i>
<i>in error...</i>

294
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,400
<i>please check the number and dial...</i>

295
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,400
Nothing?

296
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,200
That's an address up off of Reisterstown,
same one he was showing two years ago...

297
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
when I ran the car he was using.

298
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,400
- Stringer's a settled guy.
- Not there, he ain't.

299
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,500
Woman living there, last time I checked.
Just a front name.

300
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,000
His girl, maybe.

301
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,700
Not unless he likes them over 50
and asshole-ugly.

302
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
I'm sure she's real nice, though.

303
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,200
Good school spirit.
Always says hi to you in the halls.

304
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,500
You think he met her in college?

305
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,300
What? What did I say?

306
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,000
What you got?

307
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Tag comes back
to an address over on Dukeland.

308
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
Female, 53 years.

309
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,200
See? That's how they do.

310
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,200
Yeah, but I got a hit on a Marlo,
street name of Black.

311
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,400
Marlo Stanfield. 22 years.

312
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,600
BPI number and a pretty good sheet.

313
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,300
What, you thought he'd be cherry?

314
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Oh, I knew he'd have his cherry busted,
but not like this.

315
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,400
Check it out.

316
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Think I'm gonna take a ride downtown
to Homicide. Wanna come?

317
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Nope, got someplace to be.

318
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,000
This thing with Lester...

319
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
I feel like shit about it.

320
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Well, you'll get used to it.

321
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,500
We roll up and we get out of the car.

322
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,200
Crowd parts like the Red Sea, victim's
on the ground, bleeding all over the place...

323
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,300
screaming, "I'm gonna kill
that fucking bitch."

324
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,100
But it's like
nothing's really wrong with <i>him...</i>

325
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Oh, shit.

326
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,100
You tried to sneak by me, didn't you?

327
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,300
I was just coming in quiet and respectful.

328
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,900
Well, for a big man,
you do have a dancer's grace.

329
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,100
But I, sir, I have the eyes of an eagle.

330
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,600
And the fact that you tried to slither
into your work space undetected...

331
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
does not bode well
for the recovery prospect...

332
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,700
of our missing firearm, does it?

333
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,300
I'll get it.

334
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
What up, Mr. Bunk?

335
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,600
Hey, girlfriend.

336
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,000
Vernon Holley working tonight?

337
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,600
Yeah, he's 4:00 to 12:00.
You should try the coffee room.

338
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,700
All right.

339
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,700
Man, I would murder that...

340
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,600
- if she <i>wasn't...</i>
- Particular?

341
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,500
Hey, Crossfield, that line that's blinking's
for you.

342
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,700
- Find that gun.
- Yeah, okay.

343
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,100
Motherfuck you, too.

344
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,500
Marlo Stanfield, a.k.a. Black.

345
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,500
- Boy's the spawn of the devil, Kima.
- I see.

346
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,000
And y'all damn near had him
on this murder.

347
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,400
- What happened?
- We had a wit.

348
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,200
Boy they called Pooh Bear,
chubby fellow with braids.

349
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,200
We stashed Pooh over in East Baltimore...

350
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,000
even had him wear
one of those electronic bracelets...

351
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,700
so we could find him quick.

352
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,900
- You lost him?
- Not exactly.

353
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,600
Pooh went back to the West Side
to cop some hydro.

354
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,900
He could've bought the same weed
where he was, right?

355
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,900
We found him with two in his chest
and one in his mouth.

356
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,500
The bracelet led us
right to the spot where he fell.

357
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,100
Those things work.

358
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,600
Yeah. Marlo's serious.

359
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,800
That motherfucker's real.

360
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,700
I don't know, I think
a volcano's way better than a computer.

361
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,000
You see computers every day.
How often do you see a volcano?

362
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,800
Yeah, but that guy built the computer.

363
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,400
Hey, you built the volcano.

364
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,700
Big whoop.

365
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,700
Can I keep it?

366
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,400
Yeah, if you want to.

367
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,100
- Good night, Mikey.
- Good night.

368
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,800
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

369
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,100
It's good that you came.

370
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,800
- He was very proud.
- Glad to.

371
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,500
Jimmy, there's a problem with the alimony.

372
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,200
What's the problem?

373
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,700
You're behind by like four months.

374
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,900
What can I tell you?
I'm paying $2,000 a month in support.

375
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
- After that, there's nothing left.
- Right.

376
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,000
But you signed a separation agreement
that gives me another $1,000 in alimony.

377
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,200
Elena, I only signed that fucking thing
'cause I thought we'd be together.

378
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,100
Look at how much I make.
I'm not even close...

379
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,300
to being able to pay that much
every month.

380
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,100
My lawyer says that we have to serve you.

381
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,900
What, that suit of a boyfriend
won't cough up any cash?

382
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,000
Blood from a stone, darling.

383
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,000
Beginning today...

384
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,100
you can sell drugs in West Baltimore...

385
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,500
but only where we say you can.

386
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,900
Push them hard.

387
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,800
Get to it, people, and don't get captured.

388
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,500
Hey! Stay right there.

389
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,400
Get him up against the wall.

390
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,800
Hey, listen to what I'm telling you.

391
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,500
You know, kids...

392
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,000
this is a simple fucking thing
we're saying here.

393
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,200
If you stay on this corner,
you're going in a wagon.

394
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,600
If you move yourself down
to the free zone...

395
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,000
down to the vacants along Vincent Street...

396
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,200
then you can do
whatever the fuck you want!

397
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,800
How much fairer can we be?

398
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,700
Hey, I saw that, you little fuck.
What's your name?

399
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,800
You got a name?

400
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,800
Peanut Butter and Jelly.

401
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
Address?

402
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,900
What's your address?

403
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,500
I stay over on Dolphin Street.

404
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,300
Your address, numb nuts.

405
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,900
Are there any numbers
on the front of your fucking house?

406
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,800
Listen up.

407
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,000
This corner is indicted.

408
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,700
We're coming back tomorrow, and
when we do, everybody wears bracelets...

409
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,900
unless you move your shit
down to Vincent Street...

410
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,600
down where the houses are all vacant.

411
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,200
You do that, we don't give a shit!

412
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,700
Vincent Street is like
Switzerland or Amsterdam.

413
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,100
What the fuck is that?

414
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,500
It's one of those countries
where drugs are legal.

415
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,100
Vincent Street is your Amsterdam
in Baltimore.

416
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,100
You go down there, we don't give a fuck.
You stay here, you go to jail.

417
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
I ain't going to no Hamsterdam.

418
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,400
He killed a witness, huh?

419
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
The way that Vernon Holley told it, yeah.

420
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,200
So Marlo's a hitter.

421
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,900
Maybe he works for Stringer.

422
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,300
Makes sense.

423
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,500
If you need me, I'm gonna be West Side.
What about you?

424
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,900
I gotta get the scent of my boy, Stringer.

425
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,400
We've been off him too long.

426
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,800
What's your first move?

427
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,400
Something Prez said.

428
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,100
"P and P"?

429
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,600
B and B. Like the liquor.

430
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,900
You mean, liqueur, Plauzinski...

431
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,300
- Pryzbylewski.
- Benedictine and Brandy.

432
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
That was invented
by a bartender over at Club 21.

433
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,000
All that good shit comes out of New York.

434
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,500
I need every deed transfer
involving that company, Harry.

435
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,100
Today.

436
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
Yo, I'm asking them corner boys
if they know...

437
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,700
where the Barksdale package be at.

438
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
And they looking at me
like I ain't even talking.

439
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,800
On this strip, Marlo's the name ringing out.

440
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
There he is. You see him?

441
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,400
He didn't stay too long.

442
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,700
Yeah, Marlo's ghosting.

443
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,700
We're kind of sensitive about giving out
personal data on matriculating students.

444
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,500
Well, I could come back with a court order.

445
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,900
- Then I'd have to give it to you.
- Look.

446
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,500
My man has serious issues with women.

447
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,600
Domestic violence, really ugly stuff.

448
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
I can't show you any paper.

449
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,900
But let me get my screen up.

450
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,100
What did we tell you?
What'd we fucking tell you, man?

451
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,400
We told you to get yourselves
down to the free zone, didn't we?

452
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,000
We're trying to give you guys a break.

453
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,100
We're offering <i>you...</i> What's that?

454
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,300
Amnesty.

455
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,300
You take your crew down to Vincent Street.

456
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,200
You do your dirt,
nobody's gonna bother you.

457
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,800
What do you say?

458
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,700
You guys fucking brain-dead?
What do you say?

459
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,300
Yo, chief, how you gonna come up here
and try to game us?

460
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Say what?

461
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
I'm saying you acting
like we retarded or something...

462
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,100
- Better we put a foot in your ass?
- At least we'd understand it.

463
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,500
- This ain't a trick, shitbird!
- Look, we grind, and y'all try to stop it.

464
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,000
That's how we do.

465
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,800
Why you gotta
go and fuck with the program?

466
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,100
All due respect.

467
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,500
Nothing but tumbleweeds.

468
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,800
Get me some buses.

469
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,800
Tomorrow we clean the corners.

470
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,200
Put them all in one place
and give them the news.

471
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,100
And I'm not asking anymore.

472
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,500
From here to Fremont...

473
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,200
you got Barksdale's people,
East Siders and freelancers, too.

474
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,300
- On the same corners?
- Yup.

475
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,400
That shit don't make sense.

476
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,700
Yo, can we call it a day, Kima?

477
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,200
- Bullshit, man.
- You, too?

478
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,100
What the fuck is up with these phones?

479
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,700
I've been seeing kids
throwing them away all day.

480
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
They got cash like that to waste?

481
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,000
Them shits be laying all over, man.
Sometimes you get lucky.

482
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,900
Find some minutes on them,
sell them for walking-around money.

483
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,200
- They burners, Kima.
- Burners?

484
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,100
<i>Marron,</i> another murder.
In Waverly, no less. You believe it?

485
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,500
I would be fucking shocked if it was
an African-American perpetrated the crime.

486
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,600
It ain't even funny, Ash.

487
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,700
This is why everyone's leaving this city,
black and white.

488
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,400
I was at a community meeting,
Sunday, in West Baltimore.

489
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,800
People were spitting mad,
and I can't say I blame them.

490
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,000
Well, they could move
to a better neighborhood. That is...

491
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,400
if they were willing to work for it.

492
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,000
Come on, I've been hearing that
"my poor immigrant father made it...

493
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,900
"so why can't the blacks?" bullshit
my whole life.

494
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,900
Think there's not good people
on the West Side...

495
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,600
- who want the same things that you...
- Okay, Mrs. Roosevelt.

496
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,500
All's I'm saying is, it's not about color.

497
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,300
So what's your next move, Tommy?

498
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,800
<i>The Sun</i> says an Anderson
State Senate seat is up for grabs.

499
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,200
Fuck that, you could go after
Ruppersberger in the second.

500
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,100
He's only got one term.

501
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,900
I'm gonna run for mayor.

502
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
That's good. Mayor Tommy.

503
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,700
Is she in the right joint?

504
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,600
She lets me sit next to her,
I buy her a <i>drink...</i>

505
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,400
- We each give you $10.
- $20 if you fuck her.

506
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,300
Oh, please, Ash.
Show just a little more class.

507
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,000
Besides, I already had my day in the sun.

508
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Bullshit, Tommy. Once a gash-hound...

509
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,400
The bet is the bet. You said I lost a step.
I'm gonna prove I never did.

510
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
- You in, Pete?
- I'll pass.

511
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,900
Can I have two Glenlivets?

512
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
How you doing?

513
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,300
- The son of a bitch did it.
- He did you.

514
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,000
That's Theresa D'Agostino. Mario D's kid?

515
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, she grew up all right.
She's down in DC now...

516
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,800
with the national party. A campaign fixer.

517
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,900
No shit.

518
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,400
Tommy's known her ever since law school.

519
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Just hear me out, okay? One drink.

520
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,900
Go ahead. You're paying for it.

521
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,800
- Actually, they are.
- You made a bet.

522
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,400
Don't tell me we have to kiss or something.
Not gonna happen.

523
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
This isn't about ankle straps
in a two-and-a-half star hotel, is it?

524
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,600
Because the alumni dinner ended an hour
ago and I could be back in DC right now...

525
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,500
That's the old me, Terri.

526
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,300
Everything I got now, my wife, my kids...

527
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,400
I would not risk losing them. No way.

528
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,000
Seeing you with your old gang
made me think bad thoughts.

529
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
Your friends cheapen you, Tommy.

530
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,500
You're just pissed off that they
didn't recognize you when you walked in.

531
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,100
And why would they?

532
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,900
I mean, you're a Washingtonian now.

533
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,100
That's Pete Sinopoli over there, isn't it?

534
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
- I hear he's back to practicing law.
- Yeah.

535
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,600
He just didn't have it, did he?

536
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,300
I have it, Terri.

537
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,900
I'm gonna make a run for mayor.

538
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,900
And you're gonna run my campaign.

539
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,300
Give me one good reason why not to.

540
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,400
I could give you 10,
but here's the good one.

541
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,200
You're the wrong color.
You're not electable here.

542
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,200
- And I never play the long shot.
- You like to win.

543
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't like to lose. It's not the same thing.

544
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,000
Where's the fun in it
if you know you're gonna win?

545
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,000
I mean, you handled that Democrat
in East LA, what was his name...

546
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,400
- Garcia...
- Valdez.

547
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,900
Valdez. How hard was that?

548
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,800
I need someone like you on my side.

549
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,400
I need you.

550
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,100
How big a win bonus?

551
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,800
Get a white mayor elected in Baltimore,
honey, you name your price.

552
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,400
One drink was the deal.

553
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,400
Go home, sleep it off.

554
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,600
You'll wake up and realize
you're making a mistake.

555
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,700
I can do this.

556
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Question is, are you gonna come with me?

557
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,200
B and B.

558
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,600
<i>Hello?</i>

559
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,900
Yo, how we not gonna throw
a few hot ones at the motherfuckers?

560
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,200
One ass-whupping
and we back off like some bitches.

561
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,600
Then we on this off-brand-ass strip
right here.

562
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,800
Ain't even enough trade for Poot
and his crew. This some bullshit, man!

563
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,400
Look, man, Stringer gonna fix it, man,
you'll see.

564
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,800
Which one of y'all is Slim Charles?

565
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,600
- Who asking?
- That'd be Cutty.

566
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,300
Your boy gave me a number,
said to ring you up...

567
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,600
when I was ready to put in some work.
But no answer.

568
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,700
Took your time calling back, right?

569
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,200
The numbers don't play
after a few days, man.

570
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,500
- We change them up.
- Yeah, ain't you know nothing?

571
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,800
Respect, dawg, respect.
Y'all don't know who y'all talking to, man.

572
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,600
- You still ain't say your business, man.
- I'm trying to get put on.

573
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,700
- What you got in mind?
- Whatever you got that pays.

574
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,900
Yo, Poot. Come here, man.

575
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,400
Hey, look, man, call Shamrock, man...

576
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,400
and tell him
soldier's finally came into the camp.

577
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,800
You a soldier, huh?

578
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,400
Chill, Bodie, man, chill, man.

579
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,600
- Oh, Bodie Broadus?
- Yeah, that's right.

580
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,200
Shit, I remember your little ass
when you was still in diapers.

581
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,000
I used to spar
with your older brother, James.

582
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
That boy had a killer left.

583
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,900
Yeah, when he ain't drop it.

584
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,800
Yo, he still out here?

585
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,900
James been dead.

586
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,000
Fuck's up with that cheese box?

587
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,400
What, you ain't never
ridden no school bus before?

588
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,900
I'm saying, what they doing
with the niggas on that corner?

589
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,100
Look, dawg, first thing we gonna need
to do is get you some chrome.

590
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,700
Look, come on, man.

591
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,800
What's wrong
with my fucking phone? Shit.

592
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,500
Yo, TJ,
you got one with some minutes left?

593
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,000
Which is not to say
that you couldn't do some multi-use...

594
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,900
with the Howard Street properties, too.

595
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,900
- Residential-commercial could work.
- On Howard Street?

596
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,700
The whole point of the block grant is to...

597
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
bring the West Side back
to make it high-end.

598
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,400
The Hippodrome project
was just the start, see?

599
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,100
But residential?

600
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,400
With the stadium
and the theater back on line...

601
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,000
that whole area is like Inner Harbor East
10 years ago.

602
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,700
And the thing is, you're on the ground floor
with what you're holding.

603
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,500
- Yes, you are, String.
- So we're still talking more return...

604
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,300
than just flipping the properties
for the condemnation money.

605
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,600
Way more.

606
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,900
Excuse me.

607
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,300
Yo. No. Not right now.

608
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,300
A half-hour.

609
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,100
No, so go ahead and fill it up.
You got the order number, right?

610
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,400
- Man, move your ass.
- Man, this some bullshit.

611
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,300
My mom's gonna be worried and shit.
Y'all kidnapping niggas.

612
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm Major Colvin.

613
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,700
My name is Major Colvin.

614
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,300
- Major what?
- Major these, motherfucker.

615
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,600
And we had to bring you down here
this afternoon...

616
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,800
because you've not been complying
with our directives.

617
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,100
Say what?

618
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,900
You haven't been doing
what we asked you to do.

619
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yo.

620
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,600
When I'm done.

621
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,100
I gotta pee now.

622
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,000
He ain't playing.
Smell like he already pissed in his drawers.

623
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,200
All right, go ahead.

624
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,900
Yo, I gotta go, too.

625
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,600
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.

626
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,500
You just let him go,
how you gonna discriminate?

627
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,900
Yo, faggy, why you touch my butt?

628
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,100
That's enough!

629
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,800
The fun is over.

630
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,700
Tyrell, why weren't you in school today?

631
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,000
My stomach hurt.
I couldn't make it out the bathroom.

632
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,500
Stand up when I talk to you, young man.

633
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
I know your mother, Tyrell.

634
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,200
She didn't raise any clowns, now, did she?

635
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,600
No, ma'am.

636
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,000
It's yours, Major.

637
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,700
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we brought you down here because...

638
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,400
you're here to learn about the new way...

639
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,200
The new way that we're going
to do things on the corners.

640
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,100
- That's downtown.
- Yeah.

641
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,500
- Well, that makes no sense.
- All four.

642
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,400
Go ahead, rip me a new asshole.
Ask me where I've been for two days.

643
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,100
Tell us, hotshot.

644
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,200
College registrar gives up
Stringer's course schedule.

645
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,500
I tail him to where he's laying his head.
Downtown high-rise.

646
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,300
Name's on the lease, too.
No attempt to hide it.

647
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,400
I get up early next morning, follow him
from his door to a lunch meeting...

648
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,300
with the state senator.

649
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,300
Same one with the bagman
we bounced the last time around.

650
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,500
Couple of white guys at the table, too,
nobody I read.

651
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
And all the while,
Stringer's using his cell phone...

652
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,900
making calls in front of these suits
like it ain't no thing.

653
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,400
Shit, I even rang it up myself.

654
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,700
Got his number from an admissions form.

655
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,400
The number wouldn't be 844-7393?

656
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,700
I had Prez pull
the B and B property assessments...

657
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,400
and land transfers from Circuit Court.

658
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,000
Some of the paperwork
asked for a contact number.

659
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,800
So I'm not surprised
our boy's using his cell phone so freely.

660
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Those, right there, are the incoming
and outgoing numbers on his phone.

661
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,200
And damn near all of them
are downtown exchanges.

662
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,300
Architectural firms, city licensing...

663
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,000
attorneys, zoning offices.

664
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,700
Even campus exchanges over at BCCC.

665
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,100
- You saying he's right?
- I'm saying the phone is right.

666
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,000
Account information confirms
he's had that number listed...

667
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,900
for quite a while.

668
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,400
Nice work.

669
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,800
Maybe the cell phone is clean
because he's keeping it.

670
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,700
If it was dirty, it'd probably be a burner.

671
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,300
Disposables.

672
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,800
The latest in yo-tech.

673
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,100
They make a couple of calls with a burner,
throw it away.

674
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,900
Go on to the next phone, do the same.

675
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
There's more of those things laying around
the streets of West Baltimore...

676
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,100
than empty vials.

677
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,800
Well, how the fuck you supposed
to get a wire up on that?

678
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,700
Yeah, well,
first it was payphone and pagers.

679
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,500
Then it was cell phones
and face-to-face meets. Now this.

680
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,600
The motherfuckers do learn.

681
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,600
Every time we come at them,
they learn and adjust.

682
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,600
So...

683
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,600
Stringer's out of reach.

684
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
You know, a couple of years ago...

685
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,100
when they were buying up
all that downtown real estate...

686
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,600
I thought they were buying it to flip it...

687
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,000
and get the cash
when the federal payout money lands...

688
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,800
and the properties are condemned.

689
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,000
Bell and Barksdale haven't sold any of it.
They're buying more, in fact...

690
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,200
and applying for building permits.

691
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,100
Seems that
Stringer Bell is worse than a drug dealer.

692
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,700
He's a developer.

693
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,800
Jesus, fuck, he's really legit?

694
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,700
Well, you real police.

695
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,800
Now that he's out in the open,
why don't you pull him up and ask him?

696
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,500
You need a few days, I'll stall Daniels.
But after that...

697
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,300
you come home with a case we can use...

698
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,800
or you swallow your goddamn pride
and rejoin this unit.

699
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,100
How you doing, Donette?

700
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,500
"I'm fine, String. I missed you, baby."

701
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,300
Look, I'm sorry for not returning them calls.

702
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,900
"Sorry" don't keep my bed warm at night.

703
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,800
Shorty, I been running.

704
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,700
Ain't like I'm trying to shut you out.
I just got business to attend to, you know?

705
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,400
Do you know how it feels
to be alone out here?

706
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,700
Police coming to my door,
and I got no one to stand beside me.

707
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,700
You say the detective left you a card?

708
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,400
Man say D'Angelo wasn't no suicide.

709
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,900
Something about the way
the marks was on his neck.

710
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,800
He said D could have been murdered
and shit.

711
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,100
Sit down.

712
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,900
Now listen to me.

713
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,200
Everyone in them walls know who Avon is.

714
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,600
Ain't nobody gonna do his nephew.

715
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,900
All right?

716
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,800
Now, as far as you and me go...

717
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,900
I did you wrong
by keeping you at arm's length...

718
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,700
but it ain't gonna be like that no more.

719
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,700
Oh, yeah.

720
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,100
God made that.

721
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,200
Couldn't be no accident.

722
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,400
So why am I on your tab tonight?
Tell the truth.

723
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,300
I dare that to walk by me again.
She better not.

724
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,200
Why you buying, Bunk?

725
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,000
I got two dead...

726
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,700
in what feels like a drug rip up in Pimlico.

727
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,100
And the young 'uns out on the scene,
they seem to know this Omar fella by sight.

728
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,100
I need Omar, Jimmy.

729
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,500
Again? Jesus, Bunk.

730
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,800
Yeah.

731
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,600
Fuck it, then.

732
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,900
Number three?

733
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,300
No, that worked for you last time.
The blonde at the juke.

734
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,600
Oh, I really liked her.

735
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,000
Everybody likes everybody
when they're kissing.

736
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,600
But no, my friend down there...

737
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,700
she's a number two, I think.

738
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,500
And when it comes up, my mother passed.
A week ago.

739
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,700
And I'm having a little trouble
getting over it.

740
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,400
That's why I'm feeling so blue tonight.

741
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,400
- Okay, your mom's dead and you're sad.
- Yeah.

742
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,100
You my boy.

743
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,800
The same way.

744
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,300
My mom died about a week ago, <i>and...</i>

745
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,500
- Yo.
- What's up, boss?

746
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,900
You got the phone receipts
from the Virginia run?

747
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,200
All right.

748
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,400
From now on, I want you to deal with these.

749
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,600
All right.

750
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,700
If my man Bernard doing it like we said
and making them runs...

751
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,900
then I don't wanna have to deal with this
no more.

752
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,800
For sure.

753
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,800
- And if Donette call me...
- I know.

754
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,600
- Tell that bitch you busy.
- No.

755
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,400
I'm gonna take the call.

756
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,900
Ronnie?

757
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,400
Ronnie, Ronnie!

758
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,100
Rhonda!

759
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
He was strongly suspected
to have ordered or caused the deaths...

760
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,700
- of over a dozen individuals.
- Suspected.

761
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,600
It's rumor and innuendo.

762
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,800
There isn't one new allegation
in this letter that wasn't already raised...

763
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,700
by the Assistant State's Attorney
at the time of the trial.

764
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,800
And given my client's superlative record
during his incarceration...

765
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,100
and given his notable role in identifying
the source of the overdose deaths...

766
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,300
at this facility last year...

767
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,300
I respectfully ask
that you honor our existing agreement...

768
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,700
- and approve Mr. Barksdale's early release.
- That's bullshit!

769
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,900
Hold your comments, Trooper.

770
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,900
We made a commitment, Counselor.

771
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,900
And given what this institution
was dealing with a year ago...

772
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,800
this is the lesser evil.

773
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,200
Rockefeller! Rockefellers on the spot!

774
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,100
Man, that's him right there.
In that G35, man.

775
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,900
- Boy in the retro?
- That shit is tight.

776
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,100
$430, it better be.

777
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,300
Hell, yeah. I'm gonna get me
one of those motherfuckers.

778
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,700
You must be going to get
that Muggsy Bogues, then.

779
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,200
Your Mini-Me ass gonna be swimming
in that Unseld.

780
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,100
As usual, man,
y'all fools are missing my point.

781
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,600
That boy came up short on that money
last week...

782
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,700
and y'all see how he out here grinding.

783
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,300
So where that money at?

784
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,200
You need to look beyond
what he driving or wearing on his back.

785
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,200
That boy got a girlfriend?

786
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,400
He run with this little freak
up at the high school.

787
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,700
She wearing ice?

788
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,300
She wearing a onion,
that's about all I can remember.

789
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,400
Hell, yeah.

790
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,200
Yo, check out the girl.

791
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,900
High school girl with platinum around
her neck, only one place it came from.

792
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,400
Give my man his thing.

793
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,300
SIG Sauer. That ain't no Lorcin, dawg.

794
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,800
I'm used to revolvers, man.
.38 don't jam.

795
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,000
Don't hold 15, neither.

796
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,400
Game done changed.

797
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,300
Game the same. Just got more fierce.

798
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,400
- I'm not big on vacations.
- Yeah, who has time?

799
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,300
What about taking the boys down
to Ocean City for a weekend or something?

800
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,300
You ever been down the ocean?

801
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,800
Listen.

802
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,200
It wasn't like
I was waiting for an opening with Rhonda.

803
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,200
It just happened.

804
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,900
I should have told you sooner.

805
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,200
I need to know this isn't going
to be a thing between you and me.

806
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,400
No, I wish you both all the best.

807
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,500
Was I very loud last night?

808
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,100
Thanks for making this easy on me.

809
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,100
You coming?

810
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,900
No, I think I'll stay here a while, nurse this.

811
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,100
Then I'll shove off.

812
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,200
One more, and put a beer next to it.

813
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,300
Nigga, what's up? You good?

814
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,100
Shit is on.

815
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,800
This what I'm talking about.

816
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,600
Drink that shit.

817
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,700
I'm surprised Avon
be letting y'all get your heads up.

818
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,500
Sometimes you got to.

819
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,900
Kiss the sky, nigga.

820
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,200
- Ready to go?
- Yeah. Are you all right to drive?

821
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,900
I thought you
were the designated driver tonight.

822
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,700
No, I'm good, really. I'm good to go.

823
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,300
Good night.

824
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,400
Bitch with one leg named Aaliyah.

825
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,100
What kind of shit is that?

826
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,100
Oh, shit.

827
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,800
- You do still like females, don't you?
- Shit.

828
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,200
He home now.
