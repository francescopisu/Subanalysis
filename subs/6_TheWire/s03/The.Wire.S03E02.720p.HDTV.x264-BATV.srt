1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,300
Yeah, so we out on Carlton.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,000
This old white motherfucker
and his wife roll up.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,900
He's like, "Young man, you know
where the Poe House is?"

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm like, "Unc, you kidding?
Look around, take your pick."

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,000
So, the old man, he's like...

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,900
"The Poe House.
The Edward Allan Poe House."

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,000
Shit, you back already?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,400
First of the month, yo.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm like,
"I don't know no Edward Allan Poe."

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,700
The man look at me all sad and shit,
like I let him down.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,600
- I know you know you ain't coming in here.
- What?

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,500
Shorty, I don't know you.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,200
You know Miss Elaine
in the back room, right?

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,900
This her brother, Earl, from the V.A.
Hospital. He's supposed to stay with her.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,300
Can you help me inside? I'm Chantal.

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,900
So, what's good?

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,900
Thank you, young man.

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,200
Oh, shit.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,100
Oh, shit.

20
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,300
Now, now, now.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,800
Hey, yo, Omar.

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,800
Yo, all due respect, but this right here...

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,300
it's a Barksdale joint, man.

24
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,500
Do tell.

25
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,100
You think this boy woke up
yesterday morning...

26
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,000
sat on the edge of his bed and said,
"Today's my day to die"?

27
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,800
You don't think this can happen to you?

28
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,800
Doc, hold that up.

29
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,900
Look at what that bullet did to his heart.

30
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,700
That's his heart.

31
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,900
- What was that, Scared Straight?
- More like bored stiff.

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,100
What's the deal with this?

33
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,500
I go down to MCI Jessup, hoping
to pull up a fellow with some years on him.

34
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,200
See if he's ready to share his feelings.

35
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,000
Turns out "Barksdale, D'Angelo"
got himself rung up as a suicide.

36
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,700
- D.O.D. Of 7l21l03.
- Who worked it?

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
State Police.

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
You want me to pull the postmortem
on this?

39
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,300
Yeah, he's kind of a made guy down there.

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,700
I just want to make sure
nobody did the suicide to him.

41
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,800
It ain't nothing but dust and bricks
over there now.

42
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,100
Shit, all the battling we did
to take them Towers, man.

43
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,400
You're trying to tell me
we back on the street with the rest of them?

44
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,900
Any way beatin'.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,900
Now that the Towers is gone,
everybody know how it got to go down.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,300
I say we send our people over there early.
Corner chiefs, like, "Yo, we here now...

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,200
"you know what I mean,
but we bringing something to the table."

48
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,600
Lay it out like it's their lucky day.
No flexing, no threats.

49
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,800
Just be like, "This a good thing."

50
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,700
Yeah, but you know,
we gonna need good corners...

51
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,100
that's what we're gonna need.
Close to downtown.

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,900
Get the workaday trade.

53
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,300
- Talking about, like, Fremont.
- Fayette.

54
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,300
Yeah, make us like $40,000,
$50,000 a day, easy.

55
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Yeah, I'm on it.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,900
And, you know,
everybody watching us on this, man.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,100
They wanna see if we're gonna fuck this up
now that the Towers are down.

58
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,100
You know what I'm saying?
They measuring us up.

59
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,500
They wanna see
if we're gonna be weak or real.

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,300
If a fool step to us, man,
we gonna do what we got to do.

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,700
But it's them bodies that got you in here.

62
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,500
If we can do this without the bodies,
we should.

63
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
You know what I mean?
Especially now we light on muscle.

64
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,100
Speaking of muscle, man,
you hear from that man I sent you?

65
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, Cutty from the cut.
Yeah, he rang, we took care of him.

66
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,200
Good, good.

67
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,200
- How you fixed for the hearing?
- It's all good, man.

68
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Shit.

69
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,700
Levy got everything straightened up
tight for me, man.

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
I'll be home before it get cold.

71
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Terrace came down.

72
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,300
So?

73
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,400
So, we're coming in.

74
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,000
To my corners? I don't think so.

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Hey, hold on now.
This is gonna be good for you, too.

76
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,500
Yeah? Now, how you figure that?

77
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Yo, what you paying now, $37,000, $38,000?

78
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,100
Yo, we can go $31,000, $32,000 shots, man.

79
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,500
The shit's so John Blaze,
you can step on it seven, eight times...

80
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,500
and still take the cake.

81
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,000
Spider bags. Got those spider bags.

82
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,600
Damn.

83
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,400
Yo, you all seen Marlo?

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,400
Y'all ain't seen him?

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
You all know him?

86
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,400
Marlo?

87
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,900
Yeah, yeah, he was here.

88
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,700
Now he ain't.

89
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,300
Get those spider bags!

90
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,700
Spider bags!

91
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,200
Jesus, Tommy. I'd like to shit.

92
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,000
When I looked up,
saw you on the news, giving it to Erv.

93
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,400
- You fucker, you're up to something.
- I'm up to nothing, I'm telling you.

94
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,900
I can help him, he can help me.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,900
A little itch here, a little scratch there.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,500
This is a win-win for you, ain't it?

97
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,700
He won't play? You beat the shit out of him
because crime is up.

98
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Press loves it and you score.

99
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,600
Flip side is that if he caves...

100
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,100
you get yourself a snitch
in the Mayor's inner circle.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,800
So, what's my role in your little drama?

102
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,400
I thought you might broker a meeting.

103
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,800
You know...

104
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,900
help your fearless leader see the light
about his new friend on the Council.

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,100
And I should tell him, what?

106
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,800
Make nice
or invest heavily in petroleum jelly?

107
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,800
Hey, his ass, his choice.

108
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,900
- You didn't talk to him?
- I couldn't find the motherfucker.

109
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,700
Man, we just walk up, we gonna bump.

110
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
There. Middle of the block, right there.

111
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Yo, where that whistle at?

112
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,400
Hold on.

113
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,300
Wait for Marlo.

114
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,200
Yo, Cheese. Where you been at, man?

115
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,300
Nigger, that ain't nothing but bait.

116
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,900
Soap your bitch.

117
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,900
Who's my dawg? You my dawg?

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,200
Who's my dawg? Who's my baby?

119
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,900
- You make Daddy some money, all right?
- Yeah.

120
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
25 large on Dawg!

121
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,000
Cheese!

122
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,600
Yeah.

123
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,900
Anybody I want?

124
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,000
Anybody.

125
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
I want more than one.
I want the Olsen twins.

126
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
You got them.

127
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,700
Slaves.

128
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,300
All they live for is to get you off.

129
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,600
But, so now, who you gonna do for them?

130
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,200
One guy, one act, one time.

131
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,000
Right. And the minute I name a guy,
you're gonna be like...

132
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,400
"I knew you were a cocksucker
from the first time I laid eyes on you.

133
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,200
"Steve McQueen, huh? That's your fantasy?

134
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,800
"You fucking closet-case motherfucker."

135
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,200
- Steve McQueen?
- Fuck you. It's a set-up.

136
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,900
Both Olsen twins.

137
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,500
Ashley.

138
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,000
- Kate.
- Mary-Kate.

139
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,900
And, yeah, I admire their body of work.

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,500
They're yours.

141
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
All you got to do is name a guy.

142
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,400
- I'm not catching, I'm pitching.
- No problem.

143
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
Corner men out of the pit.

144
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,400
Release your dogs.

145
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,200
Yeah! I got that!

146
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,700
Break your dogs!

147
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,200
Bait.

148
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, shit, there it is.

149
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,500
Can't it just be like
this unbearable-looking woman?

150
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,400
You know, like that old tune from
<i>The Golden Girls?</i>

151
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,800
The short one with the Coke-bottle glasses.

152
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,300
A guy.

153
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,400
- Hey, yo.
- Huh?

154
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,400
Let me ask you a question.

155
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,900
Where do you guys get those hats
with the bills over the ears like that?

156
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,100
I go into all the city stores
and the only ones I can find...

157
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,100
are the ones with the bills in the front.

158
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,700
No, it's the same.
Just turn it sideways on your head.

159
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,200
Thanks. Thank you.

160
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,900
That's a knucklehead from the low-rises,
right there.

161
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The Terrace is spreading out.

162
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,600
Got to go somewheres, I guess.

163
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,500
Don't think you all needed to do that.

164
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,900
He turned cur on me, man.

165
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,100
No.

166
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,800
I think you got played.

167
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,700
So, I'm guessing from the Terrace...

168
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,300
them being all cute about the property line.

169
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
I just wanted to wait and see
what you wanted us to do about it.

170
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,500
So, what you want us to do?

171
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,800
Get back to work.

172
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,900
All right.

173
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Your boy really jammed me, that little prick.

174
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
It was all over the news.

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,100
You did not look
particularly commissioner-like.

176
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,400
The Mayor told me the same thing.

177
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
You can't have that shit every week.

178
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,100
Not if you want His Honor to give you
the job permanent.

179
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,400
Tommy's a good kid, usually.
An ass pain when he wants something.

180
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,200
- But mostly good people.
- I don't give a shit what he is.

181
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,200
Well, you can't have him
pounding on you, Erv.

182
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,400
Throw him a bone.

183
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He'll take care of you.

184
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,800
All right.

185
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,200
But I draw the line
at going behind the Mayor for this guy.

186
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,400
You can't sit where I'm sitting
and backdoor the fucking Mayor.

187
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Sorry I'm late, guys.

188
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,600
The kid had a Little League game.
It started late.

189
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Well, I'll leave you boys to it.

190
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,700
And what I have brought together,
let no man tear asunder.

191
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,200
- He win?
- Who?

192
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,100
Your kid, his team.

193
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,100
Shit, who keeps score?

194
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,800
I mean, yes. It's a little hectic, but
everybody stepping off at the right time.

195
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,700
These corner boys we dealing with...

196
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,300
I don't think they even listen
to their own people.

197
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to peoples.

198
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,000
- Where you at?
- Marlo?

199
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
I can't find him.

200
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,400
And you told us not to start nothing.
So I set up in the middle of the block.

201
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,700
You know, even that got hard stares.
I <i>don't...</i>

202
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,000
It ain't gonna hold, I don't think.

203
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,400
Now, this Marlo...

204
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,100
how hard you looking for him?

205
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Like, why ain't you out there
looking for this motherfucker right now?

206
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,300
'Cause you called this meeting here.

207
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,300
Shut the door.

208
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,100
- What's your good news, man?
- Omar right inside the stash.

209
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,300
Couple ounces of raw, already vialed, 600.

210
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,900
Cocksuckers even took my watch.

211
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,900
Second stash this month they done got to.

212
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,600
I mean, he called you by name, String.

213
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,900
I mean, all due respect...

214
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,100
but dude, like, unless you step to him,
it's gonna be like this.

215
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,900
All right, man.
Double the muscle on every stash we got.

216
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,400
And if the man coming,
make ready for the man.

217
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,800
It's not personal.

218
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,900
I swear to God,
it is never personal with me.

219
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,900
Truth is, I've been a councilman
for almost three years now.

220
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,700
And that's a long fucking time
to be ignored.

221
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
And this being Baltimore...

222
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
a white boy doesn't stand much chance
running citywide.

223
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,400
Maybe the legislature,
if the right seat opens up.

224
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,000
But until then,
I'm stuck in a job with no power...

225
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
except getting potholes filled.

226
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
All due respect, Councilman...

227
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,300
you're fucking with me because,
what, you're bored?

228
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
A little, yeah.

229
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,300
And what the fuck?
I mean, when it comes to the crime thing...

230
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
this city can use
all the fucking help it can get.

231
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,000
- Lf you're looking for dirt, there isn't any.
- There's always fucking dirt.

232
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,600
But right now, I'm just looking to know
how we can do better.

233
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,700
And you give me that much...

234
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
and I can try and get you
what you need privately.

235
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
No hearings, no press, no grandstanding.

236
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,400
And if I don't play ball...

237
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,800
you're gonna have my ass every time
I'm in front of your committee, right?

238
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,700
- One thing comes to mind.
- Shoot.

239
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,100
I can't get my marked units back
from Dickman Street to save my life.

240
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,000
Cars that are shopped for service
don't come back for weeks.

241
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,900
You tell the Mayor?

242
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,000
- Not that you heard it from me.
- Of course not.

243
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,200
- How much these?
- $10,000 a set.

244
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,800
A nigga show that on a ride,
he hanging a sign on himself.

245
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,400
"Lock my ass up."

246
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,300
No shit.

247
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,800
So how you gonna play it?

248
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,500
If they from the Terrace, that's Avon.

249
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,100
- I know.
- And Avon, he coming home, too.

250
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,200
Well, if you inclined to work something out,
that's one thing.

251
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,600
If not, Avon can seriously handle up.

252
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
I know.

253
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,500
So if you want to hold on to what's yours,
you best be ready.

254
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,200
You remember that Barksdale kid?
The one who took all the weight?

255
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,800
You remember that Barksdale kid?
The one who took all the weight?

256
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,300
Tied his neck to a doorknob
in the prison library and sat his ass down.

257
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't know.

258
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,600
Men of color usually don't do themselves.

259
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,300
I mean, take me, for instance.

260
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,600
Yeah, I mean,
you got all the reason in the world.

261
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,100
And yet here I am, still standing.

262
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,100
Give or take.

263
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,500
- You looked at the scene photos?
- No, there ain't none.

264
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,200
State Police dogged it.

265
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,500
My turn, Bunk.

266
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,000
Come on. Go with number three.

267
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,500
You gonna play my song, darling?

268
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
- You play the right song...
- Hey, Bunk.

269
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,700
...I can make you hit the high notes, baby.
- Hey, Bunk.

270
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,000
- Hey, look, I saw her first, Jimmy.
- Come on, man.

271
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,200
Come on, baby.
I got a place right here in Camden.

272
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,400
Come on, be a gentleman, come on.

273
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,100
- I'm being a gentleman, man.
- I'm really not interested, okay?

274
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,800
- Come on, let's go.
- It's all pink, baby.

275
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,300
I'm really sorry, he's had
a bit too much to drink, you know?

276
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,900
It's okay. Thank you. Thanks.

277
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,900
- You all right?
- Yeah.

278
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,100
- You get yourself home?
- Yeah.

279
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,200
Knock it out.

280
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,600
- No, the baddest nigga of all time?
- Who?

281
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,800
This nigga from New York,
from the olden days, Bumpy something.

282
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,100
- Bumpy?
- Yo.

283
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,300
He'd do shit like run up
to a police station by hisself.

284
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
- No.
- You know what I'm saying, shit like that.

285
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,100
Cops be like hiding, like,
"Yo, Bumpy, we sorry, man, we sorry."

286
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,500
"Please go away. Please, please."

287
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,800
Woof.

288
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,300
And obtain gainful employment and refrain
from associating with known criminals...

289
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,200
and keep this office informed
of your residence...

290
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,100
and any change in that residence.

291
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,800
So I gather you're not working
at this particular time.

292
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,900
They still doing morning shape-ups
down at the market?

293
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,100
I don't know and I don't care.
Just get a job, any job.

294
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,000
- "Woof"?
- "Woof," like a dog.

295
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,900
- Oh shit, it was <i>like...</i>
- It was Cheese's boy, Tri.

296
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,600
So you gonna hit back or what?

297
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,400
- You got a better shot of the ligature?
- Yeah. Inside.

298
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,000
What'd he do, hang himself twice?

299
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,700
He could have been leaning
straight forward until he blacked out...

300
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,900
then slid down,
which would give you the vertical.

301
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,200
Or how about I come up at him
from behind <i>and...</i>

302
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,100
And then set him down,
make it look like, "Goodbye cruel world."

303
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,300
- What do the scene shots show?
- There were none taken.

304
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,800
The troopers really fucked the pooch
on this one.

305
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
All I have is some half-assed report.

306
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Reads like the investigator
went off his Ritalin.

307
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,400
- What's a "large ecchy"...
- Large ecchymotic area, mid-back.

308
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,300
Bruising.

309
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
What, mid-back as <i>in...</i>

310
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,100
Or he banged himself a few days earlier
in the shower. But yeah, maybe.

311
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,800
Nothing like a definite maybe.

312
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,400
<i>Tri finally got that M. Done it on foot, too.</i>

313
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,400
Caroline?

314
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,600
<i>Nigger lying in chalk, but my boy, Tri,</i>
<i>got that dapple all up his sleeve.</i>

315
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,600
<i>Looks like polka dots. But that's just</i>
<i>something you gotta know from experience.</i>

316
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,000
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

317
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,900
<i>I even had to school him on the whistle,</i>
<i>still walking around with it.</i>

318
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,500
<i>"Yo, Tri, stash that shit at Neesey's.</i>
<i>What's wrong with you?"</i>

319
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,000
<i>You know them niggers</i>
<i>is gonna get mad busy over this.</i>

320
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,700
<i>- So we getting busy, too.</i>
<i>- So what time you coming over?</i>

321
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,000
<i>Damn, bitch, ain't you even listening?</i>

322
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,700
<i>You still there?</i>

323
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,700
Shakedown!

324
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,500
Time-out.

325
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,300
- Do that again.
- Do what again?

326
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Do that thing with your hand.
Do it in my face.

327
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,800
What the fuck you talking...

328
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,000
Whoa, man.

329
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,100
Got a lot of room in here!

330
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,000
The law think they can do
what the fuck they want.

331
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,600
Yo, I ain't do nothing.

332
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,000
Fuck the police!

333
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,200
- No, man, we was just hanging.
- Just slinging.

334
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,800
How'd you work it out
with the corner crews...

335
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,000
all you guys from the Terrace
coming in like this?

336
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,000
- I don't know what you talking about.
- Well, you best watch your ass.

337
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,300
'Cause the slingers out here,
they're like the crack babies' babies.

338
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,600
Man, every year everybody's like...

339
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,600
"Yeah, these kids out here,
they're a new breed.

340
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,000
"I ain't never seen nothing like this before.
This the end of the world now."

341
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,200
Look around you, fuckhead. This seem like
the dawn of a new day to you?

342
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,900
Can I go now?
Or you want to slap me up some more first?

343
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
How about a hand job?

345
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,000
My man, you don't even get
Weezy Jefferson for a hand job.

346
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Come on.

347
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,800
- Dozerman.
- Wanna call it a day?

348
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,400
<i>They came back on us this time.</i>
<i>Daz and them. They got Peanut.</i>

349
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,300
<i>- Oh, shit, is Peanut dead?</i>
<i>- No, he's okay.</i>

350
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,200
<i>His brains are all over the sidewalk.</i>
<i>But he's okay.</i>

351
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,700
<i>What the hell do you think?</i>

352
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,400
<i>Shit, I got to call Tony. I'll get back at you.</i>

353
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,800
<i>All right.</i>

354
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,100
- Well, that's two we heard about.
- What the hell's going on?

355
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,600
Drug war maybe?

356
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,700
<i>- What's up?</i>
<i>- Nothing good, man.</i>

357
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,000
<i>I ain't sleep since I capped his ass.</i>

358
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,500
<i>Close my eyes, see him laying there</i>
<i>all bloody and shit.</i>

359
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,700
<i>Cheese, man, you did what you had to do.</i>

360
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,800
<i>What I thought I had to do.</i>

361
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,000
That's Cheese?

362
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,000
<i>He was my dawg, yo.</i>
<i>Had much love for me, even then.</i>

363
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,100
<i>I ain't never gonna find another dog</i>
<i>like that.</i>

364
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,800
<i>- Well, they paying for it now.</i>
<i>- Mos def.</i>

365
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,800
For months, these assholes
show perfect phone discipline.

366
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,200
Now, they're talking up murders?

367
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,300
Cheese is only a level below
Proposition Joe.

368
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,300
All of a sudden, this case has legs.

369
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,200
<i>- Homicide.</i>
- This is Freamon, Major Case.

370
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,900
- Who's the O.I.C. Tonight?
<i>- Hold on for Norris.</i>

371
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,200
<i>Yo, T. T man.</i>

372
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,500
<i>I'm shot! I'm shot!</i>

373
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,700
<i>Oh, shit. Shit!</i>

374
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,400
<i>They coming back!</i>

375
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,800
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

376
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,500
<i>Who this?</i>

377
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,100
Damn.

378
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,800
<i>Detective Norris.</i>

379
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,400
Ed, this is Lester.

380
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,300
<i>I hear you're catching bodies</i>
<i>on the east side.</i>

381
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,900
You hear it?
Like what, "probable cause" hear it?

382
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,300
Like, "I got something concrete" hear it?
Or just, "gas up my head" hear it?

383
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,400
<i>Like, "I got all the fucking time in the world</i>
<i>to jaw with you" hear it?</i>

384
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,800
- How many bodies you got, Eddie?
- "How many you got, Eddie?"

385
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,200
Asshole.

386
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,000
- You want me to go up to Homicide?
- No, I got it, I got it.

387
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,500
You're early man on tomorrow.
So go home. See your kid.

388
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,300
I'm telling you,
this kid Berman's a fucking wizard.

389
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,100
I mean, check it out, right?

390
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,400
Six reported auto thefts,
two of which state:

391
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,600
"Not impossible car was borrowed."

392
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,400
Making four auto thefts,
with two unfounded.

393
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,100
And the prizewinner?
Four armed robberies...

394
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,300
two of which complainants state,
"Too dark to I.D. Weapon.

395
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,500
"Not impossible knife wasn't a comb."

396
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,700
- He might have groomed them to death.
- Yeah.

397
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,500
Wine into water.

398
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,800
There he is.

399
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,800
- Abbadabba Berman.
- The Dr. Atkins of crime.

400
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,200
Just doing what I'm told.

401
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,400
- God, what a beautiful film.
- I couldn't understand a word.

402
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
Honey, you gotta read the subtitles.

403
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,600
Oh, shit.

404
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Does y'all go to the movies?

405
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,100
And you must be the lovely Mrs. Herc.
How'd you like your movie?

406
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,300
Okay.

407
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,700
Herc and Carver here,
they try to snatch us up every day...

408
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,900
like, "Where the shit? Who got the shit?"

409
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,600
But they never get nothing.

410
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,900
So y'all go to the movies.

411
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,100
Damn.

412
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,100
All right, then. See you tomorrow.

413
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,900
Everything okay?

414
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,300
On two.

415
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,300
Pick up, pick up.

416
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,600
- Ed, you got to help me.
- I can't, not now.

417
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,300
<i>And a bucket full of worms.</i>

418
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,000
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

419
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
So.

420
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,300
So.

421
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,600
Everything good?

422
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,500
How's that fontanette?

423
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,000
Fontanelle.

424
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,100
Is he closing up?

425
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,300
He won't close for a while.

426
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,700
Good.

427
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,600
- Good?
<i>- I can't stand it anymore!</i>

428
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,400
<i>Come on, sweetheart,</i>
<i>just a few more seconds.</i>

429
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,800
Well, I'm just saying.

430
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,000
<i>I ain't sleep since I capped his ass.</i>

431
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,400
<i>Close my eyes, see him laying there</i>
<i>all bloody and shit.</i>

432
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,500
- Cheese.
- Cheese on a platter.

433
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,100
He never talks like that.

434
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,900
Now, why would...

435
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,100
Because all good things come
to those who wait.

436
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,100
- Does McNulty know?
- I'll raise his ass.

437
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,600
We'll keep our ears to the wire,
keep gathering string, no problem.

438
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,200
But if bodies keep falling
in the Eastern District...

439
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,000
we might have to give up this wiretap.

440
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,200
Now you coming around?

441
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,300
Been more than a damn year.

442
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,100
Looks just like his dad, huh?

443
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,200
Let me ask you.

444
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,400
When you heard D was a suicide,
what'd you think?

445
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,200
Hey, little fella. Come here.

446
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,800
Yeah.

447
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,500
Here's the thing, we got a tip.

448
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,800
And the autopsy report, it backs us up.

449
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,100
Can you put him down, please?

450
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,200
Sure.

451
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,600
You know, I'm sorry about your loss.

452
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,100
He seemed like a pretty decent guy,
all things considered.

453
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,800
So when I found out about this,
I felt like I owed him.

454
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,300
The last thing I wanted to do was upset you
if there was no point to it.

455
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,600
<i>So...</i>

456
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
<i>So...</i>

457
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,900
If there's anything I can help with
or any questions you need answered...

458
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,400
or whatever.

459
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,400
Major, how many people
are under your command?

460
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,300
278, sir.

461
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,000
278.

462
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,000
And how many felony arrests
did they make last month?

463
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,900
Don't bother.

464
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,700
You made sixteen.

465
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Sixteen in a month.

466
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,100
Same time period.
How many handguns you pick up?

467
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,100
All shifts, all sectors.

468
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,100
Once again, don't bother.
The answer is "none."

469
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,900
None.

470
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,000
You had four bodies last night
in how many hours?

471
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,700
- Shut the fucking book, how many hours?
- Seven.

472
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,400
Try five.

473
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,900
Tell me about this kid.

474
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,700
- I believe his name is James...
- James Toney.

475
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
When's the last time he was arrested?

476
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,200
With who?

477
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
Where's he sling?

478
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,800
How about this guy?

479
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,200
Or him? Or him?

480
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,600
You know what? You got four bodies,
all within two blocks of each other...

481
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,200
and you can't even start to connect
the fucking dots.

482
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,400
You got eight hours to get a grip
on this mess or you're done. You hear me?

483
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,700
Done.

484
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,000
Marlo?

485
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,200
You know I'm with Avon, right?

486
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,400
Stringer Bell?

487
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,100
Can we talk?

488
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,300
I need you to walk back up there
and pack up your people.

489
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,600
I'm being a gentleman about it
for the moment.

490
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,100
You offer up what you have on this,
you start the clock running on yourselves.

491
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,300
The wiretap has to surface in court.

492
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,500
- No way around it.
- She's right.

493
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,700
We finally got something
worth listening to...

494
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,500
and you're talking about
giving up the wire?

495
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Makes no sense.

496
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,300
There's a war going on.

497
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,700
We might have four more bodies tonight.

498
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
This is Baltimore, we might have six.

499
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,200
I watched Marvin Taylor from the Eastern
get his asshole ripped today...

500
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,800
because he has no fucking clue.

501
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,400
I don't believe this.

502
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
We got top lieutenants
talking about murders...

503
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,900
and we can't figure out
just to shut up and take notes?

504
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,100
We got bodies on the ground, Jimmy.
That's got to matter for something.

505
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,400
No, if we're at Cheese
then we're close to Prop Joe...

506
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,800
and if we're close to Joe,
then we're close to Stringer.

507
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,100
That has to matter.

508
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,700
Look, I was right there with you
when we left Stringer on the street.

509
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,400
And it grinds me, too.

510
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,000
But the fact is we didn't create this unit
just to lock up dope dealers.

511
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,300
There's a narcotics unit downtown for that.

512
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,200
We're about the violence.
Have been from the jump.

513
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,900
Barksdale was violent.

514
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But right now, Stringer's quiet
and over on the East side, we got bodies.

515
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,600
We got enough from the tap...

516
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,700
to take a real good shot at Cheese.

517
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,400
Put a murder case or two together...

518
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,500
you may be able to roll someone up
at Proposition Joe or Stringer.

519
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,100
As far as bodies go, four's a big number.

520
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,200
Okay, then. As of now,
we use the phones to work these murders.

521
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,100
<i>- Yo, we bracing up, son.</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>

522
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,400
<i>Gather yourself, nigga.</i>

523
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,100
<i>We got a bead on Daz.</i>
<i>Be at Neesey's crib in a hour.</i>

524
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,500
<i>Daz be with Neesey?</i>
<i>I thought that was your girl.</i>

525
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,500
Neesey, huh? Got it.

526
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,300
<i>We just hooking up there,</i>
<i>and going to the battle.</i>

527
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,100
<i>Bring your whistle, in a hour. One.</i>

528
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,400
Mount up.

529
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,800
Caroline, call Q.R.T. With that 20
and stay on the wire.

530
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,300
- We're on channel two.
- All right.

531
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Yo, Tri, what size fries you want?

532
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
What?

533
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,500
Go!

534
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,800
- Police! Search Warrant!
- Freeze!

535
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,000
Hands up!

536
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,600
Put your hands up!
Get down on the ground!

537
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,100
- Freeze!
- Go! Come on, let's go!

538
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,200
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
Hands on your head!

539
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,500
Okay, Mary Tyler Moore, buck-naked.

540
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,800
Open the door, here I come...

541
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,900
drop my attaché case down,
bend her over...

542
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,200
give it to her on the ottoman,
and she's like:

543
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,600
"Oh, Rob. Oh, Rob."

544
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,800
- Who's Rob?
- It's from the show.

545
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Done.

546
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,800
Mary Kate and Ashley. I don't want to say.

547
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,300
Just accept whatever pictures
are on my mind right now.

548
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,700
Anybody else?

549
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,600
Yeah, Dozerman's girl, what's her name?

550
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,600
She's baking a cake, naked.

551
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,100
White flour splotches
all over her fine brown skin.

552
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,200
I come in, in a chef's hat, nothing else on...

553
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,100
Johnson out to here and say:

554
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,500
"That's no way to stir a batter.
Here, let me try to get..."

555
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,000
- Bobby! Hey!
- Hey, Doze.

556
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,300
- What's up?
- Done, now the guy.

557
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,100
This is a hard one
for anybody to understand.

558
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,800
I mean, it's got nothing to do with sex.

559
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,600
It's about sympathy.

560
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,800
- It's about giving a guy a break.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

561
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,000
Gus Triandos.

562
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,600
Who's Gus Triandos?

563
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,100
A catcher with the Orioles back in the day.

564
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,000
Me and my brother had his card.
Sorry-looking motherfucker, man.

565
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,500
I mean, he looked like this little kid
who got left at a bus station by his parents.

566
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,100
You know why?

567
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,500
Because he had to catch
Hoyt Wilhelm's knuckleball.

568
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,000
Five fucking years.

569
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,800
The worst gig in baseball.

570
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,200
It was like trying to catch
a greased pig with wings.

571
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,900
I mean, he even told a reporter once,
"Wilhelm nearly ruined me."

572
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,800
Gus Triandos. Big slow guy.

573
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,800
- Good choice.
- Go ahead, say it.

574
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,000
- I know you want to say it.
- Say what? There's nothing to say.

575
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,600
- Nothing?
- You put a lot of thought into it.

576
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,500
- It's cool.
- Okay.

577
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,900
Okay. Tonight, three things.

578
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,400
Number one.

579
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,400
Keep your incident numbers sequential
or it's gonna be a stone mess tomorrow.

580
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Number two.

581
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,200
We'll be photographing
evidence at the scene.

582
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,200
That means don't bag anything
until you get the shot off.

583
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,900
And number three,
don't embarrass yourselves.

584
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Make sure your camera's loaded with film.

585
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,900
Okay, mount up.

586
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,600
So Cheese, who's your dawg?

587
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,500
You my dawg.

588
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,900
I just want to know who's your dawg.

589
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Dawg.

590
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,300
What's this, some psychology?

591
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah, okay. Yo, please stop, stop.

592
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
I'll tell you everything I know.

593
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,100
Come on, Cheese.

594
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,900
Who's your dawg?

595
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,300
Hell, no.

596
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,500
Hell, you ain't laying no bodies
on me, man.

597
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,900
Lawyer time.

598
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,600
"He was my dawg, man."

599
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,200
"I ain't sleep since I capped his ass.

600
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,100
"Looking up at me all bloody and shit.

601
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,200
"He had much love for me...

602
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,300
"even then.
I ain't never gonna find another."

603
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,100
Man, you all some
cold-ass motherfuckers, man.

604
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,200
We got you on tape.

605
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So what happened, Cheese?

606
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,200
I thought he punked me, all right?
So I did what I had to do.

607
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,000
Which was?

608
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,000
Lit him up.

609
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
Well, he's talking anyway.

610
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,900
Well, what's done is done.

611
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,400
But, maybe we can help you on this.

612
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,100
How? You gonna bring him back?

613
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
No, on the consequences.

614
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,000
Help us help you.

615
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,500
- What?
- Maybe we can trade up.

616
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,700
Trade up for what, man? For this?

617
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,800
- What the fuck...
- Proposition Joe.

618
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,800
You give us Prop Joe and maybe we look
at this whole thing with Dawg differently.

619
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,300
Now, why would I be talking
about Prop Joe <i>behind...</i>

620
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,400
You know what, man?
I don't even know no Prop Joe.

621
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,900
Okay. Dawg?

622
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,300
Which one of these is he?
Where's that body?

623
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,700
Where I left it, most likely.

624
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,900
- Warehouse on the East Side.
- And he still there?

625
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,200
Far as I know.
Unless the SPCA come around.

626
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,500
What?

627
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
Looks like they broke him.

628
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,700
I got to say,
you really showed me something on this.

629
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,400
What can I possibly add to that?
Except, I owe you one, Cedric.

630
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,800
You ever have one of those
"have your cake and eat it, too" days?

631
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,800
I believe this could be my first.

632
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,000
Tell me something good.

633
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,100
We're charging him.

634
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,300
Improper disposal of an animal.
Discharging a firearm in city limits.

635
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,100
Animal cruelty,
if you want to run wild with it.

636
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,100
Go ahead, call me a cocksucker.

637
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
- You know you wanna.
- Excuse me?

638
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,400
You know, I actually looked up
the stats on Gus Triandos.

639
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,200
Power hitter, right?

640
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,700
Fuck the both of you.

641
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,100
Later, dawg.

642
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,700
Kiss my ass.

643
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,600
- Goodnight, Bunk.
- Goodnight.

644
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,400
Funny day.

645
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,000
I'm the new departmental pet
for shutting down a drug war.

646
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,100
But I blew my wire for a dead terrier.

647
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,500
You remember how you said...

648
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,000
you hoped today would be your first
"have your cake and eat it, too" day?

649
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,000
What about it?

650
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,800
Okay, gents.

651
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,800
You see the brake lights pump twice,
you know we got a clean hand-to-hand.

652
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,100
So I get in this morning
and I'm looking at three phone messages...

653
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,600
from Buddy Ferraro over at DPW.

654
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,300
All assuring me that I'll have 20 radio cars
back in service...

655
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,900
at the end of the week.

656
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,200
Buddy and my old man go way back.

657
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,300
Made their First Communion together
at St. Leo's.

658
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,300
So, what else do you need?

659
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,900
And you didn't go to the Mayor with it?

660
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,900
Did you get your cars?

661
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,400
Did anyone get fucked over it?
Or did your job just get a little easier?

662
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,300
I got 70 cops retiring at the end of the year
that I know of...

663
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,100
and no money for academy class.

664
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,400
Well, the Mayor fucked you, 'cause I know
that money was in the budget.

665
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,100
The Mayor delayed it till next summer.

666
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,500
I mean less troops, less salary,
less bennies.

667
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,200
I mean, even a six-month delay
saves the city $2, $3 million.

668
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,300
Let me talk to some people.

669
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,600
Yeah?

670
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,700
<i>- Major Colvin?</i>
- Yeah.

671
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,800
<i>This is the Com Center.</i>

672
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,500
<i>I'm sorry to inform you of this, sir, but</i>
<i>we have an officer down in your district.</i>

673
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,100
Which hospital?

674
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,700
I just got the lease, <i>so...</i>

675
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,500
Fucking solo cars.
I should have teamed him. I fucked up.

676
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,200
Dead-ass motherfucker's dead.

677
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,900
If we catch up to him,
he don't come in alive.

678
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,800
Right?

679
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,500
Nicked jugular, shattered jaw.

680
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,600
He'll live.

681
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,800
Give me one of those.

682
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,700
I just got back from Shock Trauma.

683
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,600
You guys saved his ass
getting him down as fast as you did.

684
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,800
So who do we got for a suspect?

685
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,200
Number one male, white T-shirt,
baggy jeans, tennis shoes.

686
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,200
In the wind,
but we're locking it down out there.

687
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,100
So what's this I hear about the gun?

688
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,800
Doze tried to return fire,
he dropped his piece.

689
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,500
Some fuck picks it up and books.

690
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,900
I mean, I can't believe this shit.

691
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,600
- I'll take it.
- No.

692
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,600
No, no, no.

693
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,400
It'll be nicer when I fix the place up.

694
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,400
Cedric, I don't care.

695
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,800
No, tell him I'm cooked.
I just got done at the hospital, I'm all in.

696
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,300
<i>Well, he was asking if you could</i>
<i>maybe talk to the reporters.</i>

697
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,800
He doesn't want me
talking to reporters right now.

698
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,500
<i>- All right.</i>
- That would truly be unwise.

699
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,700
<i>- All right, all right, I'll tell him.</i>
- All right.

700
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,100
Bunny, you look hellacious.

701
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,400
You got any coffee going in there?

702
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,200
You know what I was thinking?

703
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,000
That tonight's a good night.

704
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,600
Why?

705
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,200
Because my shot cop didn't die.

706
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,200
And it hit me.

707
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,500
This is what makes
a good night on my watch.

708
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,100
Absence of a negative.

709
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,200
It was a good night.

710
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,300
Here's the thing.

711
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,500
Six months from now, I'm gone.

712
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,000
I put in my 30 and the only thing
that'll be left of me on that job...

713
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,900
is an 8"-by-11" framed picture
in the Western hallway.

714
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,300
But you know what?

715
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,900
The shit out there.

716
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,200
The city is worse than when I first came on.

717
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,900
So what does that say about me?

718
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,500
About my life?

719
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,200
Come on, man. You're talking about drugs.

720
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,300
That's a force of nature.

721
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,300
That's sweeping leaves on a windy day,
whoever the hell you are.

722
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,600
You fought the good fight.

723
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,000
Not a call since we gave it up to Cheese.

724
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,300
What did you expect?

725
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,000
Attention.

726
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,300
Be seated.

727
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,000
Regarding Officer Dozerman...

728
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,200
his condition has been upgraded
to "guarded."

729
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,600
I'm told he can receive visits,
and he's been moved to Recovery Unit.

730
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,200
As of this tour...

731
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,400
all hand-to-hand undercover buys of CDS...

732
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,500
are suspended in the Western District.

733
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,700
You're kidding me.

734
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,500
Somewheres...

735
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,700
back in the dawn of time...

736
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,000
this district had itself a civic dilemma
of epic proportion.

737
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,900
The city council had just passed a law
that forbid alcoholic consumption...

738
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,300
in public places, on the streets...

739
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,900
and on the corners.

740
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,000
But the corner is, and it was,
and it always will be...

741
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,300
the poor man's lounge.

742
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,700
It's where a man wants to be
on a hot summer's night.

743
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,800
It's cheaper than a bar, catch a nice breeze,
you watch the girls go by.

744
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,700
But the law is the law.

745
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,300
And the Western cops rolling by,
what were they gonna do?

746
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,400
If they arrested every dude out there
for tipping back a High Life...

747
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,700
there'd be no other time
for any other kind of police work.

748
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,200
And if they looked the other way?

749
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,400
They'd open themselves
to all kinds of flaunting.

750
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,200
All kinds of disrespect.

751
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,800
Now, this is before my time
when it happened, but...

752
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,300
somewhere back in the '50s or '60s...

753
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,700
there was a small moment
of goddamn genius...

754
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,800
by some nameless smokehound
who comes out the Cut Rate one day...

755
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,000
and on his way to the corner...

756
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,400
he slips that just-bought
pint of elderberry...

757
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,100
into a paper bag.

758
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,200
A great moment of civic compromise.

759
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,200
That small wrinkled-ass paper bag...

760
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,800
allowed the corner boys
to have their drink in peace...

761
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,700
and it gave us permission...

762
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,500
to go and do police work.

763
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,900
The kind of police work
that's actually worth the effort.

764
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,200
That's worth actually taking a bullet for.

765
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,200
Dozerman...

766
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,100
he got shot last night trying to buy...

767
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,600
three vials.

768
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,500
Three!

769
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,700
There's never been a paper bag...

770
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,500
for drugs.

771
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,800
Until now.

772
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,800
If we ain't doing hand-to-hands,
then what the fuck?

773
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,800
And the shit with the bag?

774
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,800
What the fuck is that?
