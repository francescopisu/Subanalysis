1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,900
Need another bag.

2
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,500
- Mike, where you at?
- Yeah, over here.

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,400
Drug war?

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,500
Barksdale's coming back
on my boy Marlo, huh?

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,700
Shit.

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,500
Got it.

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,300
Man, I don't know where we at.

8
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,200
We are in Baltimore, Lamar.
Baltimore, Maryland.

9
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,400
That's the second crib of mine
them motherfuckers cracked this week.

10
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Stir up a hornet's nest,
no telling who gonna get stung.

11
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,100
- All paranoid and shit.
- Gotta be.

12
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,600
They got Latroy.

13
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,300
Hey, what the fuck
is y'all on the streets for, man?

14
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,700
Don't y'all know
there's a fucking war going on, man?

15
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,100
Get the fuck in the truck, man.

16
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,500
What happened to all them towers?

17
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,300
Slow train coming.

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,700
Reform, Lamar. Reform.

19
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,900
We should be up on this shit,
hearing voices.

20
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,300
We get a signature number
on Bodie's phone, we will be.

21
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,700
We got enough PC off the burners alone.

22
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,900
Every time these fucking pen registers
click out a call...

23
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,100
it screams drug conspiracy.

24
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm not the one taking the case to court.

25
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,900
Pearlman wants a specific link
to a known drug trafficker.

26
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,700
These drug crews, they're dumping phones
every couple of weeks at best.

27
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,300
So when we do get a wire up,
it's gonna be a limited run.

28
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
And dumping phones doesn't meet...

29
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,000
the cellular company's definition
of "exigent circumstance," right?

30
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,200
What's your boss willing to do?

31
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,100
Demper? He's a bit too focused
on next year's re-election fight.

32
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,400
How about the feds?

33
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
They say they can't do anything for us.

34
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,100
And if you look at how they use
the Federal Communications Act...

35
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
they're not lying.

36
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,900
For national security stuff,
they use the Patriot Act.

37
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,900
Everything else gets shorted.

38
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,900
The fact is,
the industry has all of us by the balls.

39
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,700
Pardon my French, Your Honor.

40
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,300
All right, I'll tell you what.
Best I can do for you is this.

41
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
You give me a boilerplate affidavit
with the PC from the court report.

42
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,900
And then, as you get fresh numbers
for the new disposables, you call me...

43
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,300
anytime, day or night, to jump phones.

44
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,600
That helps.

45
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,800
But we're still gonna be
getting up on their phones...

46
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,800
- even as they're coming down.
- Yeah, probably so.

47
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,500
- This is so totally...
- Fucked up.

48
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,400
Judge Phelan has you on his mind.
How long has that been going on?

49
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,300
Started with my first jury trial in his court,
I think.

50
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,000
I bet you won all your motions.

51
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,400
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Have a seat.

52
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,400
I wanna thank you
for the loyalty you showed...

53
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,100
moving that body.

54
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,200
It wasn't the most sensible thing,
but I appreciate it, nonetheless.

55
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,100
You're a good man, Sergeant.

56
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,700
You got good instincts...

57
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,200
and as far as I can tell,
you're a decent supervisor.

58
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
But from where I sit...

59
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,200
you ain't shit when it come to policing.

60
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,800
Don't take it personal.

61
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,700
Ain't just you, it's all our young police...

62
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,300
whole generation of y'all.

63
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,400
No, you think about it.

64
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,400
You've been here over a year now, Carver.

65
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,500
You got nobody looking out for you,
nobody willing to talk to you.

66
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
That about sum it up?

67
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,900
Now, that's a problem.

68
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,400
And I didn't think there was any way
I was ever gonna get my head around it...

69
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,100
but then Dozerman gets shot
for some bullshit.

70
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,700
And that's when I about reach my limit.

71
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,000
And that's when the idea of the free zone,
of Hamsterdam, come to me...

72
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,300
because this drug thing,
this ain't police work.

73
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,200
No, it ain't.

74
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,900
I mean, I can send any fool with a badge
and a gun up on them corners...

75
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,200
and jack a crew and grab vials.

76
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,000
But policing?

77
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
I mean, you call something a war...

78
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,000
and pretty soon everybody gonna be
running around acting like warriors.

79
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,300
They gonna be running around
on a damn crusade...

80
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,100
storming corners,
slapping on cuffs, racking up body counts.

81
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,900
And when you at war,
you need a fucking enemy.

82
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,800
And pretty soon, damn near everybody
on every corner is your fucking enemy.

83
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,300
And soon the neighborhood
that you're supposed to be policing...

84
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,700
that's just occupied territory.

85
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,900
You follow this?

86
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,400
I think so.

87
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,200
Look here,
the point I'm making, Carver, is this.

88
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,400
Soldiering and policing,
they ain't the same thing.

89
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,700
And before we went
and took the wrong turn...

90
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,200
and started up with these war games...

91
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,500
the cop walked a beat,
and he learned that post.

92
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,100
And if there were things that happened
up on that post...

93
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
whether they be a rape
or robbery or shooting...

94
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,200
he had people out there helping him,
feeding him information.

95
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,900
But every time I come to you,
my DEU Sergeant...

96
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,400
for information, to find out what's going on
out there in them streets...

97
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,800
all that came back was some bullshit.

98
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,900
You had your stats, you had your arrests,
you had your seizures.

99
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,800
But don't none of that amount to shit...

100
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,400
when you talking about
protecting the neighborhood, now, do it?

101
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,400
You know the worst thing
about this so-called drug war...

102
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
to my mind...

103
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,600
it <i>just...</i> It ruined this job.

104
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Major.

105
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,100
- What you got?
- Incoming.

106
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,400
A <i>Sun</i> paper reporter.
Been to the free zones, all three of them.

107
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,700
Meet you at the car.

108
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,400
I was thinking,
maybe we rewrite the affidavit...

109
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,700
add some of the stuff
we're getting from the pen registers...

110
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
build the case that way, take it to the judge.

111
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,100
You have a law degree?
If you did, it would be your call to make.

112
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,700
Who would pretend to be a lawyer
that wasn't?

113
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm just saying,
I think we're being too cautious on this.

114
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
We're going the extra mile for Phelan.

115
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,100
A shortcut now could cost us later
in motions hearings.

116
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,000
We drew Phelan on this wiretap?

117
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,400
That two-faced hack sold me out,
the last go-round.

118
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,800
Relax, he's not running for a new term.
He'll be fine.

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,100
Yeah, he's a piece of shit.

120
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,800
We're all pieces of shit
when we're in your way.

121
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,100
That goes with the territory.

122
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,600
Point taken.

123
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,000
So it's these warehouses,
the old Winchester Homes...

124
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,200
and the dead blocks
down by Vincent Street?

125
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,600
All three.

126
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,300
And they're just supposed
to let it go on like this?

127
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,200
Colvin told us
to push the street dealing in these areas...

128
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,400
and then we would start locking people up.

129
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,600
But so far, not a single fucking arrest.

130
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,100
And they know about this downtown?

131
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't think
they have a fucking clue about it.

132
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,000
But I'd love to be there
when you pop the question.

133
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,700
This is <i>just...</i>

134
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
Tell me about it.

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,500
- Got the place looking good.
- Yeah.

136
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,800
Now all that needs doing
is to go out and get you some kids.

137
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,300
Come on, man.

138
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,300
You making it sound easy...

139
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,800
but, tell you the truth...

140
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,300
I ain't got no idea
how to go at these hoppers.

141
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,700
Oh, I wouldn't lose any sleep over that.
Nobody else does, neither.

142
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
We got one.

143
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,200
His grandmother.

144
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,600
<i>- Looking for me?</i>
<i>- Look, boy...</i>

145
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,900
<i>there's no reason</i>
<i>to leave your clothes in the washer.</i>

146
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
<i>How many damn times</i>
<i>do I have to tell you?</i>

147
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,900
<i>Dag, Mee-maw.</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I just forgot, okay?</i>

148
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,100
<i>But I did pick up the laundry soap.</i>
<i>I picked it up.</i>

149
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Laundry soap, that's definitely a code.

150
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Now let's listen to an intercept we made
of Bodie Broadus...

151
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,400
when we were up on those payphones
a couple of years back.

152
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,600
<i>Look, I'm telling y'all, I saw the boy.</i>
<i>He saying he ain't got that thing.</i>

153
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,600
- Same voice, no question.
- I'll let the judge know.

154
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Reference the voice comparison
in the court report.

155
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,200
We're up.

156
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,300
Yeah.

157
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,200
Got it right here, yo. Yeah, that's right.

158
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,400
- Major Colvin, Western District.
- Banisky, <i>Sun</i> papers.

159
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,700
So, this your idea?

160
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,300
Got one, get one.

161
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,400
Mind if we walk?

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,300
Apocalypse. Apocalypse.
Got that Apocalypse.

163
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Right here, shorty.

164
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,100
You got dealers selling with impunity...

165
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,500
addicts shooting up on the street...

166
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,100
people down here doing outreach,
giving out needles and all.

167
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,300
I mean, who knows about this
down at headquarters?

168
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,700
Look, Command is
well aware of the situation.

169
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,700
While there was some initial <i>concern...</i>

170
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,900
But they feel
that the cases we're gonna bring in...

171
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,500
- Cases?
- Yeah, prosecutions, sure.

172
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,100
Your officers say
no one's being locked up in the free zones.

173
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,900
Look, my troops are only involved
in pushing the trafficking...

174
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,000
to designated areas.

175
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,500
I mean, they're completely ignorant
of the investigative aspect.

176
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
That's run out of CID downtown.

177
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,400
Yeah? Who's the lead detective?

178
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,400
Look.

179
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,800
I already said more than I should.

180
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,400
The bottom line is,
you start throwing calls around right now...

181
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,900
they're gonna shit blue,
thinking there's a leak.

182
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,800
They're gonna come up on the case early,
and we won't get all we can...

183
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,400
out of this good work we did down here.

184
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,800
You're telling me
all this is an enforcement strategy?

185
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
What the hell else could it be?

186
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,900
I mean, you think we would
actually let this happen otherwise?

187
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,500
Come on, Banisky.
I mean, look. Look at this mess.

188
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,400
Any other reporter gets on <i>it...</i>

189
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,700
I give it to you,
and you run with it right then. Absolutely.

190
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,600
A week. But then I gotta run something,
no matter what.

191
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,300
- Purple Haze, Purple Haze.
- It's understood.

192
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,600
Right there.

193
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,000
So, brother, what brought you back?

194
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,300
It disturbs me to leave business unfinished.

195
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,500
Heard you was shot
before you even got started down here.

196
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Not like you to get played.

197
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,000
Betrayed, you mean.

198
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,700
I am looking for the man they sent.

199
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
From his accent, he's homegrown,
raised on the street.

200
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,200
Skilled, intelligent, late 20s, dark...

201
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,200
but with a scar across his face, like so.

202
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,400
- You down with this nigga?
- I know him.

203
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,200
Not to speak to...

204
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,400
but you can't be anywhere near the game
and not know the motherfucker.

205
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,700
- He with Barksdale?
- He with himself.

206
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
Except for
when he running with a young boy or two.

207
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,200
Ten months to the primary, and you
right now should be all about money.

208
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,600
I know, I know. Dialing for dollars.

209
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,700
You start this week, and you don't stop
until you hit your numbers.

210
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,600
We're gonna need $1 million
just for television.

211
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,400
Do you really think this is doable?

212
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,900
The odds aren't great, but, yeah.

213
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
I think it can be done...

214
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,300
as long as the thousand things
that can go wrong, don't go wrong.

215
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Even for a white guy?

216
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,700
Even for a white guy.

217
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,400
Speaking of which...

218
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,900
I notice
a certain monochromatic effect here.

219
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
One thing we're gonna need
is black faces...

220
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,600
and we're gonna need them
in prominent positions.

221
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,700
You're right.

222
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,200
You gotta start thinking
about endorsement by black leaders.

223
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,500
Ministers, community people,
elected officials.

224
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,100
Here comes the hard part.

225
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,800
Splitting the black vote
is the only way to make the math work.

226
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,500
So, Tony Gray's gotta get in the race.

227
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,700
He's gotta stay in the race,
and he's gotta stay viable in the race.

228
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,300
Guy's kind of a lightweight, ain't he?

229
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,600
- He's a good guy, all in all.
- Great.

230
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,500
He's a good guy, but we need him
to siphon votes from Royce.

231
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,500
I don't know. This thing with <i>Tony...</i>

232
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,800
It's not personal, Tommy. It's politics.

233
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,700
Live with it, or lose.

234
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,200
<i>Yo, yo. That boy with the sharp nose,</i>
<i>he going, you know...</i>

235
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,200
<i>- He going to the Apollo.</i>
<i>- The Apollo?</i>

236
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,100
<i>Yeah. He gonna need two tickets.</i>

237
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,100
<i>Damn. Tweety Bird working that shit.</i>

238
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,700
<i>Motherfucker, how many times</i>
<i>I gotta tell you not to use no names?</i>

239
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,600
<i>- Oh, yeah, right. So I holler at you?</i>
<i>- Yeah. All right.</i>

240
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,100
- Apollo, like the theater?
- Like 125th Street.

241
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,100
125 grams, one-eighth of a kilo.
Two tickets means "twice that."

242
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,100
- The only new code so far is Hamsterdam.
- Hamsterdam?

243
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,700
We're thinking it might have
something to do with the stash house.

244
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,500
Well, I'm gonna hook up with Kima,
catch the Tweety Bird meet.

245
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,600
You're happy with what we're getting?

246
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,200
Another week of calls like this...

247
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,600
and we'll have their network fleshed out
and plenty more phones to go up on.

248
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
I need a moment with the detectives.

249
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Sure.

250
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,500
IID picked up Prez's shooting.
It's to be expected.

251
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,900
The racial thing alone is tense enough
that they gotta react.

252
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,200
No luck at all to that boy, huh?

253
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,700
For the supervisor's report...

254
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,300
I need to ask
if either of you had any indication...

255
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,500
that Prez harbored racial prejudices.

256
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,900
Well, he harbored some weird shit,
no doubt, but I never got a racial vibe.

257
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,400
Lieutenant, you seriously asking?

258
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,900
Not to start no shit, but you think
Waggoner gets shot if he's white?

259
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,900
- Description called for a number one male.
- I'm just saying.

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,300
The good Lord set Sunday morning aside
for churchgoing.

261
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,600
Even Kenny Bird and Peanut,
when they was warring...

262
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,400
had the good sense to respect the truce.

263
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,300
You know them Barksdales sent a hat?

264
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
A church crown?

265
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,100
Walked up, rang the bell,
and set it down on the porch.

266
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,900
'Cause they ashamed.

267
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,600
Is Miss Josephine mending?

268
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,700
She bruised up still,
but she all right, though.

269
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
But you ain't.

270
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Not until I settle this for good.

271
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,200
Hey, yo, Butch, I want you
to go inside my bank and spread the word.

272
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,200
Omar paying cash money
to get at them people, you feel me?

273
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
Hey, save your money.

274
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,700
- Come on now, Butchie, I got to do this, yo.
- I'm saying you ain't got to pay.

275
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,200
Thomkins, up on McCulloh.

276
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,500
What, the funeral home?

277
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,100
You mean to tell me all this time
you had a scope on them clowns...

278
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,400
- and you ain't let loose a mumbling word.
- Caught myself looking out for you.

279
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,000
Fact of the matter is, your chances
of going up against that mob...

280
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,100
and coming back
is as slim as a garter snake.

281
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,500
I can't help that now, Butch.

282
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,200
What the fuck? Where's my people?

283
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,700
Slim Charles pulled them.
Hired new muscle.

284
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,400
Slim Charles? When the fuck did <i>he...</i>

285
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,300
How's the count?

286
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,700
Down bad for the third straight week.

287
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,400
And the shelf-life of the shit we got,
it ain't gonna last, String.

288
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,700
I know. Slim said
they're to stick to you for protection.

289
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,500
- Give it here. Give it here.
- Nice shot.

290
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Dribble it back out. Dribble it back out.

291
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,800
Get your dribble on.

292
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,200
Fucking hack.

293
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,200
Yo, yo, easy, easy.
Y'all just hacking my man up.

294
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,800
Foul machine.

295
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,700
Nice drive.

296
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
Kind of unschooled, ain't they?

297
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,000
What the fuck you cherry-picking for?

298
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,900
That observation meant
as just a casual curbside, "Fuck you"...

299
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,800
or are you looking to step up,
maybe help out here?

300
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm gonna give it a try.

301
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,900
I'm looking
to get some kids interested in boxing.

302
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,400
Boxing?

303
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,700
Look here. This is my time-out corner.

304
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
Where I send children
who can't play nice together.

305
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Listen up.
This man's starting a boxing program.

306
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,800
And from the looks of some of y'all,
signing on might be a good thing.

307
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,100
You gonna need it.

308
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,600
The only thing he know how to do
with his fist is wrap it around his cock.

309
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,600
Fuck you, man! Gonna kick your ass!

310
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,900
Come on, motherfucker, you ain't shit.

311
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Ease up. Sit down, sit down. Sit down.

312
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,200
Come on, man. Sit down, man. Sit down.

313
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,000
My man, you dropping your right.

314
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,300
See, if young'un there was trained,
he'd whip you.

315
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Look like he the one that got beat.

316
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,900
Stand up, let me show you something.

317
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,200
Come on, man. I ain't gonna hurt you.

318
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Yellow tops, yellow tops,
got them yellow tops. Yellow tops.

319
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
See that?

320
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,000
All right, sit down.

321
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,000
Look, if y'all wanna learn more...

322
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,300
I got a gym down on Gilmor
in the old tire plant.

323
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,900
Y'all are all welcome. All right?

324
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,700
I saw Tweety Bird parked up there.

325
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,600
All we gotta do is wait for the re-up.

326
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,400
I hope these fucks don't dick around
and make us sit here all day.

327
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What, this is eating at you?

328
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,900
No, I'm good.

329
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,200
Yeah, I can see that.

330
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,000
Remember that woman I was talking about?

331
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,900
Politician woman? How's it going?

332
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,500
It ain't. Turned to shit.

333
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,200
Feel like I don't even belong
to any world that even fucking matters.

334
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,100
'Cause you're a cop?

335
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,400
Nah, it's not just that.

336
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,900
It's like, I went to meet her once.
She was in a hotel room, the top floor.

337
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
I punched the button on the elevator.

338
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,800
It doesn't even go there, 'cause you have
to have some fucking special key...

339
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,400
to even get to that special fucking floor.

340
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,300
So I go to the front desk,
some sneering fuck calls upstairs...

341
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,800
to give me permission to go get laid.

342
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,400
I listen to the shit she talks about...

343
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,600
first time in my life,
I feel like a fucking doormat.

344
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,300
Like anyone with any smarts would do
something else with his life, you know?

345
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,800
Earn money or get elected.

346
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,200
Like I'm just a breathing machine
for my fucking dick.

347
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,300
I'm serious.

348
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
I'm the smartest asshole in three districts...

349
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,100
and she looks at me
like I'm some stupid fuck...

350
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,600
playing some stupid game
for stupid penny-ante stakes.

351
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,900
She fucking looks through me, Kima.

352
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,200
Yo, stay in the car, man.

353
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,600
Tall man said to stick to you like...

354
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,200
Tall man gonna be there
when I stomp on your fucking head?

355
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,900
Stay in the car.

356
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,800
Yo, make it short, man,
I got a meet to make.

357
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,400
Oh, fuck the meet!

358
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,200
You harder to get at
than my fat wife's cunt, nigga.

359
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Yeah, you high-and-mighty Barksdales
can afford to sit back and play low-key.

360
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,300
But some of us gotta work
for a goddamn living.

361
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,500
What, you think
this mess ain't fucking up our business?

362
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,800
That means Avon's willing to sit down
and talk with Marlo, work this shit out?

363
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,600
Well, if that don't happen, String,
I got you some bad news.

364
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,800
Me and the boys had us a sit-down.

365
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,300
Got a quorum and took a vote that says...

366
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,600
if y'all don't quit this war,
we have a mind to shut you out.

367
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,400
And when I say out, String,
I mean out the package.

368
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,200
The boys don't wanna
extend the good shit...

369
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,300
if it's gonna keep you and your peoples
out on them corners, banging.

370
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,300
What about the boy? What the fuck he say?

371
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,100
Vinson say Marlo willing to talk
if he can keep his corners.

372
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,900
Now hear me on this, String,
we ain't no ingrates.

373
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We all recognize your contribute
to the co-op.

374
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,000
But the feeling is this.

375
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,800
It ain't right for you to be at the head of
our table when you can't call off your dog.

376
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,800
Call it a crisis of leadership.

377
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,900
You're gonna tell them?

378
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,600
Got to.

379
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,300
Between the health-care workers, the
reporter, and my own pissed-off troops...

380
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,200
it's gonna come out.

381
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,600
Either tomorrow or the next day.

382
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,100
We should make a few arrests,
make it look tactical.

383
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,900
Nah. You know what happens if we start
locking people up in Hamsterdam?

384
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,200
The whole rest of the district goes back
to being a shithole.

385
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,000
Nah. If Rawls is gonna hand me my ass...

386
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,600
at least give me a chance
to tell the man my story first.

387
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,600
Devonne.

388
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,700
What was that?

389
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,600
It needed doing.

390
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,300
Somebody just got shot!

391
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,500
What you want I should give the snitch
that clued us to the Denali.

392
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,400
I mean, we didn't get Marlo, but <i>still...</i>

393
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,200
No, he kept his end up. Go it all.

394
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,700
Avon, I need a word, man.

395
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,200
Let me holler at you.
Get them niggas out of here, man.

396
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,600
Check it out, String.

397
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,600
This shit got the kill range of, like,
50 meters.

398
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,400
Slim got this from some soldier
coming back from wherever.

399
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,100
You know, I spoke to Prop Joe's people.

400
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,300
- They think we can work this out.
- A sit-down?

401
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,000
It's the perfect time for it, man. I mean...

402
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,700
you done represented yourself, man.

403
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,000
Your name ringing out...

404
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,300
now that you done taken Marlo
down a notch or two, man.

405
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,000
So why not quit while we's ahead?

406
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,400
Just let me get this thing right, man.

407
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,300
Then, you know,
we get back to business as usual.

408
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,900
They gonna cut us out, Avon!

409
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Prop Joe and them niggas, man,
they took a vote.

410
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
They gonna cut us out.

411
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,400
We ain't gonna have that dope,
so even if we win, we lose...

412
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,300
'cause we ain't gonna have no product
to put on them fucking corners, B.

413
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,000
Avon, look at you.

414
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,800
Fucking shooting dope
without a fucking needle right now, man...

415
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,200
getting high on a power trip,
playing fucking soldier.

416
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,500
Yo, you gotta sit back, man,
and think about our business.

417
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,200
What the fuck you want?

418
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,800
That motherfucker. He good.

419
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,200
What happened?

420
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,600
You know, Avon, you gotta think about
what we got in this game for, man.

421
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,700
Was it the rep?

422
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,700
Was it so our names could ring out on
some fucking ghetto street corners, man?

423
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Nah, man,
there's games beyond the fucking game.

424
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,000
Avon, look, you and me, we brothers, B.

425
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,500
We didn't think we'll make it this fucking
far, but fuck if we ain't standing here...

426
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,300
right now, with the whole world at our feet.

427
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,900
The whole world, man,
not these fucking corners.

428
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,700
The whole world, B.

429
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,900
You know what Slim just told me?

430
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,100
Devonne come up dead.

431
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,800
She was shot,
one in the mouth, one in each tit.

432
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,700
You still wanna talk truce, String?

433
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,600
You right when you say
I need to learn more discipline.

434
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,000
But this? You could do this better.

435
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,100
You're the perfect bait, Lamar.
They'll see you as conflicted.

436
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,500
Your homophobia is so visceral.

437
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,900
You see that?

438
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,400
I ain't even stepped inside the joint yet,
and you calling me a cocksucker already.

439
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,300
You in the right place?

440
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,400
I'm looking for someone named Omar.

441
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,400
No last name. Scar across his face and shit.

442
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Scarface named Omar?
Sounds different, but I can't help you.

443
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,300
You drinking?

444
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Maybe you wait four years.

445
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,800
No. It has to be now.

446
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,500
It's gotta be a three-way,
and Tony's gonna go this time.

447
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,600
I'm <i>just...</i>

448
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,400
Tony's my oldest friend on the Council.

449
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,500
Well, couldn't you go talk to him first?

450
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,000
Put it on the table?
You know, "May the best man win"?

451
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,600
Truth is...

452
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,200
he can't win alone against Royce, either.

453
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,600
He's got the bumper stickers,
but not much else.

454
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Wants to run on education.

455
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,400
I mean...

456
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,400
where do you go with that?

457
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,200
If I level with Tony and he gets out,
then I can't win.

458
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,200
I need him in the race.

459
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,400
I feel like shit. I really do.

460
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,000
Don't look like much.

461
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,500
- This don't look like shit.
- Hell, yeah.

462
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,800
- This some weak-ass shit right here.
- Hell, yeah.

463
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,500
Man, we got lockers, got gear.

464
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,300
- It's all peeling and shit.
- Go long.

465
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,800
Hey, hey, hey, pass it here.

466
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,700
- You getting me all dirty and shit.
- Hey, fuck your jeans.

467
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
- Fuck you.
- Bitch.

468
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,900
We clocked the meet with Tweety Bird,
stayed on him overnight...

469
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,800
tracked him to a possible stash house...

470
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,400
and then home to nest in Woodlawn.

471
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Got photos, his <i>tags...</i>

472
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,500
- What happened?
- They ditched their phones.

473
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,400
The DNRs and the wire all died around 3:00.

474
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,900
We were online just shy of 30 hours.

475
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,600
I thought we had them on their burners
for a couple of weeks.

476
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,300
Not anymore. It's a week at best.

477
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,400
We just spent $9,000 and change
for 18 intercepts...

478
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,100
five of them non-pertinent.

479
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,700
That's close to $700 per drug call.

480
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,300
Until we see which way this goes...

481
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
shouldn't we get back
on Bernard and his girl?

482
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,400
I mean,
get a line on the new phones at least.

483
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,900
But that'll only give us
what we just had, 30 hours.

484
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,700
Any way to get ourselves
ahead of the curve?

485
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,400
If there were some way
to pre-wiretap the <i>burners...</i>

486
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,900
And what then?

487
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,300
Stick them on a rack at Baba-whatever
and wait for Bernard to show up that day?

488
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,600
The problem is the wireless people.

489
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,800
They claim it takes a minimum of four days
to process a court order...

490
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,900
and that's only after I had my office
threaten to go public on them.

491
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,000
Four days to hit a couple of keystrokes.
Bullshit.

492
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,000
Well, what <i>if...</i>

493
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,100
No way.

494
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,400
I know what you're thinking.
I just thought the same fucking thing.

495
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,600
All right, look, man.
When I tell you, put your left foot out, boy.

496
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,400
- Hey, Unc patting my man's feet.
- Yeah, he smelling up my ass, too.

497
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,100
Stop with the damn clowning, man.

498
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,300
How the fuck you gonna learn something,
acting like a damn fool?

499
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,000
Yeah. Ain't no big mystery
why your face got tattooed.

500
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,000
Shit, that man can't talk to you like that.

501
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,500
I seen his raggedy ass up at the spot,
copping vials.

502
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,900
Yeah, probably pimps his ass, too.

503
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,300
- Listen, motherfucker...
- Yeah, bitch, touch me.

504
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,500
Touch a juvenile, see what happen.

505
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,700
Let's bounce. Bitch-ass motherfucker.

506
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,900
Faggot.

507
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,400
- Punk-ass nigga.
- Chump ass.

508
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,800
Lester.

509
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,100
First time I seen him smoking.

510
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,700
Tough habit.

511
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,400
And pacing like a motherfuck, too.

512
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,000
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

513
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,400
<i>Bay Wireless Connect 411.</i>
<i>What city and state?</i>

514
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,300
Baltimore, Maryland.

515
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,100
<i>- How may I help you?</i>
- Baltimore police.

516
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,100
<i>- Any particular department?</i>
- Western District police.

517
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,400
<i>- Is this an emergency?</i>
- No. Non-emergency.

518
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,700
Man, they did you with the bum rush.

519
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,600
That's what they do.
They past experts at plucking nerves.

520
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,900
You just gotta remember
they barely housebroke.

521
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'm telling you, man,
you wouldn't believe it.

522
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,000
They was all wild and shit. Wouldn't listen.

523
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,300
Andre, I want you to crowd him.

524
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,600
- Yes, sir, I'll crowd him.
- All right.

525
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,800
Time!

526
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You just gotta set your mind
to stick with it.

527
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,200
When those two stumbled in here,
they was wild as wild.

528
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,000
Now they come in every day.
"Yes, sir. No, sir."

529
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,600
Still pretty rough but, you know,
with the right breaks, they gonna make it.

530
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,700
How?

531
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,800
Well, try as they might, I won't let them fail.

532
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,200
When you do that,
it messes with their mind.

533
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,100
Pretty soon,
they run out of their little bag of tricks.

534
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
What do you think of that?

535
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,300
Pretty weak.

536
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,900
He ain't weak. That's the starting point.

537
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,200
Nah, nah, I can't put a name on him.

538
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,500
But I seen him around.
He's off the West Side.

539
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,000
He ain't no drug dealer,
unless he's doing it on the q.t.

540
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,300
You can't go at him, game him?

541
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
I don't know, Kima.
I mean, it'd be pressing.

542
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,700
What about her?

543
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,400
Little Squeak off of Lanvale.

544
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,700
Yeah, she used to boost
for Turtle Wells' old mob.

545
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,500
She's lost a little bit of weight, too. I mean,
looking a lot better than I remember.

546
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,100
And I remember a lot about that girl.

547
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,600
Damn, Bubs, is there anybody
West Side you don't know?

548
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,500
Just citizens and shit.

549
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,000
My CI knows the girl.

550
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,500
- He can work her?
- He's smooth, yeah.

551
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,300
Check this.

552
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,700
That's Western District.

553
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,400
- What, Stringer's calling the Western?
- Maybe he's surrendering.

554
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,400
After all the work we've done,
I'd never forgive the son of a bitch.

555
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,700
Go down. Go down and out.

556
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,700
Oh, sweet! Look at the hands!

557
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,000
What's up? My knuckleheads didn't post?

558
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,600
Yeah, they did, but they left.

559
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,500
Over here!

560
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,400
Looking for a discount, old man?

561
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Nah, but I'm looking for you.

562
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,400
Why, something come up missing?

563
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,500
Came past to apologize.

564
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,900
I'm new at this coaching thing
and got us off on the wrong foot.

565
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,400
I ain't gonna leave it between us,
with you thinking I gave up on y'all.

566
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,400
Motherfucker's memory weak as shit.
We the one bailed out on him.

567
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,700
Anyway, I'm here now.

568
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Let me understand.

569
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,800
You wanna sell drug traffickers
a series of cell phones...

570
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,700
that are pre-approved
for telephonic intercepts.

571
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,300
And you want me to sign off
on court-ordered taps...

572
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,000
on a bunch of phones that,
at the time I'm signing the order...

573
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,900
have not been used
for any illegal activity whatsoever.

574
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,700
If you're looking for precedents,
Your Honor, there aren't any.

575
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,700
It's circumstantial PC at best.

576
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
What the hell, let's do it.

577
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,900
Let the Court of Appeals sort it out,
if it even gets that far.

578
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,100
Quite the legal mind.

579
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,800
Buy you a drink?

580
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,800
- Why the fuck you coming up behind me?
- I'm sorry.

581
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,300
Bushy top.

582
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,300
He called.
I didn't know if I'd find you here so late.

583
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,700
Just getting ready for COMSTAT tomorrow.

584
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,300
So what's up, Major?

585
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,000
So your unit is still working a drug war,
right?

586
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,800
Working it hard.

587
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,500
Does the name Avon Barksdale
do anything for you?

588
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,600
- He's a player?
- He's the main guy.

589
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,400
We thought he was down,
but he popped up in September.

590
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,500
You add him to the equation, it goes
a long way to explaining the violence.

591
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,300
So it wouldn't be a stretch if he got shot?

592
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
You heard he got shot?

593
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,200
You know when or where?
I could run it out quick.

594
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Nah, ain't gonna make no difference.
He didn't post up at any emergency room...

595
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,800
from what I hear.

596
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,700
Major, I'm gonna be straight with you.
We're running wires into his people.

597
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,200
But we're barely above the street.

598
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,900
So far,
we haven't even put an eyeball on him.

599
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Supposed to be laying his head there.

600
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,100
I need you to check that out,
get back to me as soon as you can.

601
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,700
You got a CI, huh?

602
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,500
You wanna see
if your man's creds are bona fide.

603
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,100
Don't try to play me, bushy top.
I didn't say male. I didn't say female.

604
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,100
All right.
I'll get surveillance going right away.

605
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,900
According to my source,
Barksdale's name is on the paperwork.

606
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,300
No shit.

607
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,500
Now, you get me a confirmation on that
and call me back on the cell.

608
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,400
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Yeah, right.

609
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Sham.

610
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,000
Shamrock.

611
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,000
Run these over to Levy for me.
Tell him I want a read on it.

612
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,800
A read?

613
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,200
Fresh eyes. Tell him I'll call him tomorrow.

614
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,100
All right.

615
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Come on, Mr. Bodyguard.

616
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,700
And so we're gonna come at her like that.

617
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,100
So you're gonna give me
these phones to sell?

618
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,000
The money comes back, Bubs.

619
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,500
All of it?

620
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,400
- Is that Beadie Russell?
- Looks like.

621
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,400
Whoa, yo, you can't turn from this lane!

622
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,400
Sweet Beatrice Russell.

623
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,200
I was just gonna say hey.

624
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,400
North and Pulaski.

625
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:35,000
That photo was taken at 4:00 p.m.,
prime time for the street-level dealer.

626
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,200
That is Riggs and Calhoun.

627
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,800
Mount and Fayette.

628
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,700
Edmondson and Brice.
That's your old foot post, Deputy.

629
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,200
I know where it is, Major.

630
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,900
What I don't know
and very much want to know is...

631
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,500
where is the West Baltimore drug trade?

632
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,400
I hope, Major, these are not staged
photographs you're showing us.

633
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,300
No, sir, they are not.

634
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,600
No, Deputy, I found another approach.

635
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,400
I'm all ears, Bunny.

636
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,300
- I moved them off the corners.
- God damn it!

637
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,000
Don't be coy with me, Major. I can see that.

638
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,900
What I want to know is
how the fuck you managed to move them...

639
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,200
and where the fuck they are now.

640
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,500
Deputy...

641
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,100
I don't know quite how to put this,
but <i>we...</i>

642
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,300
I mean, <i>I...</i>

643
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,000
I began by identifying
those areas of my district...

644
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,100
where drug trafficking was least harmful.

645
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,000
I proceeded to push
all street-level dealing towards those areas.

646
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,700
Now, at first...

647
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,900
dealing with the juveniles on them corners,
I had little success.

648
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,200
But ultimately...

649
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,600
by rounding up
all the mid-level dealers in my district...

650
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,900
and making them
an offer they couldn't refuse...

651
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,700
- I was able to...
- You made them an offer?

652
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,000
Yes, sir.

653
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,700
Either they move their people
to one of three designated areas...

654
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,600
where drug enforcement
was not a district priority...

655
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,000
or they face the wrath
of every able-bodied soul in my district.

656
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,000
Major, I don't understand.

657
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,300
The only time we can hold a drug corner
is when we assign officers to stand there.

658
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,200
Your slides don't suggest
any concerted deployment on any corners.

659
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,400
How were you able to...

660
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,700
Jesus Christ, you nit,
don't you see what he's done?

661
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,200
He's legalized drugs!

662
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,800
Actually, I elected to ignore them.

663
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,400
You lost your fucking mind.
He's lost his fucking mind.

664
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,500
You, in my office. Now!

665
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,100
Okay.

666
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,800
That's it, gentlemen.

667
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,700
- She's a go.
- Showtime, Bubs.

668
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,200
Oh, shit.

669
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,600
- Sister Squeak.
- Bottom-end Bubbles.

670
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,200
Where you been, girl? Been a long time.

671
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,700
T-shirts?

672
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,300
<i>- What the hell kind of money is in T-shirts?</i>
<i>- Girl, you just don't know.</i>

673
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,600
<i>But how's your game?</i>
<i>I heard you was locked up.</i>

674
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,800
<i>Shit, I been on paper for a year.</i>
<i>I got some things going.</i>

675
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,000
<i>- Yeah, I can see that. Looking all good...</i>
- How's he doing?

676
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,600
- Talk a cat off a fish cart.
<i>- All right, Bubs, I gotta get.</i>

677
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,800
I'll see you later on.

678
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,200
Yo, Squeak, Squeak! I about forgot.

679
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,500
I can sell you one of these real cheap,
if you got use for the shit.

680
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,700
I'm fucking dead.

681
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,600
You mean, we're fucking dead.
We're all dead behind this shit.

682
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,500
Jesus Christ.

683
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,800
You know, what I did,
I did knowingly and on my own.

684
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,500
I mean,
my men had nothing to do with this.

685
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,500
They thought
it was part of some elaborate trap.

686
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,300
So if you need me to fall on that sword,
I'm good with that.

687
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,100
You're good with it?

688
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,200
Hey, you know I got my vacation time,
and that's 30 in a couple of months.

689
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,400
So if you need me to fall, I'm ready.

690
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,500
But don't let me hear that you're taking
any punitive action against my people.

691
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,900
Because I can get on the soapbox,
and I can lie as good as the next man...

692
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,400
if I have to.

693
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,800
Are you threatening me?

694
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,900
I believe I am, sir.

695
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,100
My apologies.

696
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,900
Bunny, you cocksucker,
I gotta give it to you! A brilliant idea!

697
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,900
Insane and illegal,
but stone-fucking brilliant, nonetheless.

698
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,500
After all my putting my foot
up people's asses...

699
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,000
to decrease the numbers,
he comes in and in one stroke...

700
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,900
gets a fucking 14% decrease.

701
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,200
Fucking shame it's gonna end our careers,
but <i>still...</i>

702
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,500
Look, y'all probably
tired of hearing from me, <i>but...</i>

703
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,500
I brought these letters...

704
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,200
I brought these letters...

705
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,400
from community associations,
ministers, business people, citizens.

706
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
And they're all positive.

707
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,500
They're all happy
that the dealers are off the corners.

708
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,300
You think that's gonna save our asses,
do you?

709
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:53,100
No, I guess not,
but that and my badge is all I got.

710
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,800
I might have your badge, Major,
but not today.

711
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,600
I don't wanna draw any attention
to this shit...

712
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,100
before we're ready to speak to it.

713
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,900
So if you have any vacation time,
you're taking it now.

714
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,300
Do not report for a shift until notified.

715
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,900
One more thing, sir.

716
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,300
A <i>Sun</i> reporter is aware of my deployment.

717
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,900
I told him an investigation was pending.

718
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,400
He promised to delay the article.

719
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,700
How long?

720
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,700
About a week, tops.

721
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,600
I was with Superstroke on the pool circuit
in the early days...

722
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,400
but mostly it was
pickpocketing and short cons.

723
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,500
I did the long-distance access card heist
before cell phones got popular.

724
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,200
You crypt numbers?

725
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,800
Yeah, I favored the airports, yeah.

726
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,400
- Can you still read numbers?
- Whoa, whoa, what's up with this?

727
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,100
Your man think
I brought him bad merchandise?

728
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,000
'Cause if that what he think,
we can just beat feet right now.

729
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,000
Damn, Bernard, why you acting all CIA
and shit? We trying to make money here.

730
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,500
If you had to answer to the people I do...

731
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,000
your ass would be damn more sight
cautious, too, that's all I'm saying.

732
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:23,000
I appreciate caution,
'cause I'm hanging out here, too.

733
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,700
Give it a go. Use a cell phone.

734
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,500
Marlene, you send that copy off to Paris?
Thank you, darling.

735
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,000
That will work.
I'm at the airport. The shuttle, yes.

736
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,400
3-1-0...

737
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,900
4-4-8-16...

738
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,300
91-7-7-8...

739
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,500
3-1-2.
Now, that last number might be a seven.

740
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,700
I'm not too sure
with these small keypads and all.

741
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,400
We can do business.

742
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,900
That's it. One-two, one-two, one-two.

743
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,200
One-two, that's it. One-two, there you go.

744
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,000
All right, there it is. Now you getting it.
Keep that left hand up.

745
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,800
All right. Watch your balance now.
Don't lean forward.

746
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,000
Don't lean too much.
Don't lean too forward, all right?

747
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,800
All right, let's go.
Don't lean too forward, that's right.

748
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,900
One-two, pivot.

749
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,200
You're kidding. Tell me he's kidding.

750
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,500
You're kidding, right?

751
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,300
- He did it without our knowledge.
- Without your knowledge.

752
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,100
Well, that's worse.
You're the Commissioner.

753
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,100
Was the Commissioner.

754
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,900
You think the buck's gonna stop
in this office, you're wrong.

755
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,500
If I might...

756
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,500
these are letters from people in his district.

757
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,800
Ministers, business people, voters.

758
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,200
All glowing reports.

759
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,700
And there's the 14% reduction in crime
in the Western.

760
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,500
That's not an anomaly. It's hard data.

761
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,400
Now, we can clean it up, make it go away.

762
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,900
The press might already have wind of it,
but we can explain that...

763
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,700
as some sort of a new initiative.

764
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Trap high-end drug dealers.

765
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,700
14%.

766
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,300
If we handle this right,
we might all get out from underneath.

767
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,100
No mud on anybody.

768
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,500
No. No.

769
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,800
I trusted you, Erv, I really did.

770
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,400
You let me down.

771
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,100
Now, this thing goes wrong,
no telling the damage.

772
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,700
On this, you walk point.

773
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,200
That's the way things work, Erv.
You know it as well as I do.

774
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,000
Thank you, Ervin.

775
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I'll be over shortly...

776
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:32,200
to see the detailed plan on
how this shit gets cleaned up immediately.

777
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,800
If you could call this shit
something other than what it <i>is...</i>

778
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,600
Don't even think it.

779
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,700
The way it works is this.

780
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,300
If you don't re-up the minutes
on your cell phone before 60 days...

781
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,500
the wireless company recycles
the phone numbers.

782
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,200
And that's where I get them.

783
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,200
I put the word out on the street
that I'm buying tossed-off burners...

784
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,700
paying $2 a pop.

785
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,700
Street people bring me hundreds.

786
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,300
I bring them in here to my niece,
she jiggles the computer...

787
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,700
juices them up another 200 minutes
on a bogus account.

788
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:25,400
And that automatically extends
the life of the phone for another 60 days.

789
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,300
She charges me $20 on each phone
on her end.

790
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,300
I double it or more on the street
to make mine.

791
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,100
So what you saying?

792
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,900
Baby, a standard Tracfone with 200,
maybe 400 minutes on it...

793
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,900
gonna run you $150, $200 easy.

794
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,300
I charge you an even $100.
You clear $50 on each phone.

795
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,600
That's if you can back them up
with receipts.

796
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,900
I gotta show receipts looking like
they from different places, or I can't play.

797
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,700
Can we accommodate the good man?

798
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,800
Damn, Calvin,
you know I got the bingo tonight.

799
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,300
Look, friend,
I ain't sure you wanna be around here...

800
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,700
and I'm damn sure we're getting
tired of having you. That plain enough?

801
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,200
You should know by now, I don't wanna be
around no bunch of cocksucking faggots.

802
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,700
But I ain't gonna stop coming round
till I run up on Omar.

803
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,400
You might want to get the word out.

804
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,700
For the last time, I don't know him.

805
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,500
Then I'm back tomorrow.

806
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,600
Maybe I can help you?

807
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,800
I don't doubt it for a minute.
