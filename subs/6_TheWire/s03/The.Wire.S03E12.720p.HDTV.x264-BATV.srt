1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,000
- Who's got the scene?
- Massey and Crutchfield are working it.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,000
Norris is on his way to the morgue.
He'll beat the bodies there.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,800
- How about the crime lab?
- Can he get enough oxygen here?

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,900
He's getting the full treatment, boss.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,700
We're good there.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,300
Just one witness so far.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,300
And you know what that means.
Right now, it's all BNBG.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,400
It's Andy Kraw's big adventure.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,300
Mayor's office already called twice,
worried sick about the man.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,800
You're kidding me.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,000
That's a whole lot
of campaign contributions...

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,600
sitting on the back of that ambo.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,900
- So, what's the scene say?
- Two shooters. Shotgun, semi-auto.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,800
One vic is a West Side soldier
with a pretty healthy sheet.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,800
The other is a major player
in Daniels' wiretap case.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,900
So, a hit. Drug related.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,300
But a big-time developer in the middle?
What's the fit?

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,800
Second vic, Russell Bell.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Owner and co-developer of this here.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,100
And other downtown real estate.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,200
Well-propertied man he was.

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,400
But you were aware that Russell Bell was
regarded as a major narcotic violator?

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,600
How do you think he made his money?

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,200
I didn't inquire.

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,600
So, you never got a look
at either of the gunmen?

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,400
I told you, I saw only the one of them.

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,400
He was black, big, I thought...

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,400
with a large weapon.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,500
BNBG.

30
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Big negro, big gun.

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,100
Two more like it upstairs.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,100
Have ballistics rush comparisons.
Drug-relateds for the last six months.

34
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,200
I caught him, Bunk.

35
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,200
On the wire. I caught him.

36
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,700
And he doesn't fucking know it.

37
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,300
Boxing, yeah.

38
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,900
I know you loved that. I hated it.

39
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,800
I hated watching it.

40
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,100
Yeah, I know you did.
So you're doing good, huh?

41
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,000
- Day to day, I am.
- Because I was thinking, <i>maybe...</i>

42
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm proud of you, Dennis. Be well.

43
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Shut that fucking door.

44
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Man, fuck it.

45
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,700
Whatever, I'm ready for this shit.
These niggas is snapping on us.

46
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,300
You see? Do you believe this fucking shit?

47
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,000
Some shit like this would've
never happened <i>with...</i>

48
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,800
Yo, Slim, man. Just say the word.
Say the motherfucking word.

49
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,600
Shit is on.

50
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,600
What's up, B?

51
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
You all right?

52
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,800
We gonna bounce back
on the motherfucker, no question.

53
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,700
- Bounce it back on who?
- Marlo, boss.

54
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
- Oh, he gonna fall.
- Marlo. Marlo ain't got shit to do with it.

55
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Marlo couldn't get String like that.
String died 'cause of some other shit.

56
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,300
What?

57
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,700
He died because of some other shit, nigga.

58
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,900
I couldn't fix it. I tried.

59
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,000
That nigga, String,
was right about this shit, man.

60
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,100
That nigga was right. Fuck Marlo.

61
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Fuck this fucking war.

62
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,400
All this beef over
a couple of fucking corners.

63
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,700
Don't matter who did what to who
at this point.

64
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,300
Fact is, we went to war,
and now there ain't no going back.

65
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,800
I mean, shit, it's what war is, you know?

66
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Once you in it, you in it!

67
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,200
If it's a lie, then we fight on that lie.

68
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,300
But we gotta fight.

69
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,500
Got this out of his pocket.

70
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,100
I got no idea.

71
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,900
- It's a cell chip from a phone.
- Oh.

72
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,700
- What else did you get off him?
- $200 cash, set of keys, license.

73
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,700
President Street address?

74
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,900
I got Landsman banging out
a warrant for the place.

75
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,300
Fuck the politics for a minute.

76
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,200
- What if the man happens to be right?
- Legalizing drugs?

77
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,100
Crime is down in his district and people
on that side of town, they're okay with it.

78
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,800
Look, if you don't exist,
what happens here?

79
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,800
If there's no Tommy Carcetti in this thing,
what's likely to happen?

80
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,000
The Mayor and Burrell,
they shut this thing down.

81
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,200
I figure the Mayor's trying to find a way
to shut it down to make it look like...

82
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,700
it was an enforcement plan
in case it goes public.

83
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,700
Otherwise he'd have moved
to end it already.

84
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Makes sense, but no matter what...

85
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,200
Colvin's little experiment is finished.

86
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,400
Come on, Tommy.

87
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,400
They dealt you a winning hand and
you're acting like you forgot how to play.

88
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,300
Mr. Mayor, call it legalization
and my office can't live with it.

89
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,200
Agreed. No one can.

90
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
But harm reduction?

91
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,200
That could sell, provided there's
a reduction in the crime rate.

92
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,900
Harm reduction. Sounds good.

93
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Steven, what if we were able to suggest...

94
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,000
limiting our street-level enforcement?

95
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,000
We were concentrating our resources
on high-level traffickers.

96
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,100
How would that play?

97
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,800
Well, if I could show off
that kind of casework, yeah, maybe.

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,800
But they've been doing street rips for so
long now, I don't think a high-level exists.

99
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,700
What if we were able to say
that no major traffickers were allowed...

100
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,900
in the free zone, that all <i>major...</i>

101
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,500
That the major violators were
still being targeted, huh?

102
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,900
Well, are you suggesting some kind
of admissions criteria for the zones?

103
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,800
- How would that work?
- I don't know that it would.

104
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,400
I'm just saying that for the sake
of public perception, huh?

105
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,700
Come on, people,
work with me on this thing!

106
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,600
<i>Fucked up, ain't it?</i>

107
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,200
<i>Marlo need to get his ass dropped,</i>
<i>him and all his crew.</i>

108
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,800
<i>- Oh, they gonna fall, son. You'll see.</i>
<i>- All right, let me know.</i>

109
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,700
That's the word on the wire anyway.

110
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,600
Every mention puts it
on Marlo Stanfield's crew...

111
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,200
which means the war's gonna ratchet up,
no question.

112
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Where's Jimmy?

113
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,700
He went with Bunk Moreland to rifle
Stringer's spot downtown.

114
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,900
- How'd he take it?
- Like Stringer was kin.

115
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,500
- Yeah?
<i>- Bushy top.</i>

116
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,500
<i>- Need to pull on your coat, boy.</i>
- Hey, what's up, Major?

117
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,000
<i>I got something for you all.</i>

118
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,300
<i>Mount Vernon Square in about an hour.</i>

119
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,500
I'm there.

120
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,600
This is Stringer's?

121
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,300
Yeah.

122
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Who in fuck was I chasing?

123
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,200
What's done is done.

124
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,500
Gay-ass gangsters. Please.

125
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,400
I took it for as long as I could.

126
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,800
Let's go, man.

127
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Let's go.

128
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,800
It being your town,
I trust you to do it proper.

129
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,500
- You off today, boss?
- Every day at this point.

130
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,800
I told them over at COMSTAT
about my little experiment.

131
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,500
Bosses went crazy, huh?

132
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,800
Anyway, that's why I called you.

133
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,300
That there is a wartime lay-up
for your man Barksdale.

134
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,700
My sources tell me the man's there
most of the time with a lot of muscle.

135
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,400
Sawed-offs, semi-autos, MAC-11s.

136
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Whole lot of good shit if you hit it right.

137
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,400
- That's a hell of a tip.
- Shit.

138
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,700
That right there might be the last bit
of police work in a long and storied career.

139
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
All right, I'll talk to you, bushy top.

140
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,900
Which one is Ali?

141
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,800
In the white trunks, boy.

142
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,700
- Damn, he look young.
- He was. This the Patterson fight right here!

143
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,900
- Old school.
- Who Patterson? He soft.

144
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,700
- Ali whipping his ass.
- He was a champ, too.

145
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,200
Look, any man still standing at the end
of a round, you can't call him soft.

146
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,500
That's a rule, all right?

147
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,800
From Stringer's place downtown.

148
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
B&B shit, college papers, real estate stuff.

149
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,700
There's no phone extension in the place,
just these.

150
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,400
Cell phone chips. About 100 of them.

151
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,600
So that's why he wasn't taking any phones
from our man, Bernard, huh?

152
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,800
Stringer had his own phone...

153
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,000
he just changed the number
every time he changed the chip.

154
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,600
Shamrock, too, probably,
with whatever phone he used to call Bell.

155
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,000
Cautious man.

156
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,100
- Yes and no.
- Have a look in here.

157
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
All different manufacturers.

158
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Thank you.

159
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,300
Before Stringer Bell got aced...

160
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,100
he went out of his way to put in
his good friend, Avon Barksdale.

161
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
That's a Barksdale safe house.

162
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,200
Where'd you get this?

163
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,900
Colvin.

164
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
- Calls to the Western.
- Where's Daniels?

165
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,400
He's got this thing downtown.
It's for his wife.

166
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,700
You should raise him.

167
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,300
It's not enough to make up for Stringer.

168
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,100
It'll do for now.

169
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,800
<i>Because the neighborhoods</i>
<i>and the residents in this district...</i>

170
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,100
<i>are among the poorest in our city.</i>

171
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,800
<i>And it is these residents</i>
<i>who most need a strong voice at City Hall.</i>

172
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
<i>Time has come for a change.</i>

173
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,100
<i>And I believe</i>
<i>I can bring about that change...</i>

174
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,400
<i>by providing a strong voice</i>
<i>for the new 11th District...</i>

175
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,700
<i>if you will do me the honor...</i>

176
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,900
It's kind of cool, the Lieutenant's wife
running for office, you know.

177
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,600
<i>Well, as you just heard...</i>

178
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,400
<i>West Baltimore City Councilwoman</i>
<i>Eunetta Perkins...</i>

179
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,000
<i>is going to have her hands full</i>
<i>in next September's Democratic primary.</i>

180
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,200
Stringer Bell. Damn.

181
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,700
Who could've gotten to him?
I mean, if it wasn't you all on it.

182
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
You know Avon's gonna put it
on you, right?

183
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Shit, let him take it on my jacket.
Don't make me no never mind.

184
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm thinking it might be what you call
one of them good problems.

185
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,100
Yeah.

186
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,500
I heard Colvin's in deep shit downtown.

187
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,700
Looking at this right here...

188
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,600
he might not be the only one.

189
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
Anything comes up, I'm on the radio.

190
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,900
My man, my man, my man.

191
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,800
Yo, you think I could get like $5?
I need like $5 to get on the bus.

192
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,400
- I look like a tourist to you?
- Man, I swear to God.

193
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,000
Looking like that,
walking into an open-air drug market...

194
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,200
why the hell would I think you'll spend
my $5 on bus fare?

195
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,700
Shit, because I already got my blast, man.

196
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,500
All night, you been drinking
like your ass is candy.

197
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,100
That's shameful shit.

198
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Twelve-gauge pumpkin balls.

199
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,100
Last time I saw that kind of load was
the Pimlico double.

200
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,600
And I fucking know that motherfucker was
in the middle of that mess.

201
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,400
And if I remember your boy,
he had no love for the Barksdale people.

202
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Execution style,
that don't play like Omar Little.

203
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,600
Besides, the word on our wire is
that Marlo's people did Stringer.

204
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,700
- Marlo Stanfield?
- The heir apparent.

205
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,800
This city's going to hell, man.

206
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We're gonna push past 300 murders
before New Year's.

207
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,300
Shit is fucked.

208
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,200
Hey, Cheryl.

209
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,600
No? My guess is she's picking up
a prisoner.

210
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,800
Yeah, I spoke to her about 10 minutes ago.

211
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,600
Yeah, well, they don't <i>allow...</i>
They make you check your stuff.

212
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,100
Cell phone, money, weapon.

213
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,100
Well, she'll call when she gets the message.

214
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
Not at all.

215
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,400
I need more, Jimmy.

216
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,500
More!

217
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,400
- Motherfucker.
- I'm tired, Bunk.

218
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,400
Let's go.

219
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
I heard the vanguard met.

220
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,700
Heard they voted to have
a civilian review board look at it.

221
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,600
It wasn't unanimous, and there were
people there speaking for you.

222
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,100
I heard that, too.

223
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,900
So six out of 10 black officers think
I'm just an asshole racist.

224
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,000
On the other hand,
four out of 10 think you're just an asshole.

225
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,500
It's an administrative charge.

226
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,900
You can fight it and win if you want.

227
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,900
Failure to properly identify myself
as a police officer.

228
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,400
Sounds like what I was guilty of
most of my career, actually.

229
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm not sure I was supposed to be a police.

230
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,900
Not really.

231
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,000
What were you supposed to be, huh?

232
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,100
This is from Major Colvin's CI?
What's the corroboration?

233
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,100
Well, the source knew that Barksdale had
a waterfront condo in his own name.

234
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,800
Gave the accurate location and title info
down to deed of transfer.

235
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Well, that's good, but it puts him
on the legitimate side of things.

236
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
What corroboration is there
for illegal activities?

237
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,100
Sorry I'm late. I had to stop in at a friend.

238
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
The source knew that Barksdale was shot
last month, wounded in the shoulder.

239
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
- Emergency room?
- No, no hospital reports.

240
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,400
We're gonna need better.

241
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,800
Either Colvin goes back to the CI,
or we sit on this address for a while.

242
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,600
- See what we can see.
- Well, fuck it then.

243
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,800
Let's name the source.
Put him right in the affidavit.

244
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,000
- It's Colvin's call, isn't it?
- It's Stringer Bell.

245
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Lester figured it out from the DNRs.

246
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,500
Bell was snitching out Barksdale.

247
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,500
- You're sure of this?
- Maybe that explains the murder.

248
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,700
What's in the wire?

249
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,100
Loose talk about how it was
Marlo's people, but nothing past rumor.

250
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
You know, with Bell gone...

251
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Barksdale might have to come down
a notch to oversee the day-to-day...

252
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,900
and maybe that puts him in contact
with some of our monitored cell phones.

253
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,600
If he's as cautious as Stringer, maybe not.

254
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,200
My guess is Barksdale never touches
a cell phone.

255
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,600
Safe house might be our best shot.

256
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,200
All right.

257
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We stay on the wires
until this batch of burners...

258
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
goes dead, hoping we have Barksdale.

259
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,700
But meanwhile, we get a warrant
for that safe house and wait on him there.

260
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,700
Thanks for the cover last night.

261
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,200
This is Greggs, Major Case Unit.
Who's the shift leader?

262
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,700
Holy Christ.

263
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,900
<i>- They're all over it, Commissioner.</i>
- Right.

264
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,600
That was Foxtrot.
The cameras have found our little shit pile.

265
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,800
Finally, your fucking councilman took
his sweet time, didn't he?

266
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,700
Everyone's a critic.

267
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,600
If this doesn't go,
what line of work are you gonna try next?

268
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
We're here in West <i>Baltimore...</i>

269
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,700
<i>For more than a month,</i>
<i>police from Baltimore's Western district...</i>

270
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,400
<i>It's just an outrageous development.</i>

271
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,900
<i>It's something I never thought I'd see</i>
<i>from this or any other administration.</i>

272
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
<i>Frankly, this is one of the reasons we need</i>
<i>a change in leadership in this city.</i>

273
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Did the Mayor know?
What about the Police Commissioner?

274
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,700
These are questions
for the Mayor and the Police Commissioner.

275
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,600
On central issues
of crime and safety...

276
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,400
<i>the Royce administration is</i>
<i>simply bankrupt.</i>

277
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,200
You still gonna announce
for mayor next month?

278
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,700
I was gonna wait,
but standing here today looking at this...

279
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,700
<i>I can't see how I can do anything else</i>
<i>but put it out there right now.</i>

280
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,200
<i>All I can tell you is</i>
<i>that for more than four weeks now...</i>

281
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,200
<i>the Baltimore Police Department</i>
<i>surrendered portions...</i>

282
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,500
<i>of the police district to the drug trade,</i>
<i>and the Council was not informed.</i>

283
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,700
Fuck me.

284
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,200
I fucking had this story all
to myself a week ago.

285
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,300
<i>Police officers for weeks have turned</i>
<i>a blind eye...</i>

286
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,600
What the fuck was I thinking?

287
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,300
<i>... apparently sanctioning</i>
<i>open-air drug markets.</i>

288
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,900
- Excuse us.
<i>- While uniformed police stood by...</i>

289
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,600
<i>... in the so-called free zones,</i>
<i>drug dealers routinely ply their trade.</i>

290
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Mr. Mayor, Commissioner Burrell is here.

291
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,700
Tell the Commissioner
the Mayor will be with him shortly.

292
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,200
<i>... and young children run the streets alone.</i>

293
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,300
<i>The inhabitants of what has come</i>
<i>to be known as Hamsterdam...</i>

294
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
<i>had little to say for the camera.</i>

295
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,800
<i>But Channel 5 has learned</i>
<i>that the police were...</i>

296
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,900
- Yeah?
<i>- What are you seeing?</i>

297
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Couple of people in and out.
No sign of Barksdale, though.

298
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,300
<i>- It's quiet here, too.</i>
- Okay.

299
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,700
Need to look at the back.

300
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,000
Our friend Carcetti's gonna run wild
with this.

301
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,700
And from the sound of things,
Gray is gonna run with him.

302
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,800
Tony Gray thinks he's gonna get my chair
behind this bullshit.

303
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,900
We're throwing you out of the boat, Ervin.
This shit is on you alone.

304
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,300
Not necessarily.

305
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,100
Not if I talk about how we were
under pressure to keep the crime down.

306
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,700
- To juke the stats district by district.
- We never said that.

307
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,800
About how Colvin, under pressure,
lost his way.

308
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,600
- About how I came to you weeks ago...
- Days ago.

309
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,900
Weeks ago to tell you what he had done
and to assure you that...

310
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,300
we were on top of the situation,
that Colvin would be relieved...

311
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,900
and his plan aborted.

312
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,700
You lying motherfucker.

313
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,800
But you heard about the drop
in Colvin's felony rate...

314
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,800
and you sent me packing.

315
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,900
Brought in your liberal-ass do-gooders
to seriously consider this horseshit...

316
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,500
while Colvin's mistake grew and grew.

317
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
My hands were tied, Mr. Mayor.

318
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,200
My department thwarted.

319
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,300
I was a prisoner
of the goddamn politicians.

320
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,000
Or...

321
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,400
I leave your office right now
willing to say a lot less than that.

322
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,700
I put what I can on crazy-ass Bunny Colvin.

323
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,600
And I take the hit.

324
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,400
And if Carcetti or Gray holds hearings...

325
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,500
I'm the wall between them and you.

326
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,600
In which case...

327
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,100
I am your commissioner
for the full five-year term.

328
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,800
- Unit one to unit two.
- Unit two standing by.

329
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,200
Deal's made.

330
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,300
Unit two to sector three,
move on the Winchester Homes.

331
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,100
<i>Ten-four. We're moving.</i>

332
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,600
Unit two to sector two,
move on the Koppers Plant.

333
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,000
<i>Roger that.</i>

334
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Over the top, gentlemen.

335
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,900
About fucking time.

336
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,700
Yo, man.

337
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
We gonna run out if we don't got no re-up.

338
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,300
- Where's Tuckie at?
- I don't know.

339
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,900
- Yo, where Tuckie at, man?
- He rolled out.

340
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,900
- What?
- He said the police coming.

341
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,500
Here they come. Let's roll.

342
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,200
Hold it right there, white jacket!

343
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
Get the fuck off me!

344
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Stop!

345
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,100
Stop right there! Stop!

346
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,400
Freeze! Freeze! Don't move!
Hold it right there. Freeze.

347
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,400
<i>Outstanding, red team, outstanding.</i>
<i>Give you a case of beer for that one.</i>

348
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,300
Son, this nigga, Stringer Bell, man,
was begging Chris, yo, for real.

349
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,600
Like, know what I mean?

350
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,100
Digging in his pockets, talking about
how much cheese he gonna give us...

351
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,100
I mean, if we just let him walk.

352
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,300
My man, Chris, hollering,
"Man, bitch, you gonna die."

353
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,000
This nigga just dropped to his fucking
knees like a little cocksucker, man.

354
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,400
Start crying.
That shit was worse than fucking pathetic.

355
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,500
Start crying.
That shit was worse than fucking pathetic.

356
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,900
- Yo, that's Marlo.
- Get on your burner, man.

357
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,100
<i>- Got a line on him.</i>
<i>- The number one? Where at?</i>

358
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,500
<i>Tall man says to tell you all to soldier up.</i>
<i>They up at the rim shop.</i>

359
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,500
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

360
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,100
Boss, you okay?

361
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,500
- What you want?
- Slim said they got their eye on Marlo.

362
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,800
I'm just saying, you know, all the boys,
they all waiting on you.

363
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,100
Go ahead, man. I'm behind you.

364
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,200
What else you need from us, Deputy?

365
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,400
City Hall wants the bulldozers
through here at dawn...

366
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,400
and then fencing all around the site.

367
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,000
Winchester Homes
and the Koppers Plant as well.

368
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,600
We got it.

369
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,500
Come tomorrow, the television reporters
get nothing they can stand in front of.

370
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,400
Excuse me, Deputy, sir, we found a body.

371
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,900
- Any trauma?
- Can't tell for sure with all the rat bites.

372
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,100
Take him to the OCME in a jail wagon.

373
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't want the fucking reporters seeing
any ambos.

374
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,400
Shit!

375
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
He just landed.

376
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,000
<i>Him plus one.</i>

377
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,500
- Got it. Sit tight.
- That makes how many?

378
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,300
Including Barksdale, Sydnor counted
10 in and none coming out...

379
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,800
so that's 10 at least.

380
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,000
- 2301 to KGA.
<i>- Go ahead, 2301.</i>

381
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,500
We need QRT to meet us at our 20
for a search and seizure.

382
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,100
Location has multiple suspects
and may contain automatic weapons.

383
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,600
<i>Ten-four.</i>

384
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,800
- Word travels fast, huh?
- Shit.

385
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,800
Burrell called Johns Hopkins personally
this morning.

386
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,300
Dragged your name into the gutter.
Johns Hopkins doesn't need the notoriety.

387
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,600
The chief academic officer
of a major research university...

388
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,300
doesn't want to hear that some new hire
makes up the rules as he goes along.

389
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,400
- Yeah, Colvin.
<i>- Yeah, Major, you're on first.</i>

390
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,500
COMSTAT tomorrow.

391
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,200
I'm up.

392
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,100
- You all taking the door?
- Where's tactical?

393
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,600
- I called for QRT.
- You ain't heard?

394
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,800
They're a little busy tonight tearing down
Bunny Colvin's fuck-up.

395
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,700
With all that going on,
you're lucky you even got us, man.

396
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
- Who we hitting on this?
- Avon Barksdale and crew.

397
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,200
I fucking told you he was out.
Didn't I fucking tell you?

398
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,600
I fucking told her.

399
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,400
<i>For more than four weeks now,</i>
<i>the Baltimore Police Department...</i>

400
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,000
<i>surrendered portions of the police district</i>
<i>to the drug trade.</i>

401
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,100
By tomorrow, the story goes national,
and Washington reacts.

402
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,300
Save the best questions for Tony Gray.

403
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,600
He needs to shine even more than you.

404
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,200
- I can't believe he wants us to knock.
- Well, you can't flush guns now, can you?

405
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,900
Well, fuck that.
What about if they open up on us?

406
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,100
These guys are at war with another crew.

407
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,000
We go charging in there,
chances are we will get lit up.

408
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,000
Yo, B.

409
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,100
Sham saying that Charles saying
they still up at the rim shop.

410
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Marlo, his boy Chris and Vinson,
they still eating.

411
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,800
But the rest of the muscle, they rolled out.

412
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,400
No.

413
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,000
- Not the police.
- Narco's out back, too.

414
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,300
Shit.

415
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,900
Let us in! We know you're in there.

416
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Shit.

417
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,800
- Open the door, you fucking cocksuckers!
- Fucked up, man.

418
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,700
You all ask me, you all ugly ass niggas
shouldn't be in here fucking around...

419
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,500
with all these guns and shit,
you know what I'm talking about?

420
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,200
Open it.

421
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,900
Come on, Avon. Enough with this shit.
Open the fucking door.

422
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,500
Open the fucking door, you cocksuckers!

423
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,200
- Police!
- Police! Police!

424
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,000
- On the floor!
- Search warrant!

425
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,700
- I'm clean, man.
- Get down!

426
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,700
- Lace them shits tight.
- Greggs, I'm opening up.

427
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,300
That'd be mine. In fact, all that's mine.

428
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,000
You got a law degree?

429
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,400
Take him.

430
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,400
You fall on the parole violation.
No matter whatever else happens...

431
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,800
you do every day of what's left
of your seven without seeing a jury.

432
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,700
Maybe even conspiracy to murder.

433
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,800
We take this federal,
see if we can't get you 10 to life.

434
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,500
- No parole.
- Whatever.

435
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,400
Shit, you only do two days no how.
That's the day you go in...

436
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,300
And the day you come out.

437
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,400
Yeah, well, here's the warrant.

438
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,000
You read it slow.

439
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,500
In between them two days,
give you something to think on.

440
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,800
Damn. Missed our shot.

441
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,900
Roll, man.

442
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,900
You bend over for us or, I swear to God,
I will spend what's left of my career...

443
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,200
shitting on every last supervisor
in your district.

444
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,100
From shift commanders down
to sector sergeants, not one of them...

445
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,800
will have any rank at all
if we hear so much as a bark out of you.

446
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,600
Look, my people saw this
as a tactical deployment only!

447
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,500
- The responsibility is mine alone!
- Well, you won't fall alone...

448
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,700
unless you're willing
to fall exactly as we want you to.

449
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,700
After COMSTAT, you go
to retirement services and drop papers.

450
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,100
Going out at a lieutenant's grade.
That's right, you're busted back.

451
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,700
We can't take your EOD away,
but you're not going out on a major's pay.

452
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,300
I can retire with my 30 right now
before you bust me!

453
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,000
- I got vacation time enough to make my 30!
- Fuck your vacation time.

454
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,400
You're out today, at the lower grade!

455
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,700
That's against the goddamn contract!

456
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,000
What part of "bend over"
didn't you understand?

457
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,600
- Avon locked up?
- With most of his muscle, yeah.

458
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,200
Good day to get back out on them corners,
ain't it?

459
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,500
- Make some money.
- You bet.

460
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,600
It's not just the $17 million
in federal funding...

461
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,100
for Baltimore Law Enforcement
that you've jeopardized.

462
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,100
Take off another $200 million
of federal money in your operating budget.

463
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,700
Another $75 in capital expenditures...

464
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,600
plus untold millions in pass-through
federal dollars from Annapolis.

465
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,300
All told, we're talking about...

466
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,500
half a billion a year
that Baltimore will be doing without.

467
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,300
Furthermore, the US attorney here
will use all the resources...

468
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,500
of the Justice Department to interdict
and destroy any attempt...

469
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,300
to establish a geographic entity
where drugs are legal.

470
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,700
Washington should know...

471
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,400
that what happened in West Baltimore
in no way reflects...

472
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
the policies of my administration.

473
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,600
That was an aberration, Mr. Thomas,
the work of one misguided police official.

474
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,900
We understand your concerns,
but, you know...

475
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,300
for the Deputy Drug Czar to take
the time out to drive 30 miles north...

476
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,600
to deliver that message, hardly necessary.

477
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,100
Rest assured.

478
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,000
What up, G? Where the older ones at?

479
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,200
Marlo got his package back out.

480
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,700
Fire Burrell. This nonsense began
in his shop without him knowing it!

481
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,600
- Fire the man and move on.
- Odell.

482
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,400
I respect your opinion, but right now...

483
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,400
Tony Gray, Carcetti maneuvering,
now is not the time.

484
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,800
No. We get past the primary,
then I'll drive a stake in his heart.

485
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,900
But right now I need him where he is,
if for no other reason than to...

486
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
well, to take the hit for this thing right here,
but I tell you what I'm gonna do, though.

487
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,600
I'm gonna shine on that new girl you like
in the 11th.

488
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,700
Yeah.

489
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,700
Give her a spot on the ticket.
Cut Eunetta loose. Eunetta's had her day.

490
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,700
I respect the fact
that you stood by me, Odell.

491
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,500
I respect loyalty.

492
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,900
<i>... and did so without properly informing</i>
<i>his superior officers...</i>

493
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,700
<i>and without regard to the criminal statutes</i>
<i>he was sworn to enforce...</i>

494
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,100
<i>thereby disgracing himself</i>
<i>and his command.</i>

495
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,200
Is any of that subject to any contradiction...

496
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,400
or argument whatsoever, Major Colvin?

497
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,900
<i>- No, sir.</i>
<i>- No argument at all, Bunny?</i>

498
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,200
<i>Not much you can say, is there?</i>
<i>Not to real police.</i>

499
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,100
<i>- Get on with it, motherfuck...</i>
<i>- Excuse me, Major?</i>

500
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,300
Is the admin-lieutenant present?

501
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,000
Major Colvin is relieved of duty.

502
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,500
You are now the acting commander
of the Western District.

503
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,600
Damn, Bernard,
didn't I tell you about these guys?

504
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,200
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hey, Freamon.

505
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,600
- Who's that, Crutchfield?
- No, Norris. Sleeping on a stakeout.

506
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,700
Yeah, that's everyone we heard on the wire.

507
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,700
Yeah, that's everyone we heard on the wire.

508
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,800
McNulty's over there in Number One
with Pearlman. Why don't you say "Hey"?

509
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,900
All right.

510
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,700
You got to be the stupidest motherfucker
that I've ever gone out with.

511
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
I can't wait to go to jail.

512
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,700
What? What'd you say?
What the fuck did you say, Bernard?

513
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,500
Hey, Donald.

514
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
You heard the tapes.

515
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,300
Look, he came to me and said we could sell
drugs if we move down to Vincent Street.

516
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,500
And that's where I moved my crew.

517
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,800
And you know I did. Because you
the one that popped me with the G-pack...

518
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,400
on my way to the spot
and let me go, remember?

519
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,100
You were selling drugs
in Major Colvin's free zone?

520
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,600
- You can prove that?
- Ask him. He know.

521
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,800
You know, <i>this...</i> This must be
one of them contrapment things.

522
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,900
- You mean entrapment?
- Kid's got a point.

523
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,300
Nineteen in bracelets
from Barksdale on down...

524
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,900
another eight wanted on warrants.

525
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,000
Any way you can tie your case
to this mess with Colvin?

526
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,800
Make it like what he was doing
led to your thing?

527
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,100
I don't see it.

528
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,700
Well, it's good work nonetheless,
Major Daniels.

529
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,600
Call came in from the Mayor's office
half-hour ago approving your promotion.

530
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,900
And now with Colvin,
there's a new vacancy.

531
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,700
- What about my wife?
- What about her?

532
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,600
The Mayor. Eunetta's seat.

533
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,700
- Why would the Mayor...
- Good police work maybe.

534
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,700
Not everything is politics.

535
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,600
- Hey, I'll take two. Western alumni.
- All right, you got it.

536
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,900
Major.

537
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,100
I heard.

538
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,700
How's your family take it?

539
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,400
Lolita done dropped herself 30 pounds
and got herself a real estate license, so...

540
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,100
I guess she's fixing to leave me.

541
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,400
I just wanted you to know that
last tip you gave me was a winner.

542
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,300
Yeah, I heard. That's good work.

543
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,800
Also, I don't know if you know...

544
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,800
Stringer Bell was shot to death
two days ago.

545
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,000
So, anyway, I put his name on the paper
to tighten the PC.

546
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,000
I figured, what the fuck.
Once he's aced, right?

547
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,200
You always did cut them corners,
didn't you?

548
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,600
Seems like you cut a few yourself, Major.

549
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,500
- However it ends, you're good police.
- Look, I just did what I did.

550
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,300
It felt right.

551
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm fine with that.

552
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,100
Tony, where's my vest, man?

553
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,500
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

554
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,800
I don't understand.

555
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,100
Drink your wine.

556
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,700
You and me in public.

557
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,700
- But your wife...
- She wins without me.

558
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,400
- On the Mayor's ticket, she wins.
- And you make major?

559
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,100
I think she was waiting for this day
more than I ever was.

560
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,800
And now she's not here.

561
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,200
No. She's not.

562
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,400
From out of nowhere, huh?

563
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,100
Nowhere is right.

564
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,100
Why me?

565
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,700
I guess you don't live right.

566
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,300
- Kari, what was that?
- Nothing.

567
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,000
- What broke?
- Nothing, Mama.

568
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,700
- <i>So...</i>
- Yeah.

569
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,200
- You just drive over here.
- I did.

570
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,900
Why tonight? What happened?

571
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,800
I was in my old district tonight...

572
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,200
which is where I used to feel pretty good,
I think.

573
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,000
I wasn't so angry when I was there anyway.

574
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,700
I don't know, someone said something,
I guess, <i>and...</i>

575
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,200
That doesn't make sense.

576
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,600
- I guess I finished something today.
- A case?

577
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,800
More than that.

578
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,800
It's like everything I poured into a glass
came out the bottom.

579
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,200
And I just kept on pouring,
like the thing had a hole in it, you know?

580
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,500
The things that make me right for this job...

581
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,900
maybe they're the same things
that make me wrong for everything else.

582
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,000
Do you want to come inside for a drink?

583
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,200
Not tonight.

584
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,900
But if it's not too late,
I wouldn't mind meeting your kids.

585
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,000
<i>Major Colvin misled his officers.</i>

586
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,900
<i>They thought that his initiative was</i>
<i>a tactical deployment...</i>

587
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,400
<i>to entrap narcotics traffickers.</i>

588
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,800
<i>There was no mention whatsoever...</i>

589
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,600
<i>of the initiative to any superior officer.</i>

590
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,500
<i>And for five weeks...</i>

591
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,600
<i>all evidence of what he was doing managed</i>
<i>to elude the entire command staff?</i>

592
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,100
<i>Are you kidding, Commissioner?</i>

593
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,900
<i>I take full responsibility, and indeed...</i>

594
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,600
<i>after I first learned of the matter,</i>
<i>I informed the Mayor...</i>

595
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,700
<i>and together we moved immediately...</i>

596
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,800
<i>to relieve Major Colvin of his command.</i>

597
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,200
<i>I'm under the impression that...</i>

598
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,600
<i>this administration gave</i>
<i>serious consideration...</i>

599
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,000
<i>- to proceeding with Colvin's initiative.</i>
<i>- No, sir.</i>

600
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,000
<i>Major Colvin informed you of his effort</i>
<i>at a COMSTAT meeting...</i>

601
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,200
<i>more than a week ago.</i>

602
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,500
<i>His free zones stayed up</i>
<i>for six days after that.</i>

603
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,100
<i>That's my responsibility, Councilman.</i>

604
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,400
<i>We needed the time to conclude</i>
<i>an ongoing investigation...</i>

605
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,700
<i>by the Major Crimes Unit...</i>

606
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,600
<i>a wiretap case that would have been</i>
<i>disrupted had we moved immediately.</i>

607
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,800
<i>Correct, Mayor Royce was aware</i>
<i>of the pending case...</i>

608
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,100
<i>and allowed us to delay</i>
<i>our response accordingly.</i>

609
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,400
<i>But the Mayor was unequivocal...</i>

610
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,500
<i>in his opposition to what Major Colvin did.</i>

611
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,200
<i>What we have here, I'm afraid,</i>
<i>is nothing more complicated...</i>

612
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,100
<i>than a solitary police commander who</i>
<i>under great pressure proved to be amoral...</i>

613
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,000
<i>incompetent, and unfit for command.</i>

614
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,800
<i>No. It's about more than that.</i>

615
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,300
<i>This is more important than who knew</i>
<i>what when, or who falls on his sword or...</i>

616
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,300
<i>whether someone can use this disaster</i>
<i>to make a political point or two.</i>

617
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,700
<i>- Mr. Chairman...</i>
<i>- We can forgive Major Colvin...</i>

618
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,000
<i>who, out of his frustration and despair...</i>

619
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,500
<i>found himself condoning something</i>
<i>which can't possibly be condoned.</i>

620
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,300
<i>We can do that much.</i>

621
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,200
<i>But, gentlemen, what we can't forgive...</i>

622
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,200
<i>what I can't forgive ever is how we...</i>

623
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,800
<i>you, me, this administration, all of us...</i>

624
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,100
<i>how we turned away</i>
<i>from those streets in West Baltimore...</i>

625
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,700
<i>the poor, the sick, the swollen underclass</i>
<i>of our city trapped...</i>

626
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,700
<i>in the wreckage of neighborhoods</i>
<i>which were once so prized...</i>

627
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,500
<i>communities which we've failed</i>
<i>to defend...</i>

628
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,300
<i>which we have surrendered to the horrors</i>
<i>of the drug trade...</i>

629
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,600
<i>and if this disaster demands anything of us</i>
<i>as a city...</i>

630
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,500
<i>it demands that we say "Enough."</i>

631
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,600
<i>Enough to the despair which makes</i>
<i>policemen even think about surrender.</i>

632
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,200
<i>Enough to the fact that</i>
<i>these neighborhoods are not saved...</i>

633
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,700
<i>or are beyond the saving.</i>

634
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,900
<i>Enough to this administration's</i>
<i>indecisiveness and lethargy...</i>

635
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,900
<i>to the garbage which goes uncollected, the</i>
<i>lots and row houses which stay vacant...</i>

636
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
<i>the addicts who go untreated...</i>

637
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,900
<i>the working men and women who every day</i>
<i>are denied a chance at economic freedom.</i>

638
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,600
<i>Enough to the crime</i>
<i>which every day chokes...</i>

639
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,800
<i>more and more of the life from our city.</i>

640
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:43,500
<i>And the thing of it is, if we don't</i>
<i>take responsibility and step up...</i>

641
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,300
<i>not just for the mistakes and the miscues...</i>

642
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,200
<i>but for whether or not we're gonna win</i>
<i>this battle for our streets...</i>

643
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,600
<i>if that doesn't happen...</i>

644
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,300
<i>we're gonna lose these neighborhoods</i>
<i>and ultimately this city forever.</i>

645
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,800
<i>If we don't have the courage</i>
<i>and the conviction...</i>

646
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,800
<i>to fight this war the way</i>
<i>it should be fought...</i>

647
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,900
<i>the way it needs to be fought, using every</i>
<i>weapon that we can possibly muster...</i>

648
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,800
<i>if that doesn't happen...</i>

649
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,200
<i>well, then we're staring at defeat.</i>

650
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,800
<i>And that defeat should not and cannot</i>
<i>and will not be forgiven.</i>

651
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It was a good case, I'm not denying that.

652
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
But I need to trust my people.

653
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,300
Unless you can give your word,
there's no way that I can...

654
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,900
That's more than fair. Thanks.

655
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,800
But it's better for me if I do something else.

656
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,800
Detective.

657
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,400
It's not you, it's me.

658
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,000
- But where...
- The Western, I think.

659
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,400
Yeah, the Western feels like home.

660
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,800
- You showed something today.
- Just felt like it needed to be said.

661
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,200
Sounds like you're running for something.

662
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,900
Eunetta. Been a while.

663
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,600
Thought you all was in training.

664
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,800
So what time you want us
to be there tomorrow, Coach?

665
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,900
3:30 would be good.

666
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,200
- Hope to see you all then.
- All right.

667
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,300
What the fuck you all standing around for?
Man, get to work.

668
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,700
<i>... to the false promise that our schools are</i>
<i>providing a future for our children.</i>

669
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,500
That's it. That's it.

670
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,600
Yeah.

671
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,900
In the cases of Malik Carr, a.k.a. "Poot"...

672
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,900
Herbert DeRodd Johnson, a.k. A "Puddin',"
Arthur <i>Carroll...</i>

673
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,200
What do you see right here?

674
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,400
It's bulk metal, 10 cent a pound.

675
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,900
Here.

676
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,400
- Aluminum.
- Right you are.

677
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,500
Thirty cent a pound. No problem.

678
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,800
You see, in these modern times...

679
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,100
a man got to keep one eye on the ground,
pick up what he find, feel me?

680
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,800
Well, there's money to be made
if you know where to look.

681
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,500
I hope you listening
'cause I'm trying to school you here.

682
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:28,600
Yeah, you don't want to know.
You think you're brown, but you still green.

683
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,500
How you doing?

684
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,100
That's something, huh?

685
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,500
Looks like they just took a big eraser
and rubbed across it.

686
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,000
Yeah.

687
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,100
Yeah, but before
a dope fiend come down here...

688
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,700
cop a little something,
ain't nary a soul hassle him.

689
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,800
Hoppers and police, they just let him be.

690
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,900
Was a good thing, huh?

691
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,000
I'm just saying.

692
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,900
You probably don't know,
but it's rough out there, baby.

693
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,300
Cops be back banging on you,
hoppers be messing with you.

694
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,800
Yeah, thank you.

695
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,700
Shit.

696
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,500
That's a dollar here. That's a seed.

697
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,400
Come on, boy.
