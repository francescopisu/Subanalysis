1
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,700
That's far enough.
Drop your laundry and turn slowly.

2
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
So you gonna rob me now?
I need to remind you who I am?

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,700
Omar, isn't it?

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,800
Pull it slowly. Then toss it.

5
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,600
Oh, I will move slow.

6
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,800
I ain't tossing nothing, Bow Tie.

7
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,400
So whatever you gonna do, you might
as well go ahead and make it quick.

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,000
- I knew you'd come back.
- I trust you didn't lose sleep over it.

9
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,300
Worrying about you would be like
wondering if the sun gonna come up.

10
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,500
I ain't about to wild out over it.

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,900
- What I want to know is how you found me.
- Your boy, he didn't give you up easy.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,600
Ain't no sugar-water
run through them veins.

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,100
- You kill him?
- He's resting.

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,500
- I see you favor a .45.
- Tonight I do.

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,800
And I keeps one in the chamber,
in case you pondering.

16
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,700
Nice showpiece you got there.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,400
Walther PPK .380, double action.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,400
- Hear them Walthers like to jump some.
- As will you, with one in your elbow.

19
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,400
That gun ain't got enough firepower
to make my joint useless.

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,900
It definitely won't stop me
from emptying out half my mag.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,200
- You might not hit me.
- This range? And this caliber?

22
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,200
- Even if I miss, I can't miss.
- I admire a man with confidence.

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't see no sweat
on your brow neither, bro.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,800
- I suppose we could stand here all night.
- Suppose we could.

25
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,800
Or settle this once and forever.

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,700
I want to ask you something, brother.

27
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,000
Omar listening.

28
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,700
<i>- I'm going to the West.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

29
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,600
<i>- Peace out.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

30
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,200
Here we go.

31
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,200
<i>- Yo. I need some face time with the man.</i>
<i>- Hold on, I'll holler back at you, man.</i>

32
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,500
That'd be Shamrock.

33
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Assuming Stringer Bell is the man,
now we wait for the return call.

34
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,200
This is beautiful.

35
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,400
Lester, can you actually believe
we fucking sold the wiretaps...

36
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,100
to the targets.

37
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,900
For a week at least.

38
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,800
Maybe we ducked a bullet.
Maybe we clean this mess quietly...

39
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,100
throw some horseshit
at whatever reporter shows up...

40
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,400
and the Mayor forgives and forgets.

41
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,300
We're ready to move on this, right?

42
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,100
As soon as we get the word,
we shut down all three zones...

43
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,600
toss everyone into wagons.

44
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,000
There'll be nothing left of it
before midnight shift.

45
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,000
So what the fuck are we waiting on
for a day and half?

46
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,000
Why isn't the Hall calling us?

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
<i>- Mayor's Office.</i>
- Commissioner Burrell for Mayor Royce.

48
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,600
- I've heard enough.
- Hold on, Coleman.

49
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,300
Come on, let the man talk, huh?

50
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,800
Excuse me, Mayor.
I have Commissioner Burrell on the line.

51
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,100
- He says it's urgent.
- I'll bet it is.

52
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,000
He wants to move, Clarence.

53
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,800
He wants to clean this shit up
yesterday, and so do we.

54
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,400
Tell him to hold. Go ahead, Gene.

55
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Look, I'm not a politician, I'm an academic.

56
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,800
All I know is that
from a public health perspective...

57
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,100
there are remarkable things
happening in the free zones.

58
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,300
Needle exchanges, on-site blood testing,
condom distribution.

59
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
Most of all, we're interacting
with an at-risk community...

60
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,200
that is largely elusive.

61
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,700
I mean, we're even talking
some of these people into drug treatment.

62
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,200
And that's just what UM and Bon Secours
have brought to the table.

63
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,800
If this thing were sanctioned...

64
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,300
my department
could put public resources into play.

65
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,300
- You people can't see the forest here.
- Odell?

66
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,200
When the story breaks,
the ministers will surely be against you.

67
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,000
And most of the City Council
will be walking sideways...

68
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
away from your administration.

69
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,800
And my guess is
the Governor and the Legislature...

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,500
will use this opportunity
to piss on the city from a great height.

71
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,500
And Washington?

72
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Can you imagine how far
the United States Department of Justice...

73
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,100
is gonna crawl up your ass behind this?

74
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,600
Crime is down, Odell.

75
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,700
Medical people
are telling me this could work.

76
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,300
I mean, a 14% decline in felonies citywide...

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,700
I might be untouchable on this.
Now, look, we need to think.

78
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
See if we can keep this thing going
without calling it what it really is, huh?

79
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,400
- Jesus.
- Now, there's got to be a way.

80
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,600
I want you to talk this thing out.
Hey, Erv, thanks for holding.

81
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,900
Yes, <i>but...</i>

82
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,400
Yes, I understand.

83
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
Then I'll wait to hear from you.

84
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,400
We're to hold off
on any action in Hamsterdam.

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,100
No arrests,
no movement until further notice.

86
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,900
He says he wants to regroup.

87
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,500
Determine the most effective
course of action.

88
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,500
Translate that for me, will you, Erv?
I don't speak his fucked-up lingo.

89
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,900
Royce is figuring a way to put
all of us in the guillotine...

90
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,700
and keep the blood from
spraying anywhere near the Hall.

91
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,900
Shit, I'll be goddamned
if I'm gonna go out like that.

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,500
Bent over in public.

93
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,800
I can spin the story
just as well as that motherfucker.

94
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,400
- You're gonna go to the press?
- Not me.

95
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,400
But I know a slick little bastard...

96
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,300
who will happily
put His Honor's shit in the street.

97
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,200
Something funny about that?

98
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,500
'Cause I look in the paper...

99
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,500
and I see all these Federal grants
coming down, but nothing for B&B.

100
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,200
- You're expecting what?
- Payout.

101
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,300
A big payout for what we put in, man.

102
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,600
Federal dollars
on them Howard Street rehabs.

103
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
You gave money up front?

104
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,500
- $250,000, yep.
- To Clay Davis.

105
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
How you know?

106
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,900
What you saying? He's running game?

107
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,400
- No, hell, no, he ain't that brazen.
- Let me guess.

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,800
He's told you about the faucet.

109
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Or was it the goose
that laid the golden egg?

110
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,700
You ever actually meet the man?

111
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,500
Did you ever actually see any of your cash
reach anyone in authority?

112
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,500
Yeah, I met the guy at the Federal Building.
Yeah, I met him.

113
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,500
Yeah? What office?

114
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,500
He came down to the lobby.

115
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,400
He rainmade you.

116
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,800
A guy says if you pay him,
he can make it rain.

117
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,900
You pay him.
If and when it rains, he takes the credit.

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,300
If and when it doesn't,
he finds reasons for you to pay him more.

119
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,800
- Clay Davis rainmade you.
- No, man...

120
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,800
he got them building permits
in no time at all, man.

121
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,800
I mean, we bribing these motherfuckers.
He got the city contractor's money back.

122
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
- How much?
- $35,000 so far.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
- On the $250,000 you gave him?
- It's for bribing the motherfuckers.

124
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,400
There are no bribes!

125
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,100
You really think a State Senator
is going to risk his salary...

126
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,500
and his position
by walking into a Federal office...

127
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
with a briefcase full of drug money?

128
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,400
I seen Chunky, Chunky Coates.

129
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,800
Chunky Coates gets his grant money
same way everyone does.

130
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,300
He fills out applications,
he makes sure the plans meet spec...

131
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,500
then he prays like hell.

132
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,000
This is an old game in this town,
and Clay Davis?

133
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
That <i>ganef</i> was born
with his hand in someone's pocket.

134
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,600
I just wish you'd run it by me sooner.

135
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,000
Now here's Shamrock
returning Bodie's call.

136
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
<i>Talk light.</i>

137
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,000
<i>Yo, the man said he'd see you</i>
<i>same time as always.</i>

138
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,600
<i>- You know the spot.</i>
- During the first call...

139
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,200
Sydnor had eyes on Shamrock
over in West Baltimore.

140
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
All right? Now look at this.

141
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,100
At the time, Stringer Bell
was at the print shop.

142
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,000
So it couldn't be a face-to-face meet.

143
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,700
We didn't catch a call
between Stringer and Shamrock.

144
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,200
How can that be?

145
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,700
Stringer's phone isn't on the same network
as everyone below him.

146
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,200
- Right you are, ma'am.
- Bell's not using Bernard's burners.

147
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,400
And Shamrock has a separate phone
for calling Bell.

148
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,400
We can't hear those calls
because the system's compartmentalized.

149
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,700
They're some tricky motherfuckers.

150
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,400
A week or so up on Bernard's phones
and we'll have everybody...

151
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,800
up to and including Shamrock,
tangled up in conspiracy counts.

152
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,400
But Bell or Barksdale?

153
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Not unless we can
pluck their cell numbers out of the air.

154
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,400
- Where you headed?
- Toy store.

155
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,900
- He legalized drugs in special zones?
- It's more than that.

156
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,800
Major Colvin
lost the necessary perspective...

157
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,100
that is required for command.

158
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,200
Now, we were all under pressure
to reduce crime before year-end...

159
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,900
and he responded poorly to that pressure.

160
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Pressure by who? Mayor?

161
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm just explaining to you...

162
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
that the pressure
was applied all down the line...

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,500
from Headquarters
to the District Commanders...

164
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,100
to the shift and sector supervisors.

165
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,700
So Colvin's 14% decline was bullshit.

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,200
And they're selling drugs
with police permission in Western?

167
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,300
The Department
is ready to shut that mess down...

168
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,900
with mass arrests.

169
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,000
- I'm on top of it.
- Why don't you move?

170
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,500
The Mayor says wait.

171
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Why?

172
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,200
I think he's gonna make
some kind of show.

173
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,200
Spin it so that I take the weight
for something...

174
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,800
that has nothing to do with me,
and everything to do...

175
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,400
with the pressure that my Commanders
were getting from City Hall.

176
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,500
Going public and putting the responsibility
for this back at City Hall...

177
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,800
is the only move I have left, right?

178
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,500
I mean, I spin Royce before he spins me.

179
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,300
- And you want me to...
- No, no, not you.

180
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,100
Your pal, Tony Gray.

181
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,100
If he's gonna take a run at Royce,
he's gonna need ammunition, right?

182
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,700
I don't have a relationship with Gray.
I do have one with you.

183
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,300
And, Councilman, you owe me.

184
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,700
- What's up, hotshot?
- I got a technical question.

185
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,900
Remember those analog units...

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,200
we used to use
to pull cell numbers out of the air?

187
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,300
- CF-something-something.
- Yeah, cell frequency identification device.

188
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,100
- The Triggerfish, yeah.
- That one. It could flag a number.

189
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,300
Right. With the old analog machines,
we used to have to follow the guy around...

190
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,800
stay close while he used the phone.

191
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,300
New digitals?

192
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,500
Bing, you just pull the number
right off the cell tower.

193
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,700
So, you got any down out at Woodlawn
that Daddy can borrow?

194
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
- What about yours?
- What?

195
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,000
City has three of them, I remember right.

196
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,700
Homeland Security grant sent them to you,
every big county department in the state.

197
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,100
No fucking way.

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
Thanks.

199
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,500
- I doubted you, Tommy.
- I told you it was big.

200
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
If we play it right.

201
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,900
He wants me to turn the information
over to Tony Gray...

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
let him use it.

203
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,000
He figures if Tony's gonna be running
against the Mayor...

204
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,000
he'll take aim at Royce
and not the Department.

205
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,600
You may want to bring Tony in on it,
keep him viable against the Mayor.

206
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,000
But right now, you need to find out
what this is all about.

207
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,500
- Firsthand. Do you know this Major Colvin?
- To shake hands, maybe.

208
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,500
If Burrell's painting him the villain...

209
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,300
Colvin might be anxious
to tell someone his side of the story.

210
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
McNulty, Major Crimes.

211
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Sullivan, minor irritations.

212
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,300
You got anything back there
that's like the old CFID, but digital?

213
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,700
For catching cell numbers?

214
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,600
- Catching who?
- You know, a Triggerfish machine.

215
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,800
Triggerfish. For cell numbers.

216
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,800
How about I look around there on my own?

217
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,700
Yes, this is Councilman Carcetti
over at the Hall.

218
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,700
- I'm trying to reach Major Colvin.
<i>- I'm sorry, but he's on vacation.</i>

219
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
I'm aware of that...

220
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,800
but I'm trying to reach him
on municipal business.

221
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,600
<i>Well, I can put you</i>
<i>through to his voicemail.</i>

222
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
No, not his voicemail.

223
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,400
- I said I have to reach him immediately.
<i>- Immediately?</i>

224
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
- Right.
<i>- How about his cell phone?</i>

225
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,500
- His cell? Yeah, that would be fine.
<i>- All right.</i>

226
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,200
All right, that's enough.

227
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,100
Yeah, I know, it hurts.

228
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,100
But your fists
gonna be like rocks after awhile.

229
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,200
Justin, come here.

230
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,900
All right.
I want you to push me in my chest.

231
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,800
You ain't got to do it hard.

232
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,300
- That's how you were standing.
- You ain't had no weight on your back foot.

233
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,700
That's right. No center of gravity.

234
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,100
Plus, if you get your stance right...

235
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,700
then you got the means
to put your hip into the punch.

236
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,300
Right?

237
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,200
- That's where your power'll come from.
- Yeah, but what happen when we get hit?

238
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,000
- Say what?
- We get hit, even with this pad...

239
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,400
you gonna get trucked.

240
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,000
- All this stuff falling apart.
- Yeah, the heavy bag, too.

241
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Yeah, where you get this stuff at?
The town of Bedrock?

242
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,000
No, he say, "Nobody."
So you gonna have to wait right here.

243
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,100
What you mean, "Wait right here?"
You know who I am, boy?

244
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,100
Man say he want to see Avon.

245
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,900
Making me wait to see my own partner.

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,700
- He new, String.
- Fuck that.

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,200
Lot of new faces round here, man.
Way too many, you ask me.

248
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,000
Get the fuck out of here.

249
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,200
- Where Avon at?
- He'll be along shortly.

250
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,100
That's good,
'cause I came to see you, anyway.

251
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,600
What you need?

252
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,400
I need you to hit somebody.

253
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,000
- Who we hitting?
- Clay Davis.

254
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,600
The Clay Davis?

255
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,600
Downtown Clay Davis?

256
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,800
Is that suppose to mean
something to me, man?

257
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,200
- That nigga need to be got.
- Shit, String, murder ain't no thing.

258
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,200
But this here is some assassination shit...

259
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,600
I tell you you getting somebody,
you getting him.

260
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,400
- I ain't asking.
- Damn, String, I don't know...

261
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,300
Nigga, I got to remind you
who the fuck you work for?

262
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,400
Hey, yo.

263
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,600
I think Slim gonna have
to sit this one out, boss.

264
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,200
So you finna
go hit a State Senator now, huh?

265
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,300
Yo, you kill a downtown nigga like that...

266
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,100
the whole world
gonna stand up and take notice.

267
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm talking about the State Police...

268
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,900
Federals, all of that.

269
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,700
You need a <i>Day of the Jackal</i> type
motherfucker, basically...

270
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,900
to do some shit like that...

271
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,400
- not a rough-and-tumble nigga like Slim.
- That nigga took our money, man.

272
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,600
I seen it coming.

273
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,000
- Well, he got to go.
- No, you a fucking businessman.

274
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,200
You wanna handle it like that.

275
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,700
You don't wanna get all gangster wild
with it and shit, right?

276
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What I tell you about playing
them fucking away games?

277
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Yeah.

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,500
They saw your ghetto ass
coming from miles away, nigga.

279
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,500
You got a fucking beef with them?
That shit is on you.

280
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,400
So, we aim this at the nearest cell tower...

281
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
the one that would be
the conduit for calls...

282
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,400
coming to and from our boy, Bell...

283
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,600
and we let rip.

284
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,700
Fucking hell.

285
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,100
Looks like Baltimore White Pages
without any names.

286
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,400
But the pattern tracer'll pull that down.

287
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,700
You know, if we know
the approximate time of Bell's call...

288
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,600
we could start just by pulling calls
off that tower at that time.

289
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,300
That could be thousands.

290
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,100
Yeah, that's the base line,
but we get a second hit...

291
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
and that list comes down to dozens.

292
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,700
- And after a third or <i>fourth...</i>
- Then we've got his number.

293
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,700
I can't believe that this was
just sitting over at ISD, gathering dust.

294
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,800
We're going to be on these motherfuckers
for real now, Lester.

295
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,300
Well, they don't know
about this technology yet.

296
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,300
For once they can't change and adjust.

297
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,900
It's genius.

298
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,600
Need something?

299
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,200
- Yeah, how much you make, man?
- What?

300
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,100
On them tees? How much you make?

301
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,900
Fair profit. No more than that.

302
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,900
You should
probably sell sweats with hoodies.

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Since the season's changing and all.

304
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
Where you live at?

305
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,500
Yellow tops, yellow tops,
got them yellow tops.

306
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,000
- Bodie Broadus.
- The man with the hands.

307
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,800
I heard you was opening up a gym
or something.

308
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,300
Yeah, trying to.

309
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,000
- I'm looking to get up with Avon.
- Thought you was out.

310
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,000
Hey, man, that's why I came to you.

311
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,400
I mean, I feel like the way we left it,
I can't just roll up on the man, you know?

312
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,600
Hey, yo, it's me.
Yo, I got that hitter here with me.

313
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Yeah, the soldier that walked in and out.

314
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah, he want to see the top man.

315
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,800
You slam shit like that,
you gonna fall out one day.

316
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
I'm good.

317
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,900
I'm trying to school you, boy,
and you just don't wanna know.

318
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,500
I'm cool. I'm good.

319
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,900
Whitey sale, whitey sale.
One for three, three for five.

320
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,000
Whitey sale, whitey sale.

321
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,800
Whitey sale, whitey sale, whitey sale, here.
One for three, three for five.

322
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,200
Whitey sale, whitey sale.

323
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,700
Whitey sale, whitey sale!

324
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,900
<i>All right, so what</i>
<i>you want me to tell the man?</i>

325
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,400
<i>Yo, I'll give word up, then I'll hit you back.</i>

326
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,600
- Shamrock.
- 4:40 p.m.

327
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,900
- B&B Enterprises.
<i>- We need to have lunch.</i>

328
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,600
All right, hold on. I'll call you back.

329
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,300
- Yo.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

330
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
What's good?

331
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, it's me.

332
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
<i>Yo, tell the hitter,</i>
<i>tell him the tall man will pick him up.</i>

333
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,000
<i>- Right.</i>
- 4:47.

334
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,800
Seven-minute window.

335
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
There's 892 phone numbers.

336
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,100
That's our base line. We're on our way.

337
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,300
Yep.

338
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,700
Stay the fuck there, man.

339
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Yo.

340
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,900
Jimmy! On the clean phone.

341
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,400
He just hit your friend's number.
The one off the business card you gave me.

342
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,800
- The Western?
- His cell.

343
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Should we be worried about this?

344
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
No.

345
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,500
- A boxing gym, huh?
- Ain't a proper one yet.

346
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,200
That's why I asked to see you.

347
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,000
So, what you know
about taking care of something like that?

348
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,500
Not a damn thing.
But I know that sweet science.

349
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,300
And I got some kids who are interested.

350
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,900
But what I got a need for, brother,
is equipment.

351
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,400
Man, these kids gonna get rained on.

352
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,800
They need headgear,
they need guards, cups, you know...

353
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
so they can take the hit.

354
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,800
Shoot, you know what I'm saying, man.

355
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,300
I seen your picture on them
Globe posters back in the day.

356
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,500
- Little undercard shit, maybe, you know.
- Yeah, but still, you was Golden Gloves.

357
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,800
For a minute, but I had a physical defect.

358
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,800
- What, you got a glass jaw?
- No, forehead, nigga.

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,900
- Cranium shot'll do you wrong.
- Yo, look here, man.

360
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,400
You see the new heavy bags?
Look, freestanding, man.

361
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,400
All you gotta do is add water.

362
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,200
Then you got speed bags,
right there, right?

363
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
You got this headgear right here. It's new.

364
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,400
Look, protect the cheek and the chin,
you know?

365
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And I know I can go around
and collect a dollar here and a dollar there.

366
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,900
But I'm trying to put together
a select group of people, right?

367
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I call them my Gold Circle Club...

368
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,900
and they gonna make
a substantial contribution...

369
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,300
and just get this thing rolling right.

370
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,900
I mean, I'm gonna put their name
and picture up on the wall in the gym.

371
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,300
- What, you trying to get me to join a club?
- No, man, I'm just saying.

372
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,400
There's all sorts of levels.

373
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,700
We got the, the Silver Club,
we got the Bronze Club.

374
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,500
Man, for motherfuckers
who really don't want to dig that deep.

375
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,200
Come on, man, check it out.

376
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,400
No, man, I ain't got no time
for this bullshit, man.

377
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,200
And you know I don't want
my fucking name and face on no damn wall.

378
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,500
You crazy, nigga?
How much money you talking about?

379
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,100
$10,000.

380
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,400
See him go through all that for $10,000?

381
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Man, Slim, go get him $15,000 cash, man.

382
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,300
<i>Yo...</i>

383
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
Shit.

384
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,500
All right. Later, man. Hey, you take care
of them little niggas, you hear?

385
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Yeah, no doubt, bro.

386
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,400
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Yo, you talk to him?

387
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,500
<i>Fat man wanna parlay.</i>

388
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,900
- All right, you good. Hook me up.
<i>- Yeah, all right.</i>

389
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,600
You check out what I sent you?

390
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Yeah, your information's good.

391
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,800
So, we can talk on the real side now, huh?

392
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,700
<i>- Tell your man I'm good for tomorrow.</i>
<i>- Yo, I'll hit you back.</i>

393
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,600
- Now we're cooking.
- Cutting butter with a hot knife.

394
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,200
Next time Stringer Bell
takes a call off the base line, he's ours.

395
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Game over.

396
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,500
So, it ain't what it might seem to you.

397
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,100
That man there is my brother.

398
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,900
But if it keep on like it been, <i>then...</i>

399
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,100
Oh, fuck.

400
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,400
You got problems?

401
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,400
I stirred up some shit
with this Hamsterdam mess.

402
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,300
That's 'cause you was behind that...

403
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,500
that made me come to you with this.

404
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,200
Look like you and me
both trying to make sense of this game.

405
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,700
Speak your mind, Russell.

406
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,700
We two good?

407
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah.

408
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,800
We got y'all out front. Let's go, P-Square.

409
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,000
- You look healthy.
- For a man who was gut-shot.

410
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,700
You reached out to a third party...

411
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,100
who engaged me
in the purpose of holding your Towers.

412
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,200
That third person's word was your word,
as he represented you.

413
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
That's right.

414
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,000
And I ran those
East Baltimore gentlemen off.

415
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,500
I held up my end of the agreement...

416
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,600
at least for as long as I was physically able.

417
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
You did.

418
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,700
Your man then set up
a meet at Butchie's bar.

419
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,400
Your man told Omar Little
that I was responsible...

420
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,200
for the torture of a young boy
who was close to Mr. Little's heart.

421
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,000
Your man, in effect...

422
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,800
sought to have me hit.

423
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,200
Omar told you that
and you believe that motherfucker?

424
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,100
He doesn't strike me
as a man who would tell stories.

425
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,300
Even at the point of dying.

426
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,300
Shit.

427
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,900
Proposition Joe package.

428
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,300
The inner workings
of your organization don't concern me.

429
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,700
If there's a way, I mean, if my <i>man...</i>

430
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,200
If he made a mistake here,
then I'm willing to pay the cost.

431
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,400
How can we fix it? You want money?

432
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,200
- Money?
- Yeah, this is business.

433
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,400
Business is where you are now.

434
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,100
But what got you here
is your word and your reputation.

435
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,000
With that alone,
you've still got an open line to New York.

436
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,300
Without it, you're done.

437
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,800
My man's still on paper.

438
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,600
I can put him in a spot
that got heavy artillery.

439
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,200
I ain't talking about pistols.
I'm talking about mini TEC-9s...

440
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,200
shotguns, they even got grenades
in that motherfucker.

441
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,700
That's a automatic fall.

442
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,500
So, I'm hoping
you could keep that shit to five.

443
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,300
Look, if you hit the joint...

444
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,300
his people are gonna try
and take the rap for it.

445
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,900
They gonna say all that firepower is theirs.

446
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,400
So all you gotta do
is just hit him with the parole backup.

447
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,400
Look, I can't make no promises.

448
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,200
- It's gonna be a nickel, at least.
- Come on, man.

449
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,300
- Him and me...
- I'm gonna do my best, all right?

450
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,800
He's always at this place?

451
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,200
No, he come and go.
But it's the spot since the war started.

452
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,300
He must have done something to you.

453
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,300
No, it's just business.

454
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,600
Almost forgot.
This came in for you last night.

455
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
Said she called your cell phone,
but you didn't answer.

456
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,100
Had a nice voice. Like a kitty cat.

457
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,300
We're on.

458
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,200
<i>- He said for you to be there, half-pint.</i>
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

459
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,200
- Stringer Bell, that's him.
- There it is.

460
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,200
Yeah, but for how long?
He could toss that burner at any moment.

461
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,700
- I got Rhonda, you raise Daniels.
- Okay.

462
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,200
- Ronnie? Yeah, we're on Stringer's phone.
- Lieutenant.

463
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,200
You should go straight to the judge.
I'll meet you there with an affidavit.

464
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,300
- Lester's raising Daniels.
- McNulty's calling Pearlman.

465
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,100
Watch that footwork, baby.

466
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,100
All right. Take it to him, now.

467
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,500
Yeah. Take it to him, now.

468
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,200
- I'm a beast, coach.
- All right, boy, don't be gloating on it.

469
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,800
Yo, when we gonna have some real fights?
You know, one of them tournament things.

470
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,700
- Yeah, we gladiators, son.
- Y'all got more fire than skills.

471
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,700
You ain't ready
for no full-blown thing just yet.

472
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,200
But I don't know,
maybe it'd be good for y'all...

473
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,100
to spar with some boys you don't know.

474
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,000
A nigga step in my house,
he getting dropped.

475
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,700
Yo, I met these fellas at that gym
over on Pennsylvania Avenue.

476
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,300
I'll see if they wanna roll through, all right?

477
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,000
- All right.
- All right.

478
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,200
You don't return a Councilman's calls?

479
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,600
I'm off this week.

480
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Taking a little accrued vacation.

481
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,200
Yeah. And I heard why.

482
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,600
I'm here for your side of this story.
If I can't get that...

483
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,700
then whatever comes
out of Burrell's mouth is gonna stand.

484
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,200
You good with that?

485
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,700
What did you do, Major?

486
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,100
And why the fuck
haven't they shut it down?

487
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,200
We've seen that law enforcement's
steamroller approach...

488
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,200
- is just spitting in the wind!
- I really think...

489
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,500
I really think that you're
onto something here, Clarence.

490
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
But if you keep it up, before you know it...

491
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,900
they'll be calling you
the most dangerous man in America.

492
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,700
Well, I know it may appear
that we're vulnerable here.

493
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,700
But if we enforce the drug laws
everywhere else in the city...

494
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,100
aggressively...

495
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,900
how can they say
we're not a law and order administration?

496
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,300
Now there's got to be a middle ground here
that we have yet to find.

497
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,500
There's got to be some way
to accomplish this...

498
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,700
without turning everything upside down.

499
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,000
Without turning everything upside down.

500
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,400
This used to be one of my worst corners.

501
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,100
This is the neighborhood
where a cop got shot last summer, right?

502
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,500
- Dozerman.
- Looks quiet now.

503
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,000
So do most all my corners.

504
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
G-man.

505
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,400
- So, what's up?
- Shut the door.

506
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,800
In 10 minutes we're gonna have an affidavit
for a city judge to sign.

507
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,100
- It's for Russell Bell's dirty cell.
- It's a good pull.

508
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,600
It is if Bay Wireless
doesn't take five days to process it.

509
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,500
You owe me, Fitz.

510
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,700
That whole port case came down early...

511
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,900
behind some ugly shit in your house.

512
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,400
Now, I don't care how you do it,
but I need my wire today.

513
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,200
These guys were in radio cars
two months ago, chasing calls...

514
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,800
clearing corners.

515
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,900
I pulled them to do felony follow-up.

516
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,700
More police work, less bullshit,
and that's why my crime is down.

517
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,500
The numbers are true.

518
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,600
- What did he do?
- Church burglaries, 14 of them.

519
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,400
Let's go.

520
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,400
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

521
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,600
Is it affiant or affiant?

522
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,700
I've never <i>been...</i>
I've never been clear on that.

523
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,700
You been hunting
this guy Bell for a long time...

524
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,300
haven't you, Jimmy?

525
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,000
A while, yeah.

526
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,800
Name's familiar to me.

527
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,500
That thing that we did
a few years back, was he the...

528
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Yeah.

529
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,000
What's done is done, Jimmy.

530
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Now, for your own fucking sake,
just let it go.

531
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,900
Come on.

532
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,400
As the affiant, do you solemnly swear...

533
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,900
and attest that the information
contained in this <i>document...</i>

534
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,800
That's the most significant drop
in crime in this district...

535
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,300
in recent history.

536
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,400
We still got some
hard-looking boys out on them streets.

537
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,600
And, Sergeant,
you know them little mini-motorcycles?

538
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,100
They keeping me up at night.

539
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,000
We're working on that.

540
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,000
Look, I have been living
in this part of the city my whole life.

541
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,300
And I can tell you something.
We weren't any angels when we were kids.

542
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
And those hard boys you talking about...

543
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,400
half of them, they's just playing gangster.

544
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,600
They ain't no different from what we were.

545
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,200
Shirts and drawers a little longer, is all.

546
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,900
The one thing
I do miss about my neighborhood...

547
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm talking about the neighborhood
I came up in.

548
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,500
See, we knew the police. See?

549
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,100
We had a white police officer.

550
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,700
Our house was on his beat,
on his foot beat.

551
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,500
And he would be sitting out...

552
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,700
talking to my mother
damn near every night...

553
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,000
I mean, just sitting out
on her stoop, just talking.

554
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,400
And I'm telling you, this man,
his name was Frazier O'Leary.

555
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,400
- He even knew my grandmother by name.
- Yes, ma'am.

556
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,700
Let's move on
to the tip-line information...

557
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,800
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm real sorry, but I was not finished.

558
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,600
You see, let me tell you something.

559
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,700
I have not seen that face-to-face
policing in a long while.

560
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,500
In a very long while. Until last week.

561
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,600
A young officer, black officer,
came by my stoop. I was sitting out...

562
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
gave me his card.

563
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,500
His name is Reggie Ballard,
is his name, right?

564
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,200
And he sat, and he talked to me.
We just talked.

565
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,400
And, see, now I know his name and face
and he knows my name and face.

566
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,500
You see?
And I'm going to tell you something.

567
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,500
That is how it should be.

568
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,300
My son wanna open up
one of them snowball stands on the street.

569
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,300
Do we need a permit for this?

570
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,500
You ever seen a West Side
community meeting like this one?

571
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,100
In fact, the folks downtown
at Minor Privileges tell me...

572
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,300
that stands aren't allowed
in the city right-of-way at all.

573
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,800
Now they do say it is possible
to have a snowball stand...

574
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,500
behind the sidewalk.

575
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,900
Why are you really down here,
Councilman?

576
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,600
- I mean, this ain't even your district.
- I'm interested.

577
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,400
And I have the Public Safety Subcommittee.

578
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,900
You see that building there?

579
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,700
It was the old Stryker building.

580
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,200
It was a funeral parlor.

581
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,300
The last stop before the cemetery
for West Side white folk...

582
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,700
back when there were
still some of those around.

583
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,300
Right about the time
that Jim Crow was breaking up...

584
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,800
back in the early '60s...

585
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,500
somebody asked old man Stryker...

586
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,100
they say, "Stryker...

587
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,400
"you gonna change your policy...

588
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,300
"and start burying black folk?"

589
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,300
And Stryker said...

590
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,800
"Yeah, on one condition.

591
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,700
"That I can do them all at once."

592
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,300
That's sick.

593
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,100
But you know something?
I had a lot of respect for that man.

594
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,900
'Cause, unlike most folks...

595
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,000
I always knew where he stood.

596
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,300
I'm doing my job.

597
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,000
Look, I done showed you the good.

598
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,900
Come on, let me show you the ugly.

599
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,900
Hey.

600
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,600
- How come so quick?
- Stringer Bell's given name.

601
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,200
- Russell.
- For now?

602
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,200
Ahmed.

603
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,300
We're on the top of the mountain.

604
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,200
Red tops over here.
Come get them, come get them.

605
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,900
- This is it?
- One of three.

606
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,500
How did you make this happen?

607
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,000
I just did it.

608
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,700
I got tired of hearing folks
talk about what needs to be done...

609
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,800
or what they would do if it was up to them.

610
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,500
- Bottle rockets, got them bottle rockets.
- So, this is about you making a mark?

611
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,500
No, I ain't analyzed it all that deep.

612
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,900
I ain't claiming no kind of victory, neither.

613
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,600
I will say I'm glad I tried.

614
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,500
Go on, Councilman.
I'll wait for you down here.

615
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,400
You're not coming?

616
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,500
What you gonna see ain't pretty.

617
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,200
- But it's safe.
- WMDs, got them WMDs.

618
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,100
I think you need to take this journey
your own self.

619
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,300
Got those yellow, those yellow tops.
Yellow tops right here.

620
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,000
- I ordered one for you.
- Thanks.

621
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,900
- Surprised I called?
- A little.

622
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,600
After the way we left it.

623
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm a type A, Jimmy.

624
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,300
People like me break things.

625
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,000
When I slow down, or when I take
a minute to think about it, <i>I...</i>

626
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,100
Is that your idea of an apology?

627
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,200
I didn't drive an hour up 95 to apologize.

628
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,400
I missed you.

629
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,800
I missed you, too, I guess.

630
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,700
Still, seems a long way
to come just to tell me that...

631
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,300
then turn around
and drive back down to DC.

632
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,800
I'm not driving back tonight.

633
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,400
So what's going on?
Are you working on a case?

634
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,800
It's a good one.

635
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,300
How about you? Anything interesting?

636
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,200
I did hear a crazy Baltimore story...

637
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,300
you know,
through the rumor mill of Washington.

638
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,100
- Really?
- Some...

639
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,200
renegade Police Commander
takes it on himself <i>to...</i>

640
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,600
I don't know,
legalize drugs in the precinct?

641
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Mayor doesn't even know about it?

642
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,600
- Can you believe that?
- Crazy story.

643
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
Someone...

644
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,300
I think it's Colvin.

645
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,600
You know him?

646
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,100
No, I can't say that I do.

647
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,700
Still, I think it's funny that some...

648
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,500
water-cooler talker down in DC
knows any Baltimore cop's name.

649
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,400
I was just wondering.

650
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,500
Listen, <i>I'm...</i>

651
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,500
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, I think so.

652
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
Good night.

653
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,400
Damn, man, I miss this crib already.

654
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,100
Yeah, well, you spending
a lot of time at the other spot...

655
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,300
- doing what you gotta do.
- Yeah.

656
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,700
Man, it's a shame we got to deal
with this Marlo bullshit, man.

657
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,000
I mean, if I had taken care
of that earlier, <i>man...</i>

658
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,300
There's always gonna be a Marlo, man.

659
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,000
No Marlo, no game.

660
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,000
But you could've dealt with that shit
a little sooner, I mean, yeah.

661
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,800
But, you know what I'm saying?
Don't let it lay on you like that.

662
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,800
Tonight, I mean, I'm gonna kick back
and just enjoy this view.

663
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,600
I mean, look at this shit.
Can you fucking believe this?

664
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,800
I mean, I got a crib
that's overlooking the Harbor.

665
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,300
This is the same <i>place...</i>
We used to run through this motherfucker...

666
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,600
we had every security guard in there
following us.

667
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,700
- As they should have.
- True, true.

668
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,100
- And then there was that one time...
- Toy store?

669
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,600
Hell, yeah, I told your ass
not to steal the badminton set.

670
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,400
What you gonna do with a fucking net...

671
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,200
and a racket and we ain't got no yard.

672
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,500
You like, "Yo, that white boy
ain't gonna jump over that counter...

673
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,900
"and come chase after me."

674
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,500
- He sure did, though.
- Then he <i>said...</i>

675
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,300
- I said, "What the fuck?"
- He was on your ass like Carl Lewis.

676
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,800
Fists was rolled up.

677
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,600
Your ass was running, too,
fast as you could.

678
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,800
Punching yourself in the chest
looking all mad and shit.

679
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,800
That shit was crazy, man.

680
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,400
Right here, too, man, right there. Goddamn.

681
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,200
Can you imagine, man,
if I had the money that I have now, man...

682
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,300
I could have bought
half this waterfront property.

683
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,600
God damn it.

684
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,500
Forget about that for a while, man.

685
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,700
You know, just dream with me.

686
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,200
We ain't gotta dream no more, man.

687
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,400
We got real shit...

688
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,400
real estate, we can touch.

689
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,400
I can't get too fucked up tonight, man.

690
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,100
I got some shit
I gotta do on the site tomorrow.

691
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,700
Plus, the fucking Polack
we got working for us, man...

692
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,900
I gotta pull his coat.

693
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,800
If he had anything to do
with that Clay Davis bullshit, man...

694
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,600
I'm gonna have to cut his money,
little faggot.

695
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,400
What time y'all meeting?

696
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,700
What time? 12:00, I think. Why?

697
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,200
You need me to do something for you?

698
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,200
No, I'm just seeing
where you going to be at.

699
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,400
You need to relax more, man.

700
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,400
Well, when the time is right, I will.

701
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,400
You know,
I don't take my work too seriously.

702
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,000
That's right.

703
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,900
It's just business.

704
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,500
Us, motherfucker.

705
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,400
Us, man.

706
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,500
Get him, Andre, go get him.

707
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,100
Come on, Spider, you got him. Come on.

708
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,400
Easy, easy, easy.

709
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,000
- All right?
- I'm good, I'm good.

710
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,100
All right.

711
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,800
- All right, Ditty, you up.
- Why didn't you hit him back, man?

712
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,000
You, Justin.

713
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,800
Come on, boy, I'm calling your name.

714
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
All right, listen up.
We gonna have three two-minute rounds.

715
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,700
Watch the low blows. Touch gloves.

716
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,300
<i>And...</i>

717
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,700
Let's go, Justin.

718
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,600
Justin, come on. Come on.

719
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,600
That's good, that's good.

720
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,700
Straight shot, come on.

721
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,400
Get your hands up, Justin.

722
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,700
- Come on, man. Come on.
- You gotta block that.

723
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,600
He leading left and punching right, Justin.
Move towards his weak side.

724
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,300
- He only come up to your waist.
- Man, bell.

725
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,600
- That was a quick two minutes.
- Yeah, I know.

726
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,100
Get you some water, boy, and spit it out.

727
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,900
- You all right?
- Dizzy.

728
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,400
That's why the hell
I keep telling you you got to breathe, boy.

729
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,300
So, what? You had enough?

730
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,400
- No, I'm good.
- All right, all right.

731
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,400
- Let's go, Justin.
- Let's go, Justin!

732
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,300
- Come on, Justin.
- Let's go, Justin.

733
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,000
- Let's go, Justin.
- Come on.

734
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,600
Jab, Justin. Gotta jab.

735
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,400
Hey, we're up. Here it is.

736
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,400
<i>- It's me, man.</i>
<i>- You heard from the fat man?</i>

737
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,100
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- We low, right?</i>

738
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>- One mark shy of the mark.</i>
<i>- Yeah, it's light.</i>

739
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,800
<i>- Cherry say it's light.</i>
<i>- Tell the man I'm doing what needs done.</i>

740
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,100
<i>All right, I'll tell him.</i>
<i>Oh, and that other thing?</i>

741
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,500
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Them two hitters you asked after.</i>

742
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,800
<i>- He good with it.</i>
<i>- Not on the phone.</i>

743
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,900
- That's it.
- We got it!

744
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,900
Good work.

745
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,000
I guess this is pertinent.

746
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah!

747
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,600
Ain't no need to go back out.
You ain't got to prove nothing.

748
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,000
Shoot, my momma hit me harder than that.
I still got a chance, he getting tired.

749
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,900
Drink and spit.

750
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,800
- Ready.
- You more than ready, boy.

751
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,300
- You game rooster.
- Let's go, Justin.

752
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,600
Hey, Justin.

753
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,900
- Is there an alley entrance?
- Boarded up on both sides.

754
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,400
So we gonna have to go through the front.

755
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
That's a change for you, isn't it?

756
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,200
You just be ready, Bow Tie.
You know what I'm talking about?

757
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,000
Breathe, boy. Breathe.

758
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,200
Touch gloves.

759
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,800
- How'd I do?
- You still got plenty to learn.

760
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,300
But on the heart side? You did good.

761
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,800
Go on home, soldier. You done for the day.

762
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,700
Oh, I can see it all clearly now.

763
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,900
Between you and them subcontractors
and that motherfucking politician...

764
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,300
y'all had me in a spin, right?

765
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,700
- Mr. Bell, I don't know...
- Little man!

766
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,600
We gonna get all this shit sorted out.
And, hey, if the shit don't come up right...

767
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,100
one way or another
you gonna pay for this shit.

768
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,100
Look, I understand you're angry
but at the same time...

769
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,700
you can see
the progress we've made in here.

770
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,400
- Progress.
- Now I honestly don't know what...

771
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,900
passed between you and Senator Davis.

772
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,800
But if you're unhappy
with Clayton's performance...

773
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,900
then you have to work that out...

774
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,900
- Shit.
- Oh, God.

775
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,700
Oh, God, no.

776
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,000
Oh, God, no, <i>no...</i>

777
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,900
I ain't strapped.

778
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,000
Look, man, I ain't involved.

779
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,800
I ain't involved
in that gangster bullshit no more.

780
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,700
What y'all niggers want, man?
Huh? Money?

781
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,700
Is that it?

782
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,500
'Cause if it is, man,
I can be a better friend to y'all alive.

783
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,600
You still don't get it, do you?

784
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,300
Huh?

785
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,900
This ain't about your money, bro.

786
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,200
Your boy gave you up.

787
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,400
That's right.
And we ain't had to torture his ass, neither.

788
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,500
Well, it seem <i>like...</i>

789
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,200
I can't say nothing to change y'all minds.

790
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,100
Well, get on with it, mother...
