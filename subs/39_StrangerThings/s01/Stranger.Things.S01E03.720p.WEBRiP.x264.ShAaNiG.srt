00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,358
Hello?

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,530
Nancy?

3
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:32,617
Nancy!

4
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:35,453
Hello?

5
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,090
Oh, my God...

6
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,141
Nancy!

7
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,355
Hey, what's the matter?

8
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,441
Nothing.

9
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,596
You're so beautiful.

10
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:44,355
Nancy!

12
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,499
Steve?

13
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,504
- Hey, Steve.
- Mmm.

14
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,258
I'll...

15
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,302
see you tomorrow, okay?

16
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,431
Mmm-hmm.

17
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,633
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.

18
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:18,885
Oh, I scared you?

19
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,178
I know, I should have called.

20
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,846
Where have you been?

21
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,389
We agreed on 10:00.

22
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:26,434
After the assembly, some people
wanted to get something to eat.

23
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,877
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

24
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,771
You didn't think to
call and let me know?

25
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,522
With everything that's been going on?

26
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,358
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

27
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,194
I'm sorry, Mom. What more do you want?

28
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,570
Hey, wait...

29
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,821
Whose sweatshirt is that?

30
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:41,574
Steve's.

31
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,367
Steve's.

32
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,775
So is Steve your boyfriend now?

33
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,079
What?

34
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,164
No!

35
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,292
It was just cold, so I
borrowed his sweatshirt.

36
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,627
It's not a big deal.

37
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:54,879
Nancy?

38
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,547
What?

39
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:00,009
You can talk to me.

40
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,970
You can talk to me. Whatever happened.

41
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:05,765
Nothing happened.

42
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,769
Nancy.

43
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,689
Nothing happened.

44
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,151
Can I please go?

45
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,011
Will? Will?

46
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,765
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

47
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,849
Will...

48
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,184
Please...

49
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,894
Will...

50
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:54,981
It's me.

51
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,568
It's me. Just talk to me. Talk to me.

52
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,653
Just say...

53
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,905
- Mom?
- Jonathan!

54
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,866
- Come here. Come here.
- Mom, what is this?

55
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,494
Come here. Come here.

56
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,913
- What's going on?
- It's Will. It's Will, he's...

57
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:12,832
he's trying to talk to me.

58
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,004
- He's trying to talk to you?
- Yes, through... through the lights.

59
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,213
- Mom...
- I know.

60
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,673
I know.

61
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,883
Just... just watch.

62
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:26,554
Will... your brother's here.

63
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,433
Can you show him what
you showed me, baby?

64
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,312
Please... Did you see that?

65
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,355
It's the electricity, Mom.

66
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,839
- It's acting up.
- No.

67
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:39,562
It's the same thing
that fried the phone.

68
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,986
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

69
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,280
Something is going on here!

70
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,991
- Yesterday, the wall...
- What? What about the wall?

71
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,794
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

72
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:51,704
I just know that Will is here.

73
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,289
No, Mom.

74
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,042
- Maybe if I get more lamps...
- No, Mom.

75
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,546
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay?

76
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,798
He is just lost.

77
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:06,969
People are looking for him,
and they're going to find him.

78
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,638
Okay.

79
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,932
- This isn't helping.
- Okay, okay.

80
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,309
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

81
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,645
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

82
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,480
Can you just try and get some sleep?

83
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,232
- Yeah.
- Huh? Can you do that for me?

84
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:21,567
- I promise. I will.
- Yeah?

85
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,611
- Yeah.
- I just need to sit here for a minute.

86
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,572
All right, I'll go make breakfast.

87
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,157
- Okay.
- Yeah?

88
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,752
Will?

89
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,841
We just tell our parents we
have AV Club after school.

90
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,511
That'll give us at least a few
hours for Operation Mirkwood.

91
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,139
You seriously think that the
weirdo knows where Will is?

92
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,933
- Just trust me on this, okay?
- Okay.

93
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,518
- Did you get the supplies?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,229
Binoculars... from 'Nam.

95
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,481
Army knife... also from 'Nam.

96
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,025
Hammer, camouflage bandana...

97
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,277
and the wrist rocket.

98
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:07,481
You're gonna take out the
Demogorgon with a slingshot?

99
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:09,907
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

100
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:12,326
And second of all, the
Demogorgon's not real.

101
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,411
It's made up.

102
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,747
But if there is something out there,
I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

103
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,501
- and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get?

104
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:25,589
Well, alrighty.

105
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:26,924
So, we've got...

106
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:30,386
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

107
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,014
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

108
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,266
- banana, and trail mix.
- Seriously?

109
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,852
We need energy for our
travels. For stamina.

110
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,062
And besides, why do we
even need weapons anyway?

111
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:42,773
- We have her.
- She shut one door!

112
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:44,025
With her mind!

113
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,777
Are you kidding me? That's insane!

114
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:49,739
Imagine all the other
cool stuff she could do.

115
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:50,906
Like...

116
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,453
I bet... that she could make this fly!

117
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,165
Hey. Hey.

118
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,833
Okay, concentrate. Okay?

119
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,211
Okay, one more time.

120
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,548
Okay.

121
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,341
Use your powers, okay?

122
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,428
Idiot.

123
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,180
- She's not a dog!
- Boys!

124
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,015
Time for school!

125
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:19,226
Just stay down here.

126
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,562
Don't make any noise, and don't leave.

127
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,106
If you get hungry, eat
Dustin's snacks, okay?

128
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,067
- Michael!
- Coming!

129
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,526
You know those power lines?

130
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,403
- Power lines?
- Yeah.

131
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,529
The ones behind my house?

132
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:31,822
Yes.

133
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,449
Meet us there, after school.

134
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,201
After school?

135
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,619
Yeah, 3:15.

136
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:39,830
Ah.

137
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,506
When the numbers read
three-one-five, meet us there.

138
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,800
"Three-one-five."

139
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,843
Three-one-five.

140
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,412
Hey!

141
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:21,580
Hey!

142
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,166
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

143
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,709
Yeah, totally.

144
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,795
I just...

145
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,216
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.

146
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,801
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.

147
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,136
I know.

148
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,054
I know. Of course not.

149
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,683
But what about, like,
Tommy, and Carol and them?

150
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:41,851
You're being paranoid.

151
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,312
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, it's cute.

152
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:48,524
Hey...

153
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,276
I had a good time.

154
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,320
Yeah.

155
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,115
Yeah. Me, too.

156
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,087
Mmm. Hmm.

157
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,564
Hey, Ally. Where's Barb?

158
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,482
Um, shouldn't you know?

159
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,735
You haven't seen her anywhere... at all?

160
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,993
There she is. Emerald City.

161
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,203
I heard they make
space weapons in there.

162
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,288
Space weapons?

163
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,498
Yeah. You know, like,
Reagan's Star Wars.

164
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,251
I guess we're gonna blow
the Ruskies to smithereens.

165
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:51,706
Hey, can I help you?

166
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,632
Uh, yeah. We're here for a tour.

167
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,508
Oh, we don't give tours.

168
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,636
Okay... A quick look around.

169
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,347
You have to get clearance for
that. You can contact, uh...

170
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,015
Rick Schaeffer at the
Department of Energy.

171
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,418
Maybe you seen it on TV. We
got a local kid that's missing.

172
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,621
We have reason to believe
he might have snuck in here.

173
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,647
Like I said, you have to
speak to Mr. Schaeffer.

174
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,943
- What's your name?
- Patrick.

175
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,613
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and
I got reporters breathing down my neck

176
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,281
and I got a very upset mother.

177
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,870
Now, I know the kid's not in there,
but I gotta check off this box.

178
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:29,166
Patrick, would you do me a favor?

179
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,795
Would you speak to your boss and
see what you can swing for us?

180
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,381
I'd really appreciate it.

181
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,342
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,498
... was occupying a
large part of Lebanon.

183
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,751
Today, Syria has become a home for...

184
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,964
I have the power!

185
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,728
... gift that will last forever.

186
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,926

- Joyce...
- Just ring me up, Donald.

193
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,502
And you think this missing boy
may have crawled through there?

194
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,213
Well, that was the idea.

195
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,715
Yeah, I just don't see
how that'd be possible.

196
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,509
We've got over 100 cameras.

197
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,220
Every square inch
covered, plus all my guys.

198
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:53,388
No one breaks in here.

199
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,098
Certainly not some kid.

200
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,601
Those cameras, you keep the tapes?

201
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,915
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you guys do in here?

202
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,750
You're asking the wrong guy.

203
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:11,532
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians?
- I expect. Something like that.

204
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,034
- Who's in charge here?
- That'd be Dr. Brenner.

205
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,994
And he builds the space lasers?

206
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,913
- Space lasers?
- Ignore him.

207
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,001
This is the night of the 6th
and 7th we're seeing here?

208
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,419
That's correct.

209
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,558
Is that it?

210
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,561
Like I said, we would have seen him.

211
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,024
The night of the 7th, we had
a search party out for Will.

212
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,818
You remember anything about that night?

213
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,153
Mmm, not much to
remember. Called it off.

214
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,823
- 'Cause of the storm.
- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.

215
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,575
You see any rain on that tape?

216
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,202
What are you thinking?

217
00:17:58,537 --> 00:17:59,830
I don't know.

218
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,041
But they're lying.

219
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,330
That's why science doesn't
make any damn sense to me.

220
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,083
No, I swear. Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.

221
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:53,378
Oh, thanks, man. It's a heated pool.

222
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,297
Well, if it's not
frostbite, then what is it?

223
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,215
Ugh, I don't care what
it is, it's disgusting!

224
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,009
Get it off the table. We're eating here.

225
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,385
Ew!

226
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,096
Hey, Tommy.

227
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,056
When you left, did you see Barb?

228
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,559
- What?
- Barbara.

229
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,102
She's not here today.

230
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,314
I seriously have no idea
who you're talking about.

231
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,566
Come on, don't be an
ass, man. Did you...

232
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,485
Did you see her leave last night or not?

233
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,197
No, she was gone when we left.

234
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,741
Probably couldn't stand
listening to all that moaning.

235
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,661
Oh, Steve!

236
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:30,165
- Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve!
- Oh, Steve...

237
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,334
Oh, Steve!

238
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,097
Okay, chill.

239
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:38,006
Listen... I'm sure she's
fine. She's probably just...

240
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,592
she's probably just, like,
skipping or something.

241
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,093
Yeah.

242
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,762
Yeah, probably.

243
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,074
- How about this one?
- Too big for the sling.

244
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:08,411
So, do you think Eleven was born
with her powers, like the X-Men,

245
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,790
or do you think she acquired
them, like... like Green Lantern?

246
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:15,001
She's not a superhero. She's a weirdo.

247
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,504
Why does that matter?
The X-Men are weirdos.

248
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,048
If you love her so much,
why don't you marry her?

249
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,466
What are you talking about?

250
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,051
- Mike, seriously?
- What?

251
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,178
You look at her all, like...

252
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,722
"Hi, El! El! El! El!

253
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,182
I love you so much!

254
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,346
- Would you marry me?"
- Shut up, Lucas.

255
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,872
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.

256
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,522
What are you losers doing back here?

257
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,285
Probably looking for
their missing friend.

258
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:40,151
That's not funny. It's
serious. He's in danger.

259
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,405
I hate to break it to you,
Toothless, but he's not in danger.

260
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,865
He's dead. That's what my dad says.

261
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,243
He said he was probably
killed by some other queer.

262
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,413
Come on. Just ignore them.

263
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,295
Watch where you're going, Frogface.

264
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,631
- You all right?
- Yeah.

265
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,930
Hey.

266
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,515
How about this one?

267
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,102
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

268
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,604
Yeah, this is it.

269
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,606
Oh, yeah.

270
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:20,066
Yeah, this is the monster killer!

271
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,192
Whoo!

272
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,428
Hey.

273
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,139
Oh, hey.

274
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,265
- Hey!
- Hey, Karen.

275
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:35,350
Hi...

276
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:38,978
I brought you a casserole.

277
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,190
Oh! Thank you, uh...

278
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,819
Uh, you wanna... come in?

279
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,171
Hey, Marissa. How you doin'?

280
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:08,633
You have a lot of nerve showing up here.

281
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,051
What?

282
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,137
You could have at least called, said,

283
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,683
"Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out.
Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."

284
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,269
Yep.

285
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:24,315
I'm sorry. Uh...

286
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,776
Maybe we could go out again next week?

287
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,409
Newspapers? You guys got
newspapers around here?

288
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,912
We have the New York Times,
the Post, all the big ones.

289
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,539
Organized by year and topic.

290
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,333
You can find the corresponding
microfiche in the reading room.

291
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,211
Okay, we're looking for anything
on the Hawkins National Laboratory.

292
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,335
Well, shouldn't you be
looking for that missing kid?

293
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,528
Yeah. We are.

294
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,343
Uh, so, why don't you
start with the Times,

295
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:53,845
and we'll check out the Post.

296
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,397
The librarian?

297
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,903
Will always loved Christmas, you know.

298
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,280
So I thought if I...
I put the lights up...

299
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,950
I don't know, he...

300
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,701
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

301
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,286
It's silly, I know.

302
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,414
No. No, it's not silly.

303
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:05,500
How is Jonathan holding up?

304
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,545
You know, he's good at
taking care of himself.

305
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,588
He always has been, you know?

306
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:11,923
I...

307
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,176
I mean, he thinks I'm
losing my mind, but...

308
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,805
Is something the matter?

309
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,223
Uh, no.

310
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,558
No, I just...

311
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,852
We're having electrical problems.

312
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:25,061
Joyce.

313
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,564
I want you to know something.

314
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,775
If you need anything, anything at all...

315
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,402
Ted and I are here for you.

316
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,529
Thank you. Thanks.

317
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,905
Okay.

318
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,741
How... how's Mike dealing with this?

319
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,618
Is he, uh, okay?

320
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,663
Mike? Uh... I don't know.

321
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,290
He skipped school yesterday.

322
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,334
He's never done anything
like that before.

323
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,959
Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

324
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,130
Oh, where's Holly?

325
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,436
Hey!

326
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,188
She shouldn't be here.

327
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,775
Oh, I'm sorry. She's quite
the explorer these days.

328
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,111
- Wait, did you see something?
- Yeah.

329
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,863
What did... what did you see? Tell me.

330
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,823
- What did you see? What...
- Joyce... Joyce!

331
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:04,786
Listen... Karen, thank
you for the casserole,

332
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,120
but I need you to leave.

333
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:07,914
Okay?

334
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,501
Come on, come on, come on...

335
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,546
- Hello?
- Hi.

336
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,507
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

337
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,967
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

338
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,093
Good. I'm good.

339
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:23,388
Um, I was just wondering,
uh, is Barb there?

340
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,431
Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.

341
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,893
But she did come home,
right? After the vigil?

342
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:32,230
No, she said she was
staying with you last night.

343
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:36,109
Right, yes. She did, sorry.

344
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:39,362
I meant, did she come home this morning?

345
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,615
I think she left some textbooks
and she was gonna go pick them up.

346
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,909
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

347
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:49,914
Do... Do you know what? I just
remembered... she's at the library.

348
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:53,626
Nancy, will you please have her
call me as soon as you find her?

349
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,670
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

350
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,089
Sorry to bother you.

351
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,146
Hey, man.

352
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,272
What's going on?

353
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,357
Nicole here was, uh,
telling us about your work.

354
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,801
- We've heard great things.
- Yeah, sounds cool.

355
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:22,530
And we'd just love to take a look.
You know, as... connoisseurs of art.

356
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,574
I don't know what you're talking about.

357
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,097
- Oh, no? Oh...
- Hey.

358
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:28,161
Please, give me my bag. No, just...

359
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,924
Man, he is totally trembling. He
must really have something to hide.

360
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:32,040
Here we go.

361
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,833
Ah...

362
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:34,917
Here we go.

363
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,712
- Oh, man.
- Let me see.

364
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:40,548
Dude.

365
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,900
Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

366
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:45,743
- I was looking for my brother.
- No.

367
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,170
No, this is called stalking. Mmm-hmm.

368
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:51,434
- What's going on?
- Here's the starring lady.

369
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,643
What?

370
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:54,771
This creep was spying on us last night.

371
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,107
He was probably gonna
save this one for later.

372
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:06,657
See, you can tell that he
knows it was wrong, but...

373
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,785
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

374
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:10,828
It's hardwired into 'em.

375
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,790
You know, they just
can't help themselves.

376
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,752
So...

377
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,546
we'll just have to take away his toy.

378
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,757
- Steve...
- No, please, not the camera.

379
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,550
No, no, wait, wait... Tommy, Tommy.

380
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,553
It's okay.

381
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,640
Here you go, man.

382
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,522
Come on, let's go. The
game's about to start.

383
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,233
Boo.

384
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,611
Bye.

385
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,169
Hey, Nance!

386
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,504
Come on.

387
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,365
Three-one-five.

388
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:32,034
Three-one-five.

389
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,327
Three-one-five.

390
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,022
No! No!

391
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,399
Papa! Papa!

392
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:46,776
Papa!

393
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,945
Papa!

394
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,321
Papa!

395
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:54,992
No!

396
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:47,503
Incredible.

397
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:42,725
El!

398
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,228
You okay?

399
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,608
Hop on. We only have a few hours.

400
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:04,080
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

401
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:07,249
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

402
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,709
blow me."

403
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:11,273
Bull, if you did that, you'd
be in detention right now.

404
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:12,672
Saturday.

405
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,548
I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

406
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:15,792
Oh, he's so a virgin!

407
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,761
Maybe you should blow him,
Carol. Help your grades a bit.

408
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,840
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

409
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,433
I totally forgot.

410
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,102
I told my mom I would, um...

411
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,645
I would do something with her.

412
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,688
Well, what do you mean?
The game's about to start.

413
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,171
I'm sorry.

414
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:35,152
What the hell's wrong with her?

415
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:38,197
Maybe she freaked out when you
went all psycho on the psycho.

416
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,281
Oh, give me a break.

417
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,659
What'd you expect, dating Miss Perfect?

418
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,667
Why did they hurt you?

419
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:51,877
What?

420
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:55,464
Oh, that.

421
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:56,549
Uh...

422
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,300
I just fell at recess.

423
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:01,429
- Mike...
- Yeah?

424
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:02,972
Friends tell the truth.

425
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,019
I was tripped by this
mouth breather, Troy, okay?

426
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:10,563
Mouth breather?

427
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,565
Yeah, you know...

428
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:13,774
a dumb person.

429
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:15,025
A knucklehead.

430
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:16,193
Knucklehead?

431
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,906
I don't know why I just didn't
tell you. Everyone at school knows.

432
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,826
I just didn't want you to think
I was such a wastoid, you know?

433
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,036
- Mike...
- Yeah?

434
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,621
I understand.

435
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:29,957
Oh.

436
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,792
Okay, cool.

437
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,085
Cool.

438
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,484
Barb?

439
00:37:58,652 --> 00:37:59,987
Barb!

440
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,715
Barb?

441
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:31,727
Barb?

442
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:50,496
Barb?

443
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:53,499
Oh!

444
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:08,574
Will... are you here?

445
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,038
Okay, good, good, good, good.

446
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:15,998
Are you...

447
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:20,127
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

448
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,671
Can you do that for me, sweetie?

449
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:23,797
Can you do...

450
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,594
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

451
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,805
Baby, I need to know...

452
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,434
Are you alive?

453
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,693
Are you safe?

454
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:59,124
I need to know where to find you,
honey. Where... where are you?

455
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,670
Can you... can you
tell me where you are?

456
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,088
Can you...

457
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:08,759
Please, baby. I need to
find you. Tell me what to do.

458
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,721
Please just...

459
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:17,142
Will...

460
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,296
Hey! You're home
early! How was the game?

461
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,719
Nancy? What's the matter?

462
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:53,887
It's Barb.

463
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:55,180
I think...

464
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,475
something happened.

465
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,478
Something terrible.

466
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,898
I don't know, Chief.

467
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:06,233
What don't you know?

468
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:09,486
This lady, Terry Ives,
sounds like a real nut to me.

469
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,615
Her kid was taken for LSD
mind control experiments?

470
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:14,783
She's been discredited.

471
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,227
Claim was thrown out...

472
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,377
Okay, forget about her.

473
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,496
Take a look at this.

474
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,790
- Dr. Martin Brenner.
- Who?

475
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,500
Brenner.

476
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:25,502
He runs Hawkins Lab.

477
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:26,628
Okay.

478
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,215
You don't find that interesting?

479
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:31,717
Not really.

480
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,678
He was involved in some hippie
crap back in the day, so what?

481
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:38,932
No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.

482
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:41,143
Doesn't mean he had
anything to do with our kid.

483
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:44,229
Come on. Look at that.
Hospital gowns. All of 'em.

484
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:46,713
Now, that piece of fabric that
the teacher found by the pipe.

485
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,717
That sure looked like a
hospital gown to me, huh?

486
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,028
- Am I wrong?
- I don't know, Chief.

487
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,446
Come on, man.

488
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,823
Work with me here.

489
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:57,493
I'm not saying that there's
some grand conspiracy.

490
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:58,827
I'm just...

491
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,958
I'm saying maybe something happened.

492
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:09,880
Maybe Will was in the wrong
place at the wrong time

493
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,882
and he saw something
that he shouldn't have.

494
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:15,636
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.

495
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,263
Hey, Powell, is the chief with you?

496
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,557
Hopper here. What do you got?

497
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:05,185
Here.

498
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:07,813
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

499
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:09,439
Hiding.

500
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:12,151
No, no, this is where he lives.

501
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:14,236
He's missing from here. Understand?

502
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:19,804
- What are we doing here?
- She said he's hiding here.

503
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:21,577
Um... no!

504
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,329
I swear, if we walked all the
way out here for nothing...

505
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:25,914
That's exactly what we did.

506
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:29,042
I told you she didn't know what
the hell she was talking about!

507
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,837
Why did you bring us here?

508
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,132
- Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then?

509
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:36,800
Call the cops, like we
should have done yesterday.

510
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:38,924
- We are not calling the cops!
- Hey, guys?

511
00:44:38,948 --> 00:44:40,762
- What other choice do we have?
- Guys!

512
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:50,689
Will...

513
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,000
Okay.

514
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,419
Okay, baby, talk to me.

515
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,212
Talk to me. Where are you?

516
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,883
"R." Good, good, good, good.

517
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,343
That's good. Come on, come on.

518
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:21,178
"I...

519
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:23,388
G...

520
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:25,140
H... T...

521
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,100
H...

522
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:28,185
E...

523
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,312
R... E... "

524
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:31,980
"Right here."

525
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,107
"Right here"?

526
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:36,860
I don't know what that means.

527
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:39,237
I need you to tell me what to do.

528
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:40,322
What should I do?

529
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:43,659
How do I get to you? How do
I find you? What should I do?

530
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,144
Oh, Jesus.

531
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:02,404
Oh, God. Please tell
me it's not the kid.

532
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,351
It's not Will. It can't be.

533
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:44,488
It's Will. It's really Will.

534
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,412
Mike...

535
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:54,664
"Mike"? "Mike," what?

536
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:56,875
You were supposed to
help us find him alive.

537
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,376
You said he was alive!

538
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,878
Why did you lie to us?

539
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,172
What's wrong with you?

540
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,007
What is wrong with you?

541
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,301
- Mike...
- What?

542
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,224
Mike, come on. Don't do this, man.

543
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,350
Mike...

544
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:16,103
Mike, where are you going? Mike!

545
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:22,275
Mike!

546
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:34,287
Mom?

547
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:38,250
Mom, what happened?

548
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,584
It's okay.

549
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:41,920
Hey.

550
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:48,510
Michael?

551
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:51,471
What's wrong?
