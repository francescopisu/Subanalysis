2
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,869
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

3
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,089
- Move it.
- Let's get out of here!

4
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,218
Headed down Poplar, toward Main.

5
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,153
- Get 'em off of us, Mick!
- I'm working on it!

6
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,825
- The alley. To your right.
- Okay.

7
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,414
Shit!

8
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,917
Shit! Shit! Shit!

9
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,959
Shit!

10
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,187
Okay. Okay.

11
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,735
- Son of a bitch! We got more!
- Oh, shit!

12
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,571
They're headed down 7th.

13
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,618
Do something, Kali. Do something!

14
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,996
Next right. There's a tunnel. Take it.

15
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,755
We got these bastards now!

16
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
Boom.

17
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,691
Holy shit!

18
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,320
Shit! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

19
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,535
What the hell is wrong with you, Adams?
The hell are you doing?

20
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,788
Adams! Come on.
What the hell? Why'd you stop?

21
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,166
Adams! Adams!

22
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,834
Adams, I'm talkin' to you!

23
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,923
Adams! Adams!

24
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,858
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

25
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,488
A police chase rocked downtown Pittsburgh
earlier this evening...

26
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,242
- Another stupid penny!
- Dusty, watch it! You almost hit Mews.

27
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,369
- Can I please check under your cushions?
- Dusty.

28
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,247
Mom, please? It's an emergency!

29
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,917
Who's your buddy? Who's your buddy?

30
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,421
Love you, Mom.

31
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,799
Lucas, you copy? I've got four quarters.
What's your haul?

32
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,802
Take your puny haul
and multiply it by five.

33
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,887
- How?
- While you were scrounging around

34
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,432
like a homeless bum,
I mowed Old Man Humphrey's lawn.

35
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,934
Old Man Humphrey's got that kinda cash?

36
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,894
- Just call Mike already.
- You call Mike.

37
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,939
I have to go take a shower
from doing real work, like a man.

38
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,190
Over and out.

39
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,736
Mike, do you copy? Mike, do you copy?

40
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,113
Yeah. Yeah, I copy.

41
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,490
- What are you doing on this channel?
- Nothing.

42
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,992
Lucas and I have six bucks total.

43
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,453
- What's your haul?
- Shit! I don't know yet.

44
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,539
- What do you mean you don't know yet?
- Hold on. Call Will.

45
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,259
What the hell are you doing?

46
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,801
I'll pay you back!

47
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,265
- Bye!
- Mike!

48
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,103
- Mike! Get back here!
- Hey. No running in the house.

49
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,772
What is going on?

50
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,357
Mike! Mike!

51
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,072
Asshole!

52
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,762
- Hey!
- Okay. So, I'll pick you up in two hours.

53
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,181
- That's 9:00 on the dot, okay?
- Okay.

54
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,064
If anything happens,
if you need to come home,

55
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,352
just ask them to use their phone
and call home. Okay?

56
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,896
- Don't...
- Don't walk or bike home. I know.

57
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,190
- Okay, but, sweetie...
- Mom, I have to go.

58
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,608
Have fun.

59
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,411
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

60
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,956
Oh, Jesus!
I'm in unchartered territory here, guys.

61
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,792
- Down! Down! Down!
- I'm going! I'm going!

62
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,049
I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!

63
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,262
Okay. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

64
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,641
No. No. No!

65
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,811
No! No! No!
I hate this overpriced bullshit!

66
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,980
Son of a bitch! Piece of shit!

67
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,524
You're not nimble enough.
But you'll get there one day.

68
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,610
But until then,
Princess Daphne is still mine.

69
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,197
Whatever. I'm still tops
on Centipede and Dig Dug.

70
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,490
You sure about that?

71
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,951
Sure about what?

72
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,622
You're kidding me. No, no, no.

73
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,834
Move! Move! No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, no! No! No!

74
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,381
- 751,300 points!
- That's impossible.

75
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,884
- Who is Mad Max?
- Better than you.

76
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,970
- Is it you?
- You know I despise Dig Dug.

77
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,930
- Then who is it?
- Yeah, spill it, Keith.

78
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:57,310
You want information,
then I need something in return.

79
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,357
No, no, no. No way.
You're not getting a date with her.

80
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,026
Mike, come on. Just get him the date.

81
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,861
I'm not prostituting my sister!

82
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,590
- But it's for a good cause.
- No, don't get him the date. Know what?

83
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,450
He's gonna spread his nasty-ass rash
to your whole family.

84
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,953
Acne isn't a rash and it isn't contagious,
you prepubescent wastoid.

85
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,165
Oh, I'm a wastoid?
She wouldn't go on a date with you.

86
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,667
You make, like, what? $2.50 an hour?

87
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,671
- Nice perm.
- Gonna make fun of my hair?

88
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,051
Hey. Hey, guys, do you see the...

89
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,217
Will! Are you okay?

90
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,265
Yeah. I just...

91
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,811
- I needed some air.
- Come on. You're up on Dig Dug.

92
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,021
Let's take that top score back, huh?

93
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,302
Good morning, Jim.

94
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,640
- Jim. Hold on a second. We need to talk.
- Get away from me.

95
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,934
Okay, no... I think you really
wanna hear this.

96
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,229
- Get away from me.
- Trust me. I only want five minutes!

97
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,816
Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek.
We all want things.

98
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,651
This isn't a laughing matter, Jim.

99
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,278
This is serious, okay?

100
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,280
I really got something here.
I'm telling you!

101
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,698
- Hey. Mornin', Chief.
- Morning.

102
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,866
Morning, Murray.

103
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,493
Got any proof
on your butt-probin' aliens yet, Murray?

104
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,913
I believe there was, and may still be,

105
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,832
a Russian spy presence in Hawkins.

106
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,375
Russian spies!

107
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:32,048
Are the spies in cahoots with the aliens?
Or how do they fit in here? I'm confused.

108
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,925
I'm talking multiple reports now.
Multiple reports, okay?

109
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,510
Of a Russian child in Hawkins.

110
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,681
- A child? What are you talking about?
- A girl who may have psionic abilities.

111
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,183
- "Psionic"?
- Psychic.

112
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,352
What about that girl
that made that kid pee himself?

113
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,311
- A prank.
- What girl?

114
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,714
Wasn't a prank.

115
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,648
You got five minutes. Not a second more.

116
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,734
I talked to a Big Buy ex-employee

117
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,613
who said some little girl
shattered the door with her mind.

118
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,572
I heard that story.

119
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,784
Did you hear the one about the fat man
with the beard who climbs down chimneys?

120
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,370
Then last month,
a co-worker of Ted Wheeler's claims

121
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,915
some Russian girl with a shaved head
was hiding in his basement.

122
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,249
Ted now denies this.

123
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,877
- Oh, wow. That's a surprise.
- But it connects.

124
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,379
- Enlighten me.
- This girl,

125
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,048
she's some kind
of a Russian weapon, right?

126
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,175
Barbara sees this girl,
tries to help her, perhaps.

127
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,136
But before she can,
the Russians find them, take them...

128
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,265
Wait. You're telling me Barbara Holland
was kidnapped by Russian spies.

129
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,893
- Kidnapped. Killed.
- Killed?

130
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,395
- Don't you get it, Jim?
- No.

131
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,523
This has potentially
international implications.

132
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,151
I'm talking a full-on Russian invasion
right here in Hawkins.

133
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,324
Do you have any proof of this girl?
I mean, has anybody seen her recently?

134
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,593
These are separate...

135
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,827
Excuse me. Sorry.

136
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,036
- Okay.
- Hello?

137
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,747
Merrill called,
wants you to check out his pumpkins.

138
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,291
- Says they've been contaminated...
- All right.

139
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,003
by his vengeful neighbor, Eugene.
You're welcome.

140
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,090
I'm sorry. I really hate to do this,
but I gotta run.

141
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,551
- It's an emergency.
- You gave me five minutes.

142
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,314
Yeah, listen, you know what?
I liked your alien theory a lot better.

143
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,930
And you want my advice?

144
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,100
Why don't you stop bleeding
those people dry and go home? All right?

145
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,103
- I am not bleeding anyone... dry.
- Listen to me. Go home.

146
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,739
It's crap, I know.

147
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,367
No, it's not crap.

148
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,413
- It's not good.
- It's going to be.

149
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,250
Just... It needs some reorganizing.

150
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,169
- Can I mark on it?
- Yeah, I guess.

151
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,879
So, in the first paragraph,

152
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,965
you used the basketball game
versus Northern

153
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,676
as a metaphor for your life,
which is great.

154
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,304
But then, around here,

155
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,432
you start talking about your granddad's
experiences in the war.

156
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,728
And I...
I don't see how they're connected.

157
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,229
It connects because...

158
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,648
because, you know, we both won.

159
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,113
- Do you think I should start from scratch?
- No. I mean...

160
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,991
When's the deadline?

161
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,910
It's tomorrow for early application.

162
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,245
Can you come and help me tonight?

163
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,623
We have our dinner tonight, remember?

164
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,167
- Oh, my God!
- We already canceled last week.

165
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,631
- You don't have to go. Just work on this.
- No, no, no. What's the point?

166
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,967
- Hey, calm down.
- I'm calm. I'm calm.

167
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,761
I'm just being honest. You know, I mean...

168
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,389
- I'll end up working for my dad anyway.
- That's not true.

169
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,273
I don't know, Nance.
Is that such a bad thing?

170
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,062
There's insurance and benefits
and all that adult stuff.

171
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,485
And if I took it, you know,
I could be around for your senior year.

172
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,695
- Steve...
- Just to look after you a little bit.

173
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,781
Make sure you don't forget
about this pretty face.

174
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,742
Nance, I'm serious.

175
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,167
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

176
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,419
Who is that?

177
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,671
I have no idea.

178
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,132
But would you check out that ass?

179
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,593
Just look at it go.

180
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,201
Meet the human brain.

181
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,621
I know. I know, it doesn't look like much.

182
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,540
A little gross even, right?
But consider this.

183
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:21,086
There are a hundred billion cells
inside of this miracle of evolution.

184
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,588
All working as one.

185
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,383
No, no, I did not misspeak.
I did not stutter.

186
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,886
A hundred billion.

187
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,139
Ah, this must be our new student.

188
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,599
Indeed. All yours.

189
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,143
All right. Hold up.
You don't get away that easy.

190
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,770
Come on up. Don't be shy.

191
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,897
Dustin, drum roll.

192
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,110
Class, please welcome,
all the way from sunny California,

193
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:50,115
the latest passenger to join us
on our curiosity voyage, Maxine.

194
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,326
- It's Max.
- Sorry?

195
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,037
Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max.

196
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,957
- Mad Max.
- Well, all aboard, Max.

197
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,229
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

198
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,774
Do you have these in any other colors?
I'm not a big fan of orange.

199
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,234
Hmm...

200
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,527
I'll have to check in back.

201
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,659
Oh, shit!

202
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,122
- You're gonna get me fired.
- That's my master plan.

203
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,885
Get you fired so I can hire you
and we won't have to hide back here.

204
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,963
Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work.

205
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,841
I know. I'm sorry.
I can't stop thinking about you.

206
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,343
- It's crazy. I feel like a teenager.
- Me, too.

207
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,929
You know, in high school,
you didn't know who I was.

208
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,889
Come on.

209
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,851
Bob, I have to get back to work.

210
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,185
Okay.

211
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:05,607
Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies,
and I'll see you tonight for movie night.

212
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,942
Jonathan's night to pick?

213
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,318
- Yes.
- Okay.

214
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,330
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

215
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,207
Hey, look, a green one.

216
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,546
Tell Jonathan not to pick anything scary.
I hate scary movies.

217
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,232
You're saying
this was fine yesterday?

218
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,317
Fine?

219
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,278
These were prize winners, Chief.
You should've seen 'em.

220
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,739
For the life of me,
I couldn't figure out what happened.

221
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,033
And then I remembered... Eugene.

222
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,243
What about him?

223
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,927
He's been complaining about me
to just about anyone who'll listen.

224
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,664
Why's that?

225
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,876
Well, he started this
"Pick Your Pumpkin" thing.

226
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,503
Acted like it was trademarked.

227
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,714
I said, "Hire yourself a damn lawyer.
See how far that gets you."

228
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,759
You're telling me that nice old Eugene

229
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:18,430
came out here after dark
and doused your field with poison?

230
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,640
Not Eugene himself.

231
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,684
- I'm thinking one of his field hands.
- Uh-huh.

232
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:27,231
Listen, Chief, I don't go throwing around
accusations lightly. You know me.

233
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,609
This happening the day before Halloween,
when sales are peaking?

234
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,194
That's a hell of a coincidence.

235
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,530
Hell of a coincidence.

236
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,075
You got somebody working on that field?

237
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,538
Yeah, screw you, too.

238
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,417
Hey. Be there.

239
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,254
- Hey, Nancy.
- Hey! Thanks.

240
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,715
- Oh, could I get one more?
- Yeah, sure.

241
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,178
You're coming to this.

242
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,097
"Come and get sheet faced."

243
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,474
No, I'm not.

244
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,313
I can't let you sit all alone Halloween.
That's just not acceptable.

245
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,107
Well, you can relax.
I'm not gonna be alone.

246
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,860
I'm going trick-or-treating with Will.

247
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,737
- All night?
- Yeah.

248
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,490
No, no way. You're gonna be home by 8:00,

249
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,997
listening to the Talking Heads
and reading Vonnegut or something.

250
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,624
Sounds like a nice night.

251
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:13,086
Jonathan, just come. I mean, who knows,
you might even, like, meet someone.

252
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,052
- Oh, my God! Take those stupid things off.
- I missed you.

253
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,471
- It's been like an hour.
- Tell me about it.

254
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,102
Okay. Okay, okay. God.

255
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,521
Sorry.

256
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,951
- There's no way that's Mad Max.
- Yeah. Girls don't play video games.

257
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:47,537
And even if they did,
you can't get 750,000 points on Dig Dug.

258
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,790
- It's impossible.
- But her name is Max.

259
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,668
- So what?
- So, how many Maxes do you know?

260
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,962
- I don't know.
- Zero. That's how many.

261
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,213
She shows up at school

262
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,174
the day after someone with her same name
breaks our top score.

263
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,136
- I mean, you kidding me?
- Exactly. So she's gotta be Mad Max.

264
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,555
And plus she skateboards,
so she's pretty awesome.

265
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,100
Awesome?
You haven't even spoken a word to her.

266
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:12,187
I don't have to. I mean, look at her.
Shit, I've lost the target.

267
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,814
Oh! There.

268
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,499
Got it. There we go.

269
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,671
"Stop spying on me, creeps."

270
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,964
Well, shit.

271
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,090
William Byers.

272
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,843
Your mother's here.

273
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,076
You guys think he's okay?

274
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,412
He's always weird
when he has to go in.

275
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,165
I don't know. He's quiet today.

276
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,167
He's always quiet.

277
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,812
You feeling any better?

278
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,315
Will?

279
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,525
Huh?

280
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,070
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

281
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,532
Hey. What did we talk about, huh?
You've got to stop it with the sorries.

282
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:52,287
Sorry. I mean, yeah, I know.

283
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:58,043
And listen, you know, there's nothing
to be nervous about, you know.

284
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,922
Just tell 'em what you felt last night
and what you saw.

285
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:07,552
Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole time.
So it's gonna be okay. Okay?

286
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,639
Okay.

287
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,369
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

288
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,830
Hey.

289
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,043
Sir Will, how are you?

290
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,837
Mom. Pop.

291
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,548
Let's take a look,
see what's going on here.

292
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,177
I see you shaved off a pound
since we saw you last.

293
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,013
Must be making room
for all that Halloween candy.

294
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,222
What's your favorite candy?

295
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,850
Desert island candy,
if you had to pick one?

296
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,393
- I don't know.
- Come on.

297
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,395
Life or death situation,
what would you pick?

298
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,981
- I guess... Reese's Pieces.
- Reese's Pieces.

299
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,817
Good call. Good call.

300
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,194
I'm more of a Mounds guy,

301
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:51,490
but I gotta say, peanut butter
and chocolate, come on, hard to beat that.

302
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,408
All right, tell me
what's going on with you.

303
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,160
Tell me about this episode you had.

304
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:01,666
Well, my friends were there
and then they just weren't,

305
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,418
and I was back there again.

306
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,295
In the Upside Down?

307
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,423
All right, so what happened next?

308
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:15,013
I heard this noise, and so I went outside,
and it was worse.

309
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,348
How was it worse?

310
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,308
There was this storm.

311
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,023
Okay. So how did you feel
when you saw the storm?

312
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,107
I felt...

313
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,150
frozen.

314
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,324
- Heart racing?
- Just frozen.

315
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,410
Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch?

316
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,497
No. Like how you feel when you're scared,

317
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,960
and you can't breathe or talk
or do anything.

318
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:49,047
I felt... felt this evil,
like it was looking at me.

319
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,801
It was evil?

320
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,096
Well...
What do you think the evil wanted?

321
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,430
To kill.

322
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,809
To kill you?

323
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,435
Not me.

324
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,314
Everyone else.

325
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,371
All right,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

326
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,374
It's probably gonna get worse
before it gets better.

327
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:28,169
Worse? He's already had
two episodes this month.

328
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,797
He'll likely have more
before the month is out.

329
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,592
It's called the Anniversary Effect.
And we've seen this with soldiers.

330
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,096
The anniversary of an event brings back
traumatic memories.

331
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,640
Sort of opens up
the neurological floodgates, so to speak.

332
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,350
So what does this mean for the kid?

333
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,311
He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares?

334
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,314
Yeah, that.
Maybe some personality changes.

335
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,066
He might get irritable. He might lash out.

336
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,568
What do we do when that happens?

337
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:56,031
Okay. Well, from what we know
about post-traumatic stress...

338
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,909
And we're still learning, okay?
Just treat him normally.

339
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,496
Be patient with him.
Don't pressure him to talk.

340
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,998
Just let him lead the way.

341
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,293
I'm sorry, what you're saying
is it's gonna get worse and worse

342
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,587
and we're just supposed to pretend
it's not happening?

343
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,339
It sounds counterintuitive, I know.

344
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,800
But I assure you that is really
the best thing you can do for him.

345
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,600
Listen. I understand what you went through
last year. I get it.

346
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:27,312
But those people are gone.
They're gone. Okay?

347
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,522
So if we're gonna get through this,

348
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,818
I just... I need you to realize
I'm on your side.

349
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,614
I need you to trust me.

350
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,242
"Trust me"?

351
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,328
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, I know.

352
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:47,165
But, you know, university gives out
a degree, this guy's got it.

353
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:51,252
And look, that post-traumatic stuff
he's talking about, that stuff is real.

354
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,839
He's gonna be okay. All right?

355
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,134
How's Bob the Brain?

356
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,303
Don't call him that.

357
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,888
Sorry. Old habit.

358
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,516
He's good. We're good.

359
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,684
Good. I'm happy for you.

360
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,853
Really. Hey...

361
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,856
Things get worse, you call me first.

362
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,442
You call me.

363
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,069
Okay.

364
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,176
They're ready for you, sir.

365
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,193
- Patty.
- Sam.

366
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,653
Afternoon, sir.

367
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:03,074
- Looks like another hot one today, huh?
- Never gets old, sir.

368
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,040
Still no sign?

369
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,166
Jack shit.

370
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:58,379
- Oh! Damn it. My mom's gonna murder me.
- So go home. I'll radio if she comes.

371
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,674
Oh, yeah, nice try. You just want me
out of here so you can make your move.

372
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,718
- Oh, 'cause you're such a threat.
- That's right.

373
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,221
She will not be able to resist
these pearls.

374
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,850
- Ten o'clock. Ten o'clock.
- What?

375
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,695
- They're arguing. They're arguing.
- Oh, my God.

376
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,029
I see that. I don't even know
why you need those.

377
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,489
God. You're so stupid.

378
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,423
She's incredible.

379
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,510
She's...

380
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,679
Mad Max.

381
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,311
After dinner, I want you to pick out
your toys for the yard sale.

382
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,146
- Fine.
- Two boxes' worth.

383
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,023
- Two boxes?
- You heard me.

384
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm fine with you giving away a couple,

385
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,069
but the other ones have
way too much emotional value.

386
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,738
- Emotional value?
- They're hunks of plastic, Michael.

387
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,073
You already took away my Atari.

388
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,756
Didn't wanna lose more toys,
you shouldn't have stolen from Nancy.

389
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,244
I didn't steal. I borrowed.

390
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,927
Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr. Kowalski
last week either, right?

391
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,541
Or plagiarize that essay?
Or graffiti the bathroom stall?

392
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,334
Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.

393
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,005
So if your friend jumps off a cliff,
you're gonna jump, too?

394
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,884
We know you've had a hard year, Michael.
But we've been patient.

395
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,678
This isn't strike one.
This isn't even strike three.

396
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,306
It's strike 20. You're on the bench, son.

397
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,143
And if it'd been my coach,
you'd be lucky to still be on the team.

398
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,313
Two boxes. Two.

399
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,363
Okay. Ready?

400
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,407
Yeah.

401
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,201
Okay.

402
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,668
I'm so sorry
I didn't get to cook.

403
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,671
I was gonna make that baked ziti
you guys like so much,

404
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,049
but I just forgot about the time,
and before you know it,

405
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,717
"Oh, my God, it's five o'clock."

406
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,762
- It's fine. It's great.
- Right. I love KFC.

407
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:16,601
So, I noticed a "For Sale" sign
out in your yard.

408
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,228
Is that the neighbors', or...

409
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,814
- You wanna tell them?
- Go ahead.

410
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,946
We hired a man named Murray Bauman.
Have either of you heard of him?

411
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,199
- No.
- No, I don't think so.

412
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,827
He was an investigative journalist
for the Chicago Sun-Times.

413
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,204
He's pretty well known.

414
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,833
Anyway, he's freelance now,
and he agreed to take the case.

415
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,878
That's... That's great.

416
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,881
No, that's really... That's great, right?

417
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,426
Um, what exactly does that mean?

418
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,471
Means he's gonna do
what that lazy son of a bitch Jim Hop...

419
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,808
Sorry.

420
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,521
What the Hawkins police haven't been
capable of doing.

421
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,483
Means we have a real detective
on the case.

422
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,567
It means...

423
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,445
we're going to find our Barb.

424
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,116
If anyone can find her, it's this man.

425
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:18,621
He already has leads.
By God, he's worth every last penny.

426
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,958
Is that why you're selling the house?

427
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,460
Don't worry about us, sweetie. We're fine.

428
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,337
More than fine.

429
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:30,258
For the first time in a long time,
we're hopeful.

430
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,347
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

431
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,027
- It's finger-lickin' good.
- Mmm.

432
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,325
El, are you there? El?

433
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,872
It's me. It's Mike.

434
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,627
It's day 352, 7:40 p.m.

435
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,213
I'm still here.

436
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,637
If you're out there, say something.
Or give me a sign.

437
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,474
I won't even say anything.
Just... I wanna know if you're okay.

438
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,647
I'm so stupid.

439
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,568
Mike.

440
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,030
- Mike?
- Hello, is that you?

441
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,200
Yeah, it's me, Dustin.
What're you doing on this channel again?

442
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,704
I've been trying to reach you all day.
We were right. Max is Mad Max.

443
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,247
- Yeah, I'm busy.
- But...

444
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,793
- What do we do now?
- We stick to the plan.

445
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,878
Mike's not gonna like it.

446
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,088
Last time I checked,
our party is not a dictatorship.

447
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,215
- It's a democracy.
- What if Max says no?

448
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,093
How can Max say no to these?

449
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,720
I told you to stop that.

450
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,430
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Later.

451
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,490
Mews!

452
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,582
Mews.

453
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,682
- Stop. Stop!
- What?

454
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,060
Come on, you gotta get used to it.
This is the future.

455
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,145
Well, put the future down
and get me a clean bowl.

456
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:22,573
Hey, bud. I didn't know
what you'd like, so I got a variety.

457
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,660
- Take your pick.
- Whatever you want.

458
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,911
All right.

459
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,540
What are you working on?

460
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:36,128
Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy?

461
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,508
- Me.
- Did someone call you that?

462
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:45,763
Hey. You can talk to me.
You know that, right?

463
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,599
Whatever happened.
Will, come on, talk to me.

464
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,643
- Stop treating me like that.
- What? Like what?

465
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,104
Like everyone else.
Like there's something wrong with me.

466
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,939
What are you talking about?

467
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,275
Mom, Dustin, Lucas. Everyone.

468
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,402
They all treat me like I'm gonna break.

469
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,071
Like I'm a baby.
Like I can't handle things on my own.

470
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:06,409
It doesn't help. It just makes me feel
like more of a freak.

471
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,662
- You're not a freak.
- Yeah, I am.

472
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,580
I am.

473
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,586
You know what? You're right.

474
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,506
You are a freak.

475
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,801
- What?
- No, I'm serious. You're a freak.

476
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:28,514
But what? Do you wanna be normal?
Do you wanna be just like everyone else?

477
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,725
Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak.

478
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,019
Is that why you don't have any friends?

479
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,230
I have friends, Will.

480
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,441
Then why are you
always hanging out with me?

481
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,111
Because you're my best friend, all right?

482
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:46,282
And I would rather be best friends
with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody.

483
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,700
You know what I mean?

484
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,910
Okay, look...

485
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,415
Who would you rather be friends with?
Bowie or Kenny Rogers?

486
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,708
Ugh.

487
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,960
Exactly. It's no contest.

488
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,213
The thing is, nobody normal

489
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,758
ever accomplished anything meaningful
in this world.

490
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,427
- You got it?
- Well...

491
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,014
- some people like Kenny Rogers.
- Kenny Rogers.

492
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,725
I love Kenny Rogers.

493
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,311
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

494
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,482
Mr. Mom. Perfect!

495
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,530
Where's Mommy keep the extra diapers?

496
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,205
Hey! Cowards.

497
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,631
Hey.

498
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,259
It's okay. Let it go.

499
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,719
Probably just a crank call.

500
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,806
- Okay.
- Holy mackerel!

501
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,933
- Let it go.
- Aw, man!

502
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,385
Hey, what'd we talk about?

503
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,639
No signal.

504
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,935
- What?
- No signal.

505
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,313
It's 8-1-5. You're late.

506
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,901
Yeah, I lost track of time.
I'll signal next time, all right?

507
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:18,781
Uh, and it's 8:15. It's not 8-1-5.

508
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,951
Eight-fifteen.

509
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,828
Now, what did we talk about?

510
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,958
Dinner first, then dessert. Always.

511
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,960
That's a rule.

512
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:34,963
Yeah?

513
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,424
Yes.
