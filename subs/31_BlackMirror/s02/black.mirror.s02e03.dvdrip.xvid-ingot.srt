00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,549
We can look into the Brown Knight.
But right now let's find more Waldo ideas.

176
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,792
The problem is, any guests we book

177
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,469
will be in on it. They know that
Waldo's a joke, the surprise is gone.

178
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,748
So, we think round that.

179
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,995
- But we can't just...
- TABLET: <i>Hey, boys and girls!</i>

181
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,152
<i>Yeah! Ha-ha!</i>

182
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,475

- He's awesome, isn't he?

183
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,431
- I mean, look...
<i>- Hey, boys and girls...</i>

184
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,914
...sod name in lights,
you're an app now, my brother.

185
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,155
<i>Yeah! Ha-ha!</i>

186
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,191
All right, Sara?
How's the think-tanking going?

187
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,355
- Good shit?
- Um...

188
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,119
- Yeah, we're making headway.
- Good.

189
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,913
I see our friend Monroe
is in the news again,

190
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,633
running in
the Stentonford by-election.

191
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,829
We should get Waldo down there.

192
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,551
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
actually.

193
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,751
We get a van with a screen
with the image of Waldo on the side.

194
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,279
Like it.

195
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,754
And then, when Monroe's
doing a meet and greet, we just

196
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,268
- turn up and just get under his skin.
- I love that, I love it.

197
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,788
- We've done Monroe.
- But it was a great bit.

198
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,637
I'm not dumb or clever enough
to be political...

199
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,309
Why don't we get Waldo
to stand for the by-election?

200
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,351
- Get people to vote for him?
- He's not real.

201
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,517
But people have stood as fictional
characters before. Do you think

202
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,391
Screaming Lord Sutch was his real name?

203
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,908
We just put "commonly known as"
on the ballot.

204
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,076
No-one's actually going to vote for him,
that's not the point.

205
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,554
The point is, we get to hang around,
we're there for the count.

206
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,479
(CLICKS FINGERS) Well, go on then, Sara,
whack it up there.

208
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,037
OK. Going live
in five... four... three... two...

209
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,755
Thank you so much for joining me this
morning. It's been incredibly informative

210
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,951
and I think we should have a little
round of applause for the children,

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,911
who were fantastic.

212
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,188
Thank you, Naomi.

217
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,068
I'd wear trainers myself
but I can't cos I haven't got feet.

- I'm sorry about this, Liam.
<i>- Hey, I'm being snubbed!</i>

He's 33 years old,

surprisingly quickly.

about six years ago,

432

and the others moved on
to better things,

433
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,150
but your main achievement
seems to have been

434
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,952
playing the part of a corn on the cob

435
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,072

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,074
Which by the way is easier than it looks.
Anyone could do it.

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,270
See, this is... this is the thing.

440
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,155
It's easy, what he does.

441
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,236
He mocks.

442
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,157
And when he can't think of

443
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,079
an authentic joke, which is actually
quite often, he just swears.

444
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,477
I think that this puppet's inclusion
on this panel

445
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,919
debases the process of debate,

446
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,679
and smothers any meaningful
discussion of the issues.

447
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,111
So I return to my original question -
is that really what this is for?

448
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,517
He has nothing to offer
and he has nothing to say.

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,998
TV: <i>And yet accusations</i>
<i>of vapidity aside,</i>

510
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,951
<i>it's clearly tapped a nerve.</i>

511
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,037
<i>In just three days,</i>
<i>Waldo has gone viral.</i>

512
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,949
<i>The video of his clash has already been</i>
<i>viewed over a million times on You Tube.</i>

513
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,676
<i>There are Facebook groups calling on Waldo</i>
<i>to form a national party.</i>

514
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,837
WALDO: <i>You're a joke.</i>
<i>You look less human than I do</i>

515
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,395
<i>and I'm a made-up bear with</i>
<i>a turquoise (BLEEP). What are you?</i>

516
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,079
<i>You're just an old attitude</i>
<i>with new hair.</i>

517
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,998
<i>Assuming you're my superior</i>
<i>because I'm not taking you seriously?</i>

518
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,598
<i>No-one takes you (BLEEP) seriously.</i>

519
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,551
(CHATTERING)

520
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,230
Oh, look, here he is,
the man of the moment!

521
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,952
How does it feel to be a phenomenon?

522
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,274
Shit-ifying.

523
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,595
You are everywhere, my son.

524
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,200
Twitter, the news...
Have you seen the poll?

525
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,390
You're in third place, mate.

526
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,953
You overtook that Lib Dem prick...

527
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,673
- Yeah, well, he's a glass of water.
- This is an opportunity, Jamie.

528
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,438
He knows my name now.

529
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,516
We could really do something here.

530
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,869
You know, everyone's pissed
with the status quo.

531
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,592
And Waldo gives that a voice.

532
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,677
Waldo's a bear. A blue bear.

533
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,393
Tell him, Tams.
We've been asked on <i>Consensus.</i>

534
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,711
It's a ten-minute one-to-one interview
with Phillip Crane.

535
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,636
Pitbull Crane?

536
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,513
- Big guns for big guns.
- Hello? I'm not a politician, OK?

537
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,913
I don't want to be a politician.

538
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,598
We know that you hate politics.

539
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,993
I don't hate them,
I'm just not interested in them.

540
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,554
You don't need to be
interested in them.

541
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,113
You just need to be Waldo.

542
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,039
And when Crane asks something tricky

543
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,036
and I look stupid
because I don't know how to answer?

544
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,390
You'll know the answer
because you have a producer.

545
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,194
Look... I can tell you what to say.

546
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,673
I can live Google any facts,

547
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,314
give you stats, quotes,
whatever else you need.

548
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,590
So you've got a safety net
for the concrete stuff

549
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,995
and the rest is Waldo,
and you can do that in your sleep.

550
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,678
You'll piss all over Crane.

551
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,280
He'll know there's a team around me,
he'll see it.

552
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,595
Yeah, good. I hope he does.
I hope he points a camera at it.

553
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,791
All the other MPs have got teams,
we're just more honest about it.

554
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,400
Now, come on. What d'you say? Eh?

555
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,474
- Jamie! Jamie!
- Why would I want to do this?

556
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,512
Look, the world is knackered
and you can do something about it.

557
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,993
I don't know what you're on about.

558
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,952
Waldo has got the attention of the young,
and the young don't give a shit

559
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,992
about anything except trainers
and pirating films.

560
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,759
Do you have any other astounding theories
about young people?

561
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,270
Yeah, yeah, I do, actually.
Look, they care about Waldo.

562
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,118
They'll vote for Waldo.
The video was a hit for a reason.

563
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,435
The video's embarrassing.
I'm embarrassed by it.

564
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,357
I was lashing out.
I wasn't even articulate.

565
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,550
- It doesn't matter.
- Or funny, which is almost worse.

566
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,874
We can build on that.

567
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,478
- Waldo's not real.
- Exactly!

568
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,717
That's what you said
that really hit home. He's not real,

569
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,273
but he's realer than all the others.

570
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,992
He doesn't stand for anything.

571
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,395
Yeah, well, at least
he doesn't pretend to.

572
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,749
Look we... we don't need politicians,

573
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,394
we've all got iPhones
and computers, right?

574
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,319
So any decision that has to be made,
any policy, we just put it online.

575
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,069
Let the people vote - thumbs up,
thumbs down, the majority wins.

576
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,953
That's a democracy. That's a...
that's an actual democracy.

577
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,753
So's YouTube, and I don't know
if you've seen it,

578
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,078
but the most popular video is a dog
farting the theme tune to <i>Happy Days.</i>

579
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,917
Well, today it's Waldo.

580
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,633
No. It's still the dog.

581
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,274
Listen, can you imagine
all the things we can change

582
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,515
if we fuck the politicians
out of the equation?

583
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,120
I've said what I've said
and now I'm shutting this door.

584
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,038
Do you know who owns Waldo?

585
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,072
I do, I own the rights.

586
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,598
He's my character.

587
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,995
Yeah, written for my show.

588
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,919
You're too frightened to take it
to the next level. Fine. I understand.

589
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,359
But also...

590
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,515
fuck off!

591
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,357
And watch me fly.

592
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,957
You own Waldo, you can't <i>be</i> Waldo.

593
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,788
(MIMICS WALDO) Eh, Jamie, Jamie,
Jamie, what's 'appenin'? Eh-eh-eh!

594
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,433
Pretty close, I'd say.

595
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,791
(AS WALDO) What's happenin'? Ahh!

596
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,229
Waldo-rrific, yeah!

597
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,269
Yeah!

598
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,912
(OWN VOICE)
Why is he going off left again?

599
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,269
- Because the...
- I know! I've got my...

600
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,515
- Put your thumb in the white thing.
- In there? OK.

601
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,596
That's not how that works.

602
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,878
First tonight, a figure -
or more accurately a character -

603
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,196
who's been causing an upset
in the Stentonford by-election.

604
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,798
Unlike the other candidates,

605
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,753
he has no party affiliation.
He doesn't even have a surname.

606
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,351
He is Waldo. A few weeks ago,
just a cult character in a comedy show.

607
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,949
Today, an official mascot
for protest voters.

608
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,558
Vote Waldo.

609
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,592
Cartoons don't play by the rules,
and Waldo's open disdain

610
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,200
for his opponents
has clearly struck a chord.

611
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,753
<i>Ha-ha-ha!</i>

612
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,473
Waldo, as a mascot
for the disenfranchised, aren't you

613
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,399
ultimately neutralising
seriously effective dissent?

614
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,591
<i>Can I have subtitles</i>
<i>for Mr Crane, please?</i>

615
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,438
By encouraging people not to care,
you're actively dangerous.

616
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,515
<i>Dangerous?</i>

617
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,357
<i>- You think the public can't be trusted?</i>
- No.

618
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,072
<i>Isn't that basically</i>
<i>you calling them twats?</i>

619
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,519
- No, I...
<i>- Bell-ends, then?</i>

620
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,676
Did you actually come here
for a discussion or...

621
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,757
<i>You're snooty for a glorified</i>
<i>Punch and Judy man, Phil.</i>

622
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,439
<i>You know you're gonna get your</i>
<i>best ratings in months cos I'm here.</i>

623
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,392
<i>To even get close to the figures</i>
<i>I'm gonna pull in for you tonight,</i>

624
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,238
<i>you'd have to fuck a prawn sandwich</i>
<i>live on air.</i>

625
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,748
<i>- Make a nice prawn cocktail.</i>
- Could we make a serious

626
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,949
political point that is...

627
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,592
<i>I've got one big blue point</i>
<i>to make, fool.</i>

628
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,949
<i>- Would you like to have a look at it?</i>
- Oh, God. Thank you.

629
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,514
Great work tonight. Look at...
Look at this, look at this.

630
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,791
It's the Waldo polling app.
Now, this can pinpoint you with GPS

631
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,071
so that when you're at a polling station,
it unlocks loads of free shit, look.

632
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,712
<i>Thanks for voting, dickhead!</i>

633
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,830
<i>Thanks for voting, dickhead!</i>

634
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,233
It's good, isn't it?

635
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,713
Who's this guy we're meeting?

636
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,069
I dunno. But he's from Washington

637
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,111
and he's got my restricted number.

638
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,912
Jeff Carter, from the agency.

639
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,632
- Hey.
- And I'll leap right in.

640
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,716
I think what you're doing
with Waldo is fascinating.

641
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,035
- From "the agency"?
- Yeah, listen.

642
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,311
Waldo may be
the perfect political figurehead.

643
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,509
Waldo the Bear.

644
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,313
The bear people like.
The fact he's a bear is an assist.

645
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,679
An assist?

646
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,153
- It helps.
- Right.

647
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,918
You look at human politicians,

648
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,110
you're instinctively like,
"brrrr" - uncanny, right?

649
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,513
Like the girls in porn.

650
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,790
You just know something's wrong,
cos why else are they doing it?

651
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,549
- It's usually daddy issues, eh?
- Just like politics. Waldo bypasses that.

652
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,068
You already know he's not real,
so no personal flaws.

653
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,997
I'm a person.

654
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,917
With respect, Waldo's more than you.

655
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,838
He's a team,
and you're open about that,

656
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,189
which is fantastic.
The honesty thing works.

657
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,756
Waldo is a construct
people not just accept, but embrace.

658
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,155
At the moment he's anti-politics,

659
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,760
which is a political stance in itself,
right?

660
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,678
But he could deliver any brand
of political content,

661
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,154
minus the potential downsides
of a human messenger.

662
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,512
In a debate, your team could Google
every word the other guy says,

663
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,676
then let Waldo hit him
with debunk stats

664
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,792
and spit a Twitter-ready zinger
into the next sentence.

665
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,070
He's the perfect assassin.

666
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,519
We won't win, though.

667
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,919
You guys are so British.

668
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,428
No, of course he won't win.

669
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,550
You started out too coarse off the bat.

670
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,160
There's no substantial basis
to what you offer,

671
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,115
