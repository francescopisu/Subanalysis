almost everybody just became Onlookers,
started watching, filming stuff,

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,237
I call them Hunters.

You might've noticed that's what they do.

148
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,233
They seemed normal to begin with,

149
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,510
but then they realised
they could do what they wanted,

150
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,278
and they started taking stuff,

151
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,959
nicking cars cos they could,
doing what they like.

152
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,070
And not just with things - with people.

153
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,317
It got worse and worse.
And now they've got an audience.

154
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,669
So this... this thing on the TV, the...

155
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,039
The signal.

156
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,674
That's what's doing it?
That's what's making them act like this?

underneath.

00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,711
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

541
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,189
Thank you. All of our roles are very,
very important, yours included.

542
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,038
Now, yours come
with some basic rules. Rule number one -

543
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,752
no talking.

544
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,679
Not just to her, but each other
as well, OK, unless it's essential.

545
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,996
We're trying to get her to believe
that yous are all mesmerised.

546
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,553
(ALL LAUGH)

547
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,477
I know, I know, I know.
But she's believed it up to now.

548
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,954
Morning. Ticket, please.
Thank you.

549
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,550
JEM: <i>OK, rule number two -
<i>keep your distance.</i>

550
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,591
I can't stress the importance
of this one enough, OK?

551
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,756
Don't forget,
she's a dangerous individual.

552
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,472
Imagine that she's an escaped lion.

553
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,034
Now, yesterday, she threw a projectile,

554
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,355
and we will step in if she gets too close.

555
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,231
We're all equipped with Tasers,

556
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,919
but then we're into story shutdown
and we've all wasted a day.

557
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,793
So it's best to keep your distance,
at least three metres back.

558
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,035
You can use your camera zoom.

559
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,039
BAXTER: <i>Last, but not least -

560
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,513
enjoy yourself.

561
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,393
That's probably the most important
rule of all, OK?

562
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,796
Take lots of photographs, run around
through the woods, but try and stay safe.

563
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,910
We'll be keeping an eye on you,
making sure you're all OK.

564
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,871
So get out there, enjoy yourselves

565
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,718
and let's make this show happen, people!

566
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,795

Look, there she is.

571
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,311
JEM: Don't know yet.
I'm kind of knackered.

572
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,396
Hmm. Me, too.

573
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,352
BAXTER: <i>She's just leaving her house now.</i>
<i>Two minutes tops.</i>

574
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,992
Right you are.

575

We're on.

Watch out!

VICTORIA: He's trying to fucking kill me.
What's going on?

580
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,875
JEM: Get that extinguisher.

581
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,239
It's OK, they've gone.

583
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,598
Convincing, eh?

(WHISTLES)

585
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,836

Early screamer.
It's an early screamer tonight.

593
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,917
So keep the noise up...

594
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,195
...and let's go!
