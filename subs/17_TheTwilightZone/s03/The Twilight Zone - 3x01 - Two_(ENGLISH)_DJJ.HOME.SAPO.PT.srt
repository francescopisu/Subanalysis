1
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,263
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:17,017
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:18,268
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:20,770
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,890
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,032
This is a jungle,

7
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,534
a monument built
by nature honoring disuse

8
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:36,403
commemorating a few years

9
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:38,905
of nature being left
to its own devices.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,659
But it's another kind of jungle,
the kind that comes

11
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:46,046
in the aftermath of man's
battles against himself.

12
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:48,415
Hardly an important battle,

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,550
not a gettysburg or a marne
or an iwo jima.

14
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:53,670
More like one insignificant
corner patch

15
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:55,555
in the crazy quilt of combat,

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,309
but it was enough to end the
existence of this little city.

17
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:01,177
It's been five years

18
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:03,063
since a human being
walked these streets.

19
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:06,182
This is the first day
of the sixth year

20
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:08,184
as man used to measure time.

21
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,217
Perhaps a hundred
years from now, or sooner,

22
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:44,971
or perhaps it's already happened
two million years ago.

23
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:46,222
The place?

24
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:48,108
The signposts are in english

25
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:49,976
so that we may read them
more easily,

26
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:53,730
but the place
is the twilight zone.

27
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:12,752
Here, invader... eat.

28
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:17,757
Eat.

29
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,762
The only reason i can see
for our fighting

30
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:25,898
is that your uniform
is a different color

31
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,767
than mine.

32
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:30,269
Do you understand my language?

33
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:36,525
I suppose not.

34
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,667
Anyway, i repeat...

35
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:47,787
there's no longer
any reason for us to fight.

36
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:51,290
There are no longer
any armies.

37
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:57,179
Only rags of various colors
that were once uniforms

38
00:09:57,214 --> 00:10:01,434
like the two sets
of rags we wear.

39
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:05,187
There are no more boundaries,
governments or noble causes,

40
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:08,307
therefore no reason
to fight.

41
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:17,950
Hear ye!
Hear ye!

42
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:22,705
Know ye, by these present,
that i do

43
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,710
hereby declare peace
upon the entire world!

44
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,236
You're very pretty,
now that i see you clearly,

45
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,739
but i'm afraid the only way
i could convince you

46
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:59,859
of my honorable intentions
would be by force.

47
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,498
And i am terribly,
terribly sick of fighting.

48
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,241
Hello, again.

49
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,986
Precrassny.

50
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,020
Put it on.

51
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,795
Go away.

52
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,297
Go away!

53
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,687
You go to take your war
to more suitable companions.

54
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:38,807
This is civilian territory!

55
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,730
Precrassny.

56
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,645
This has been a love story

57
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,781
about two lonely people
who found each other

58
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:13,535
in the twilight zone.

59
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,709
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

60
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:22,577
will tell you
about next week's story

61
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:27,065
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

62
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,633
And now, mr. Serling.

63
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:29,885
Literature is studded

64
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,004
with stories of ghost ships
and skeleton galleons.

65
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,256
And next week
onthe twilight zone

66
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,141
we take the old tale
of a flying dutchman

67
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:38,009
and give it
a coat of fresh paint.

68
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,512
This time the haunted ship
is an aircraft.

69
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:41,763
It lands
in a typical busy airport

70
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:44,266
and rolls up to the ramp,
and it's at this point

71
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:46,768
that you find yourselves
on a passenger manifest

72
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:49,905
of a flight that leads
only to the twilight zone.

73
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,407
It's called "the arrival."

74
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:22,637
Hi. This is ed sullivan

75
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:25,774
reminding you that
the colgate-palmolive company

76
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:28,276
also brings you star-studded
entertainment on our show

77
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,146
on most of these same stations.
