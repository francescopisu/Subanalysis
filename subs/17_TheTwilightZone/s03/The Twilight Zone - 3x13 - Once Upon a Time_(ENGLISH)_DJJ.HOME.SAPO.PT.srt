00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,262
YOU'RE TRAVELING
THROUGH ANOTHER DIMENSION-

2
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:16,016
A DIMENSION NOT ONLY OF SIGHT
AND SOUND, BUT OF MIND,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,267
A JOURNEY INTO A WONDROUS LAND

4
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:19,769
WHOSE BOUNDARIES
ARE THAT OF IMAGINATION.

5
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:22,272
YOUR NEXT STOP,
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,652
MR. MULLIGAN, A RATHER
DOUR CRITIC OF HIS TIMES,

IS SHORTLY TO DISCOVER
THE IMPORT OF THAT OLD PHRASE,

8
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,274
"OUT OF THE FRYING PAN,
INTO THE FIRE"-

9
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:40,777
SAID FIRE BURNING BRIGHTLY
AT ALL TIMES

10
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:43,279
IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

11
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,629
YOU BETTER MOVE,
MISTER.

12
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,881
GET OUT OF THE STREET.

13
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:16,886
YOU WANT
TO GET YOURSELF KILLED?!

14
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,888
HEY, GET OUT OF THERE.

15
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:44,046
HARMONY?

16
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,803
HEY!

17
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,435
HEY!

18
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,574
HEY! THAT'S MINE!

19
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,097
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON
AROUND HERE, SERGEANT.

20
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:37,216
EVERYTHING'S AS QUIET AS A...
MOUSE!

21
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:37,850
HEY, YOU!

22
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,862
CALL YOU BACK, SERGEANT.

23
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:50,479
HEY!

24
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,000
STOP IN THE NAME OF THE LAW!

25
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,162
OH!

26
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,785
YOU JUVENILE DELINQUENT, YOU!

27
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,300
OH, NO!

28
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,808
IT'S BROKEN.

29
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:11,944
HOW AM I GOING
TO GET BACK NOW?

30
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,567
I ONLY GOT 15 MINUTES.

31
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,706
LET ME TRY TO
UNDERSTAND THIS, SIR.

32
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:26,208
YOU HAVE THIS
FUNNY-LOOKING HAT, NO PANTS,

33
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:28,711
AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO SOMEWHERE

34
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:29,328
WITHIN 15 MINUTES?

35
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,579
RIGHT.

36
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,465
THIS IS A TIME HELMET.

37
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,716
I'M FROM 1890.

38
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,218
THAT'S WHERE I'VE
GOT TO GET BACK TO.

39
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,087
AND YOUR TROUSERS?

40
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:40,589
I HUNG THEM UP
TO DRY IN 1890.

41
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:41,841
YOU'RE FROM 1890?

42
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:43,092
WHAT PROOF HAVE YOU?

43
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:44,343
PROOF?

44
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,480
YES. AH! THAT WATCH.

45
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:48,731
THOSE CLOTHES.

46
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:49,982
WHERE DID
YOU GET THEM?

47
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,851
THEY'RE MINE.

48
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,736
IS IT POSSIBLE?!

49
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,490
QUICKLY- WHO
IS THE PRESIDENT?

50
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:58,741
YOU MEAN
BENJAMIN HARRISON?

51
00:10:58,776 --> 00:10:59,992
BENJAMIN HARRISON.

52
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,243
AND BEFORE HIM?

53
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:02,495
GROVER CLEVELAND.

54
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,746
BUT WHAT'S THAT...?

55
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:04,997
BY GEORGE!

56
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,866
I BELIEVE YOU, SIR!

57
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,751
YOU ARE FROM 1890!

58
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:10,619
WELL, THAT'S
NO NEWS TO ME.

59
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:13,122
HOW TO GET BACK
WOULD BE NEWS.

60
00:11:13,157 --> 00:11:15,007
AND THIS IS
THE DEVICE, EH?

61
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,876
HOW DOES IT WORK?

62
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,127
WELL, YOU...

63
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:20,012
WELL, I DON'T KNOW!

64
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,881
SEE, I'M ONLY
THE JANITOR.

65
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,132
JANITOR, HMM?

66
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,634
HMM. PRIMITIVE,
BUT FUNCTIONAL.

67
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:26,886
YES, YES, YES.

68
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:28,771
FASCINATING.

69
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:31,273
OH! WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?

70
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,029
PROPRIETOR!

71
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,531
PROPRI...

72
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:39,782
YEAH?

73
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:47,156
WOULD YOU COME HERE
A MOMENT, PLEASE?

74
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,042
YES, PLEASE.

75
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,293
WHAT IS IT?

76
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,162
CAN YOU FIX IT?

77
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:55,047
WE CAN FIX ANYTHING.

78
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,298
GOOD.

79
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,418
THURSDAY,
ABOUT 2:00.

80
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,927
THURSDAY?!
THURSDAY?!

81
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,072
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

82
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:23,192
THIS MAN MUST
GET BACK TO 1890.

83
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:25,077
OH, YOU'RE IN
THE WRONG BLOCK.

84
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,946
THIS IS
ONLY 1600.

85
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,197
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

86
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:30,082
THAT'S A TIME HELMET.

87
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,585
AND THIS MAN
IS FROM THE YEAR 1890.

88
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,704
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF NUT?

89
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:36,956
I'M AN ELECTRONIC
SCIENTIST.

90
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,458
NOW, JUST LEND ME
THOSE TOOLS...

91
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:40,709
DON'T TOUCH!

92
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,461
BUT THIS IS...

93
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,346
DON'T TOUCH...

00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,849
DON'T TOUCH
THE TOOLS!

95
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,859
LISTEN TO ME.

96
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,110
HOWDY.

97
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,613
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

98
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:01,864
YEAH.

99
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:05,618
THAT MAN DOESN'T
HAVE ALL HIS BUTTONS.

100
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,125
OH, YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, HUH?

101
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,994
WELL, I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.

102
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,879
LOOK AT THESE PAPERS.

103
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:18,130
WE BARELY HAVE
15 MINUTES

104
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,499
TO GET BACK TO HIS
TIME CONTINUUM.

105
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:21,750
IF YOU'LL REPAIR...

106
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:23,002
EXCUSE ME.

107
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,504
THIS FELLER SAYS

108
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,007
HE HASN'T GOT
ALL HIS BUTTONS.

109
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,509
WHAT'S HE MEAN,
HE HAS NO BUTTONS?

110
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:33,646
MEANS HE HAS NO MENTAL
FACILITIES, YES?

111
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,897
WHO SAID THAT?

112
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,399
THIS FELLER HERE
IN THE WINDOW.

113
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,268
THAT'S TV!

114
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:40,519
WHO'S TV?

115
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,404
TV- TELEVISION.

116
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,907
OH, YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND IF I TOLD...

117
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:48,027
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU
DOING, YOUNG MAN?

118
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:49,912
DON'T DO THAT
TO ME, PAL.

119
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:51,163
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

120
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,414
ALL WE WANT

121
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,283
IS THIS SOLDERED

00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:56,168
DON'T TOUCH THE
TOOLS, WILL YOU?

123
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,419
YOU DON'T

00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:05,544

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

128
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:14,803
I'M TRYING
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU...

129
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:16,689
DON'T HOLLER.

00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:38,577
NOW, LOOK, WE WANT TO GET

00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,462
JUST SIT DOWN
QUIETLY, PLEASE.

00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,714

141
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,582
YOU SURE THIS ISN'T

142
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,467
SOME KIND OF
A COFFEE MAKER?

143
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:47,336
NO, SIR, THAT'S A
VERY SCIENTIFIC

144
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:49,221
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.

145
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,114
FIVE DOLLARS, PLEASE.

146
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,765
WHAT IS THAT LITTLE
THING IN THERE?

OH, WELL,
THAT, YOU SEE...

148
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,267
THAT IS A TRANSITRON.

149
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,136
DON'T... DON'T
TOUCH MY TOOLS,

150
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,387
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

151
00:15:38,422 --> 00:15:40,889
I'M MERELY TRYING
TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT,

152
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:42,775
IN ORDER TO
FACILITATE THAT...

153
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,643
DON'T POINT WITH
MY TOOLS, PLEASE.

154
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,780
WOULD YOU ALLOW ME

163
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,075
HEY...

164
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,576
WHAT'S THE IDEA

165
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:36,445
OF RUNNING AROUND
THE STREET

166
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,330
WITH NO PANTS ON?

167
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,977
ALLEY... OOP!

168
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,010
WELL, IS IT READY?

169
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,896
COUPLE OF SMALL,
MINOR ADJUSTMENTS,

170
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,764
YOU'LL
BE ALL SET.

171
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,649
I ENVY YOU
YOUR TRIP, SIR.

172
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:51,653
1890 IS A
WONDERFUL PERIOD.

173
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:54,156
MMM. FOR INSTANCE,
NO INCOME TAX.

174
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:56,024
INCOME TAX?

175
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,527
I AM A SCHOLAR
OF THAT PERIOD, SIR.

176
00:17:58,562 --> 00:18:02,281
IT HAS A CHARM- NAY,
A FASCINATION- FOR ME.

177
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,532
THE VERY THOUGHT

178
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:07,286
OF HAVING LIVED
IN THOSE HALCYON DAYS...

179
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,171
I'LL SURE BE GLAD
TO GET BACK.

180
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,039
IF I EVER DO.

181
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:13,542
HOW MUCH TIME
IS THERE LEFT?

182
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:14,793
OH...

183
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,678
WE GOT LESS THAN
FIVE MINUTES!

184
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:19,798
MMM. TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR TOWN, SIR.

185
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,935
WHERE, FOR INSTANCE,
MIGHT A SCIENTIST
FIND EMPLOYMENT?

186
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,186
YOU A SCIENTIST?

187
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:26,688
YES. ARE THERE ANY
IN YOUR TOWN?

188
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:27,940
WELL, PROFESSOR GILBERT.

189
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,808
I WORK FOR HIM.

190
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,059
THERE YOU ARE, GENTLEMEN.

191
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,945
ALL FIXED.

192
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,197
GOOD. WHAT
DO WE DO NOW?

193
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:36,315
UH... PAY ME.

194
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,566
HMM?

195
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:40,068
PAY THE MAN,
PAY THE MAN.

196
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,324
AH! THAT'S JUST
THE RIGHT AMOUNT.

197
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,575
THANK YOU.

198
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,460
UH... HOW DOES
IT WORK?

199
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,963
OH, YOU JUST
SET THIS DIAL.

200
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,084
GOOD!

201
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:00,472
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

202
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,341
I INTEND TO
USE IT MYSELF

203
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,592
IN EXACTLY
THREE MINUTES.

204
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:04,843
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

205
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,094
BUT IAM
DOING IT, SIR.

206
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,980
I'M RETURNING TO
THAT TIME OF BLISS

207
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:08,597
AND SIMPLE PLEASURES!

208
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:09,848
AND LEAVING ME HERE?

209
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,733
YOUR FATE IS
UNIMPORTANT, SIR.

210
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:13,602
YOU ARE A JANITOR.

211
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:14,853
I AM A SCIENTIST!

212
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,104
WHY, I...

213
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,356
STAND BACK!

214
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,241
IN LESS THAN
THREE MINUTES,

215
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:21,743
I SHALL HAVE ESCAPED
THIS AGE OF MADNESS!

216
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,364
LOOK, LOOK.

217
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,249
I BROUGHT A CHICKEN
WITH ME

218
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:29,117
ALL THE WAY FROM 1890.

219
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,369
ALL I DID WAS HOLD IT.

220
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,254
WE CAN GO BACK TOGETHER.

221
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,505
YOU'RE LYING, SIR.

222
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,756
I AM NOT.

223
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,310
HEY, LOOK OUT!

224
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,182
GET THAT NUT
OUT OF HERE.

225
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:37,319
1890, HERE I COME.

226
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,762
"TO EACH HIS OWN."

227
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,631
SO GOES ANOTHER OLD PHRASE

228
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:56,384
TO WHICH MR. WOODROW MULLIGAN
WOULD HEARTILY SUBSCRIBE.

229
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:58,887
FOR HE HAS LEARNED,
DEFINITELY THE HARD WAY,

230
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,023
THAT THERE IS MUCH WISDOM
IN A THIRD OLD PHRASE

231
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:03,892
WHICH GOES AS FOLLOWS:

232
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:05,777
"STAY IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD."

233
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,646
TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ADDED,

234
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:10,782
"AND, IF POSSIBLE, ASSIST
OTHERS TO STAY IN THEIRS."

235
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:13,285
VIA, OF COURSE,
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

236
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,989
ROD SERLING,
CREATOR OFTHE TWILIGHT ZONE,

237
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,875
WILL TELL YOU
ABOUT NEXT WEEK'S STORY

238
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,377
AFTER THIS MESSAGE.

239
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:25,664
AND NOW, MR. SERLING.

240
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:27,549
NEXT WEEK, ONTHE TWILIGHT ZONE,

241
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:29,417
YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
INEXPLICABLY ENTANGLED

242
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:30,669
IN THIS DARK DUNGEON.

243
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:33,171
YOU'LL MEET AN INCREDIBLE
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO, LIKE YOU,

244
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,674
WILL BE QUITE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
HOW THEY GOT THERE,

245
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,559
WHY THEY GOT THERE,
OR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET OUT.

246
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:39,427
AND, AT THE END,
WE'RE GOING TO BELT YOU

247
00:24:39,462 --> 00:24:41,930
WITH ONE OF THE MOST SURPRISING
ENDINGS WE'VE EVER HAD.

248
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,815
NEXT WEEK, "FIVE CHARACTERS
IN SEARCH OF AN EXIT"

249
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:46,318
ONTHE TWILIGHT ZONE.

250
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,468
SEAT BELTS CAN REDUCE
SERIOUS INJURY BY ONE-THIRD.

251
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:23,605
DOES YOUR FAMILY HAVE
THE SECURITY OF SEAT BELTS?
