00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,925
SO HE'S OUT THERE
IN THE MEDI EVAL SECTION

177
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,094
SLAYING A DRAGON.

00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,013
YOU MEAN THERE

179
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,598
HM?

180
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,267
(Wickwire)
OH, YES,
OF COURSE,

181
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,352
WE HAVE
MANY SECTIONS.

182
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,937
THERE'S
THE ROMAN,

183
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,188
THE EGYPTIAN,

184
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,773
THE WILD
WESTERN

185
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,275
BUT THIS IS
THE MOST POPU LAR

186
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,943
BECAUSE IT
REPRESENTS
A PERIOD

187
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,653
IN AM ERICAN CU LTU RE

188
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,947
WHEN CREATU RE
COM FORTS WERE
MOST ABU N DANT

189
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:13,995
AND BEFORE PEACE ON EARTH
BECAME IMPOSS I BLE.

190
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,663
NOW, LOOK,
M R., UH,

191

WICKWI RE, WE

193
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,211
OH?

194
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,214
(Webber)
WE WERE ON A ROUTINE
GEOLOGICAL MISSION.

195
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,133
WE RAN INTO
A METEORITE STORM.

196
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,510
SOME OF OUR EQU I PM ENT
WAS KNOCKED OUT.

197
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,054
WE GOT LOST.

198
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,306
NOW, THAT WAS
SIX MONTHS AGO.

199
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,975
WE SAW
THIS ASTERO I D
AND WE LAN DED.

200
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,226
OUR FU EL

00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,478
WE'VE GOT

00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,022
I SEE.

203
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,025
I SEE, THEN YOU'RE
NOT FROM THE GLADES.

204
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,111
THE WHAT?

205
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,781
BUT YOU ARE FROM THE EARTH.

TELL ME, DID THEY EVER
HAVE THAT ATOM IC WAR?

207
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,328
YES, IN 1 985.

208
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,539
MOST OF THE EARTH'S
SU RFACE WAS DESTROYED

209
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,667
AND IT'S TAKEN
US 200 YEARS

210
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,251
TO PICK UP
THE P I ECES.

211
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,754
OH, HOW SAD.

00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,587
WICKWI RE.

237
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,838
WE'RE VERY

00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,298
WE NEED H ELP.

BUT BEFORE
I EXPLAIN

247
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,692
YOU MUST GIVE ME
SOME IN FORMATION.

248
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,488
IF YOU WERE GRANTED
YOUR DEAREST WISH

249
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,656
WHAT WOULD
YOUR WISH BE?

250
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,492
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

251
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,243
I MEAN, WHERE

252
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,953

2 1 85?
[chuckIes]

262
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,565
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

263
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,942
WELL, THAT'S N ICE.

264
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,235
WE DON'T!

265
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,820
WHEN YOU ARRIVED

266
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,030
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
FROM HAPPY GLADES.

267
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,698
BUT BY YOUR BEHAVIOR

268
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,575
OF COURSE, I SEE
YOU COULDN'T BE.

269
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,327
WE'RE STILL
NOT FOLLOWING YOU.

270
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,745
WHAT'S HAPPY GLADES?

271
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,831
THE WORLD'S
G REATEST MORTUARY.

272
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,500
AT LEAST, THAT'S
WHAT IT USED TO BE.

273
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,628
YOU SEE,
THE MANAG EM ENT
H IT UPON THIS SCH EM E

274
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,631
AS A SERVICE
TO THOSE WHO
COULD AFFORD IT.

275
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,091
"THIS SCH EM E"
BEING?

276
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,843
THIS LITTLE
ASTERO I D

277
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,263
WHERE WE WOULD RECREATE
THE EXACT CON DITIONS

278
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,641
U N DER WHICH
THE DEAR DEPARTED
COULD BE MOST HAPPY.

279
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,476
FOR AN EXAM PLE,

280
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,729
IF THE DECEASED ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE ELECTED MAYOR

281
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,773
HE WOULD ACH I EVE
HIS AM B ITION HERE

282
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,485
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

283
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,863
YOU MEAN THOSE PEOPLE
ARE ALL DEAD?

284
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,366
NO, NO, NOT ALL OF THEM.
JUST A SELECT FEW.

285
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,577
THE OTH ERS ARE IMITATIONS.

286
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,371
(Professor)
IN OTHER WORDS,
THIS IS THE PLACE

287
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,875
WHERE YOUR
DREAMS COME TRU E AFTER
YOU'VE STOPPED DREAMING.

288
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,461
YES, THAT MIGHT
BE ONE WAY OF
PUTTING IT.

289
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,380
YES, THAT'S
VERY GOOD.

290
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,633
YOU EXPECT
US TO BELIEVE
THAT EXPLANATION?

291
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,094
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT.

292
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,388
DON'T YOU?

293
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,183
IT'S TRU E, YOU KNOW.

294
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,809
WELL, I'LL ADM IT

295
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,146
WE HAVEN'T COME UP
WITH ANYTHING BETTER.

296
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,608
BUT A CEM ETERY
OUT IN SPACE.

297
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,068
M I LLIONS OF M I LES
FROM EARTH.

298
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,404
WHY?

299
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,323
YES, WHY?

300
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,284
NOW, YOUR BOSS
COULD HAVE BOUGHT
A P I ECE OF DESERT.

301
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,660
OH, NO, NO

302
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,038
YOU DON'T
U N DERSTAND AT ALL.

303
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,166
HAPPY GLADES PROMISES

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,792
EVERLASTING PEACE.

305
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,670
YOU COULDN'T
HAVE THAT ON EARTH

306
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,465

YES, YOU, HOW
DO YOU F IG U RE
IN ALL THIS?

311
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,768
WHY, I'M
THE CARETAKER.

312
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,145
IT'S MY JOB
TO MAKE SURE

313
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,940

00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,977
OH, I AM NOW

326
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,812

YOU UNDERSTAND.

331
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,832
YES, IT'S NOT
VERY COM PLICATED

332
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,041
IS IT, REALLY?
