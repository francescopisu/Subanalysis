00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,506
(male narrator)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,050
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,803
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,889
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,685
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,895
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,898
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,818
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,738
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,992
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,340
YOU'RE LOOKING AT
A TABLEAU OF REALITY.

00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,010

THESE THINGS EXIST
AND HAVE DIMENSION.
