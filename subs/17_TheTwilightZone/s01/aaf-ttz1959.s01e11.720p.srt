00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,506
(male presenter, off)
THERE IS A
FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,925
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,302
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:15,389
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:19,560
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,812
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,024
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,568
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,279
THIS IS
THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,949
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,215
HER NAME: X-20.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,010
HER TYPE: AN
EXPERIMENTAL INTERCEPTOR.

14
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,972
RECENT HISTORY: A
CRASH LANDING IN
THE MOHAVE DESERT

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,225
AFTER A 31 -HOUR FLIGHT
900 MILES INTO SPACE.

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,229
INCIDENTAL DATA: THE SHIP,
WITH THE MEN WHO FLEW HER

17
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,900
DISAPPEARED FROM
THE RADAR SCREEN
FOR 24 HOURS.

18
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,950
WELL, HELLO, COLONEL.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

19
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,410
I'M FINE, LIEUTENANT.

20
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,828
I'M... I'M FINE.

21
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,455
UM... IS
MAJOR GART HERE?

22
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,582
WELL, OF COURSE.

23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,958
HE'S HERE.

24
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,043
OF COURSE.

25
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,336
GO ON IN.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,046
HE'LL BE GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,257
THANK YOU.

28
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,635
ISN'T THAT ONE OF
THE SPACE PILOTS--

29
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,011
THE ONES
THAT CRASHED?

30
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,181
YEAH, THAT'S
COLONEL FORBES.

31
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,809
(male presenter, off)
BUT THE SHROUDS
THAT COVER MYSTERIES

32
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,186
ARE NOT ALWAYS MADE
OUT OF A TARPAULIN

33
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,271
AS THIS MAN WILL
SOON FIND OUT

34
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,315
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF A HOSPITAL DOOR.

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,162
(Gart)
WELL, THE PRODIGAL
COLONEL! WELCOME.

36
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,332
HEY, HOW ABOUT A SHOT
OF STRAIGHT ORANGEADE?

37
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,043
HOW ARE
YOU FEELING?

38
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,837
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

39
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,505
ONE MORE THERMOMETER
IN MY PUSS,

40
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,382
I'M GONNA
ABSENT MYSELF
WITHOUT LEAVE.

41
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,801
COME ON, WHAT'S
IT LIKE IN THE
OUTSIDE WORLD?

42
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,428
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

43
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,888
WELL, TELL ME
ABOUT IT.

44
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,557
TALK TO ANY
OF THE GUYS?

45
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,392
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE SHIP, CLEGG?

46
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,770
DID YOU
CHECK HER OVER?

47
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,856
IT'S FINE,
THE SHIP'S FINE.

48
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,358
NO, NO, THEY PUT
IT UNDER WRAPS.

49
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,694
HEY, YOU GOT
OFF ON A TOOT,
DIDN'T YOU?

50
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,362
YOU DON'T
LOOK SO GOOD.

51
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,780
HOW DO I LOOK?

52
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,366
A LITTLE HUNG
OVER MAYBE.

53
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,535
[chuckling]

54
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,579
OH, YOU
GOT ANOTHER
ONE OF THOSE?

55
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,592
HEY, STEADY,
COLONEL, STEADY.

56
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,552
BILL, SOMETHING
HAS HAPPENED.

57
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,888
S-S-SOMETHING I
JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

58
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,140
WELL, GO ON.

59
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,440
FIRST, I WANT
TO GET ORIENTED.

60
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,484
I WANT YOU TO ANSWER
SOME QUESTIONS,
ALL RIGHT?

61
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,195
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

62
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,447
WHEN DID
I LEAVE HERE?

63
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,699
WELL, DON'T
YOU KNOW?

64
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:25,579
LOOK, I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ANYMORE!

65
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:31,251
LOOK, ALL I NEED...ALL
I NEED IS SOMEBODY'S
HELP, ALL RIGHT?

66
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,838
LOOK, AT 9:30
YESTERDAY MORNING,

67
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,592
I WALKED OUT OF
HERE, DIDN'T I?

68
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,470
YEAH, ABOUT THAT
TIME, I GUESS.

69
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,721
WHO DID I
WALK OUT WITH?

70
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,098
NOBODY WAS
WITH YOU.

71
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,100
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

72
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,685
YOU SAY NOBODY!

73
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,066
WHAT'S THAT SAY?

74
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,318
GO AHEAD, TELL ME,
WHAT'S IT SAY?

75
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,821
WELL, IN
EFFECT, IT SAYS

76
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,282
THOSE TWO INTREPID
VOYAGERS INTO
THE UNKNOWN

77
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,285
RETURNED FROM THE
UNKNOWN IN A SLIGHTLY
DENTED AIRCRAFT.

78
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,538
WHAT ABOUT
THE PICTURE?

79
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,998
WHO'S IN
THE PICTURE?

80
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,130
(Gart, reading)
"COLONEL CLEGG FORBES
AND MAJOR WILLIAM GART

81
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,299
"TAKEN JUST BEFORE
THEIR HISTORIC FLIGHT

82
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,135
THAT ENDED IN A MYSTERIOUS
DISAPPEARANCE AND CRASH."

83
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,860
THAT'S WHAT
YOUREMEMBER, HUH?

84
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,364
YOU AND ME AND
THE X-20 TAKING OFF.

85
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,574
ABOUT FOUR HOURS UP
WE BLACK OUT

86
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,786
AND 24 HOURS LATER,
WE END UP IN A CRASHED
AIRCRAFT IN THE DESERT.

87
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,706
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'VE
BEEN OR WHAT'S HAPPENED.

88
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,499
IS THAT RIGHT?

89
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,543
THAT'S RIGHT.

90
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,962
OH, NOW, WHAT'S THE
MATTER? ISN'T
THAT RIGHT?

91
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,263
BILL--

92
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,599
THERE WERE THREE OF US
IN THAT AIRCRAFT--

93
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:14,938
YOU AND ME
AND A COLONEL
NAMED HARRINGTON.

94
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,606
OH, YEAH, HARRINGTON.

95
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,191
ED HARRINGTON!

96
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,028
NOW, LOOK,
HE WAS 36 YEARS OLD.

97
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,447
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.
I'D KNOWN HIM
FOR 1 5 YEARS

98
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,240
AND YOU'D KNOWN
HIM FOR FIVE.

99
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:35,584
THAT SHIP TOOK
A CREW OF THREE,
AND WE WERE THE THREE.

100
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,669
AND THERE
WERE THREE OF US
WHEN THEY BROUGHT US

101
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,129
TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER
PICKING US UP IN
THE DESERT--

102
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,881
YOU AND ME
AND HARRINGTON.

103
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,632
HARRINGTON AND I
WERE JUST SCRATCHED;

104
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,218
YOU WERE THE ONE
WITH THE BUSTED LEG!

105
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:49,264
YESTERDAY MORNING, THEY
DISCHARGED HARRINGTON
AND ME.

106
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,141
THERE WERE
THREE BEDS
IN THIS ROOM--

107
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,728
YOURS AND M INE
AND HARRINGTON'S.

108
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,150
CLEGG...

109
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,236
I DON'T
KNOW ANYBODY
NAMED HARRINGTON.

110
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,988
HE WASN'T ON
THE CREW
WITH US.

111
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,283
THE X-20
CARRIED TWO
MEN, YOU AND ME--

112
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,578
NOBODY NAMED HARRINGTON,
NOBODY ELSE AT ALL.

113
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,747
WHEN YOU
WALKED OUT OF HERE
YESTERDAY MORNING,

114
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,249
YOU WALKED
OUT ALONE.

115
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,836
THERE'S NEVER BEEN
THREE BEDS IN THIS
ROOM, ONLY TWO.

116
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,588
YOURS...

117
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,006
AND M INE.

118
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,930
I THINK YOU BETTER
BE LOOKED AFTER.

119
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,810
PLEASE.

120
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,853
I KNEW YOU'D
SAY THAT, BILL,

121
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,939
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR SAYING IT EITHER.

122
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,858
BUT... BUT...
LET... LET ME...

123
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,445
LET ME
DESCRIBE TO YOU
WHAT I REMEMBER.

124
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,490
LOOK, I'LL GIVE
YOU A BREAKDOWN
CHRONOLOGICALLY

125
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,159
OF EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED AS
OF YESTERDAY MORNING.

126
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,036
BILL...

127
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,996
YOU SAID
GOODBYE TO US
FROM THAT BED

128
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,874
AND... AND...
YOU SAID...

129
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,960
YOU SAID, "HARRINGTON,
LOOK AFTER FORBES.

130
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,628
HE DRINKS TOO MUCH."

131
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,214
THAT, THAT... THOSE
WERE YOUR EXACT WORDS.

132
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,216
AND...

133
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,884
AND I
STOOD RIGHT
AT THAT DOOR,

134
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,720
AND... AND I LAUGHED.

135
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,557
I SWEAR TO YOU, BILL,
I SWEAR TO YOU--

136
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,643
IT HAPPENED!
I KNOW IT HAPPENED!

137
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,814
[Iaughs]
I'M GONNA LET YOU HAVE
IT, FRESH, PUNK KID.

138
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,652
OH, I'M GOING TO FIX
THIS BABY'S WAGON!

139
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,737
I'M GONNA TELL THE
MEDICS HE'S A VERY
SICK COOKIE

140
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,573
AND OUGHTTA BE KEPT
UNDER OBSERVATION

141
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,159
FOR ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS.
AND EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT,

142
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,161
THE COLONEL AND I ARE
GONNA PHONE YOU FROM
WHATEVER BAR

143
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,163
WE HAPPEN TO BE
IN AT THE TIME,
AND IF YOU'RE NICE--

144
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,914
IF YOU ARE
REAL NICE...

145
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,833
WE'LL EVEN LET YOU
TALK TO OUR WOMEN.

146
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,460
WILL YOU
COME ON ALREADY?

147
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,712
I JUST CAN'T STAND
THESE LONG GOODBYES.

148
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,008
WOULD YOU BOTH
GET OUT OF HERE
AND LEAVE ME ALONE?

149
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,259
LET ME SUFFER
IN LONELINESS

150
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,595
ALL BY MYSELF, HUH?

151
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,764
(Harrington)
THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING
GUY IN THE MIDDLE THERE,

152
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,893
BUT WHO ARE
THE TWO SLOBS
ON THE SIDES?

153
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,687
WELL, WILLY,
WE'LL DROP BY

154
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,230
AND SEE YOU
TOMORROW, MAYBE.

155
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,441
WELL, GET LOST,
UM, WHO NEEDS YOU?

156
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,234
[all laughing]

157
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,032
[cheerfuI music]

158
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,639
(man)
HEY! YOU'RE FORBES AND
HARRINGTON, AIN'T YOU?

159
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,599
AIN'T YOU THE GUYS
THAT WAS UP IN SPACE?

160
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,309
YEAH, BUT WE
CAN STILL BUY
A COUPLE OF BEERS

161
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,186
FOR 30 CENTS
EARTH MONEY, HUH?

162
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,979
YOU BET YOUR LIFE,
BUT YOUR MONEY'S
NO GOOD HERE.

163
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,606
THE DRINKS ARE
ON THE HOUSE.

164
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,067
I DON'T GET TO SERVE
MANY CELEBRITIES.

165
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,485
NOW DRINK
UP, BOYS.

166
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,278
THANKS.

167
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,613
I DON'T EVEN CARE
THAT YOU CRACKED
UP THE SHIP

168
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,740
AND I'M
A TAXPAYER.

169
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,660
SAY, WHAT'S IT
LIKE UP THERE

CLEGG.

342
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,257
I DON'T KNOW
ED HARRINGTON.

343
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,428
I NEVER HEARD
OF HIM BEFORE.

344
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,432
I THINK HE MUST BE AN
ILLUSION OR SOMETHING.

345
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:30,853
OH, I KNOW HE'S
NOT AN ILLUSION.

346
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,606
I KNOW.

347
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,276
HE'S BEEN YANKED
OUT OF HERE.

348
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,822
HE'S BEEN
TAKEN AWAY.

349
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,618
HE TOLD
ME, REMEMBER?

350
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,788
HE TOLD
ME MAYBE...

351
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,460
MAYBE SOMEBODY
OR SOMETHING--

352
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,463
MADE A M ISTAKE...

353
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:03,886
LET US GET THROUGH
WHEN WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH.

354
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,554
THEY'VE GOT
TO COME BACK
TO GET US--

355
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,849
SOMEBODY UP THERE.

356
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,018
AW, BILL...

357
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:21,070
THIS IS WEIRD,
JUST PLAIN WEIRD.

358
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:26,325
LIKE I JUST
DON'T BELONG...

359
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,745
JUST LIKE I...
I DON'T BELONG.

360
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,219
AW, NO!

361
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,721
I DON'T
WANT THIS
TO HAPPEN!

362
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,973
BILL, I
DON'T WANT
IT TO HAPPEN!

363
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,309
I DON'T WANT IT
TO HAPPEN!

364
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,105
[shouting]
SOMEBODY GET HIM!

365
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,523
SOMEBODY GET HIM!

366
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,358
SOMEBODY...
SOMEBODY GET HIM.

367
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,110
MAJOR, YOU
SHOULDN'T BE
OUT OF BED!

368
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,570
WHY, IF
THE DOCTOR...

369
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,572
SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO HELP HIM.

370
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,990
COLONEL FORBES--
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO
HELP HIM RIGHT AWAY.

371
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,366
WHO?

372
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,535
[yells]
COLONEL FORBES!

373
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,413
[sighs]

374
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,041
YOU KNOW
COLONEL FORBES.

375
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,043
WHY, HE WAS BROUGHT
IN HERE WITH ME.

376
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,003
WHY, HE WAS RIGHT
OVER HERE IN THIS--

377
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,136
OH, MY DEAR GOD!

378
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,555
MAJOR, MAJOR, LET ME
HELP YOU GET INTO BED.

379
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,724
COME AHEAD, MAJOR.

380
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,144
AND I'LL... I'LL
CALL THE DOCTOR.

381
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,520
COME, MAJOR.

382
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,734
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

383
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,903
[shouting]
MAJOR!
MAJOR HANGERSON!

384
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,802
HOW ARE WE FIXED
IN THIS WARD HERE?

385
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,262
ROOM 1 5 DOWN HERE CAN
TAKE THREE PATIENTS, SIR.

386
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,430
IT'S EMPTY.

387
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,723
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

388
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,487
(man)
MM-HMM, THAT WILL DO
FOR THE MALARIA PATIENTS.

389
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,614
ORDER SOME BEDS UP
FROM Q-M, WILL YOU?

390
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,865
YES, SIR.

391
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,747
(Serling, off)
ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE
WAS A MAN NAMED HARRINGTON,

392
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,209
A MAN NAMED FORBES,
A MAN NAMED GART.

393
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:43,462
THEY USED TO EXIST,
BUT DON'T ANY LONGER.

394
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,383
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
TOOK THEM SOMEWHERE.

395
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,553
AT LEAST, THEY ARE NO LONGER
A PART OF THE MEMORY OF MAN.

396
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:54,723
