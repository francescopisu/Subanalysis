00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:02,876
[eerie music]

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,804
(male narrator)
YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER
ANOTHER DIMENSION

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,807
A DIMENSION NOT ONLY OF SIGHT
AND SOUND, BUT OF M IND

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,727
A JOURNEY INTO A WONDROUS
LAND OF IMAGINATION.

5
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,021
NEXT STOP,
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,155
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
IS A GHOST

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,866
ONCE ALIVE, BUT NOW DECEASED.

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,076
ONCE UPON A TIME,
IT WAS A BASEBALL STADIUM

9
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,037
THAT HOUSED
A MAJOR LEAGUE BALL CLUB

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,913
KNOWN AS THE HOBOKEN ZEPHYRS.

11
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,832
NOW IT HOUSES NOTHING
BUT MEMORIES

12
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,835
AND A WIND THAT STIRS
IN THE HIGH GRASS

13
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,920
OF WHAT WAS
ONCE AN OUTFIELD.

14
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,548
A WIND THAT SOMETIMES BEARS
A FAINT GHOSTLY RESEMBLANCE

15
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,842
TO THE ROAR OF A CROWD
THAT ONCE SAT HERE.

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,053
WE'RE BACK IN TIME NOW

17
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,846
WHEN THE HOBOKEN ZEPHYRS

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,473
WERE STILL A PART
OF THE NATIONAL LEAGUE

19
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,183
AND THIS
MAUSOLEUM OF MEMORIES

20
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,518
WAS AN HONEST-TO-PETE STADIUM.

21
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,104
BUT SINCE THIS IS STRICTLY
A STORY OF MAKE-BELIEVE

22
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,898
IT HAS TO START THIS WAY.

23
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,025
ONCE UPON A TIME
IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY,

24
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,361
IT WAS TRYOUT DAY.

25
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,238
AND THOUGH HE'S NOT YET
ON THE FIELD

26
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,783
YOU'RE ABOUT TO MEET
A MOST UNUSUAL FELLOW.

27
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,367
A LEFT-HANDED PITCHER

28
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,078
NAMED CASEY.

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,230

30
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,398
WERE YOU EXPECTING

THIS IS THE MATERIAL

THIS IS THE MATERIAL

YOU'RE GEN ERAL MANAG ER.

36
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,285
WHY DON'T YOU GET

37
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,162
YOU'D KNOW
WHAT TO DO
WITH THEM?

38
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,997
20 GAM ES

00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,999

IS A MANAG ER WITH THE WI DEST

41
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,254
MAYBE YOU BETTER
GET REMINDED

42
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,297
WHEN THE HOBOKEN ZEPHYRS
WIN ONE GAM E

43
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,091
WE GOT TO CALL IT
A STREAK.

44
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,136
OH, BUDDY BOY, WH EN
CONTRACT TIME COMES AROUND

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,470
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

46
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,937
HOW'S FLETCHER DOING?

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,397
ARE YOU KI DDING?

48
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,731
HE P ITCH ED

49
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,441
AND ONLY ALLOWED
SIX RUNS.

50
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,527
HE'S THE MOST VALUABLE
PLAYER OF THE MONTH.

51
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,989
[phone ringing]

52
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,115
DUGOUT.

53
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,616
YEAH.

54
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,160
WHO?

55
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,037
WANT TO LOOK
AT A P ITCH ER?

56
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,790

57
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,250
SEND HIM OVER.

58
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,421
HE'S A LEFTY.

59
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,173
LEFTY, SCH MEFTY.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

60
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,632
IF HE'S GOT MORE
THAN ONE ARM

61
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,301
AND LESS THAN FOU R,
HE'S FOR US.

62
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,052
HEY, MON K!

63
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,888

GO ON OUT AND
THROW HIM

100
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,423
THANKS VERY MUCH,

00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,592
PUT YOUR CAP

102
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,927
GOOD LAD.

103
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,981

I AM WHAT

HOW OLD IS H E?

110
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,137
THAT'S A LITTLE
DI FF ICU LT TO SAY.

111
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,847
WELL, GU ESS.

112
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,265
WHAT I MEAN IS

113
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,641
IT'S HARD TO
BE CH RONOLOG ICAL

114
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,643
WHEN DISCUSSING
CASEY'S AG E

115
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,064
BECAUSE HE'S ONLY BEEN
IN EXISTENCE THREE WEEKS.

116
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,691
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
HE HAS THE PHYS IQU E

117
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,902
AND THE MIND
OF A BOY OF 22.

118
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,488
BUT IN TERMS
OF HOW LONG
HE'S BEEN HERE

119
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,659
THE ANSWER TO THAT
WOULD BE, UH,
THREE WEEKS.

120
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,161
YOU WANT TO
GO OVER THAT AGAIN?

121
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,913

00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,972
DON'T EVER SAY THAT.

158

00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,176
AND THEN
THE THREE OF US

00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,928

177
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,099
GO WITH HIM AND
CHECK HIS BLU EPRI NTS.

178
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,768
I THINK THAT
LAST SLOW BALL
SHOOK HIM UP.

BEASLEY? DRAW
THE CONTRACT.

182
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,552
THE ONLY THING
BETWEEN US AND
THE PEN NANT

183
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,555
IS IF THIS GUY'S
BATTERY GOES DEAD
OR HE RUSTS IN THE RAI N.

184
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,474
N EVER MIND WHAT I MEAN.

185
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,311

00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,042
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE

201
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,960
OH, YEAH.

202
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,587
I FORGOT

WELL, YOU

MR. MCGARRY,

WHAT TEAM IS CASEY

207
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,062
THE NEW YORK GIANTS.

208
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,399
OH, I'D LOVE

OR EVEN THE

PU RELY EXPERI MENTAL.

218
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,926
YOU KNOW, I THINK CASEY'S
SOME SORT OF A SU PERMAN.

219
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,095
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
THAT PROVEN.

220
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,722
ONCE, I BU I LT
A HOME ECONOM IST

221
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,515

NOW WITH
CASEY'S SKI LLS

225
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,606
I CONSIDER THAT

00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,608
H E'D BE A

228
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,738
I HAD TO HAVE HIM

NO FRACTU RE,
NO CONCUSS ION,
REFLEXES SEEM NORMAL.

241
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,696
I THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT,
MR. CASEY.

242
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,990
OH, BOY. I CAN
BREATHE AGAIN.

243
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,325
ALL I KEPT
THINKING ABOUT

244
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,618
WAS, "THERE
GOES CASEY.

245
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,911
"THERE GOES
THE PEN NANT.

246
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,204
THERE GOES
THE SERI ES."

247
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,706
THERE GOES
YOUR CAREER.

248
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,375
(doctor)
YES, SIR,
MR. CASEY.

249
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,043

COUG H, MR. CASEY.

[mechanical click]

256
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,160
WHAT'S WRONG?

257
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,662
WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG.

258
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,247
THEN WHAT ARE
YOU PRYING FOR?

259
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,915
WELL, THERE'S NOT
A THING WRONG.

260
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,250
EVERYTHING IS
JUST F IN E.

261
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,334
IT'S JUST THAT--

262
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,419
JUST THAT WHAT?

263
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,087
WELL, THIS, UH--

264
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,922
THIS MAN
DOESN'T HAVE
ANY PU LSE.

265
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,507
NO HEARTBEAT.

266
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,509
TH IS, UH...

267
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,095
THIS MAN
ISN'T ALIVE.

268
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,180
IT WILL HAVE TO
COME OUT NOW.

269
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,099
WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT, MOUTH?

270
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,560
WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING
TO PULL OFF?

271
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,770
YOU'RE NOT GON NA
LIKE THIS BUT--

272
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,440
U H, DOCTOR, I THINK
YOU SHOU LD KNOW THIS

273
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,358
BEFORE YOU GO
ANY FU RTH ER.

274
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,694
THIS MAN HASN'T A
PU LSE OR A HEARTBEAT

275
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,404
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
HAVE A HEART.

276
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,530
HE'S A ROBOT.

277
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,075
(doctor)
A WHAT?

278
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,201
(Stillman)
A ROBOT.

279
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,536
YOU'RE SURE?

280
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,539
BY ALL MEANS.
I BU I LT HIM.

281
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,960
AND HE'S BEEN P ITCHING
FOR THE HOBOKEN ZEPHYRS.

282
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,046
U N DER THE CI RCU MSTANCES,
AS TEAM PHYS ICIAN

283
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,506
I'M AFRAI D IMUST NOTI FY
THE BASEBALL COM MISS ION ER.

284
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,677
CASEY, MOVE OVER.

285
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,603
ARTICLE SIX,
SECTION TWO,
THE BASEBALL CODE.

286
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,396
I QUOTE--

287
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,774
"A TEAM
SHALL CONSIST
OF NINE MEN."

288
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,567
END OF QUOTE.

289
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,277
"MEN," UNDERSTAND?

290
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,737
NOT ROBOTS.

291
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,197
HE'S SUSPENDED.

292
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,865
THAT'S MY
FINAL DECISION.

293
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,743
COM MISS ION ER, TO ALL
I NTENTS AND PU RPOSES

294
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,662
HE IS HUMAN!

295
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,622
CASEY...

296
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,249
TALK TO HIM.

297
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,627
TELL HIM
ABOUT YOURSELF.

298
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,504
WHAT SHOU LD I SAY?

299
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,964
SEE? HE TALKS
BETTER THAN ME

300
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,590
AND HE'S A
LOT SMARTER

301
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,841
THAN MOST OF
THOSE M UTTON H EADS.

302
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,176
HE IS NOT HUMAN!

303
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,970
HOW HUMAN DO
YOU WANT HIM?

304
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,847
HE'S GOT ARMS AND LEGS
AND A FACE AND HE TALKS.

305
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,224
AND NO HEART.

306
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,850
HE DOESN'T EVEN
OWN A HEART.

307
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,352
HOW COULD
HE BE HUMAN
WITHOUT A HEART?

308
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,187
BEASLEY HASN'T GOT
A HEART EITHER.

309
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,064
HE OWNS 40%
OF THE CLU B.

310
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,399
THAT'S IT.
HE DOESN'T
HAVE A HEART

311
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,692
THAT MEANS
HE ISN'T HUMAN.

312
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,943
THAT'S A
CLEAR VIOLATION

313
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,027
OF THE
BASEBALL CODE.

314
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,195
HE DOESN'T PLAY.

315
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,155
MR. COM MISS ION ER

316
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,199
SU PPOSE WE GAVE
HIM A HEART.

317
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,118
IF THAT'S WHAT
MAKES HIM DIFFERENT

318
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,745
I THINK I COULD
OPERATE AND SU PPLY
HIM WITH A HEART.

319
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,206
YOU CAN DO THAT ?

320
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,958
NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

321
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,711
DO YOU WANNA PLAY?

322
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,132
OF COURSE H E
WANTS TO PLAY.

323
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,467
[Iaughs]

324
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,429
YOU'RE SURE?

325
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,847
I GUARANTEE IT.

326
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,059
IF HE WERE TO
BE GIVEN A HEART

327
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,562
WOULD YOU CLASS I FY
HIM AS A...

328
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,856
WELL, WHAT I MEAN IS,
WOULD YOU CALL HIM A...

329
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,317
HE HAD ME FOOLED
EVEN WITHOUT ON E.

330
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,070
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

331
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,322
WITH A HEART,
I'LL GIVE HIM
A TEM PORARY OKAY

332
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,283
U NTI L THE LEAG U E
M EETING IN OCTOBER.

333
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,744
THEN WE'LL HAVE
TO TAKE IT UP.

334
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,203
THE OTHER CLU BS

335
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,539
ARE GONNA SCREAM
BLOODY M U RDER.

WELL, THEN IT'S
ALL SETTLED.

339
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,004
CASEY GETS A HEART

340
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,505
AND ACCREDITATION
AS BEING A HUMAN

BEFORE THAT NIGHT
WHEN HE HAD
HIS CH EST,

367
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,285
[sniff]

368
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,287
HE SAID, "GO OUT
THERE, ZEPHYRS,

369
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,249
AND WIN THIS ONE
FOR THE BIG GUY."

370
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,502
PULL YOURSELF

(male narrator)
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS
A MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM

452
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,205
CALLED THE HOBOKEN ZEPHYRS

453
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,915
WHO DURING THE LAST YEAR
OF THEIR EXISTENCE

454
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,792
WOUND UP IN LAST PLACE

455
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,669
AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER
WOUND UP IN OBLIVION.

456
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,796
THERE'S A RUMOR,
UNSUBSTANTIATED, OF COURSE,

457
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,549
THAT A MANAGER NAMED MCGARRY
TOOK THEM TO THE WEST COAST

458
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,551
AND WOUND UP
WITH SEVERAL PENNANTS

459
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,886
AND A COUPLE
OF WORLD'S CHAMPIONSHIPS.

460
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,472
THIS TEAM HAD A PITCHING
STAFF THAT MADE HISTORY.

461
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,891
OF COURSE, NONE OF
THEM SMILED VERY MUCH

462
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,601
BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE A FACT

463
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,311
THEY PITCHED
LIKE NOTHING HUMAN

464
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,021
