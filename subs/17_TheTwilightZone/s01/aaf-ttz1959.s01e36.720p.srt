AND I CREATED HIM.

177
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,962
OH, MY.

178
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,720
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

179
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,390
I AM AFRAI D
THAT PSYCH IATRY IS
NEXT ON THE AG EN DA.

180
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,725
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE
M E, VICTORIA.

181
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,811
CHARACTERS IN MY PLAYS
DO COME ALIVE.

182
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,479
I'VE SEEN THEM,
TALKED TO THEM.

183
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,314
I'VE EVEN
SHAKEN HAN DS
WITH THEM.

184
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,567
YOU EVEN MADE LOVE
TO THEM, REMEMBER?

185
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,652
YES... I MEAN NO!

186
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,989
LOOK, YOU KNOW HOW I WORK.

187
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,740
I DICTATE DIALOG
AND STAG E BUS IN ESS

188
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,200
INTO THE TAPE RECORDER.

189
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,411
I DESCRI BE
ANY CHARACTER I WANT

190
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,331
AND IF I DO IT WELL ENOUGH,
THEY COME TO LIFE--

191
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,166
TO LIFE, VICTORIA.

192
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,085
AND I DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO DESCRI BE
THE CHARACTERS

193
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,004
IN MY PLAYS ANYMORE.

194
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,090
I CAN DESCRI BE
ANY CHARACTER I WANT!

195
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,010
YOU SHOU LD BE
PUT AWAY.

196
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,182
NOW, YOU SAID THAT YOU
SAW MARY HERE, RIGHT?

197
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,184
OH, I SAW
HER HERE,
ALL RIGHT.

198
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,395
THEN HOW DID
SHE GET OUT?

199
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,689
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING
TO F IN D OUT.

200
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,613
SHE COULD
NOT HAVE GONE OUT
TH ROUG H THE WIN DOW.

201
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,783
YOU KNOW THERE ARE NO
SECRET DOORS IN HERE.

00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,620
BUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW SHE GOT OUT OF HERE

00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,301
I TAKE MY SCISSORS,

205
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,094
I SN I P
OFF THE PART
OF THE TAPE

206
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,556
ON WHICH
SHE IS DESCRI BED,

207
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:46,561
I ROLL THE TAPE
INTO A LITTLE BALL,

208
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,814
I THROW IT
INTO THE F I REPLACE,

209
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,734
SHE'S GONE!

210
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,027

211
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,531
I'M GOING TO
HAVE YOU COM M ITTED.

212
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,452
YOU'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE ME.

213
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,079
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

214
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,580

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

217
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,342
I COULD DESCRI BE A
DOG OR A CAT OR ANY
CHARACTER YOU WANT

218
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,844
BUT I'M SURE YOU WOULD
PREFER TO SEE MARY

219
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,680
AND I'VE CREATED MARY
SO MANY TIMES,

220
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,181
THAT SHE'LL BE
MUCH MORE AVAI LABLE.

221
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,766
I'LL JUST BET SHE IS.

222
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,685
