THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,093
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,887
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,807
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

THIS IS
THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,992
IT IS AN AREA WHICH WE
CALL THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,425
THE PLACE IS HERE,

00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,957
484 HOURS,

219
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,000

00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,429
VERY MUCH SO.

227
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,306
THE MAN

ALONE IN A BOX

228
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,351
FOR SOMETHING IN
THE N EIGH BORHOOD
OF 484 HOURS.

229
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,853
THAT'S ROUG H LY
EQU IVALENT TO A

00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,605
SEVERAL ORB ITS

00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,651
FOR ALL I NTENT
AND PU RPOSE, YES.

233
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,320
WHAT ABOUT
THESE WIRES
ATTACHED TO HIM?

234
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,239
ELECTRODES.

235
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,658
ALL OF HIS REACTIONS
WERE CHARTED AND GRAPH ED.

236
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,119
RESP I RATION, HEART
ACTION, BLOOD PRESSURE.

237
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,538
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
TOWARD THE END, GENERAL,

238
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,457
BEFORE HE PUSH ED THAT
BUTTON, WHATEVER IT WAS?

239
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,336
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
IS THAT HE CRACKED.

240
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,007
DELUS IONS OF SOME

ALL BY YOUR LON ESOM E
WITHOUT HEARING
A HUMAN VO ICE

245
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,228

I'LL GIVE YOU
ESPECIALLY GOOD ODDS

247
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,525
THAT YOUR I MAG I NATION

248
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,943

(Ferris)
I FEEL MUCH
BETTER, SIR.

00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,337
I'M SORRY ABOUT
TOWARD THE EN D.

254
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,629
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

255
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,173
WHAT WAS IT
LIKE, FERRIS?

256
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,883
WHERE DID YOU
THINK YOU WERE?

257
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,886
A PLACE I DON'T WANT
TO GO AGAIN, S I R.

258
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,637
A TOWN.

259
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,098
A TOWN WITHOUT PEOPLE,
WITHOUT ANYBODY.

260
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,225
WHAT WAS THE MATTER
WITH ME, DOC?

261
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,560
JUST OFF MY
ROCKER, HUH?

262
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,103
JUST A KIND
OF A NIGHTMARE

263
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,732
THAT YOUR MIND
MAN U FACTU RED FOR YOU.

264
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,400
YOU SEE, WE CAN
FEED THE STOMACH

265
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,194
WITH CONCENTRATES.

266
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,072
WE CAN SU PPLY M ICROF I LM
FOR READING, RECREATION,

267
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,574
EVEN MOVIES
OF A SORT.

268
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:52,244
WE CAN PU M P OXYG EN IN
AND WASTE MATERIAL OUT.

269
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,705
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
WE CAN'T SIMULATE

270
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,792
THAT'S A VERY
BASIC NEED--

271
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,252
MAN'S H U NG ER
FOR COM PAN IONSH I P.

272
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,880
THE BARRIER
OF LONELINESS--

273
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,549
THAT'S ONE THING
WE HAVEN'T
LICKED YET.

274
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,637
NEXT TIME, IT WON'T
BE JUST A BOX IN A
HANGAR, WILL IT?

275
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,680
NO, M I KE.

276
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,100
NEXT TIME, YOU'LL

277
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,452
HEY. DON'T GO
AWAY UP THERE.

278
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:37,623
NEXT TIME, IT
WON'T BE A DREAM
OR A NIGHTMARE.

279
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,459
NEXT TIME,
IT'LL BE FOR REAL.

280
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,087
SO DON'T GO AWAY.

281

IN THE VOID
THAT IS SKY--

285
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:58,811
UP THERE IS AN ENEMY
KNOWN AS ISOLATION.

286
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,148
IT SITS THERE IN
THE STARS, WAITING--

287
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,692
