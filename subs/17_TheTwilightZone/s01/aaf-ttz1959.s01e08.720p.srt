1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,795
[eerie music]

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,464
(male presenter, off)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,175
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,220
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,431
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,435
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,187
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,649
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,818
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,237
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:34,324
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:56,805
TWO, THREE, FOUR.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,434
ONE, TWO, THREE.

14
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,396
MRS. CHESTER,
HAVE YOU EVER READ
DAVID COPPERFIELD?

15
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,773
HOW'S THAT?

16
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,566
IT'S A WONDERFUL BOOK.

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,027
THERE'S THIS
POOR LITTLE FELLA
AND HIS FATHER

18
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,279
HAS PASSED AWAY
AND HIS MOTHER
HAS MARRIED

19
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,364
THIS MISERABLE MAN
CALLED MURDSTONE.

20
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,493
ISN'T THAT
A VILLAINOUS
NAME? MURDSTONE.

21
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,162
WELL, THIS MURDSTONE
HAS A SISTER
CALLED JANE--

22
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,206
MR. BEM IS,
YOU SHORTCHANGED ME AGAIN.

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,333
YOU OWE ME
ONE MORE DOLLAR.

24
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,210
SEE?
THERE'S ONLY 24 HERE

25
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,505
AND THERE
SHOULD BE 25.

26
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,091
OH, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,
MRS. MURD-- ER, UH--

27
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,425
MRS., UH, CHESTER.

28
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,969
I THOUGHT THERE WAS FIVE ONES

29
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,471
AND THERE'S ONLY FOUR.

30
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,515
I THOUGHT
I'D GIVEN YOU FIVE.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,102
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
THEN THERE'S ANOTHER
FUNNY CHARACTER,

32
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,605
CALLED M ICAWBER,
MR. M ICAWBER.

33
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,316
AND HE'S
ALWAYS BEING SENT
TO DEBTOR'S PRISON.

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,110
HM!

35
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,821
THEN THERE'S
ANOTHER CHARACTER
CALLED PEGGOTY.

36
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,532
THAT IS DAVID'S--

37
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,243
NURSE.

38
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,412
[sighs]
OH, WELL.
[mumbIes]

39
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,008
YES, SIR?

40
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,553
I WONDER IF IMIGHT
SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE,
MR. BEM IS?

41
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,347
WHY, CERTAINLY,
MR. CARSVILLE.

42
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,849
I DON'T SUPPOSE

43
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,976
YOU'VE READ
DAVID COPPERFIELD?

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,352
NO, MR. BEM IS,
I HAVE NOT.

45
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,562
NOW IF YOU'D KINDLY

46
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,981
ACCOMPANY ME.

47
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,442
(male presenter, off)
WITNESS MR. HENRY BEMIS,
A CHARTER MEMBER

48
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,111
IN THE FRATERNITY
OF DREAMERS.

49
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,737
A BOOKISH LITTLE MAN

50
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,073
WHOSE PASSION
IS THE PRINTED PAGE

51
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,160
BUT WHO IS CONSPIRED
AGAINST BY A BANK
PRESIDENT AND A WIFE

52
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,453
AND A WORLD FULL
OF TONGUE-CLUCKERS

53
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,957
AND THE UNRELENTING
HANDS OF A CLOCK.
BUT IN JUST A MOMENT

54
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,793
MR. BEMIS WILL ENTER A WORLD
WITHOUT BANK PRESIDENTS,

55
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,337
OR WIVES, OR CLOCKS,
OR ANYTHING ELSE.

56
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:57,134
HE'LL HAVE A WORLD
ALL TO HIMSELF,
WITHOUT ANYONE.

57
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,976
(President)
NOW, MR. BEMIS

58
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,728
I SHALL COME
TO THE POINT.

59
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,147
I SHALL ARRIVE VIA
THE FOLLOWING ROUTE

60
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,357
WHICHIS NAMELY,
"WHAT CONSTITUTES

61
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,152
AN EFFICIENT MEMBER
OF THIS ORGANIZATION?"

62
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,655
VIZ, A BANK TELLER
WHO KNOWS HIS JOB
AND PERFORMS IT.

63
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,532
I.E.,
AN ORGANIZATION MAN

64
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,951
WHO FUNCTIONS
WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION.

65
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,663
YOU, MR. BEM IS,
DO NOT FUNCTION
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.

66
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,999
YOU ARE NEITHER
AN EFFICIENT BANK TELLER

67
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,709
NOR A PROFICIENT EMPLOYEE.

68
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:34,630
YOU, MR. BEM IS, ARE A READER.

69
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,048
A "READER"?

70
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,591
A READER!

71
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,551
A READER OF BOOKS,
MAGAZINES

72
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,178
PERIODICALS, NEWSPAPERS.

73
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,263
I SEE YOU CONSTANTLY
GOING DOWNSTAIRS

74
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,474
INTO THE VAULT
DURING YOUR LUNCH HOUR.

75
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,517
ULTIMATUM, MR. BEM IS!

76
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,937
YOU'LL HENCEFORTH
DEVOTE YOUR TIME
TO YOUR JOB

77
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,689
AND FORGET
READING, OR YOU'LL
FIND YOURSELF OUTDOORS

78
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,150
ON A PARK BENCH READING
FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT

79
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,652
FOR WANT OF HAVING A JOB.

80
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,445
DO I MAKE MYSELF
PERFECTLY CLEAR?

81
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,864
THAT'S PERFECTLY
CLEAR, SIR. IT'S
JUST THAT,

82
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,491
JUST THAT WHAT, BEM IS?

83
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,534
MAKE IT QUICK
AND GET BACK TO YOUR CAGE.

84
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:09,581
IT'S JUST THAT MY WIFE
WON'T LET ME READ AT HOME.

85
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,626
SEE, WHEN I GET
HOME AT NIGHT AND TRY
TO PICK UP A NEWSPAPER

86
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,586
SHE YANKS IT OUT OF MY HAND

87
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,047
AND AFTER DINNER
IF I TRY TO FIND

88
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,840
A MAGAZINE, SHE HIDES THEM.

89
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,635
WELL, I GOT SO DESPERATE
THAT I FOUND MYSELF

90
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,973
TRYING TO READ THE LABELS
ON THE CONDIMENT BOTTLES
ON THE TABLE.

91
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:30,227
NOW, SHE WON'T
EVEN LET ME USE
THE CATSUP.

92
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:35,482
UNASKED, I GIVE
MY REACTION TO THIS.

93
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,194
YOUR WIFE
IS AN AMAZINGLY
BRIGHT WOMAN.

94
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,989
I REMEMBER LAST NOVEMBER
YOU SPENT THE DAYS

95
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,533
READING CAMPAIGN BUTTONS
ON CUSTOMERS' LAPELS.

96
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,327
YOU WILL RECALL
THE LADY WHO TOOK
EXCEPTION TO THIS

97
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,371
AND TRIED TO HIT YOU
WITH HER UMBRELLA.

98
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,872
YES, I REMEMBER THAT.

99
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,000
I NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO TELL HER

100
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:58,839
THAT I WAS ONLY
LOOKING TO SEE
WHO SHE VOTED FOR.

101
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,757
GOOD DAY, BEM IS.

102
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,437
[cIears throat]

103
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,980
[startIed gasp]

104
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,779
(wife, shrill call)
HENRY!

105
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,657
HENRY!

106
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,618
YES, DEAR?
I'M IN THE LIVING ROOM!

107
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,877
YOU WANT MORE
COFFEE OR DON'T YOU?

108
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,920
NO, THANK YOU, DEAR.

109
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,298
BUT THEN WHY DON'T
YOU TELL ME THAT,

110
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:45,052
AND DON'T SNEAK OFF
INTO THE LOVING ROOM
TO BURY YOURSELF IN NEWSPRINT?

111
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,637
I THINK WE'VE
BEEN OVER THIS
QUITE ENOUGH, HENRY.

112
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,641
I WON'T TOLERATE A HUSBAND
OF MINE SACRIFICING THE ART
OF CONVERSATION.

113
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,018
[chuckIes]

114
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,145
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

115
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,690
NO, NO, DEAR, IT'S
JUST THAT YOU SAID
"A HUSBAND OF M INE."

116
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,902
HOW MANY HUSBANDS
HAVE YOU GOT? YOU'VE
ONLY GOT ME!

117
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:06,406
I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT
NOT BEING RUBBED IN!
[beats newspaper]

118
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,534
WE'RE PLAYING CARDS
TONIGHT. I WANT YOU
TO CHANGE YOUR SHIRT.

119
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,787
WE'RE GOING OVER
TO THE PHILLIPS' HOUSE.

120
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,455
OH, DEAR.

121
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,875
ALL RIGHT, HENRY.
ANYTHING TO SAY?

122
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,419
NO, DEAR, NOTHING TO SAY.

123
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,922
WHAT TIME
DO WE DO THAT?

124
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,924
IN ABOUT 1 5 M INUTES.

125
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,551
I'LL BE READY ON TIME.

126
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,720
SEE THAT YOU ARE!

127
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,473
[startIed]
OH!

128
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,933
HENRY?

129
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:19,813
YES, MY DEAR?

130
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,065
WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT, HENRY?

131
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,358
GOT?

132
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,609
GOT!

133
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,446
NOTHING, MY DEAR.

134
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,613
WHAT'S THIS?

135
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,739
WHAT, THAT?

136
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,907
THIS!

137
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,117
ISN'T THAT ODD?

138
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,452
HOW DID THAT
GET HERE?

139
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,871
I CAN ONLY HAZARD
A GUESS.

140
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,790
"A BOOK
OF MODERN POETRY."

141
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:44,087
YOURS, HENRY?

142
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,465
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO READ ME SOME?

143
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,258
READ YOU SOME?

144
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,428
DO YOU MEAN
READ YOU OUT LOUD
OUT OF THE BOOK?

145
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,596
DO YOU WANT TO?

146
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,431
OH, I WOULD LOVE TO.

147
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,976
YOU KNOW,
THERE ARE SOME
LOVELY THINGS IN HERE.

148
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,146
THERE ARE
ONE OR TWO THINGS
FROM T.S. ELIOT

149
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,734
AND EDNA ST. VINCENT M ILLAY,
ROBERT FROST, CARL SANDBURG.

150
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,787
HELEN.

151
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,042
WHO DID THIS, HELEN?

152
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,211
WHO DO YOU THINK
DID IT, HENRY?

153
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,713
YOU SHOULD
THANK ME, REALLY.

154
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,090
A GROWN MAN WHO READS SILLY

155
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,134
RIDICULOUS,
NONSENSICAL DOGGEREL.

156
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,513
THIS ISN'T DOGGEREL!
THERE'S SOME BEAUTIFUL
THINGS HERE.

157
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,223
I SAY IT'S DOGGEREL.

158
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,184
AND I ALSO SAY
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

159
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,770
HELEN, HELEN,
DON'T DO THAT!

160
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,147
HELEN, PLEASE
DON'T DO THAT!

161
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,404
WHY, HELEN?

162
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,323
WHY DO YOU DO
THESE THINGS?

163
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,325
BECAUSE I'M
MARRIED TO A FOOL.

164
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,175
[crash]

165
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,926
[expIosion]

166
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,551
(Carsville)
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU

167
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,179
THAT IN ADHERENCE TO DUTY,
A CONSTANT REMEMBRANCE

168
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:48,183
THAT A BANK,
LIKE A POLITICAL OFFICE
IS A PUBLIC TRUST.

169
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,393
THESE THINGS
ARE OF THE ESSENCE.

170
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,021
THOSE THINGS ARE BASIC
ABOVE ALL THINGS.

171
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,190
JUST THE QUALITIES
I'VE MENTIONED.

ON HANDS AND KNEES
FOR MR. HENRY BEMIS

178
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,682
WHO LOOKS FOR A SPARK
IN THE ASHES OF A DEAD WORLD.

00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,767
A TELEPHONE CONNECTED
TO NOTHINGNESS.

180
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,477
A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR, A MOVIE

A BASEBALL DIAMOND,
A HARDWARE STORE

182
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:21,776
THE MAILBOX OF WHAT
WAS ONCE HIS HOUSE
AND IS NOW A RUBBLE.

183
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,778
THEY LIE AT HIS FEET

184
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,240
AS BATTERED MONUMENTS
TO WHAT WAS, BUT IS NO MORE.

185
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,077
HELEN!

186
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:37,917

00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,465
OF A GRAVEYARD.

189
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,025
THEY'RE ALL DEAD.

190
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,402
THEY MUST BE.

191
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,363
EVERYBODY'S DEAD EXCEPT

192
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,198
ME.

193
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,285
I'M ALL RIGHT.

194
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,913
WHY AM I ALL RIGHT?

195
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,958
I WAS RIGHT THERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF--

196
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,710
THE VAULT!

197
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:24,756
I WAS DOWN IN THE VAULT.

198
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,257
THAT'S WHY I'M ALIVE.

199
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,887
I WENT DOWN IN THE--

200
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,891
THE THING OF IT IS, THOUGH,

201
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,977
THE THING OF IT IS

202
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,564
I'M NOT AT ALL SURE

203
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,318
THAT I WANT TO BE ALIVE.

204
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,493
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING TO STARVE
TO DEATH ANYWAY.

205
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,328
LOTS OF FOOD.

206
00:15:55,412 --> 00:16:00,333
FOOD ENOUGH TO LAST
FOR YEARS AND YEARS
AND YEARS

207
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:04,587
AND YEARS.

208
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,759

209
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,387
ALL THE FOOD

210
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:22,397

LET'S SEE, THE WORST PART,
THE VERY WORST PART

213
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,376
IS BEING ALONE.

214
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,338
IS THIS HOW IT'S GOING TO BE

215
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,049
SITTING AROUND DAY AFTER DAY

216
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,260

00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,130
NO. NO. NO.

229
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:57,176
NO. NO, THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

230
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,972
NO, IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T
MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

231
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,682
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

232
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,143
THIS IS SOLITUDE.

233
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:09,272
I'VE NEVER HAD MUCH SOLITUDE.

234
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:14,944
I HAVE ENOUGH
TO OCCUPY MY M IND
AND MY TIME.

235
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,197
I HAVE ENOUGH FOOD

236

LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE

KLEENEX TOWELS
ARE BUILT LIKE A SPONGE.

321
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,668
AND LIKE A SPONGE,
THEY HAVE A SOFTNESS
THAT SHAPES TO THE JOB.

322
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,338
SO THE WHOLE TOWEL
SURFACE IS ABSORBING.

YOU KNOW, I FIND KLEENEX
TISSUES SO USEFUL

343
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,701
I KEEP A BOX IN EVERY
ROOM OF MY HOUSE.

344
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,953
IT'S A MUST IN OUR
LIVING ROOM, OF COURSE.
