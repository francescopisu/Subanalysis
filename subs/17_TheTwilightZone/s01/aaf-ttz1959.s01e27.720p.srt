THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,426
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,387
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,390
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:20,019
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,187
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,441
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,360
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,030
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:35,034
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

MR. BOLIE JACKSON,
WHO BY THE STANDARDS
OF HIS PROFESSION

17
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,664
IS AN AGING,
OVER-THE-HILL
RELIC OF WHAT WAS,

18
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,127
AND WHO NOW SEES A REFLECTION
OF A MAN WHO HAS LEFT TOO MANY
PIECES OF HIS YOUTH

19
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,005
IN TOO MANY STADIUMS
FOR TOO MANY YEARS

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,841

00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,094
'CAUSE I THOUGHT
HE HAD ME ON MY BACK.

231
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,430
AND THERE I WAS,
LYING THERE,

232
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,766
LOOKING UP
AT THE REF WAVING
HIS ARM DOWN ON ME,

233
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,186
STARING AT THE LIGHT,
BLIN KING MY EYES.

234
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,440
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
SOME KIND OF A DREAM
OR SOMETHING 'CAUSE--

235
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,404
HENRY?

236
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,703

238
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,627
HENRY, IN EVER
WENT DOWN.

239
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:35,303
HENRY, WAS I?
WAS I ON MY BACK
AND ON MY WAY OUT?

240
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,272
NOBODY REMEMBERS IT.

241
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,569
NOBODY AT ALL
EXCEPT ME.

242
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,782
I THOUGHT IT HAPPENED,
BUT IT DIDN'T.

243
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,952
I THOUGHT I WAS
LYING THERE ON MY
BACK, BEING COU NTED OUT,

244
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,164
AND EVERYBODY
TELLS ME THAT--

245
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,126
BOLI E, I MADE
THE BIG WISH THEN.

246
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,504
I WISHED YOU WAS
NEVER KNOCKED DOWN.

247
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,674
I JUST SHUT MY EYES,
AND I, I WISH ED REAL HARD.

248
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,012
IT WAS MAG IC, BOLI E.
WE HAD TO HAVE
MAGIC THEN.

249
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,767
HAD TO, BOLIE. NOTHING
LEFT FOR US THEN. HAD
TO MAKE A WISH.

250
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,520
THERE AIN'T NO MAG IC
OR WISHING OR NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

251
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,649
YOU'RE TOO BIG TO HAVE N UTSY
THOUGHTS. YOU'RE TOO BIG TO
BELIEVE IN FAIRY TALES.

252
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,944
IF YOU WISH HARD
ENOUGH, BOLI E,
IT'LL COME TRU E.

253
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,654
IF YOU WISH
HARD ENOUGH--

254
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,115
SOMEBODY GOTTA
KNOCK IT OUT OF YOU.

255
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,451
SOMEBODY GOTTA TAKE YOU
BY THE HAIR AND RU B YOUR
FACE INTO THE WORLD

256
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,746
TILL YOU GET THE TASTE AND

I GOT A GUT ACH E
FROM WISHING,

259
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,385
AND ALL I GOT

YOU'RE A LITTLE
