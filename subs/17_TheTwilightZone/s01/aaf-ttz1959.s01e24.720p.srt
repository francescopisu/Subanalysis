(male narrator)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,843
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:14,054
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,849
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,561
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,188
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,191
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,194
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,697
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,325
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,263
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ACT ONE,
SCENE ONE OF A NIGHTMARE,

00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,724
ONE NOT RESTRICTED
TO WITCHING HOURS

PROFESSOR SAMUEL KITTRIDGE,

00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,541
THAT WAS,
LET ME SEE, 1 947,

102
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,668
WHICH WOULD
MAKE YOU 5 1.

103

ALL MY TEETH AND
HARDLY A WRIN KLE.

00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,613
LOOK AT ME NOW.

110
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:33,952

WHILE YOU HAVEN'T

112
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,665
IT HAPPENS THAT
WAY SOMETIME.

113
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,293
I KNOW, BUT WHY?

114
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:46,006
DON'T ASK ME, SAM.
YOU'RE THE CH EM IST.
I TEACH H ISTORY.

115
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,550
YES, AND YOU
TEACH IT VERY WELL.

116
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,136
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE STU DENTS SAY?

117
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,724
THEY SAY IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH
YOU'D LIVED TH ROUG H THE PERIOD
YOU WERE DISCUSSING.

118
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,226
I TRY TO MAKE
IT I NTERESTING.

119
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,187
FAKE IT, YOU MEAN?

120
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,023
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

121
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,941
YES, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

122
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,652
BUT SOMEHOW, THAT
DI DN'T SEEM LIKE YOU.

123
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,113
YOU'RE SUCH
A PRECISE SORT.

124
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,659
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

125
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,579

WELL, WHAT IS IT?

128
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,757
YOU LOOK AS THOUGH
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

129
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,176
MAYBE I HAVE.

130
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,263
WALTER WAS-WAS YOUR
G RAN DFATHER IN THE CIVI L
WAR, BY ANY CHANCE?

131
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,891
NO.

132
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,393
THEN I'D SAY WE
HAVE SOMETHING OF
A MYSTERY HERE.

133
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,104
HOW SO?

134
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,774
YOU MADE ME CU RIOUS
ABOUT THIS MAJOR
SKELTON TODAY.

135
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,860
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE I NTERESTING TO SEE
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE,

136
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:54,032
SO I WENT TH ROUG HMY
BRADY PICTURES, NOT REALLY
EXPECTING TO F IN D ANYTHING.

THESE ARE THREE OF

ALMOST 1 00 YEARS AGO.

00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,282
YOU SHOU LDN'T HAVE KEPT
THAT RING, YOU KNOW.
IT'S A DEAD GIVEAWAY.

141
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,952
WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING AT, SAM?

142
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,913
OH, COME, WALTER.

HOW OLD ARE

156
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,559
YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

157
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,103
I CAN BELIEVE
ANYTHING NOW.

158
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:52,067
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SAY THAT
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE KNOWN
THIS GENTLEMAN PERSONALLY.

159

PLATO?

160
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,825
BUT THAT WAS OVER
2,000 YEARS AGO!

161
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,163
I KNEW YOU
WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.

162
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,750
NO, NO, IT'S--IT
ISN'T THAT, IT'S--

00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:13,380
TWO THOUSAND YEARS.

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,760
IN H EAVEN'S NAME,
THIS IS WHAT MAN KIND
HAS BEEN DREAMING OF.

166
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,011
SAM.

167
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,263
TELL ME THE SECRET.

168
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,226
I CAN'T TELL YOU
THE SECRET, SAM,

169
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,437
BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW IT MYSELF.

170
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,234
I WAS LIKE YOU, SAM.

171
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:38,780
AFRAI D OF DEATH.
AND WHEN I THOUGHT OF ALL
THE THINGS THERE WERE TO KNOW

172
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,450
IN THE MISERABLE
FEW YEARS THAT A
MAN HAD TO KNOW THEM,

173
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,746
IT SEEM ED SENSELESS.
AT NIGHT, EVERY NIGHT

174
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,041
I DREAM ED, AS YOU DREAM,
OF IMMORTALITY.

175
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,377
ONLY IF A MAN
LIVED FOREVER,
I THOUGHT,

176
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,296
COULD THERE
BE ANY PO I NT
IN LIVING AT ALL?

177
00:11:55,381 --> 00:12:00,385
I TALKED TO PRI ESTS,
PH I LOSOPH ERS.

178
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,556
THEN ONE DAY
I MET AN ALCH EM IST.

179
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,435
TOLD HIM THESE THINGS.
HE SAID THAT HE COULD
G RANT MY WISH.

180
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,104
ONLY, OF COURSE,
IT WOULD COST A
G REAT DEAL OF MONEY.

181
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,733
I WAS DESPERATE, I PAI D HIM
HIS MONEY AND SU BM ITTED
TO HIS EXPERI MENTS.

182
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,902
I REMEMBER VERY
LITTLE ABOUT IT.

183
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,238
I LAY IN A COMA
FOR MANY WEEKS,

184
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,617
AND WHEN I REVIVED,
I WAS ALON E.

185
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,828
THE ALCH EM IST
HAD DISAPPEARED.

186
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,872
GO ON.

187
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,129
THERE'S REALLY
VERY LITTLE MORE
TO TELL.

188
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,923
I THOUGHT, OF COURSE,
THAT THE EXPERI MENT
HAD FAI LED

189
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,844
BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL
ANY DIFFERENTLY.

190
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,472
BUT THEN

191
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,976
I SAW MY WIFE AND
MY CH I LDREN AGING.

192
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,022
MY FRIENDS DYING.

193
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,778
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT
I HADN'T CONSIDERED,
YOU SEE?

194
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,490
BUT SURELY THERE--
THERE'S SOME ANSWER
TO THAT PROBLEM.

195
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,701
IS THERE?
THINK ABOUT IT.

196
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,370
I TELL YOU THAT
SOM EHOW I CAN STOP
YOU FROM AGING.

197
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,539
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO STOP, AT 30?

198
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,375
THEN YOU WATCH EVERYON E
AROUND YOU GROW OLD.

199
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,211
AT 70?

200
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,631
DO YOU WANT
TO LIVE FOREVER
THE WAY YOU ARE NOW?

201
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,674
OLD, S ICK?

202
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,384
IT'S BETTER
THAN DYING.

203
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,179
NO, YOU'RE WRONG, SAM.

204
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,474
I WAS WRONG.

205
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,560
IT'S... DEATH

206
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:37,148
THAT GIVES THIS
WORLD ITS PO I NT.

207
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:42,237
WE LOVE A ROSE BECAUSE WE
KNOW IT'LL SOON BE GON E.
WHO EVER LOVED A STON E?

208
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,990
I'M NOT A ROSE.
I'M NOT A STON E.
I'M A MAN!

209
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,202
VERY OLD AND
VERY FRIGHTEN ED.

210
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,411
OF WHAT, DEATH?

211
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,913
YES, OF DEATH.

212
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,665
YOU'RE A FOOL, SAM.
I WANT TO DIE.

213
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,167
THEN WHY DON'T YOU?

214
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,919
BECAUSE I'M A COWARD.

215
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,587
YOU?

216
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,714
I HAVEN'T CHANG ED.
I'M THE SAME MAN I WAS.

217
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,926
I WAS A COWARD THEN,
I'M A COWARD NOW.

218
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,512
I'M TIRED OF LIVING.

219
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,684
IN MY DESK I HAVE
A REVOLVER, SAM.

220
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:17,397
AND EVERY NIGHT I TAKE IT
OUT AND PRAY FOR THE COU RAG E
TO PULL THE TRIGG ER. I CAN'T.

221
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,191
YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT
YOU'VE SU RVIVED
OVER 2,000 YEARS

222
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,527
WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT,
WITHOUT BEING WOU N DED?

223
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,737
SOME PEOPLE ARE
LUCKY THAT WAY.

224
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,282
THEY GO TH ROUG H
LIFE WITHOUT EVER
BREAKING A BON E

225
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,285
OR SEEING THE I NSIDE
OF A HOSP ITAL.

226
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,414
OH, I'VE BEEN
CLOSE TO DEATH,
MANY TIMES,

227
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,585
BUT NEVER
CLOSE ENOUGH.

228
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,964
THANK YOU.

229
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,258
FOR WHAT?

230
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:50,763
I THOUGHT IF A MAN
LIVED FOREVER, H E'D
G ROW WISER.

231
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,974
BUT THAT ISN'T
TRU E, IS IT?

232
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,311
YOU JUST GO ON
LIVING. THAT'S ALL.

233
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,147
IT MUST BE LON ELY.

234
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,492
I SU PPOSE YOU'VE BEEN
MARRI ED SEVERAL TIMES.

235
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,994
YES.

236
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,830
HOW LONG WITH EACH
WOMAN, WALTER?

237
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,416
TEN YEARS?
F I FTEEN YEARS?

238
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,002
I SEE.

239
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,589
SAM, I TRI ED TO RESIGN SIX
MONTHS AGO. YOU TALKED ME OUT
OF IT. DO YOUREMEMBER THAT?

240
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,549
YES.

241
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,010
I KNEW SUSANNA
WAS FALLING IN
LOVE WITH ME,

242
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,347
AND I KNEW WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN. IT'S
HAPPENED BEFORE.

243
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,183
A FEW YEARS
OF HAPP IN ESS
AND THEN--

244
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,978
I TRI ED TO WARN H ER.
I DID EVERYTHING IN MY
POWER TO DISCOU RAG E H ER.

245
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,939
EXCEPT TELL
HER THE TRUTH.

246
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,316
HOW COULD I DO THAT?
SH E'D HAVE THOUGHT
I WAS MAD.

247
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,151
THEN WHY DIDN'T
YOU LEAVE?

248
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,695
BECAUSE BY THEN
IT WAS TOO LATE.

249
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,323
I WAS IN LOVE WITH H ER.

250
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,325
I NEED H ER.

251
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:56,204
EVERYTHING IS
AGAINST IT. ALL MY
REASON AND EXPERI ENCE.

252
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,041
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MATTER NOW. IT
DOESN'T MATTER.

253
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:05,046
IT DOES TO ME, WALTER.
I CAN'T LET YOU MARRY
MY DAUG HTER.

254
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,839
(Susanna)
AND WHY NOT?

255
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,887
WELL, COME ON.

256
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,349
YOUR FATHER SEEMS
TO THINK I'M TOO OLD
FOR YOU, DARLING.

257
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,687
THAT'S THE S I LLI EST
THING I EVER HEARD OF.

258
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,480
GOOD.

259
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,692
THEN YOU'LL
MARRY ME TONIGHT.

260
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,568
I THINK YOU MEAN IT.

261
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,196
I DO. YOU GO
U PSTAIRS, PACK YOUR
PRETTI EST THINGS.

262
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,991
I'LL PICK YOU UP

263
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,909
BUT--

264
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,620

265
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,003
I'LL TELL H ER.

266
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,838
SHE WON'T
BELIEVE YOU.

267
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,173
NOBODY WOULD.

268
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,343
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
IT YOURSELF BY
TOMORROW MORNING.

269
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,403
(Woman)
HELLO, TOMMY.

274
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,107
I'M AFRAI D YOU'RE

275
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,525
NO, TOMMY.

276

MY NAME IS JAMESON.

277
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,862

278
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,031
DON'T PRETEND.

279
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,575
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

280
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,581

MY DEAR WOMAN,
PERHAPS IF YOU'LL TELL ME

I HAD TO COME
TO SEE IF IT WAS TRU E.

287
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,529
IT IS.

288
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,366
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
I ONLY KNOW IT'S HAPPENED.

289
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,911
I'VE GROWN OLD,
AND YOU HAVEN'T.

00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,373
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO
MARRY SOMEONE ELSE

LAST STOP ON
A LONG JOURNEY,

00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,724
AND INTO THE DUST
THAT IS ALWAYS THE END.
