00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,754
[eerie music]

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,424
(male presenter, off)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,176
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,179
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,016
AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,644
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,980
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,191
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,194
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,613
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:36,118
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,677
(male presenter, off)
1 2:00 NOON.

13
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,222
AN ORDINARY SCENE,
AN ORDINARY CITY.

14
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,434
LUNCHTIME FOR THOUSANDS
OF ORDINARY PEOPLE.

15
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,728
TO MOST OF THEM,
THIS HOUR WOULD BE A REST.

16
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,397
A PLEASANT BREAK
IN THE DAY'S ROUTINE.

17
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,357
TO MOST, BUT NOT ALL.

18
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,402
TO EDWARD HALL,
TIME IS AN ENEMY.

19
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,321
AND THE HOUR TO COME

20
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,490
IS A MATTER
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

21
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,442
HEY, MISTER.

22
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,444
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU SICK?

23
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,404
NO.

24
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,755
WE'VE BEEN
EXPECTING YOU, MR. HALL.

25
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,220
GO RIGHT IN.

26
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,439
HELLO, MR. HALL.

27
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,152
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU ILL?

28
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,361
NO.

29
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,446
I'M JUST TIRED.

30
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,991
WELL, YOU'D
BETTER REST.

31
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,327
OVER HERE, MR. HALL.

32
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,415
SIT DOWN.

33
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,535
I THOUGHT
YOU SAID
YOU WERE TIRED.

34
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,955
I AM. I'M
THE TIREDEST
MAN IN THE WORLD.

35
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,458
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW MANY HOURS
I'VE BEEN AWAKE?

36
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,543
87 HOURS.

37
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,462
ALMOST FOUR
DAYS AND NIGHTS.

38
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,380
AND YOU CAN'T
GO TO SLEEP,
IS THAT IT?

39
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,301
NO, DOCTOR.
NOT CAN'T,
I MUSTN'T!

40
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,347
I MUSTN'T GO TO SLEEP
BECAUSE IF I DO I'LL
NEVER WAKE UP.

41
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,147
THANKS.

42
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,649
MM-HM.

43
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,234
YOU M IND IF I
WALK AROUND A BIT?

44
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,027
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN STAY AWAKE.

45
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,446
STAND ON YOUR HEAD
IF YOU THINK IT WILL HELP.

46
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,198
WHAT'S FUNNY?

47
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,575
YOU ARE.
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
A PSYCHIATRIST?

48
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,535
WHY DO YOU ASK?

49
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,829
I EXPECTED
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

50
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,748
LIKE AN OLD MAN
WITH A WHITE BEARD

51
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,874
AND A GERMAN ACCENT?

52
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,042
MAYBE.

53
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,543
I KNOW.

54
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,420
THAT'S WHAT
EVERYBODY EXPECTS,

55
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,798
AND THEY'RE
ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED.

56
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:21,051
YOU KNOW,
I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT
OF WEARING A DISGUISE.

57
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,427
YEAH, NOW,

58
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,720
FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE?

59
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,973
LOOK, DOCTOR.

60
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,349
YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

61
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,850
I'M JUST
WASTING YOUR TIME.

62
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,977
YOU'RE SURE
OF THAT?

63
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,311
YEAH.

64
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,146
THEN WHY'D YOU
COME TO ME?

65
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,649
IT WAS FRED
JACKSON'S IDEA,
MY REGULAR DOCTOR.

66
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,817
I KNOW,
HE CALLED ME.

67
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,901
WHAT DID HE SAY?

68
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,194
NOT MUCH.

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,531
YOUR NAME,
EDWARD HALL.

70
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,616
AGE, 35,
OCCUPATION, DRAFTSMAN.

71
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,703
SINGLE, HEART
CONDITION, NO HISTORY
OF MENTAL DISEASES.

72
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,371
THAT'S IT.

73
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,082
ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL ME THE REST?

74
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,375
[sighs]

75
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,128
NO. NO, FORGET IT.

76
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,963
OKAY.

77
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,346
MR. HALL.

78
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,641
DO YOUREALLY THINK
RUNNING AWAY

79
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,727
WILL DO YOU ANY GOOD?

80
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,645
NOW DON'T
GET ME WRONG.

81
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,566
SOMETIMES RUNNING AWAY
IS THE BEST ANSWER.

82
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,277
BUT I DON'T KNOW
THAT YOURS IS THAT
SORT OF PROBLEM.

83
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,573
MAYBE IT IS,
MAYBE IT ISN'T.

84
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,534
YOU DO WHAT YOU LIKE.

85
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,999
YOU PROMISE
YOU WON'T PUT ME
IN A STRAITJACKET?

86
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,834
I DON'T PROMISE ANYTHING.

87
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,670
OKAY.

88
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,173
OKAY. IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

89
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,970
[sighs]

90
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,181
CAN I OPEN THIS?

91
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,065
QUITE A DROP.

92
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,487
UH, MR. HALL,
I'LL, UH--

93
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,532
I'LL HAVE TO CLOSE
THE WINDOW.

94
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,867
I ONLY
WANTED SOME AIR.

95
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,577
WELL, I'LL, UH,

96
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,162
TURN THE CONDITIONER UP.

97
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,165
IT WORKS BEST
WITH THE WINDOWS CLOSED.

98
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,584
DID YOU THINK
I'D JUMP?

99
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,002
YOU M IGHT HAVE.

100
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,004
NOT A CHANCE.
I WANT TO LIVE.

101
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,589
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

102
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,216
OH?

103
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,719
ALL RIGHT, MR. HALL,
SUPPOSE YOU TELL ME

104
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,389
ALL ABOUT IT. EVERYTHING.

105
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,973
START ANYWHERE.

106
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,559
OKAY, BUT I'M
WARNING YOU

107
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,603
YOU'RE GONNA THINK
I LOST MY MARBLES.

108
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,815
NO. MARBLES
CAN BE FOUND, MR. HALL.

109
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,109
GO ON.

110
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,746
DID YOU EVER LOOK
AT THIS PICTURE?

111
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,623
I MEAN,
REALLY LOOK AT IT?

112
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,627
(Doctor)
I THINK SO, WHY?

113
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,547
HAS IT EVER MOVED?

114
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,923
NO.

115
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,591
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, ANYWAY.

116
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,094
I CAN MAKE IT MOVE.

117
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,346
CAN YOU?

118
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,431
YES.

119
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,726
BUT NOT REALLY.

120
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,729
WHEN I WAS A KID,
WE HAD A PICTURE LIKE
THIS IN OUR HOUSE.

121
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,190
NOT THE SAME THING EXACTLY,
BUT PRETTY CLOSE.

122
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,401
A BOAT.

123
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,070
(Hall)
MY MOTHER
USED TO TELL ME
TO LOOK AT IT.

124
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,407
SHE SAID IF
I LOOKED AT IT
LONG ENOUGH IT WOULD MOVE.

125
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,535
ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS KEEP LOOKING AT IT.

126
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,164
I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER,
BUT THE IDEA FASCINATED ME.

127
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,543
ONE NIGHT I SPENT
A WHOLE HOUR JUST
STARING AT THAT SILLY BOAT.

128
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,421
AND DID IT MOVE?

129
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,423
YES.

130
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,468
NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND,
THERE'S NOTHING
STRANGE ABOUT THAT.

131
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,969
IT WAS AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.

132
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,804
YEAH, I KNOW.

133
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,183
EXCEPT THAT AFTER A WHILE,
I COULDN'T CONTROL IT.

134
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,977
EVERY TIME
I LOOKED AT THAT BOAT,
THE SAILS WOULD FILL,

135
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,687
AND THEY WOULD BEGIN TO DIP.

136
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,523
I JUST COULDN'T STOP IT.

137
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,234
IMAGINATION IS STRONG
IN A GROWING BOY.

138
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,611
YEAH, I REALIZE THAT.

139
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,405
I REALIZED IT
EVEN THEN.

140
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,491
BUT THE POINT IS,

141
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,744
I GOT JUST
AS SCARED AS IF IT
WERE REALLY HAPPENING.

142
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,496
THE M IND IS EVERYTHING.

143
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,623
IF YOU THINK YOU'VE
GOT A PAIN
IN YOUR ARM,

144
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,708
AND THERE'S NO
PHYSICAL REASON FOR IT,

145
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,085
IT HURTS
JUST THE SAME,
DOESN'T IT?

146
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,087
GRANTED.

147
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,644
IS THAT HOW YOU MANAGE
TO STAY AWAKE?

148
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,021
HOW ELSE?

149
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,231
HOW MANY GRAINS A DAY?

150
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,690
I DON'T KNOW.

151
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,609
I HAVEN'T GOT
MUCH LONGER ANYWAY.

152
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,569
YOU WANT TO HEAR
THE REST OR NOT?

153
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,404
YES.

154
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,951
WHEN I WAS 1 5,
I DEVELOPED
A RHEUMATIC HEART.

155
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,704
THEY SAID I'D NEVER
REALLY GET WELL.

156
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,373
THAT I'D HAVE
TO TAKE IT EASY.

157
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,874
NO STRENUOUS EXERCISE.

158
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,876
NO LONG WALKS,

159
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,087
NO STAIRS, NO SHOCKS.

160
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:12,676
AVOID ANY KIND
OF SHOCK, THEY SAID.

161
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,011
THEY FORGOT
ABOUT MY IMAGINATION.

162
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,014
THREE YEARS AGO,
A WOMAN WAS KILLED BY A MAN

163
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,392
WHO WAS HIDDEN
IN THE BACKSEAT OF HER CAR.

164
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,353
YOU MAY HAVE
READ ABOUT IT. I DID.

165
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,730
ANYWAY, IT STARTED
ME THINKING.

166
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,733
MAYBE SOMEBODY WAS HIDING
IN THE BACKSEAT OF MY CAR.

167
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,069
MAYBE ONE NIGHT DRIVING
OVER LAUREL CANYON,

168
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,946
I'D LOOK UP IN
THE REAR-VIEW M IRROR.

169
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,864
AND I'D SEE SOMEBODY
OR SOMETHING

170
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,369
COMING UP
OUT OF THE DARKNESS.

171
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,955
I HAD TO DRIVE
THE CANYON TWICE A DAY.

172
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,082
IT'S A ROUGH ROAD.

173
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,293
ONE SLIP
AND YOU'RE OVER THE EDGE.

174
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,045
ONE NIGHT,
LIKE EVERY OTHER NIGHT,
I HEADED FOR HOME.

175
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,214
SUDDENLY, I
FELT UNCOMFORTABLE,

176
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,466
AS IF I WEREN'T ALONE
IN THE CAR.

177
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,761
IT WAS RIDICULOUS,
BUT I COULDN'T SHAKE
THE SENSATION.

178
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,015
I KEPT THINKING
THERE'S SOMEBODY BACK THERE.

179
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,892
I'LL LOOK
IN THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR
AND I'LL SEE HIS FACE.

180
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,895
THEN I'LL SEE
HIS HANDS REACHING UP,

181
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,732
HERE'S THE IMPORTANT
THING, DOCTOR.

182
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,109
I KNEW INTELLECTUALLY
THAT I WAS ALONE.

183
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,486
BUT I ALSO KNEW
THAT MY IMAGINATION

184
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,532
WOULD MAKE ME
SEE SOMETHING IF I
THOUGHT ABOUT IT LONG ENOUGH.

185
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,409
[eerie music]

186
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,547
[honking horn]

187
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,842
[brakes screech]

188
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,389
OF COURSE, THERE WASN'T
ANYONE ELSE IN THE CAR.

189
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,017
IT WAS ALL IN MY M IND.

190
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,604
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DID THAT MAKE?
I CRASHED ANYWAY.

191
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,064
I WAS LUCKY.

192
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,274
THE SHOCK SHOULD
HAVE KILLED ME.

193
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,943
I COULDN'T
SURVIVE ANOTHER ONE,
THE DOCTOR SAID.

194
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,362
I COULD BE SURE
OF THAT.

195
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,281
AND HAS THERE
BEEN ANOTHER ONE?

196
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,158
NO.

197
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,952
BUT THERE WILL BE,
JUST AS SOON AS
I FALL ASLEEP.

198
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,996
THE GIRL WILL BE
IN THIS DREAM AGAIN.

199
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,333
AND IT'LL BE THE LAST SHOCK.

200
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,559
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I USED TO DREAM
IN SEQUENCE.

201
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,521
REMEMBER
THE ADVENTURE SERIALS

202
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,439
THEY USED TO HAVE
IN MOVIE THEATERS?

203
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,774
IT WAS LIKE THAT.

204
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,194
EVERY DREAM
WAS A CHAPTER.

205
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,488
I'D ALWAYS REMEMBER
BECAUSE WHEN I WOKE UP,

206
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,073
I'D WRITE DOWN
WHAT HAPPENED.

207
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,116
IT'S CRAZY, HUH?

208
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,159
NOT NECESSARILY.

209
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,246
IT COULD SIMPLY
BE THAT THE DREAMS
CONFORMED TO THE NOTES,

210
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,248
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

211
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,209
THEN YOU DON'T
THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
TO DREAM IN EPISODES?

212
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,128
I DON'T SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

213
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,798
IT ISN'T. BELIEVE ME.

214
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,759
FOR A LONG TIME,
I DIDN'T DREAM AT ALL.

215
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,011
THEN A WEEK AGO,
IT STARTED.

216
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,557
I WENT TO BED
AT AROUND 1 1 :30.

217
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:09,102
I WASN'T TOO TIRED,
BUT I NEEDED THE REST
BECAUSE OF MY HEART.

218
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,771
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I FELL ASLEEP,
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN,

219
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,773
I WASN'T AT HOME ANYMORE.

220
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,400
I WAS AT
AN AMUSEMENT PARK.

221
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,318
[merry-go-round

222

[maniacal laughter]

223
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,826
(Hall)
IT WAS THE KIND OF PLACE
YOU SEE ONLY IN NIGHTMARES,

224
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,245
EVERYTHING WARPED
AND TWISTED OUT OF SHAPE,

225
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,789
BUT IT WAS REAL, TOO.
VERY REAL.

226
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,500
(Barker)
HURRY, HURRY, HURRY,

227
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,711
THIS IS WHERE YOU GET
THOSE BIG PRIZES.

228
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,504
SIX SHOTS
FOR A DIME.

229
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,840
HIT THE BULL'S-EYE
AND YOU GET A KEWPIE DOLL.

230
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,175
HOW ABOUT IT?
COME ON.

231
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,051
TEN CENTS.
TEN PENNIES.

232
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,304
(Barker 2)
HURRY HURRY,
HURRY, FRIENDS,

233
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,889
THE SHOW
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

234
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,515
SEE HER DANCE.
SEE HER WIGGLE.

235
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,434
THE MOST SENSATIONAL

236
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,187
AND ELECTRIFYING EXHIBITION
SINCE LITTLE EGYPT.

237
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,272
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING

238
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,233
STANDING OUT THERE.
YOU'VE GOTTA GET
DOWN CLOSER.

239
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,986
RIGHT DOWN CLOSE.
THAT'S IT, NOT TOO CLOSE.

240
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,821
LET'S NOT
TRAMPLE EACH OTHER.

241
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,657
NOW, YOU SAY
YOU WANT FAT
ONES? WE GOT 'EM.

242
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,118
YOU SAY
YOU WANT THIN ONES?
WE'VE GOT THEM.

243
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,413
BLONDS, BRUNETTES,
REDHEADS, AND BELIEVE
ME, FOLKS,

244
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,124
IF THEY AIN'T UP HERE,
THEY AIN'T WORTH
LOOKING AT.

245
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,460
AND NOW, TO GIVE YOU
A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION

246
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,587
OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO SEE ON THE INSIDE,

247
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,006
MAYA, THE CAT GIRL!

248
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,299
COME ON, BABY.

249
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,967
WE KNOW YOU'RE MODEST,

250
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,803
BUT WHY SHOULD
THE FOLKS OUT THERE

251
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,805
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT?

252
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,140
[sIow percussion music]

253
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,778
[maniacaI Iaughter]

254
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,574
(Hall)
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO THE GIRL WAS.

255
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,242
I'D NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.

256
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,244
BUT AS MUCH
AS I WAS DRAWN TO HER,

257
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,413
I KNEW I HAD
TO GET AWAY FROM HER.

258
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,373
THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT HER EYES.

259
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:39,085
SOMETHING DEEP
INSIDE THOSE DARK CAT'S EYES.

260
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,134
MAYA.

261
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,052
WHY DID
YOU DO THAT?

262
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,804
WHY DID I DO WHAT?

263
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,723
RUN AWAY.

264
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,100
I FELT LIKE IT.

265
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,937
YOU DIDN'T FIND ME
NICE TO LOOK AT?

266
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,773
YEAH, MAYBE TOO NICE.

267
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,859
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE BACK THERE

268
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:07,030
ENTERTAINING THE CUSTOMERS?

269
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,283
I'M FREE.
FOR THE NIGHT.

270
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,118
ARE YOU ALONE?

271
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,203
YES.

272
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,544
THEN COME WITH ME.

273
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,967
YOU WANT TO.
DON'T YOU, EDWARD?

274
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,054
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

275
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,390
OH, I KNOW
A LOT OF THINGS. I'M MAYA.

276
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,268
DON'T BE AFRAID.

277
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,521
I'M NOT.

278
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,690
THEN COME.

279
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,069
YOU ARE AFRAID.

280
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,529
ONLY BECAUSE THIS
ISN'T HAPPENING.

281
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,531
THIS IS A DREAM.

282
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,450
I'M NOT HERE,
I'M AT HOME, ASLEEP

283
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,202
AND YOU'RE PART
OF THAT DREAM.

284
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,454
I KNOW THAT.

285
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,499
YOU DO?

286
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,251
OF COURSE.

287
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,380
COME.

288
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,548
[eerie music]

289
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,258
COME.

290
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,366
TAKE ME
IN THERE, EDWARD.

291
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,536
IT'S DARK INSIDE.

292
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,081
SOFT AND COOL
AND DARK.

293
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,875
PLEASE?

294
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,713
HOW CAN I ARGUE
WITH A DREAM?

295
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,398
[eerie music
and maniacal laughter]

296
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,969
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING
YOU, MR. HALL.

297
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,222
WHAT?

298
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,434
YOU CAN
KISS ME NOW.

299
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,811
WHAT IF
I DON'T WANT TO?

300
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,773
OH, YOU WANT TO.

301
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,317
LOOK, WHO'S DREAM
IS THIS, ANYWAY?

302
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,995
[screaming in terror]

303
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,168
[maniacaI Iaughter]

304
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,058
(Hall)
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
SHE WAS TRYING TO KILL ME.

305
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,186
AND YOU WOKE UP THEN?

306
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,604
YES.

307
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,065
MY HEART
WAS BEATING FAST.

308
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,693
I HAD TO LIE STILL
FOR AN HOUR WAITING
FOR IT TO SETTLE DOWN.

309
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,196
THE DOCTOR SAID
I ALMOST HAD IT.

310
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,240
TELL ME, DO YOU KNOW
WHO THE GIRL WAS?

311
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,325
NO IDEA.

312
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,411
SHE LOOKED FAM ILIAR,
BUT I KNOW I'VE NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE,

313
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,622
EXCEPT MAYBE
ON THE STREET OR SOMETHING.

314
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,958
BUT YOU'RE SURE
SHE WANTED TO KILL YOU?

315
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,043
YEAH.

316
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,295
GO ON.

317
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,674
THE NEXT NIGHT
I PUT OFF GOING
TO SLEEP UNTIL 1 :00.

318
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,926
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.

319
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,011
THE DREAM WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

320
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,472
I WAS BACK
IN THE AMUSEMENT PARK.

321
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,683
[panting]
I WAS RUNNING.

322
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,482
(Maya)
EDWARD.

323
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,111
EDWARD!

324
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,737
GET AWAY FROM ME.

325
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,948
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF, EDWARD.

326
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,324
IT'S ONLY A DREAM.

327
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,118
I'VE GOT
A HEART CONDITION.

328
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,995
I CAN'T STAND
ALL THIS EXCITEMENT.

329
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,664
THAT'S SILLY.
THERE ISN'T
ANY EXCITEMENT.

330
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,624
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

331
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,002
YOU'RE AT HOME,
ASLEEP IN BED.

332
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,755
NOW YOU CAN DO ALL
THE THINGS YOU CAN'T
DO WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE.

333
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,757
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,760
LOOK EDWARD,

LOOK, EDWARD, LOOK.

[roller coaster rattling]

338
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,895
COME ON,
EDWARD, IT'S FUN!

339
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,480
COME ON.

340
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,942
(Hall, off)
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT

341
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,444
BUT I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF

342
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,529
I HAD TO FOLLOW HER,

343
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,907
EVEN THOUGH
I KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT IT WOULD MEAN,

344
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,784
I HAD TO FOLLOW HER.

345
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,057
[Iaughing]
HOLD ON, EDWARD.
[eerie music]

346
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,169
STOP IT! STOP IT!

347
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,129
THEY CAN'T. IT'S TOO LATE.

348
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,908
I'VE GOT TO GET OFF!
I'VE GOT TO GET OFF!

349
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,910
JUMP, EDWARD, JUMP!

350
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:32,748
(Maya)
JUMP, EDWARD, JUMP!

351
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,959
(Doctor)
AND IS THAT IT?

352
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,044
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

353
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,131
IF I GO TO SLEEP
I'LL GO RIGHT BACK
TO THE ROLLER COASTER.

354
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,091
MAYA WILL REACH ME.

355
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,676
SHE'LL PUSH ME.

356
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,469
AND THAT'LL BE
THE END OF ME.

357
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,805
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IF I STAY AWAKE
ANY LONGER,

358
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,974
THE STRAIN WILL BE
TOO MUCH FOR MY HEART.

359
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,684
AND THAT'LL BE THE END OF ME.

360
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,562
HEADS, YOU WIN.
TAILS, I LOSE.

361
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,647
IT'S QUITE A CHOICE,
HUH, DOCTOR?

362
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,320
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

363
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,988
OUT, TO GET
SOME FRESH AIR.

364
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,489
I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT.

365
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,533
WHAT DO YOU ADVISE?
A STRAITJACKET?

366
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,660
SO LONG, DOC.

367
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,663
YOU CAN'T DO
ANYTHING MORE FOR ME.

368
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,093
MAYA!

369
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,185
WHAT'S THE MATTER, HALL?

370
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,353
IT'S HER.

371
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,271
MY RECEPTIONIST?

372
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,274
I'M SORRY,
BUT HER NAME DOESN'T
HAPPEN TO BE MAYA.

373
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,486
[disturbing music]

374
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,784
[screaming]

375
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,837
MISS THOMAS?

376
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,297
YES, DOCTOR?

377
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,258
WOULD YOU COME
HERE, PLEASE?

378
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,976
I'M AFRAID HE'S DEAD.

379
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,480
BUT HE CAME IN
JUST A M INUTE AGO.

380
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,399
I KNOW.

381
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,777
WHEN HE CAME IN,
I TOLD HIM TO SIT
DOWN AND HE DID.

382
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:28,864
IN LESS THAN
TWO SECONDS
HE WAS ASLEEP.

383
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,078
AND THEN
HE GAVE THAT
SCREAM YOU HEARD.

384
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,705
HEART ATTACK?

385
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,999
PROBABLY.

386
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,253
WELL, I GUESS
THERE ARE WORSE
WAYS TO GO.

387
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:47,216
AT LEAST
HE DIED PEACEFULLY.

388
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,346
(male presenter, off)
THEY SAY A DREAM TAKES
ONLY A SECOND OR SO,

389
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,849
YET IN THAT SECOND,
A MAN CAN LIVE A LIFETIME.

390
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,767
HE CAN SUFFER ANDIE,

391
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,937
AND WHO'S TO SAY
WHICHIS THE GREATER REALITY?

392
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,357
THE ONE WE KNOW
OR THE ONE IN DREAMS?

393
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,194
BETWEEN HEAVEN,
THE SKY, THE EARTH,

394
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,488

(male presenter, off)
AND NOW, MR. SERLING.

399
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,006
ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WAS A SHIP SAILING

400
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,300
FROM LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND
TO NEW YORK.

401
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,636
IT NEVER GOT THERE
AND ONE MAN ON BOARD
KNEW WHY.

402
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,722
NEXT WEEK WE TELL
THIS MAN'S STORY.

A HAUNTED MAN

406
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,813
CALLED "JUDGMENT NIGHT."

407
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,733
THIS SHIP SAILS
NEXT WEEK AND WE HOPE
YOU'LL SEE IT OFF.

THIS IS AN OASIS, TOO.

JUST AS THE MIST
