328
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,458
- No. I don't take passengers.
- The law makes you accept any fare.

329
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,668
You don't understand.
This cab isn't real.

330
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,754
What's your medallion number?

331
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,298
My medallion number is,
get out of the cab!

332
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,092
- What?
- Get out of the cab!

333
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,602
Oh, hey, can I give you guys
your housewarming gift now?

334
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:48,814
- Now, that you can do.
- All right.

335
00:22:57,656 --> 00:23:01,952
Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.?

336
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:06,373
Don't hide from Mama!

337
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,007
You can open your eyes now.

338
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:18,468
- Are we off the bridge?
- Yes!

339
00:23:18,635 --> 00:23:24,224
- Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
- Yeah, she jumped right back up.

340
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:28,645
- Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down!
- Do you want to get to Rachel in time?

341
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:30,939
Yes, but I don't want
to die in your cab.

342
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:34,734
You should have thought of that
before you got in!

343
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:36,820
- Tollbooth.
- What?

344
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:39,281
Toll booth!

345
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:42,158
Four bucks. There are quarters
in the glove compartment.

346
00:23:44,452 --> 00:23:46,121
Hurry!

347
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,498
Okay. Aah!

348
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,586
Damn, that window's clean.

349
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:56,089
Quack, quack. Tweet, tweet.
Quack, quack.

350
00:23:56,423 --> 00:23:58,633
Tweet, tweet. Quack, quack.

351
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,597
Tweet, tweet. Quack, quack.
Tweet, tweet. Quack, tweet, quack.

352
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:07,100
We were wondering
what was taking so long...

353
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:10,562
...but now we understand.
You were doing this.

354
00:24:12,606 --> 00:24:15,775
Okay. I wanted to surprise you, but...

355
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:20,280
For your housewarming gift,
I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.

356
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:22,991
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?

357
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:28,705
Oh, great. Just what you want for
a new house with infants. Bird feces!

358
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:31,541
But they must've jumped off the table.
Now they're gone!

359
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,293
Don't worry, we'll find them.

360
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,378
- I'm gonna go check on the twins.
- All right.

361
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:39,215
Oh, God! What did I just step on?

362
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:42,302
- It's okay. It's just an egg roll.
- Oh.

363
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:44,888
You stepped on my egg roll?

364
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:49,100
I'm sorry. I didn't know to look
for Chinese food on the floor.

365
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:50,936
Just put it on a plate and leave.

366
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:58,652
- Okay. Let's find these birds.
- All right.

367
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:04,407
Wait, wait. You hear that?

368
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:11,206
- They're in the table!
- Well, that can't be good.

369
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,375
- We gotta get them out of there!
- How?

370
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,294
Maybe we can lure them out.
You know any birdcalls?

371
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,130
Oh, tons. I'm quite the Woodsman.

372
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,593
Well, maybe we can just
tip the table a little.

373
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:26,596
Joey, wait! The ball!

374
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:43,989
So, what do we do?

375
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:46,116
Maybe we can open this up somehow.

376
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:47,909
Okay.

377
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:52,747
No. It's all glued together.

378
00:25:52,956 --> 00:25:55,959
Does that mean
we have to bust it open?

379
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:59,921
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Oh, my God.

380
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:05,010
I know. it's... It's the foosball table.

381
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:09,097
All right, you know what?
We don't have a choice.

382
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:13,059
It's like I would have said in that
sci-fi movie if I'd have gotten the part.

383
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:17,564
Those are our men in there,
and we have to get them out...

384
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:21,735
...even if I have to sacrifice
the most important thing in my life...

385
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:23,903
...my time machine.

386
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:28,366
- Did that movie ever get made?
- It did not.

387
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:35,331
Jack Weinberg,
white courtesy phone. Jack Weinberg.

388
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,834
- Ross, where are you going?
- Uh, to talk to Rachel.

389
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,670
Isn't that why we took a ride
in the death cab?

390
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:42,672
You're walking up to her at the gate?

391
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:45,508
Have you never chased anyone
through the airport before?

392
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:48,011
Not since my cop show got canceled.

393
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:51,514
You have to get a ticket
to get past security.

394
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:55,685
- What? We're never gonna make it.
- Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!

395
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:02,400
Okay, if you could all walk slower,
that'd be great.

396
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:12,452
- Madame, your passport, please.
- Oh, my God.

397
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:15,330
I was afraid I wouldn't remember
any of my high school French.

398
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:18,333
But I understood every word
you just said.

399
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,337
- Your boarding pass, please.
- Oh, sure.

400
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:24,297
Oh...

401
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:28,134
Shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.

402
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,304
- Madame, if you don't have your...
- I have it, I have it!

403
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,473
Oh...

404
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,812
Okay, I can't find it, but I remember
that I was in seat 32C...

405
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:41,648
...because that's my bra size.

406
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:44,192
You must have your boarding pass...

407
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,821
You know what? If I was in 36D,
we would not be having this problem.

408
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,081
- Hi. I need a ticket.
- Just one?

409
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,084
I drive you here, and I don't get
to see how it works out?

410
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:05,755
- Fine. Two tickets. I need two tickets.
- We're on our honeymoon.

411
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:10,468
- And the destination?
- I don't care. Whatever's the cheapest.

412
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,971
I'm so lucky I married you.

413
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:19,310
Oh, shoot. Damn it. Where is it?

414
00:28:20,228 --> 00:28:23,565
I found it. I found it.
I told you I would find it.

415
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:25,984
In your face. You're a different person.

416
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:29,362
Sorry.

417
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,741
Okay. Flight 421, Paris.

418
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,953
- I don't see it. Do you see it?
- No. Did we miss it?

419
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,456
No, no, it's impossible.
It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.

420
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:43,209
Maybe we have the flight number wrong.

421
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:45,336
God.

422
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:49,299
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.

423
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:50,842
What?

424
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:53,261
Hey. Hey, listen...

425
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:57,640
You wouldn't believe the cute noises
the twins are making. Wait, listen.

426
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:00,059
But Monica...

427
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:04,606
Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica.

428
00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:07,358
I'm sorry. They were doing it before.

429
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:10,987
- That's all right. Listen, listen.
- Oh, wait, wait. Here they go again.

430
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:15,116
Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica.

431
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,035
- Monica?
- Isn't that cute?

432
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:20,163
That is precious! Listen...

433
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,625
- I need Rachel's flight information.
- Oh, okay.

434
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:29,589
- All right, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
- I have that. It's not on the board.

435
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:33,927
That's what it says here. Flight 421.
Leaves at 8:40. Newark Airport.

436
00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:36,429
- What?
- Newark Airport.

437
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:41,100
- Why? Where are you?
- JFK.

438
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,217
Don't worry, you guys!
We're gonna get you out of there!

439
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:18,930
And we're also gonna buy you
tiny bird hearing aids.

440
00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:27,981
Okay. Here goes.

441
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:34,362
What's the matter?

442
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:38,449
I need to say goodbye to the table first.

443
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:41,869
I understand.

444
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:44,205
Okay.

445
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:50,211
Table...

446
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:55,550
...you have given us
so many great times.

447
00:30:56,843 --> 00:31:03,474
And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel...

448
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:07,353
All of you guys. What can I say?

449
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,026
You guys make us look good.

450
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:19,365
- You want to say anything?
- I don't know.

451
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:25,246
Except that, for one last time...

452
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:28,333
Good game. Good game. Good game.

453
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:34,047
- Good game.
- Yeah.

454
00:31:37,508 --> 00:31:39,510
Okay. Here we go.

455
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:49,604
I can't do it.

456
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:52,023
Well, I can't do it either.

457
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:56,235
- Hey. Did you find them?
- Yeah. They're stuck inside the table.

458
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:59,113
And we have to bust it open,
but neither of us can do it.

459
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,494
Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.

460
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:06,746
I'll do it. Give me.

461
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:14,420
Phoebe! No, no, no!

462
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:19,592
Wow, I've never gone this fast before.

463
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:23,096
Phoebe, forget it, okay?
Newark is, like, an hour away.

464
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:25,098
There's no way we'll make it in time.

465
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:29,102
- She's got her cell. You could call her.
- I am not doing this over the phone.

466
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,104
You don't have any other choice.

467
00:32:38,444 --> 00:32:40,363
- Hello?
- Rachel. Oh, good.

468
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:42,657
By the way,
did you just get on the plane?

469
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:44,617
- Yeah.
- We would have caught her...

470
00:32:44,784 --> 00:32:47,328
- ...if we were at the right airport.
- Yay.

471
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,873
Um, Rachel, hang on.

472
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:53,292
No. No. No.

473
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,211
Phoebe, is everything okay?

474
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:57,463
Um...

475
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,343
Actually, no. No.
You have to get off the plane.

476
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,470
- What? Why?
- I have this feeling that...

477
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:10,309
...something's wrong with it.
Something is wrong with the left phalange.

478
00:33:12,311 --> 00:33:15,189
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's
nothing wrong with the plane.

479
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:20,653
Look, I have to go. I love you, and I
will call you the minute I get to Paris.

480
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:23,156
Um, ahem...

481
00:33:23,322 --> 00:33:26,367
- What was that?
- Oh, that was just my crazy friend.

482
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:30,079
She told me to get off the plane
because she had a "feeling" that there...

483
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:33,916
...was something wrong
with the left phalange.

484
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:38,337
- Okay. Uh, that doesn't sound good.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

485
00:33:38,504 --> 00:33:41,299
She comes up with this stuff,
and she's almost never right.

486
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:44,135
- But she is sometimes.
- Well...

487
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,598
- What are you doing?
- I can't take this plane now.

488
00:33:48,764 --> 00:33:52,101
- Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?
- I have to get off this plane.

489
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:56,439
Her friend has a feeling something's wrong
with the left phalange.

490
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,487
Could I get some peanuts?

491
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:06,949
- What's wrong with the plane?
- There's nothing wrong.

492
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:10,036
- The left phalange.
- There's no "phalange."

493
00:34:10,244 --> 00:34:12,955
Oh, my God. This plane
doesn't even have a phalange.

494
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,584
- I'm not flying on it.
- Please sit down.

495
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:21,214
- What's going on'?
- We're getting off. There is no phalange!

496
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:27,303
This is ridiculous. I...

497
00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:32,058
Yeah, okay.

498
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:43,110
All right. My job here is done.

499
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:46,656
That was impressive.

500
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:50,451
Yeah. You didn't even use the tools
for most of it.

501
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,246
Yeah, they were just slowing me down.

502
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:58,459
All right. I gotta get back to the babies.
See you girls later.

503
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:05,216
- Sorry about the table, man.
- Yeah.

504
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,552
You gonna buy a new one?

505
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:11,138
Probably not. No.

506
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:14,433
I don't know how much I'm gonna
want to play after you go.

507
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:20,856
- Well, at least we got these little guys out.
- Yeah.

508
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:23,526
Aw, we were worried about you.

509
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,488
Hm.

510
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:32,326
I guess I better get used to things
crapping in my hand, huh?

511
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,296
I'm gonna miss these little guys.

512
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:45,298
It was nice having birds around again.

513
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:50,886
Hey, you know what? Maybe we
should keep them here with you.

514
00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:53,973
- What?
- Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.

515
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,310
And plus, here,
they'd have their own room.

516
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,855
I could get a goose!

517
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:06,110
You know, I think you're set
with the poultry.

518
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:10,531
Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?

519
00:36:10,698 --> 00:36:14,744
You're gonna get to stay here.
And it's good...

520
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,330
...you know, because, uh...

521
00:36:17,997 --> 00:36:20,666
Because now you have a reason
to come visit.

522
00:36:23,502 --> 00:36:26,714
I think there may be another reason.

523
00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:36,349
So, uh...

524
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,897
Awkward hug
or lame cool-guy handshake?

525
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:46,859
Yeah, well, you know,
lame cool-guy handshake.

526
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:11,092
- Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
- And you fixed the phalange?

527
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:14,095
Yes. The phalange's fixed.

528
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:18,432
In fact, we've put a whole lot of extra
phalanges on board, just in case.

529
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:23,604
Paging Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Josh Anderson.

530
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:25,523
- Where is she?
- I don't see her.

531
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,900
- Rachel! Rachel Green!
- There she is!

532
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:31,445
Rachel! Rachel!

533
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:35,157
- Whoa, do you have a boarding pass?
- No. I just have to talk to someone.

534
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:37,118
I'm sorry. You need a boarding pass.

535
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,914
- No, no. But you don't...
- Rachel!

536
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:46,043
What? Oh, my God.
What are you guys doing here?

537
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:48,921
Okay. You're on.

538
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:52,425
What? What, Ross? Okay, you're
scaring me. What's going on?

539
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:55,469
- Okay. Thing is...
- Yeah.

540
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,514
- Don't go.
- What?

541
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:03,686
Please, please stay with me. I am
so in love with you. Please don't go.

542
00:38:04,812 --> 00:38:07,022
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I know.

543
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:11,944
I shouldn't have waited till now to say it,
but, um... That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.

544
00:38:12,111 --> 00:38:14,989
But I'm telling you now. I love you.

545
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:21,328
- Do not get on this plane.
- Miss, are you boarding the plane?

546
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,456
(Hey, he)'-

547
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:28,294
I know you love me. I know you do.

548
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:30,504
- Miss
- l...

549
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:33,340
I... I have to get on the plane.

550
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:34,800
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

551
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:37,636
- No, you don't.
- I do. They're waiting for me, Ross.

552
00:38:37,803 --> 00:38:41,307
I can't do this right now, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:43,392
Rachel.

554
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,978
I'm so sorry.

555
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:02,411
I really thought she'd stay.

556
00:39:02,661 --> 00:39:04,663
I know.

557
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,957
I'm sorry.

558
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:23,265
Well, that's it.

559
00:39:23,474 --> 00:39:24,892
Everything's packed.

560
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:28,103
Wow.

561
00:39:28,854 --> 00:39:31,190
- This is weird.
- I know.

562
00:39:31,357 --> 00:39:32,608
Yeah.

563
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:36,195
Uh, does this mean
there's nothing to eat?

564
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:39,865
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.

565
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:43,869
I love you.

566
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:49,375
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you guys make it in time?

567
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:53,712
Yeah, yeah. He talked to her,
but, um, she got on the plane anyway.

568
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,550
Where's Ross?

569
00:39:57,716 --> 00:39:59,927
He went home.
He didn't want to see anybody.

570
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:21,782
Ross. Hi, it's me.

571
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:26,745
I just got back on the plane,
and I just feel awful.

572
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,417
That is so not how I wanted things
to end with us.

573
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:35,588
It's just that I wasn't expecting
to see you.

574
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:39,258
And all of a sudden you're there
and saying these things.

575
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:43,679
Now I'm just sitting here and thinking...

576
00:40:43,846 --> 00:40:47,600
...of all the stuff I should have said
and I didn't.

577
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,645
I mean, I didn't even get to tell you
that I love you too.

578
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:55,774
Because of course I do. I love you.

579
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,778
I love you.

580
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:02,448
I love you.

581
00:41:02,948 --> 00:41:07,286
What am I doing? I love you.

582
00:41:09,455 --> 00:41:12,458
I've got to see you.
I've got to get off this plane.

583
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,376
Oh, my God.

584
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:17,630
- Okay, excuse me.
- Miss, please sit down.

585
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:20,966
No, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,
but I need to get off the plane.

586
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:24,178
- I need to tell someone that I love them.
- I can't let you off.

587
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:27,306
Let her off the plane!

588
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:29,808
You have to take your seat.

589
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:32,394
Oh, please, miss.
You don't understand.

590
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:35,147
Try to understand!

591
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:38,150
Come on, miss, isn't there any way
that you can just let me off the...?

592
00:41:39,652 --> 00:41:41,528
No! No!

593
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:46,742
Oh, my God. Did she get off the plane?
Did she get off the plane?

594
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,829
I got off the plane.

595
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,675
You got off the plane.

596
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,606
I do love you.

597
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:20,359
I love you too, and I am never
letting you go again.

598
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:23,862
Okay. Because this is where I want
to be. Okay? No more messing around.

599
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:28,200
- I don't want to mess this up again.
- Me neither. We're done being stupid.

600
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:31,036
Okay. It's you and me, all right?
This is it.

601
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:34,873
This is it. Unless we're on a break.

602
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:46,343
Don't make jokes now.

603
00:43:07,448 --> 00:43:10,409
Okay, please be careful with that.
It was my grandmother's. Be careful.

604
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,202
Thank you.

605
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:15,789
If that falls off the truck,
it wouldn't be the worst thing.

606
00:43:24,423 --> 00:43:26,050
Wow.

607
00:43:27,676 --> 00:43:29,386
I know.

608
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:32,264
Seems smaller somehow.

609
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:37,186
Has it always been purple?

610
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:43,901
Look around, you guys.
This was your first home.

611
00:43:45,152 --> 00:43:51,200
And it was a happy place,
filled with love and laughter.

612
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:56,163
But more important, because
of rent control, it was a frigging steal.

613
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:05,047
Hey, do you realize that, at one time or
another, we all lived in this apartment?

614
00:44:05,631 --> 00:44:07,382
Oh, yeah. That's true.

615
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:09,968
Uh, I haven't.

616
00:44:11,053 --> 00:44:14,306
What about that summer during college
that you lived with Grandma...

617
00:44:14,473 --> 00:44:17,267
...and you tried to make it as a dancer?

618
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,984
Do you realize we almost made it
10 years without that coming up?

619
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:33,325
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger
that we'd leave our keys.

620
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:35,744
Oh, okay.

621
00:45:09,778 --> 00:45:13,157
- So I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

622
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:16,118
I guess so.

623
00:45:18,245 --> 00:45:20,664
This is harder than I thought
it would be.

624
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:23,375
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

625
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:27,629
Come on.

626
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,099
Do you guys have to go to the new
house now, or do you have some time?

627
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:43,145
We got some time.

628
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,733
- Okay. Should we get some coffee?
- Sure.

629
00:45:48,817 --> 00:45:50,402
Where?
