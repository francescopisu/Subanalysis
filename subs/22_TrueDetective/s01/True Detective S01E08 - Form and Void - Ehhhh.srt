1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:02,941
We left something undone.

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:04,146
We gotta fix it.

3
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:06,513
He and I were on
a case in Erath.

4
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:08,396
A girl comes forward and
says she was chased

5
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:10,683
through the woods
by a spaghetti monster

6
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,806
with green ears and I think

7
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:16,269
that this is our man
with the scars on his face.

8
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,458
What happened to
Billy Lee Tuttle?

9
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,532
I staked
his places out for weeks.

10
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,253
Found those in the safe there.

11
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:23,858
There was a videotape.

12
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:26,197
No!

13
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:29,664
Out of all these
kids running around,

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,587
you remember one that maybe had
scars all across the bottom of his face?

15
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:37,502
I think that was
Mr. Sam's grandchild.

16
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,927
Could you have a look at
something for me? One thing.

17
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:41,592
You know Carcosa?

18
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:44,459
Did some backtracking
on the Marie Fontenot stuff.

19
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:48,450
Sheriff didn't take the original
complaint, deputy did.

20
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:50,374
Steve Geraci.

21
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,577
I said all I remember
about the girl,

22
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:54,001
and don't ask again.

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,348
I ain't gonna ask you.

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,633

42
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:50,056
Them flies are gettin' thick.

43
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,592
Somebody ought to give you
a good hosin'.

44
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:56,596
Hmm. Heat ain't helpin'.

45
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,634
Eh, reckon you'll keep
another day.

46
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:04,804
Be good, I'll bring you
some more water round noon.

47
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:08,475
Bye, Daddy.

48
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,134
Hey!

49
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:37,537
Come on. Come on.

50
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:40,006
Come on.

51
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,975
What the
devil is all this about?

52
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:43,976
Why was I brought here?

53
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:47,480
Games, must we?

54
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:50,617
Not that I mind
a slight case of abduction

55
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:52,985
now and then, but I have tickets
for the theater this evening,

56
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,655
to a show I was looking
forward to, and I get, well,

57
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,124
kind of unreasonable
about things like that.

58
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,260
With such expert play-acting, you
make this very room a theater...

59
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:04,263
You have a good walk?

60
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:06,766
Yes, my dear.

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,236
Top-notch walk
this morning.

62
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:13,606
Top-notch constitutional.

63
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:21,848
It's been weeks
since I left my mark.

64
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:24,317
Would that they had
eyes to see.

65
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:28,054
Hey! Don't you get Miss Billie
in here with them dirty feet!

66
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,431
Sorry, old chap.

67
00:04:56,116 --> 00:05:00,119
You want to make flowers today?

68
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:03,122
Now, Betty,

69
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:05,692
I have very important
work to do.

70
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:08,661
My...

71
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:12,666
ascension removes me from
the disc and the loop.

72
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,202
I'm near final stage.

73
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:17,670
Some mornings,

74
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:21,641
I can see the infernal plane.

75
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:25,712
You haven't made flowers
on me for maybe 3 weeks.

76
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:28,347
Makes me sad is all.

77
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:33,152
Ah, come up in me lap, lass.

78
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:37,323
Here, and let me comfort
ye in your distress.

79
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:40,460
You're make fun of me again.

80
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:43,463
Heh heh! Now, why'd I do
a thing like that, huh?

81
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:46,599
Is it because you're
ne so bright?

82
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:50,837
Because of your head bein'
so slow and like? Ha ha ha!

83
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:54,874
Oh, you better let me go
'cause I'm burn your eggs.

84
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:57,010
Hmm?

85
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:02,815
Mmm.

86
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:08,821
Couldn't
you tell me about Grampa?

87
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:13,960
Mmm.

88
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,663
Ah!

89
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,501
Mmm.

90
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:25,004
I was in the cane fields,

91
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,675
and he caught me
when I was alone.

92
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:32,144
And the dirt was warm.

93
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:35,514
I felt the dirt warm
on my back.

94
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,543
_

95
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:58,137
You're gonna lose a kneecap
if I got to ask you again.

96
00:06:58,171 --> 00:07:01,574
Take it out of the bag
and put it in the machine.

97
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:24,731
Don't look at me.

98
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:26,866
Look at the TV.

99
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:48,221
Oh, Jesus Christ.

100
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:51,124
Why are you showing me this?!

101
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:05,071
That little girl is the one you
said went to see her daddy.

102
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:08,340
Marie Fontenot, circa 1990.

103
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:14,713
I took a m-missing
juvenile report.

104
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,485
And when I went back
to follow up on it,

105
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,722
the file said,
"Report made in error."

106
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:26,725
I never wrote that.

107
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,263
So I marched it right in to
the sheriff, Ted Childress.

108
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:31,998
He's dead now.

109
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:33,666
He did it.

110
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:36,636
What'd the sheriff say?

111
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,571
He said he'd changed it,

112
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,673
that he knew the mother
and the father,

113
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,142
the aunt and the uncle.

114
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:46,345
It was a niece once removed
from him or somethin'.

115
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,848
It was the chain of command.

116
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:51,317
No reason to change it.

117
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:54,854
I just... follow what
the big man says.

118
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,824
It's...

119
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,427
how this all works.

120
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:03,430
I-- I tried to get back
with the mother.

121
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:05,031
I tried to get back with her.

122
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:07,066
She was gone! She split!

123
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,035
The file was gone!

124
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,503
Nobody said a word!

125
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:14,807
Later that year, I was in State
CID, on Ted's recommendation!

126
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:17,944
Nobody ever gave me
a reason to second-guess it!

127
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:20,947
It's chain of command!

128
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:23,082
Right?

129
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:28,120
What do you think?

130
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:31,658
I don't think he's lying...

131
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:34,160
as far as he knows.

132
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:36,362
As far as I know?

133
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:38,364
What the fuck is
with you, man?!

134
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:40,366
Might be a whole lot safer

135
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,869
if we staged
something, Marty...

136
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:45,672
sent the Maserati
over the guardrail.

137
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:57,083
Whoa!

138
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:04,023
Boys, slow down.

139
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:12,031
Be careful out there.

140
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:26,112
I can get you a cafeteria
lunch if you're hungry.

141
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:28,081
That's all right, Miss.

142
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:30,617
I've got to get on
with my work.

143
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:32,618
Lots to do today.

144
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:34,120
Oh, all right.

145
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:01,280
We're gonna hang onto
your phone and your gun

146
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:04,350
till we get safe and mail them
to you once we know we are.

147
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:06,319
That work for you, Steve?

148
00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:08,321
You can bet your ass
it doesn't.

149
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:11,423
And it's Sheriff Geraci
to you, shitheel.

150
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,927
Now, look, Steve, you're gonna want
to swing some dick on this thing.

151
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:17,429
I'm gonna give you a couple
reasons why you won't.

152
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:19,932
First off, we found this
tape in your possession.

153
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:23,569
It's a video of the little girl
that you said was not missing.

154
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:26,805
Second off, all findings are with
lawyers, ready to be forwarded

155
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,975
to media outlets, feds,

156
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,443
CID, US Attorneys,

157
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,746
should either one of us
get sworn a warrant or

158
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:36,248
if either one of us just fall off
the face of the fuckin' earth,

159
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:38,684
as people are wont to do
in your neck of the woods.

160
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:41,354
So you just think about
that little girl, Steve.

161
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,361
What about your boat?

162
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:51,297
That ain't my boat.

163
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:54,367
- You know whose boat that is?
- I never seen it before.

164
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:57,269
It's gonna come back
on you, you assholes,

165
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:59,272
one way or another.

166
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:01,240
You just think about
that little girl, Steve.

167
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:04,276
For quite some time, I'm gonna
be thinking about you, Rust.

168
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:06,278
Hey, one other thing, Steve.

169
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:08,514
Got an old sniper
pal, all right?

170
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:11,017
Contract's already been paid.

171
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,186
Me or Marty, we see
cuffs or coffins,

172
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,187
you're gonna end up
in the dirt.

173
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:17,223
Then we're gonna
smear your name.

174
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:20,226
I got something coming
for you, baby.

175
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,762
Your psycho bit
don't cur me, boy!

176
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:25,898
You hear me?!

177
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,540
What the fuck?! Hey!

178
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:46,919
I strike you as more of a
talker or a doer, Steve?

179
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:49,288
That's my fuckin' car!

180
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:50,756
God damn it!

181
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,658
L'chaim, fatass.

182
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:55,594
You motherfuckers!

183
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:58,197
Fuck you!

184
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:08,040
This old Sheriff Childress.

185
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:11,210
He's got no kids, no location
on any of his relatives.

186
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:15,047
You think they could have
wiped out birth records?

187
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:16,649
I don't see why not.

188
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:19,886
I mean, half those hospitals
along the coast are gone now.

189
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:23,755
You know, we got a dead end

190
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,292
on the relations and, uh,

191
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:28,294
what else is there?

192
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:30,396
Case files.

193
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,598
You want pre-'98
or after?

194
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:34,733
After.

195
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:39,638
We're gonna have to be looking at
these records with fresh eyes, Marty.

196
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:42,809
All right?
Like we're totally green.

197
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,262
Why green ears?

198
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,966
I mean, assuming
that's our guy.

199
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,969
I don't know, exactly.

200
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:12,304
My thinking was it was probably

201
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,440
leaves of some kind, you know,

202
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:17,310
'cause we do know that he came
at her through the woods.

203
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:27,586
Why?
What you thinking?

204
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:32,158
Looking for '95 Dora
Lange canvassing photos

205
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,193
from Erath.

206
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,195
Why?

207
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:38,830
Well...

208
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,218
Rust.

209
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:01,854
Come over here.

210
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:06,859
Now, you think, back
then, does that--

211
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:09,896
does that look like a fresh...

212
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,531
paint job to you?

213
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:20,006
- The green ears.
- Yeah.

214
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,042
Maybe they were
sticking out of his hat.

215
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:26,212
Maybe he painted that house.

216
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:34,153
I'm going to look up
old addressees.

217
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:43,695
Fuck you, man.

218
00:15:56,176 --> 00:15:59,678
Something's been bugging
me the last 10 years.

219
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:02,714
Not every day,
just now and then.

220
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:04,716
We went at it,

221
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:07,019
day you quit.

222
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:09,255
Were you holding back?

223
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:12,291
No, I don't see how I could've.

224
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:14,760
Oh, yeah, you do.

225
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:17,263
You-- you've
always had such

226
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:19,798
an inflated idea of yourself.

227
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,467
Meaning what?

228
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,303
Meaning it seems
pretty damn arrogant

229
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:27,974
to hold back
in a fight with me.

230
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:32,844
You think you could
have put me down?

231
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,813
Ah, I don't know.

232
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:36,815
Hell, I'd have had to kill you.

233
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,485
You were so goddamn mad.

234
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:45,257
Yeah, um... ahem.

235
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,793
You know, when she
told me, she said

236
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:51,330
not to blame you, that
it wasn't your choice.

237
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:53,865
You, uh, were drunk and...

238
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,335
she made it happen.

239
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:59,271
Everybody's got
a choice, Marty.

240
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:01,307
Shit, I sure blamed you.

241
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,309
Blamed me? For what?

242
00:17:03,343 --> 00:17:05,644
For pushing a good woman

243
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,647
to the point where
she had to use me,

244
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:11,650
use our partnership
to get rid of you.

245
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:14,920
For just being
a lying sack of shit.

246
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,725
You know, she couldn't have
used you, you didn't want some.

247
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,694
There you go.

248
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:24,863
Everybody's got a choice.

249
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:30,703
And yet, she still
cares about you.

250
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:33,706
You went to see her, I take it.

251
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,774
- She came out to the bar.
- What?

252
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:38,777
- When?
- Yeah, she was just checking on you,

253
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:41,647
wanted to make sure I wasn't
getting you in any trouble.

254
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:44,183
You should have
fuckin' told me.

255
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:47,153
Yeah, maybe. I guess.

256
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:50,656
I reckoned it was best
to just avoid her name.

257
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,159
Didn't want to invite judgments.
You never liked being judged.

258
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:56,495
No, you're right,
I don't. Not by you.

259
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,497
Well, I didn't say a word.

260
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:01,000
Well, I could read it
all over your face.

261
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,535
Well, then the problem's
with your face,

262
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,037
not mine.

263
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:11,109
It's hard to find
something in a man

264
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:14,313
who rejects people as much
as you do, you know that?

265
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:16,982
I never told you how
to live your life, Marty.

266
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:19,185
No, no, no, you just
sat in judgment.

267
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:21,153
Look, as sentient meat,

268
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:24,656
however illusory
our identities are,

269
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:28,160
we craft those identities
by making value judgments.

270
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:31,130
Everybody judges, all the time.

271
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:35,534
Now, you got a problem with
that, you're living wrong.

272
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:42,040
What's "scented meat"?

273
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:05,464
Can I help you?

274
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:08,634
Did you happen
to live here back in '95?

275
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:10,503
No, we didn't live
here back then.

276
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:12,404
- This is my grandma's place.
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:14,506
Grandma, she still with us?

278
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,075
- Alive, you mean?
- Yeah.

279
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,009
Yeah, she's in
an old folks' place.

280
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:19,978
Abbeville.

281
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:24,450
Mrs. Hill, now,

282
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:26,619
this is a very
strange question,

283
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:29,121
but, um, do you remember

284
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:32,558
back in the winter
of '94 or '95,

285
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:35,728
did you get your house painted?

286
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,598
I did. Yes, I did.

287
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:41,567
A nice green.

288
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:43,902
Don't remember what
they call it anymore.

289
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:45,904
Do you happen to remember

290
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:48,273
who it was that
painted your house?

291
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:50,008
Well, yes.

292
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:53,178
I don't remember the name,
but they were nice men.

293
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:55,181
They worked for our parish.

294
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:57,182
Yard work,
house-painting.

295
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:59,318
My church, they got a discount.

296
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:02,688
- Good work for fair pay back then.
- Mmm.

297
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:05,524
Do you remember, by any chance,

298
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:08,894
names or just any
other details?

299
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:11,363
Um...

300
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:15,367
I remember they charged $250

301
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:18,103
for the whole house exterior.

302
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:20,138
- Hmm.
- And one of the men--

303
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:22,274
the younger one-- he had

304
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,011
scarring all along
the bottom of his face.

305
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,946
Mm-hmm.

306
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:31,650
Miss Lilly, back then,
did you or your husband work?

307
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:34,953
My husband, Butch,
he's always worked.

308
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:37,823
He was offshore
for City Services.

309
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:39,791
Did he pay his taxes?

310
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:42,494
Always. Heh!
A lot of good it did him.

311
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:44,129
Thank you so much.

312
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:46,699
- You've been really helpful.
- Thank you.

313
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,168
There you go.

314
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:53,205
Husband took the write-off.
December '94.

315
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:56,141
$265 paid by Butch Hill

316
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:59,144
- to Childress and Son Maintenance.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

317
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:01,480
Yes, yes.
Here we go.

318
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:03,749
Business license first issued

319
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:06,284
to Billy Childress, 1978.

320
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,919
Same name as that--

321
00:21:07,954 --> 00:21:09,454
- Sheriff.
- Yeah.

322
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:11,423
Uh... OK.

323
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,925
Business license not renewed

324
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,362
since 2004.

325
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:19,598
OK.

326
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:23,101
Name comes up a lot
in public records.

327
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:26,605
Looks like they had
a lot of parish contracts.

328
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:29,341
Public, state property,
landscape, yeah.

329
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:31,777
That's what I want. I want
to know where he was.

330
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:34,280
OK.

331
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:39,384
All over the coast, OK?

332
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:41,420
It looks like
they did maintenance

333
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:44,122
for a lot of schools,

334
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:46,559
playgrounds,
cemeteries--

335
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:49,595
Run a background on Billy Childress.
Find his son.

336
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,463
OK.

337
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:53,265
Here we go.

338
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,969
William Lee Childress,
born to Lizbeth Childress,

339
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:59,838
1944, Erath.

340
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:01,807
No son showing.

341
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:04,343
Address-- DMV,
old license--

342
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:07,413
Highway 27 South.

343
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:25,431
Get out of here! Go on!

344
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:27,899
Oh! Oh!

345
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:31,069
Can you smell
the flowers, Miss Billie?

346
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:33,739
One to the feds,
one to State CID,

347
00:22:33,773 --> 00:22:36,842
one to State Attorney, one
to US Attorney.

348
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,744
Two to national papers,

349
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:41,647
two to local papers, two
to national channels.

350
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:44,149
It's the whole story,

351
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:46,118
near as we got it.

352
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:48,586
There's a copy
of the tape in each one,

353
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:51,623
the case files,
our depositions--

354
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:54,092
everything we got.

355
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:58,497
Now, 24 hours passes
and I don't stop you,

356
00:22:58,531 --> 00:23:01,133
mail 'em all out.

357
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:05,737
Then lay low a while.

358
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,711
Ah.

359
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:16,715
So how's that case
going, uh, Lake Charles?

360
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,717
None of your fucking business.

361
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:21,219
Your old partner
give you anything yet?

362
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:23,722
None of your fucking business.

363
00:23:23,756 --> 00:23:27,358
Why'd you call me?
Why not my partner?

364
00:23:28,728 --> 00:23:31,029
You, I can read.
Him, I can't.

365
00:23:31,064 --> 00:23:33,065
And why would you
need to do that?

366
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,233
What have you two been doing?

367
00:23:35,268 --> 00:23:39,170
All those late nights. Your
offices the last month.

368
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:42,874
Christ, and that's it?
That's all you got?

369
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:45,176
Ain't for you to know,

370
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:48,379
but I know you been pulling case
files all over south Louisiana.

371
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:51,416
It's about
Cohle's theory, way back?

372
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,886
He's fucking with you.

373
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,421
He's a manipulator, sociopath.

374
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:58,590
You know this.

375
00:24:00,593 --> 00:24:03,561
Do you know about Sam Tuttle,

376
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:06,098
all the branches of the family?

377
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:08,567
The, uh, marsh cult,

378
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:12,104
devil worship,
child sacrifices?

379
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:14,573
You sound like Cohle.

380
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,042
It points in every
direction but him, huh?

381
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:19,578
- Man, I knew you were gonna say that.
- You know something,

382
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:22,047
- you're obstructing.
- We don't know,

383
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:24,249
but we're following up an idea.

384
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:26,117
May be nothing,
but--

385
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:28,587
ahem-- time comes,

386
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:31,056
we-- we know
we got something,

387
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,925
you get a call, you gonna
do the right thing?

388
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,928
You speak in riddles
to me, white man.

389
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:39,430
You sound like Cohle, again.

390
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:41,433
We get something,
do you want the call

391
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:44,202
or you want it to go
to someone else?

392
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:47,706
Give it to me.

393
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:55,814
Just make sure
you come runnin'.

394
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:37,790
That taste.

395
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:43,662
What?

396
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,663
Aluminum,

397
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:47,666
ash.

398
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,602
I've tasted it before.

399
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:57,442
You still see things, ever?

400
00:25:57,476 --> 00:25:59,911
It never stops, not really.

401
00:25:59,946 --> 00:26:04,616
What happened to my head, it's
not something that gets better.

402
00:26:09,022 --> 00:26:11,957
Uh, this is it.

403
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:56,167
Call Papania.

404
00:26:56,202 --> 00:26:59,170
Shit.
Can't get a signal.

405
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:02,273
I'm gonna ask to use the phone.

406
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:06,778
You know what?
I'll go ask.

407
00:27:09,182 --> 00:27:10,782
Marty.

408
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:15,287
This is the place.

409
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,150
Hello.

410
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:49,120
Aw, damn it!

411
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:51,089
Oh, pardon me, ma'am.

412
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:53,558
Uh, we're
professional surveyors

413
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:56,795
and got lost on these back roads
like a couple of greenhorns.

414
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:59,931
Uh, cell phone is
getting no service.

415
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:02,467
Is there any way
that I could, uh,

416
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:04,636
use your phone?

417
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:07,172
- We don't have no phone, Mister.
- Oh.

418
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,540
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

419
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:10,609
No, I said!

420
00:28:10,643 --> 00:28:13,011
Stop it over there
or I kick you!

421
00:28:13,045 --> 00:28:15,480
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

422
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:21,452
The water around
here is not real good.

423
00:28:21,487 --> 00:28:24,822
Sit, I said! Stop it!
I'm gonna kick you!

424
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:27,492
Where's Billy Childress?

425
00:28:27,526 --> 00:28:29,661
- Old Bill?
- Yeah.

426
00:28:29,695 --> 00:28:31,797
He's in this house, Mister.

427
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:35,967
Oh, th-this isn't his?

428
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:41,039
Well, who-- who do you,
uh, who do you live here with?

429
00:28:41,074 --> 00:28:43,508
I think you should go now.

430
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:47,179
Mm-hmm, uh, hey,
where is he?

431
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:50,015
All around us,

432
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:52,851
before you were born...

433
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:56,421
and after you die.

434
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:58,857
No! No!

435
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:01,326
Get out of my house, Mister!

436
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,970
Marty, clear the house!

437
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:47,639
Don't move!

438
00:29:47,673 --> 00:29:49,641
On your knees, now!

439
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:52,277
On your knees! Now!

440
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:54,846
No.

441
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,848
Fuck.

442
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,454
Ohh.

443
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,640
Everybody has a phone.

444
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:31,810
Where's yours?

445
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:36,014
He's gonna come for you.

446
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:38,850
He's worse than anybody.

447
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:41,153
No, you--

448
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:44,055
- Where's your fuckin' phone?!
- No!

449
00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:54,732
Come with me, little man.

450
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:57,868
Come in here with me.

451
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:45,216
Rust?

452
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:47,185
Yeah!

453
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,855
- Rust!
- Here!

454
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:21,319
Come on inside, little priest.

455
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:35,327
To your right, little priest.

456
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:40,465
Take the bride's path.

457
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:48,005
This is Carcosa.

458
00:34:51,777 --> 00:34:55,346
You know what they did to me?

459
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:57,348
Hmm?

460
00:34:57,383 --> 00:34:59,684
What I will do to all

461
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:03,288
the sons and daughters of man.

462
00:35:03,322 --> 00:35:06,291
You blessed Reggie...

463
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:08,426
Dewall.

464
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:11,762
Acolytes.

465
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:16,200
Witnesses to my journey.

466
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:24,075
Lovers.

467
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:26,677
I am not ashamed.

468
00:35:30,082 --> 00:35:34,218
Come die with me,
little priest.

469
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:13,157
Rust?

470
00:36:22,668 --> 00:36:24,769
Rust!

471
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:07,137
Now, take off your mask.

472
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:39,430
Rust.

473
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:02,754
Aah!

474
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:05,222
Oh, fuck.

475
00:40:05,257 --> 00:40:08,259
Ah, he cut me
pretty good, Marty.

476
00:40:08,294 --> 00:40:10,761
No, Rust.

477
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:13,397
It ain't bad.

478
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,001
It ain't bad.

479
00:40:31,149 --> 00:40:32,750
Oh.

480
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:40,091
- Get me a forward team in the house.
- Yes, sir.

481
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,092
- Get me a second team on that back house.
- Going around back.

482
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:44,762
Deputy, light up those woods.

483
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:01,645
Here!

484
00:41:03,682 --> 00:41:06,784
Here! We're here!

485
00:41:08,186 --> 00:41:09,954
Hey!

486
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:20,798
That's the last thing
I remember.

487
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:23,334
I was on the ground.

488
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:25,803
Sirens.

489
00:41:25,837 --> 00:41:28,839
Saying my friend's name.

490
00:41:31,943 --> 00:41:34,411
The girl's a nut.

491
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:36,413
She talked some, but...

492
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:39,584
This group of guys,
pedophiles in Sulphur.

493
00:41:39,618 --> 00:41:41,552
Voodoo worship.

494
00:41:41,587 --> 00:41:44,088
Man Cohle shot dead was
the old man's son.

495
00:41:44,122 --> 00:41:45,556
No records.

496
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,558
Girl was at least
a half-sister.

497
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:49,626
- DNA comparison--
- Stop.

498
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:53,598
Really, man. Stop.
I don't want to hear it.

499
00:41:53,632 --> 00:41:57,134
Well, we're still
cataloguing everything,

500
00:41:57,168 --> 00:42:00,070
but knife casts came
back from that shed.

501
00:42:00,105 --> 00:42:02,607
One of them matched our
Lake Charles case,

502
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:05,142
another matched
Dora Lange's wounds.

503
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:07,144
Had his prints.

504
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:08,613
Hmm.

505
00:42:08,647 --> 00:42:11,516
Look, man, we owe
you on this collar.

506
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,185
How's Rust?

507
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:20,257
Hasn't woke up.

508
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:22,793
Been in a coma since surgery.

509
00:42:24,997 --> 00:42:27,965
They came by,
you first got here.

510
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,601
Thank you, Ted. No.

511
00:42:33,104 --> 00:42:34,571
Ma'am.

512
00:42:34,606 --> 00:42:36,206
Hi.

513
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:43,413
It's so good to see y'all.

514
00:42:43,448 --> 00:42:46,283
I... I didn't expect you.

515
00:42:55,193 --> 00:42:57,528
How are you?

516
00:42:59,431 --> 00:43:02,399
Oh, good.

517
00:43:03,802 --> 00:43:05,503
I'm fine.

518
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:12,376
Yeah, I-- I'll be fine.

519
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,881
I mean... I-- I am...

520
00:43:16,915 --> 00:43:19,016
fine.

521
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,367
And now the latest news update

522
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:39,870
in the case of alleged
Louisiana serial murderer

523
00:43:39,905 --> 00:43:41,873
Errol William Childress.

524
00:43:41,907 --> 00:43:44,375
It's a story that first broke
nationwide two weeks ago,

525
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:46,376
when two former
police officers,

526
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:48,545
now private detectives,
released information

527
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,548
to a number of news
and law enforcement agencies.

528
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:53,784
Our last update confirmed
physical evidence

529
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:56,220
at the suspect's home
proved connections

530
00:43:56,254 --> 00:43:58,755
to dozens of missing persons.

531
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,758
In the meantime, the State
Attorney General and the FBI

532
00:44:01,793 --> 00:44:04,594
have discredited rumors
that the accused was in some way

533
00:44:04,629 --> 00:44:08,633
related to the family of
Louisiana Senator Edwin Tuttle.

534
00:44:59,685 --> 00:45:02,152
What are you doing here?

535
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:05,656
Nothin'. Nurse said
I could come in.

536
00:45:05,691 --> 00:45:07,657
Are you watching me sleep?

537
00:45:07,692 --> 00:45:09,459
Well, you know what?
I just got here.

538
00:45:09,494 --> 00:45:11,261
I was gonna leave,
but then you woke up.

539
00:45:11,296 --> 00:45:13,030
Jesus, what's your
fuckin' problem?

540
00:45:13,064 --> 00:45:14,966
Nothing.
What's your problem?

541
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,969
Not a care in the world.

542
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:21,605
I saw him, Marty.

543
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:24,942
He was mowing that schoolyard

544
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:28,012
on Pelican Island in '95.

545
00:45:29,381 --> 00:45:31,848
I couldn't tell how tall he was

546
00:45:31,883 --> 00:45:35,352
'cause he was sittin'
and his face was--

547
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:39,723
it was dirty,
but I... I saw him.

548
00:45:42,594 --> 00:45:45,562
That's what's bugging you?

549
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:48,732
Tuttles, fucking men
in the video.

550
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:53,971
We didn't get 'em all.

551
00:45:54,006 --> 00:45:55,939
Yeah, and we ain't
gonna get 'em all.

552
00:45:55,973 --> 00:45:58,742
That ain't what kind of world
it is, but we got ours.

553
00:46:01,712 --> 00:46:04,348
I'm not supposed to be here.

554
00:46:05,717 --> 00:46:08,218
Yeah.

555
00:46:08,253 --> 00:46:10,187
Well...

556
00:46:10,222 --> 00:46:12,723
I'll come back by
tomorrow, buddy.

557
00:46:12,757 --> 00:46:14,692
Why?

558
00:46:14,726 --> 00:46:17,194
Don't ever change, man.

559
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:49,520
Ahem.
Doc said, uh,

560
00:47:49,554 --> 00:47:52,022
probably get out in a few days.

561
00:47:52,057 --> 00:47:55,526
I'll make sure you got
a ride, place to stay.

562
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,028
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

563
00:47:58,063 --> 00:48:00,564
Well, it's already
been figured out.

564
00:48:00,598 --> 00:48:02,533
Oh, hey.

565
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:04,568
I brought you something.

566
00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:10,541
Are we getting engaged?

567
00:48:10,575 --> 00:48:14,211
If we were getting engaged,
I'd have got a nicer ribbon.

568
00:48:19,584 --> 00:48:21,585
You remembered.

569
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:23,554
Yeah.

570
00:48:23,588 --> 00:48:25,989
Ah, let's get out from
under this roof, huh?

571
00:48:26,023 --> 00:48:28,125
Good idea.

572
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,928
Hey, I can push two
goddamn wheels on my own.

573
00:48:31,963 --> 00:48:36,133
Yeah, I ought to let you and rip out
your fuckin' stitches. Stop it.

574
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:41,672
Feeling better?
Your head, I mean.

575
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:48,512
Ah, I shouldn't even
fuckin' be here, Marty.

576
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:51,615
I believe "no shit" is
the proper response

577
00:48:51,649 --> 00:48:53,684
to that observation.

578
00:48:53,718 --> 00:48:56,320
Nah, I don't mean like that.

579
00:48:56,354 --> 00:48:58,888
It's something else.

580
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:03,093
Well, so...
talk to me, Rust.

581
00:49:10,502 --> 00:49:12,936
There was a moment--

582
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,472
I know when I was
under in the dark

583
00:49:15,506 --> 00:49:17,942
that something...

584
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:20,110
whatever I'd been reduced to,

585
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:22,179
you know, not even
consciousness.

586
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:26,149
It was a vague awareness
in the dark,

587
00:49:26,183 --> 00:49:29,119
and I could--

588
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:32,656
I could feel my definitions

589
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,158
fading.

590
00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:38,729
And beneath that...
darkness, there was another kind.

591
00:49:38,763 --> 00:49:41,698
It was-- it was deeper,

592
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:45,869
warm, you know,
like a substance.

593
00:49:47,272 --> 00:49:50,206
I could feel, man,

594
00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:54,245
and I knew, I knew my daughter

595
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:56,647
waited for me there.

596
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,649
So clear.

597
00:49:58,683 --> 00:50:01,785
I could feel her.

598
00:50:03,154 --> 00:50:05,622
I could feel...

599
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:10,294
I could feel a piece
of my-- my pop, too.

600
00:50:12,163 --> 00:50:14,631
It was like I was
a part of everything

601
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:18,635
that I ever loved,
and we were all...

602
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:23,307
the 3 of us, just--
just fadin' out.

603
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:30,680
And all I had to do
was let go...

604
00:50:30,715 --> 00:50:33,317
and I did.

605
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:38,322
I said, "Darkness,
yeah, yeah."

606
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,326
And I disappeared.

607
00:50:43,695 --> 00:50:47,698
But I could--
I could still feel

608
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:50,467
her love there,

609
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:53,603
even more than before.

610
00:50:55,373 --> 00:50:57,474
Nothing...

611
00:51:00,845 --> 00:51:03,847
There was nothing
but that love.

612
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:19,296
Then I woke up.

613
00:51:24,202 --> 00:51:26,803
Hey, uh...

614
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:34,144
Didn't, uh...

615
00:51:34,179 --> 00:51:37,648
didn't you tell me
one time at dinner

616
00:51:37,682 --> 00:51:41,618
once, maybe,
about you used to...

617
00:51:41,652 --> 00:51:45,356
you used to make up
stories about the stars?

618
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:49,226
Yeah, that was--

619
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,728
that was, um,

620
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:54,164
in A-Alaska,

621
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:56,366
under the-- under
the night skies.

622
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:59,903
Yeah, you used to lay
there and look up,

623
00:51:59,937 --> 00:52:02,539
yeah, at the stars?

624
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:05,876
Yeah, and you remember I...

625
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,378
I never watched
a TV till I was 17,

626
00:52:08,413 --> 00:52:10,880
so there wasn't much
to fuckin' do out there

627
00:52:10,915 --> 00:52:13,417
besides walk around
and explore and--

628
00:52:13,451 --> 00:52:15,386
And...

629
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,423
and look up at the stars
and make up stories.

630
00:52:19,457 --> 00:52:21,558
Like what?

631
00:52:23,093 --> 00:52:27,097
I tell you, Marty,
I've been up in that room

632
00:52:27,132 --> 00:52:31,268
looking out those windows every
night here and just thinking...

633
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:39,276
It's just one story.

634
00:52:40,678 --> 00:52:42,779
The oldest.

635
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,283
What's that?

636
00:52:49,186 --> 00:52:52,489
Light versus dark.

637
00:52:55,393 --> 00:52:57,327
Well,

638
00:52:57,362 --> 00:53:01,298
I know we ain't
in Alaska, but...

639
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:06,070
appears to me that the dark
has a lot more territory.

640
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:11,908
Yeah.

641
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:15,145
You're right about that.

642
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,518
Hey, listen, hey.

643
00:53:21,553 --> 00:53:22,952
Yeah, what?

644
00:53:22,987 --> 00:53:25,955
Why don't you point me in the
direction of the car, man?

645
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,993
I've spent enough of my
fuckin' life in hospitals.

646
00:53:30,027 --> 00:53:33,530
Jesus. Oh.
You know what?

647
00:53:33,565 --> 00:53:35,499
I'd protest,

648
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:39,002
but it occurs to me
that you're unkillable.

649
00:53:39,036 --> 00:53:41,471
You want to go back,
get clothes or anything?

650
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:45,676
No, anything I left back
there, I don't need.

651
00:53:50,515 --> 00:53:55,552
You know, you're looking at it wrong,
the... sky thing.

652
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:59,022
How is that?

653
00:53:59,056 --> 00:54:02,626
Well, once,
there was only dark.

654
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:08,031
If you ask me,
the light's winning.
