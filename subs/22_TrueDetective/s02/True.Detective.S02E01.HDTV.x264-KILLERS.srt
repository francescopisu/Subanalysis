You all right, bud?

39
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:21,496
Yeah, I'm okay.

40
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,833
Worried about the other kids?

41
00:02:24,884 --> 00:02:27,302
How much longer do I
have to go to school?

42
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:31,173
A while longer, sorry to say.

43
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:37,229
You got that camping trip
coming up next weekend, huh?

44
00:02:37,263 --> 00:02:38,813
That'll be fun, right?

45
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:44,936
Hey, you like your new kicks?

46
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:52,627
All right.
Go on, pal.

47
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:55,530
Mom or Richard
will pick you up.

48
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:57,532
I'll see you
in two weeks, yeah?

49
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:01,703
Head up.

50
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:03,588
Strong.

51
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:13,598
Hey, I love you, buddy.

52
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:15,383
Now be proud.

53
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:30,115
Hey, Chad.
Nice sweater.

54
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:31,866
I really like it.

55
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,452
Oh, and I like your shoes, too.
They match your hair.

56
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,906
It's great.

57
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:46,248
<i>It wasn't an incident.</i>

58
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,917
She was--
she was beaten.

59
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:50,585
Raped.

60
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,805
I'm sorry, I need to ask.

61
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:57,058
Your wife,
was she pregnant at the time?

62
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:00,762
We think so.

63
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:03,565
<i>You were trying</i>
<i>a long time, right?</i>

64
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,934
Mmm.

65
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:10,488
<i>Your son was born nine
months after what happened?</i>

66
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:16,695
<i>And they never caught the
man who did it, correct?</i>

67
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,953
No.

68
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:27,022
They never caught the guy.

69
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,460
And how is the relationship
with your son?

70
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:34,879
It's good.
It's real good.

71
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,766
I mean, he's a--
he's a true-blue kid.

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,018
You know?
I have--

73
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:44,022
I bought us-- I got us
these digital recorders.

74
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:47,142
You see? So we can send
each other letters, like,

75
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:48,810
and express stuff, talk.

76
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:51,529
Book said that can
be effective, so...

77
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:53,648
<i>So why do you feel</i>
<i>your visitation rights</i>

78
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,817
<i>should be expanded,</i>
<i>Detective Velcoro?</i>

79
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:58,320
Well, how about
I raised him alone

80
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,822
for two months
when she took off?

81
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:03,992
You know?
It was me and him.

82
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:07,829
She comes back,
she's talking divorce.

83
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,881
<i>Did either of you</i>
<i>request a paternity test?</i>

84
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:12,033
No.

85
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:14,135
My son is my son.

86
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,388
They're gonna ask
that question.

87
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:18,023
<i>More rudely than I just did.</i>

88
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,842
Look, you're not getting--

89
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:23,928
there's me and him
and I'm his dad.

90
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:27,599
And I just need you to come
up with something, all right?

91
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,484
<i>You might have the wrong idea.</i>

92
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:31,686
Why? You like
paying taxes?

93
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,689
Just...

94
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:37,759
<i>You were with</i>
<i>LA Sheriff's Department</i>

95
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,894
<i>eight years before Vinci PD.</i>

96
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:42,364
<i>Anything there gonna hurt you?</i>

97
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:43,932
No.

98
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:45,867
I welcome judgment.

99
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:21,069
Deputy Velcoro, right?

100
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,825
This filth hurt your woman.

101
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:31,079
We know this guy.

102
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:33,548
Tell me.

103
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:38,086
Sometimes everybody's
not always on the same side.

104
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:41,423
Fine, it's business.

105
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:47,011
But this... no.

106
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:48,930
Fuck that.

107
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:51,566
Some things don't stand.

108
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,701
What do you know about it?

109
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,967
<i>Fits the description, right?</i>

110
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:29,137
My people know him.
He's not with us.

111
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:30,638
Amphetamine freak.

112
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,475
Bragged about it, said, well,

113
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:36,110
matched your wife's account.

114
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:37,529
How do you know
my wife's account?

115
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:39,147
This is only information, man.

116
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,432
Shit in the air.

117
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:43,485
I'm sharing with you.

118
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:48,706
I wanted to do this.

119
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:52,260
And now it's done.

120
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:54,412
That's it.

121
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:56,881
What do you want from me?

122
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,166
Me?

123
00:07:58,168 --> 00:07:59,834
Yeah.

124
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:01,803
Not a thing.

125
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:04,806
Maybe we'll talk sometime.

126
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:07,725
Maybe not.

127
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:13,982
Your wife, she doing better?

128
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:10,905
Did you go to sleep?

129
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:13,241
No. Big day.

130
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:14,909
All the marbles.

131
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:34,979
Suits you better
than you think.

132
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,900
Behold what was once a man.

133
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:42,186
You think I should have
sprung for the country club?

134
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:43,488
Don't put on airs.

135
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:46,407
You don't need
to fake anything.

136
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,276
You're better than that.

137
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,860
<i>Caspere pitches at developers.</i>

138
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:25,113
Russians in for five.

139
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:28,716
Somebody taking Osip
through customs?

140
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:31,469
United Ambassadors are
meeting him at the ramp.

141
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,071
Maybe I should have
gone to the airport.

142
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:34,822
Don't want to look hungry.

143
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:37,291
Never do anything
out of hunger,

144
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:38,993
not even eating.

145
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:44,799
What?

146
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:50,838
The fuck?
An eight-part series?

147
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,725
<i>Talks city corruptions,
sweatshops, nothing on us.</i>

148
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,810
Nothing, huh?

149
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:57,395
What's Osip gonna
tweak from this?

150
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,731
<i>That we're not buttoned
down at the least.</i>

151
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:03,434
Could put Tom or Ivar on the
reporter you want, but I think--

152
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:05,687
No, get Velcoro.

153
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,188
He won't get carried away.

154
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,074
If this story gets play, there
could be a state investigation.

155
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:11,826
But I'm saying
you're not touched.

156
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:18,332
This place is built on a
codependency of interest.

157
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:21,703
Worries me,
you talking so stupid.

158
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,011
Everybody gets touched.

159
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:40,948
<i>Hey, hey, I'm sorry.</i>

160
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,700
Look, don't let that ruin it.

161
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,285
Just-- it took me
by surprise was all.

162
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,369
You know?
I didn't expect that.

163
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,255
Forget it.
Don't worry about it.

164
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:49,173
Oh, come on, we don't
have to stop, right?

165
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,425
You know, it's just
I wasn't really ready.

166
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,878
I didn't think--
I mean, I don't know.

167
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:55,963
<i>Do you--</i>
<i>do you like that?</i>

168
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:57,965
Sometimes.

169
00:12:58,016 --> 00:13:00,935
Okay. I just didn't
think that most women--

170
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:03,221
you know, you, would--
I'm just used to--

171
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:06,224
you know, I mean--
have you done that a lot?

172
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:08,392
Let's not talk this to death.

173
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:14,532
Hey, I still got
some time before I report.

174
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:16,317
Yeah, I've got
to get ready for work.

175
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:18,786
Can we talk?
Please?

176
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:21,539
I mean, forget this,
what just happened.

177
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:23,791
You know, I think
this is good, right?

178
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:25,960
Depends on what's expected.

179
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:29,664
Well, I wanted--
I mean, I thought,

180
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,133
you know, maybe we could talk
about taking things forward.

181
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,502
Steve, you're a nice guy,
but right now is not the time

182
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:35,670
you want to have
this conversation.

183
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:37,889
Okay.
But if you--

184
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:41,309
Can you get your stuff?
'Cause I gotta get going.

185
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:44,729
Yeah.

186
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,000
Sheriff's Department!

187
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:09,503
- Yo, what's this?
- Hands! Hands! On your knees.

188
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:11,539
You running hookers?

189
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,376
<i>Right there!
Stay there!</i>

190
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:17,378
<i>Sheriff's Department!</i>

191
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:19,096
Hands up!
Get up! Get up!

192
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:20,882
- Clear!
- All right, everybody out.

193
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:22,800
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

194
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:25,269
<i>Right here, right here.
Let's go, move, move.</i>

195
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:31,108
<i>Clear in the back.</i>

196
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:35,196
- What is this?
- Webcams.

197
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,064
Private subscribers.
Totally legit.

198
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:38,566
We ain't broke no law of yours.

199
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:40,534
Got IDs for these girls?
Visas?

200
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:42,620
They American,
that what you mean?

201
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:44,238
Who here is an American?

202
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,290
Say "I am an American"
one by one.

203
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:47,742
I am an American.

204
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:49,076
I am an American.

205
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:51,746
- <i> I am an American.</i>
- <i> I am an American.</i>

206
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:54,081
- This is private property.
- Shut the fuck up.

207
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,000
Come on, now. Everybody out.
Let's go.

208
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,335
Let's go, on your feet.

209
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:58,719
Hey!

210
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:07,895
All right.

211
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,432
I ran this op
because I heard a rumor.

212
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,901
Unbelievable. Porn.

213
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:16,153
It's not porn, okay?

214
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:18,689
Not everybody has a problem with sex.
I'm a performer.

215
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,107
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

216
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:22,827
So this is like some kind
of Meryl Streep type

217
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:24,612
expressive creativity?

218
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:26,247
I-- are you off
your meds?

219
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:29,750
God, you're
fucking hilarious, man.

220
00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:31,786
You want people
to stop screwing

221
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:33,788
and start taking drugs, right?

222
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,957
- That is so typical. So typical you.
- That's not--

223
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,676
This isn't right.
It's not healthy.

224
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,696
Not healthy? Really? And what do
you know about being healthy?

225
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,848
When you walk,
it's like erasers clapping.

226
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:45,349
- Okay. Okay.
- This isn't your business.

227
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:49,303
So what is this? This is like
another "I hate my sister" cycle?

228
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:51,305
When does that stop?
You take another bust?

229
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:54,275
Bust doing what?
Masturbating?

230
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:59,230
I'm straight edge now, okay?
I'm totally clean.

231
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:01,115
Okay, then maybe you should
get back on something.

232
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:06,737
You know, what you say are my problems
are really your fucking problems.

233
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,719
Don't think we got anything.

234
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:24,071
They even have
the business license.

235
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,426
Yep.

236
00:16:56,455 --> 00:16:58,539
<i>That low background
rumble is the sound</i>

237
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,374
<i>of paper shredders</i>
<i>on the third floor.</i>

238
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:03,177
First part of a series,
it says.

239
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:06,047
<i>Talks about municipal salaries,</i>

240
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:07,381
<i>undocumented workers,</i>

241
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:09,950
pollution, policing practices.

242
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:11,886
He uses the word extortionary.

243
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:13,270
Are we expecting subpoenas?

244
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:15,189
You know Ben Caspere,
the city manager?

245
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:17,558
Gone missing. Second day he
hasn't shown up for work.

246
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,143
Lots of people looking for him.

247
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:21,278
- Fix on his phone?
- Shut off.

248
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:23,147
Mayor Chessani's on DEFCON.

249
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:25,232
His office has been
on the horn all morning.

250
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:26,984
Some big meeting today.

251
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:28,402
<i>Get with Teague Dixon on this.</i>

252
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:30,654
Caspere is officially
a missing person.

253
00:17:30,705 --> 00:17:32,790
Dixon?

254
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:34,575
Seriously,
Lieutenant, he's--

255
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,827
We're lucky just
to detail the two of you.

256
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:43,751
Uh, you know
where I should start?

257
00:17:43,753 --> 00:17:46,670
City manager's office,
I imagine.

258
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:49,256
All right.

259
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:25,376
License and registration,
please, ma'am.

260
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,679
Uh, yes. Yeah.

261
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:36,971
Um... I, um...

262
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:40,724
don't have my license
on me right now.

263
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:42,810
It's at my house.

264
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:45,396
It's just, like,
a mile away in Malibu.

265
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:47,982
I'm really close.

266
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,734
You had anything to drink
this morning, ma'am?

267
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:52,786
To drink?

268
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:54,321
No. No, sir.

269
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:56,207
Well, I absolutely
have not ha--

270
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,492
have not have had
anything to drink.

271
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:01,045
Would you step out of
the car for me, ma'am?

272
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,715
Sir,

273
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:07,551
please, if I get
in trouble again...

274
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:11,505
<i>Look, I pay my parents'</i>
<i>bills for them and...</i>

275
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:15,476
Um, look,

276
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,897
maybe you could
just escort me home

277
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:22,049
<i>and we could talk</i>

278
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,518
<i>or do something.</i>

279
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,771
A trade, like...

280
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:36,363
<i>Hell, I know, Paul.
We all know it's bullshit.</i>

281
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:40,201
<i>Soliciting a blowjob</i>
<i>to avoid a citation.</i>

282
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:41,569
<i>That ain't you, kid.</i>

283
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:44,255
But it's cut the tabloids
on that mercenary work.

284
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:47,174
This actress,
she violated her parole

285
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:50,544
by leaving the fucking house
to score, I guess.

286
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:54,014
Swerves into traffic
high, freaks,

287
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,382
I'm getting flushed.

288
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:56,717
- No.
- Yes.

289
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:59,887
Administrative leave with pay
just until IA finishes.

290
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:01,889
The Black Mountain work,

291
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,441
do you know how hard
they're looking?

292
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:14,201
You got a little
vacation, that's all.

293
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:15,786
Comes back around
about this girl,

294
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,821
and it will,
you'll be reinstated.

295
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:19,490
Back on the bike?

296
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,742
I like the bike, sir.

297
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:25,879
The highway, it suits me.

298
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:28,315
I am no good on the sidelines.

299
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:32,336
The other watch commanders

300
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:34,838
want me to convey
our full support.

301
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,434
Black Mountain.

302
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:51,589
We were working
for America, sir.

303
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:53,691
I know you were, son.

304
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:11,625
Woodrugh, tell me it's true.

305
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:36,283
Hey, Bart.
Enjoying it?

306
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:37,651
- Yes.
- All right.

307
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:39,903
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

308
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:51,081
Mayor.
You heard from Caspere?

309
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:53,884
Newspaper shit
couldn't wait, huh?

310
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:57,388
Federal contracts come through,

311
00:21:57,422 --> 00:21:59,840
they can write all the
stories they fucking want.

312
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:02,676
Newspaper's not
gonna be a problem.

313
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:05,679
Let's allow an afternoon
for celebration, gents.

314
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:09,433
See that? I tell people
it's her brains.

315
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:14,355
Maybe you'd like
something to eat?

316
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:16,106
Please.

317
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:19,910
- See you in a bit.
- Yeah.

318
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:29,086
Caspere hasn't been
to work in two days.

319
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,873
He hasn't? This is his
entire goddamn pitch.

320
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:36,460
Watch the mayor.
He's getting a load on.

321
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:38,879
You think I should have
sprung for the country club?

322
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,547
Nah.

323
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:42,599
What did you say
about looking hungry?

324
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:47,554
- Osip landed yet?
- Just touched down.

325
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:52,393
<i>- No family?</i>
<i>- Bachelor.</i>

326
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:55,028
<i>He didn't have any
trips on the books?</i>

327
00:22:55,063 --> 00:22:56,647
Not the type to just take off?

328
00:22:56,698 --> 00:23:00,000
No, sir. He wouldn't leave
without saying something.

329
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:01,785
He had been
going up to Monterey

330
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,320
and the Russian River
Valley a lot,

331
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,707
but he wouldn't be
out of touch like this.

332
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:08,909
He mention anything
about the newspaper?

333
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,911
You know, that journalist.

334
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:12,379
Nothing I've heard.

335
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:14,715
I've only been here
about six weeks, though.

336
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:16,717
I didn't know
a whole lot about him yet.

337
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:19,136
Bad blood?
Any enemies?

338
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:22,556
I don't think so.

339
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,259
I mean, not like enemies.

340
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,145
Mr. Caspere sort of holds the
purse strings for a lot of stuff.

341
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:29,930
A lot of people
have to go through him.

342
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,765
Okay.

343
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:34,768
<i>Can you give us</i>
<i>a list of his properties?</i>

344
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:38,238
I-- well, I guess
that's okay.

345
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:41,141
Sure, it is.
We're the police.

346
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:46,780
Big place for one guy.

347
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:11,221
Hey, you see that, too, right?

348
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:24,485
Now we got us
something-something.

349
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:43,003
<i>You ever meet this guy?</i>

350
00:24:43,037 --> 00:24:46,173
<i>Once or twice.
Some civic thing.</i>

351
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,595
I had no idea he was so...

352
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,780
<i>adventurous.</i>

353
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:09,363
You know, I got instructions.

354
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:12,866
Anything happens to me,
you burn all my shit quick.

355
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:20,374
Took the computer.

356
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,564
This is fucked.

357
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:46,567
We need a tech crew
in here for prints.

358
00:25:46,618 --> 00:25:49,453
Anything they can catch.
Catalog what's left behind.

359
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:50,904
We should let the bosses know.

360
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:53,490
You sure they
don't know already?

361
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:57,077
<i>We need to treat this</i>
<i>like a 207.</i>

362
00:25:57,128 --> 00:25:59,296
- What?
- Kidnapping.

363
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:03,133
Teague, we don't
belong on this.

364
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:09,723
Francis Semyon.
Look now at you.

365
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:16,096
This man in the '90s,
what a terror.

366
00:26:16,098 --> 00:26:18,398
The good life suits you.

367
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:22,769
Osip, have a champagne.

368
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:26,239
To friends and the future.

369
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:27,941
Hear, hear.

370
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:31,945
Frank, I don't think
you met Michael in Paris.

371
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:34,081
Michael Bugulari, my attorney.

372
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:36,950
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Semyon.

373
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:41,538
Osip, you should
meet some people.

374
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:43,957
Contractors, developers.

375
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:54,134
If he turns up, I'm gonna put my
size 13s so far up Caspere's ass...

376
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:57,688
He'll spit shoelaces?

377
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:36,677
They should make the fucking
banks deliver these things.

378
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,797
<i>This the best they
got for police to do?</i>

379
00:27:40,832 --> 00:27:42,899
<i>Take people's houses?</i>

380
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:45,168
They just make us
drop the paper, ma'am.

381
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:46,853
We are sorry.

382
00:27:49,857 --> 00:27:51,358
<i>You want to be police?</i>

383
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:53,360
Why don't y'all find my sister?

384
00:27:53,362 --> 00:27:56,747
Uh, who's that?
She missing?

385
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:02,869
My little sister Vera.

386
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:05,839
She's 24.

387
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:08,291
- How long she been missing?
- We're not sure.

388
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:10,260
I mean, about a month ago,

389
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:13,096
I hadn't heard from her
for a few weeks.

390
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:16,466
Started calling,
getting voice mail.

391
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:19,102
One day it's disconnected.

392
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:21,054
I go to her apartment.

393
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:24,608
Her old roommate says
she moved out a while back.

394
00:28:24,642 --> 00:28:27,310
Took all her stuff.
They didn't know where.

395
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:30,063
Does she have a job?

396
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:32,382
She worked as a maid
at a couple of places.

397
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:34,901
But they said she quit.

398
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:37,571
Well, could you come down,

399
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:39,539
file a report, and we
could get started on it?

400
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:42,409
We told city police.
Never heard anything.

401
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,545
<i>Last place she worked,</i>
<i>this, like,</i>

402
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,982
religious place, an institute.

403
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,636
Panticapaeum?

404
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,721
The Panticapaeum Institute?

405
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:57,724
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

406
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,093
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

407
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:09,603
Our city manager Ben Caspere
was going to be here

408
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:11,354
to explain this,

409
00:29:11,405 --> 00:29:14,991
but I suppose I can
approximate the information.

410
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:18,028
So everybody knows
Proposition 1 has passed.

411
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,697
And next year
construction will start

412
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:23,817
on a $68 billion
high-speed rail

413
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:25,535
up Central California.

414
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:28,121
An undeveloped valley
adjacent to the rail

415
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:30,173
<i>and the coastal highway</i>
<i>has been purchased</i>

416
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,509
by several holding companies

417
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:34,761
anticipating
a commercial development

418
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:38,298
<i>that will be in line</i>
<i>for hundreds of millions</i>

419
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,933
in federal grants.

420
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:43,103
And the feds

421
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:45,438
have guaranteed cost overages.

422
00:30:15,553 --> 00:30:19,506
<i>I was told something
a long time ago.</i>

423
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:21,842
<i>Let me share it with you.</i>

424
00:30:21,844 --> 00:30:26,229
When you see
only with God's eyes,

425
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:29,449
you see only the truth.

426
00:30:29,483 --> 00:30:33,320
<i>And you recognize</i>
<i>a meaningless universe.</i>

427
00:30:35,072 --> 00:30:38,859
Ginsberg said this to me once.

428
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:40,760
And it was a gift.

429
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:43,029
<i>So today's exercise</i>

430
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:46,366
<i>is to recognize the world</i>
<i>as meaningless</i>

431
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:50,403
and to understand
that God did not create

432
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,289
a meaningless world.

433
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,993
<i>Hold both thoughts</i>
<i>as irrefutable and equal,</i>

434
00:30:57,028 --> 00:31:00,714
because this is
how we must live now

435
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:03,300
in the final age of man.

436
00:31:13,945 --> 00:31:17,214
She gave her notice
maybe two months back.

437
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,565
Any forwarding address?

438
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:22,235
No, she said she got a new
job, less hours, more money.

439
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:25,622
Told me she was working,
like, some club circuit.

440
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:28,658
<i>She mentioned Sonoma, I think.</i>

441
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,677
All right if we talk
to the rest of your staff?

442
00:31:30,711 --> 00:31:33,129
Of course.

443
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,412
_

444
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:34,641
Shh.

445
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:53,543
I may have seen her.

446
00:32:53,577 --> 00:32:58,048
Just on the grounds, but, no.

447
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:00,467
No, not speak to her.

448
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:02,502
I wouldn't know her name.

449
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:06,256
I still have an office, but...

450
00:33:06,307 --> 00:33:10,010
I don't spend as much
time here as I used to.

451
00:33:10,012 --> 00:33:12,645
Just a few lectures a year.

452
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:17,817
I've wondered how you are.

453
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:20,570
You talk to Athena?

454
00:33:20,604 --> 00:33:22,672
A few days ago, actually.

455
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:24,691
She seems good.

456
00:33:25,576 --> 00:33:27,827
Clear eye, has a job.

457
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:30,363
You talk to her that much?

458
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:32,082
Do you know what her job is?

459
00:33:32,116 --> 00:33:33,366
Something on the Internet.

460
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:36,086
Web camera performances,
she said.

461
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,005
Athena, goddess of love.

462
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,792
I won't go near computers,
you understand.

463
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:45,345
She's doing porn.

464
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:48,715
Well, what exactly is porn?

465
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:51,684
I remember, you see,
when the status quo,

466
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,887
they labeled anything they
didn't like pornography.

467
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:55,472
Avant-garde cinema, then,

468
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:58,525
featuring live sex acts
for paying customers.

469
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,361
She has a different outlook.

470
00:34:01,395 --> 00:34:02,862
Athena said it was theater.

471
00:34:02,897 --> 00:34:04,280
God damn.

472
00:34:04,315 --> 00:34:07,200
You don't have any feeling,
your daughter doing that?

473
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:09,736
Well, what would you
have me do, Antigone?

474
00:34:09,738 --> 00:34:12,705
Since I've never been good
at guessing your needs.

475
00:34:14,158 --> 00:34:17,794
Maybe talk her into doing
something with her life.

476
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:21,581
Maybe convey some guidance,

477
00:34:21,632 --> 00:34:24,134
some values she could carry.

478
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,419
We have always disagreed here.

479
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:29,005
I am not comfortable
imposing my will on anyone

480
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:31,257
and I haven't been since 1978.

481
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:33,676
Not even to stop them
walking into a river.

482
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:35,261
Yes, not even then.

483
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:36,996
And if your mother's
flair for drama

484
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,481
had been more present
in her acting,

485
00:34:38,516 --> 00:34:41,684
she might have gone on
to great things.

486
00:34:52,863 --> 00:34:55,732
These totems,

487
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:58,952
they watch over
departed spirits.

488
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:03,173
I've always felt
your mother among them.

489
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,874
You won't even own it a little.

490
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:07,377
She abandoned
the two of you, I didn't.

491
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,298
You should spend less time
in a state of resistance

492
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,635
making up problems
for yourself.

493
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:17,303
What does that mean?

494
00:35:18,472 --> 00:35:21,724
A failed marriage,
a few relationships,

495
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:24,144
you're angry
at the entire world

496
00:35:24,146 --> 00:35:25,812
and men in particular

497
00:35:25,863 --> 00:35:28,281
out of a false sense
of entitlement

498
00:35:28,315 --> 00:35:29,949
for something
you never received.

499
00:35:29,984 --> 00:35:32,952
Your entire personality

500
00:35:32,987 --> 00:35:35,622
is an extended criticism
of my values.

501
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:37,490
Meant, I'm sure,

502
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:40,160
to compel me into engagement
through argument.

503
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,831
Do you even like what you do?

504
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:48,668
Or is it just a reflexive urge
toward authority out of defiance?

505
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:50,837
Talk to your daughter, prick.

506
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,722
Help her.

507
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,228
I just did.

508
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:07,320
- Hey, bud.
- Dad?

509
00:36:07,354 --> 00:36:09,155
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, Ray.</i>

510
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,607
You're not till next Friday.

511
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:13,076
Hey, buddy, I knew you had
a camping trip coming up

512
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,029
and I just wanted to--
here, it's a Coleman.

513
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,614
It's, like, top line.

514
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:19,499
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

515
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:20,917
<i>Camping trip was last weekend.</i>

516
00:36:20,951 --> 00:36:23,536
He ended up having
a stomachache.

517
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:27,340
Wait a minute.
Where's your shoes?

518
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:30,710
- What? - He's wearing shoes.
Ray, you been drinking?

519
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:33,546
Not those, the Nikes.

520
00:36:33,597 --> 00:36:36,182
The fucking LeBrons
or whatever.

521
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:38,134
The tennis shoes
he begged--

522
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:40,136
You know what
I'm talking about.

523
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:41,688
I just didn't wear them.

524
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:44,557
You realize I tell when people
are lying for a living?

525
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,443
All right, Ray.
Let's talk about this later.

526
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:49,946
Is that--
is that blood on your sleeve?

527
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,564
What happened to your shoes?

528
00:36:51,566 --> 00:36:54,117
It was a little thing
that happened last week.

529
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:56,202
Boys.

530
00:36:56,237 --> 00:36:57,787
What happened?

531
00:36:59,406 --> 00:37:02,492
What happened to your shoes?

532
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:05,295
Ray, God damn it. They took his
shoes out of his gym locker.

533
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:06,913
And what?
What, shit on them?

534
00:37:06,964 --> 00:37:08,248
They cut 'em up.
That's it.

535
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:09,916
Christ, man, come on.
This isn't good for him.

536
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:11,668
- Who was it, boy?
- Ray, stop it.

537
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:14,304
- Let's talk later somewhere else.
- Jesus, God, you fat pussy.

538
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:15,755
You're gonna give me
a kid's name right now

539
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:17,307
or I'll pull down your pants
and I'll spank you

540
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:18,808
in front of the fucking
cheerleading squad.

541
00:37:18,842 --> 00:37:22,428
Don't look at him!
You look at me!

542
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:24,681
You tell me the name
of that kid, Chad.

543
00:37:25,683 --> 00:37:27,433
I'm gonna count to three.

544
00:37:27,484 --> 00:37:29,602
One, two--

545
00:37:29,653 --> 00:37:31,688
Aspen.
Aspen Conroy.

546
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:34,607
Aspen?
That's a boy's name?

547
00:37:36,694 --> 00:37:39,379
- Chad.
- God damn it, Ray.

548
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:41,331
What the hell
is the matter with you?

549
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:43,533
Asshole.

550
00:37:48,422 --> 00:37:52,775
We just had a-- a thing,

551
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,178
me and you.

552
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:58,798
Totally, totally my fault.

553
00:38:00,517 --> 00:38:04,470
Childhood is so scary.

554
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:09,559
I used--

555
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:12,895
I used to want
to be an astronaut.

556
00:38:18,986 --> 00:38:22,038
But astronauts don't even
go to the moon anymore.

557
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:25,158
<i>Detective Velcoro?</i>

558
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:34,417
Yeah.

559
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:36,736
<i>Yeah, got that Conroy
address you wanted.</i>

560
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,871
<i>Place in Sherman Oaks.</i>

561
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:42,975
Go.

562
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,928
<i>Last name Conroy,</i>
<i>first name Wit.</i>

563
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:47,397
<i>982...</i>

564
00:39:07,418 --> 00:39:09,786
And your pop,
he's a piece of work, huh?

565
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,372
Don't talk about
my family, Elvis.

566
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:52,412
<i>Come on back, baby.</i>

567
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:54,664
<i>I've got something for you.</i>

568
00:40:06,677 --> 00:40:09,595
It's been a week,
Mr. Policeman.

569
00:40:10,848 --> 00:40:13,015
Get that dick over here.

570
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:17,603
Hold that thought.
I'm pretty rank.

571
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:20,022
Let me jump in the shower.
I'm gonna get clean for you.

572
00:40:20,073 --> 00:40:21,741
I like it when you stink.
I don't mind.

573
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:25,161
Five minutes
and I'll be right out.

574
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:26,696
Can I soap you up?

575
00:40:26,747 --> 00:40:28,498
No, I like you the way you are.

576
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,834
One hot shower,
I'm ready to go.

577
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:38,040
I'm timing you,
Officer Woodrugh.

578
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,981
Jeez, that was like 30 minutes.

579
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:36,983
I thought you had drowned.

580
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:38,684
What took you so--

581
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:40,903
It's been a long day.

582
00:41:40,938 --> 00:41:43,523
I had to work some kinks out.

583
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:46,776
Well, I've got a place

584
00:41:46,827 --> 00:41:49,745
right here where you can
work that kink out.

585
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:08,231
Osip, we talked
this through in Paris.

586
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:10,299
Caspere's absence
don't mean a thing.

587
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,051
It is happening, though.

588
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:14,720
Vinci tapped fed money
from the subway line,

589
00:42:14,722 --> 00:42:16,472
and the same thing will happen

590
00:42:16,523 --> 00:42:19,308
on a much, much bigger scale
with the rail corridor.

591
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,227
Owned by our holding companies.

592
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,895
Set up through Catalast.

593
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:28,568
This goes beyond us.
A legitimate legacy.

594
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,738
Chance for the grandkids to be part of
one of those old California families.

595
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:34,874
Don't even remember where
the money comes from.

596
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,794
Let's talk more at dinner.

597
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:42,748
Give us a minute, friends.

598
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:03,519
I thought we already
had an agreement, Osip?

599
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:08,024
Frank, you know you have
my complete confidence,

600
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:11,410
but our organization
has very old rules.

601
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:13,112
Checks and balances.

602
00:43:13,163 --> 00:43:15,748
I have to perform
my due diligence.

603
00:43:15,782 --> 00:43:18,668
Sure. Sure.

604
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:21,721
But, Osip,
it's a buy-in.

605
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:23,623
I thought you
were here to close.

606
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:27,159
I will close
when I'm ready to close.

607
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:28,794
Do not rush me, Frank.

608
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:37,970
Sure.

609
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:39,605
Yeah, of course.

610
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:43,392
You guys should relax.

611
00:43:43,443 --> 00:43:45,361
Get some rest before dinner.

612
00:43:45,395 --> 00:43:47,313
I look forward
to meeting Caspere.

613
00:44:11,254 --> 00:44:14,006
Fuckin' Caspere.

614
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:19,979
What could you have
to talk to my son about?

615
00:44:20,013 --> 00:44:21,847
Relax, it's nothing.

616
00:44:21,898 --> 00:44:24,734
Maybe I just want to ask him
about some stolen property.

617
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:27,987
Look, bud, you want
to call him out

618
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:30,573
and maybe we can take care of
this, you know, right here?

619
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:33,859
You don't even have
to tell the missus.

620
00:44:35,612 --> 00:44:37,947
- Yeah, hold on. Um...
- Great.

621
00:44:39,683 --> 00:44:42,201
<i>Hey, son? It'll just
be a second, honey.</i>

622
00:44:48,675 --> 00:44:51,093
<i>This man's with the police.</i>

623
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:53,763
He says he has something to ask you.

624
00:44:53,797 --> 00:44:56,882
You like to bully kids,
Ass-pen.

625
00:44:56,933 --> 00:44:58,384
Hold on, what is this?

626
00:44:58,386 --> 00:45:00,803
You're 12 years old
and you're already evil as fuck.

627
00:45:00,854 --> 00:45:03,105
Hey, you can't talk--

628
00:45:04,524 --> 00:45:06,442
- No!
- You're gonna run out on your dad?

629
00:45:06,476 --> 00:45:09,845
Take a look.
He's doing this for you.

630
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:20,656
Stop! Stop! Stop!

631
00:45:20,707 --> 00:45:23,125
- Stop!
- Stop? Stop?

632
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,078
I thought that got you off, kid--
seeing people in pain.

633
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:28,964
If you ever bully
or hurt anybody again,

634
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:30,916
I'll come back
and butt-fuck your father

635
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:33,586
with your mom's headless
corpse on this goddamn lawn.

636
00:45:37,758 --> 00:45:39,925
12 years old, my ass.

637
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:42,394
Fuck you.

638
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:55,775
Oh, my God, Wit!

639
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,424
What's this one?

640
00:47:02,475 --> 00:47:04,260
The big one.

641
00:47:09,282 --> 00:47:11,350
I know you don't like
talking about the army,

642
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:13,402
but I keep wondering--

643
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:15,688
It's not from the army.

644
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:18,791
It's from before.

645
00:47:18,825 --> 00:47:20,893
A long time ago.

646
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,535
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on something.

647
00:47:29,586 --> 00:47:32,087
Just got to check it out.

648
00:47:32,122 --> 00:47:34,006
How are you working
on something?

649
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,008
- You're on leave.
- <i> It's a side job, babe.</i>

650
00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:38,444
Told a friend I'd help him out.

651
00:47:43,683 --> 00:47:45,768
That sounds like
bullshit, Paul.

652
00:47:47,053 --> 00:47:49,521
Hey, it's not.

653
00:47:49,556 --> 00:47:51,557
I swear.

654
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,145
Are you ever
gonna spend the night?

655
00:47:58,198 --> 00:48:02,101
Hey, there's no one else.

656
00:48:02,135 --> 00:48:06,071
It's just right now
my life is kind of fucked.

657
00:48:06,122 --> 00:48:08,407
I gotta keep working.

658
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:10,409
I need to do something.
I need to work.

659
00:48:10,411 --> 00:48:12,478
You need to come back to bed.

660
00:48:23,256 --> 00:48:25,140
It's just work.

661
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:27,009

I asked him how long he thought
it took Stephen Hawking

676
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,889
to type a piece of
investigative journalism.

677
00:50:38,224 --> 00:50:40,025
He ain't gonna be writing
that story no more.

678
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,994
Good. Yeah.

679
00:50:42,028 --> 00:50:44,480
Give him something to chew on.

680
00:50:56,576 --> 00:50:59,995
Supposed to savor that.

681
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:02,915
Yeah?
Let me try it again.

682
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,260
Tying one on?

683
00:51:15,262 --> 00:51:17,763
Not particularly.

684
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:23,302
How's your kid?

685
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:25,237
You talk to that lawyer
I put you with?

686
00:51:25,271 --> 00:51:28,107
Harris? Yeah. Yeah.
She's gonna see what she can do.

687
00:51:28,158 --> 00:51:31,026
She said, you know,
don't get my hopes up.

688
00:51:36,116 --> 00:51:37,449
Is your dinner okay, Ray?

689
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:39,618
- Yeah.
- You want something else?

690
00:51:39,669 --> 00:51:41,537
No, thank you, darling.

691
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:49,378
You seeing anybody?
A woman?

692
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:52,131
There something else
I'd be seeing?

693
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,869

You got time.
Have more kids.

697

We're trying.
