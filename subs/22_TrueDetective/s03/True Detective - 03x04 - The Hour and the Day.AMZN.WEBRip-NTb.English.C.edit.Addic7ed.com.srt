1
00:00:01,789 --> 00:00:03,952
We need to reexamine it all.

2
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:05,704
It's like a thing staring right at us.

3
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:08,902
The Purcells...

4
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,243
said they were gonna
play with their neighbor.

5
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:12,952
The Boyle kid. What
were they really doing?

6
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:15,118
Looks like the kids had this play area

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,406
hidden out in the forest.
Found these toys there.

8
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:20,869
They were meeting
somebody? Like some adult?

9
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:23,617
- What's this?
- That's Will's first communion.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,829
It's the same.

11
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:27,661
What are you coming around the kids for?

12
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:32,035
I've seen those kids before.

13
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:33,285
You see anybody else?

14
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:35,577
Car out here a couple times.

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,452
Another former resident noticed
the car because it was new

16
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,954
and upscale and no one ever
came back to question him.

17
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:44,077
This points to serious
flaws in the investigation

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,195
from the beginning.

19
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:47,750
Two months ago. Burglary.
One set of prints hit.

20
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:48,892
Julie Purcell's.

21
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,794
Her prints were found
just on the shells.

22
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:52,452
Looks like she was probably a customer.

23
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:55,786
Do not come bouncing in
here, giddy about this shit.

24
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:57,786
New task force. I'm in charge.

25
00:00:57,788 --> 00:00:59,788
You feel like maybe
being a detective again?

26
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:28,156
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

27
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,746
For whoever desires to save his life...

28
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:49,577
will lose it, but...

29
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:53,037
whoever loses his life for my sake...

30
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:56,294
will save it.

31
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,327
I will never leave
the gathered regiment,

32
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:04,125
nor flee from any battle.

33
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:09,577
And I give them eternal life.

34
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,413
And they shall never perish.

35
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:18,204
Neither shall anyone
snatch them out of my hand.

36
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:21,037
Now...

37
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:24,744
what is this about?

38
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,412
We didn't do classes,
my first communion.

39
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:31,661
Why are the children posed this way?

40
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:33,051
Prayerful repose

41
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:36,535
signifies their innocence
and rebirth in Christ.

42
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:38,788
And why does Will have his eyes closed?

43
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:41,369
I don't know.

44
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:43,786
I suppose he blinked.

45
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,911
Who took these pictures?

46
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:47,287
I did.

47
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,453
The youth group...

48
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,120
Had you talked much with the kids

49
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,368
about their activities
outside the church?

50
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:57,285
Ever about their home lives,

51
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:00,077
new acquaintances?

52
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,744
I didn't often see
their parents at service,

53
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:06,786
and it usually was just the father, Tom.

54
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,993
Actually, last I saw her,

55
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:12,704
Julie had been excited
about seeing an aunt...?

56
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:15,993
She doesn't have any aunts.

57
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:18,140
Tell you anything about this aunt?

58
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:19,619
Description?

59
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:21,911
Something might draw notice?

60
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:25,452
She told the woman's name.
I-I wish I could recollect it.

61
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:27,035
We'd be grateful for names,

62
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:29,702
other people who worked
with the youth group.

63
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,859
Like to get some fingerprints too.

64
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:32,871
Certainly.

65
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:37,120
Any of this stuff look familiar?

66
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:41,160
That's a chaff doll.

67
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:43,494
Patty Faber makes
them for our fall fair,

68
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,577
first week in October.

69
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,746
She's a dear, good
woman, I can tell you.

70
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:56,746
You were Catholic. Do
you attend services?

71
00:04:58,162 --> 00:04:59,911
Sometimes.

72
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,577
Remiss of late.

73
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,702
I was an altar boy,

74
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,452
little country church in Conway.

75
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,911
Well, even abiding in the dark,

76
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:09,911
we implore a steadfast faith,

77
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:12,704
assured His hand is at work.

78
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,785
Anything else about the kids?

79
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:20,786
Just that they were sweet children,

80
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,162
and they looked out for each other.

81
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,160
I don't like him.

82
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,537
The priest.

83
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:32,207
And I know his alibi's good,

84
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,079
but... I don't like him.

85
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:40,452
Man signs up to go
without fuckin' for life...

86
00:05:40,454 --> 00:05:43,035
Either he don't know himself for a liar,

87
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:47,577
or he's some tight, limited
edition psycho, you know?

88
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:50,410
I mean,

89
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:52,412
everybody's fuckin' somethin'.

90
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:55,786
You can imagine that little boy

91
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,746
looking out for his sister, huh?

92
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,535
He was trying to defend her.

93
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:06,494
That's what happened to him.

94
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:10,911
Maybe whoever they were
playing with in the woods...

95
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,287
Maybe this new aunt or whoever...

96
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:17,120
They never wanted the boy.

97
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:20,410
My feeling...

98
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:21,995
it was all about the girl.

99
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,289
Catholic, huh?

100
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,909
Yep.

101
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:34,412
We were Baptist.

102
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:40,243
Had a good buddy in the war. Baptist.

103
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:41,621
What happened to him?

104
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:03,162
Look forward to meeting Patty Faber.

105
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,496
A dear, good woman.

106
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,278
Yes, I'm pretty sure these are mine.

107
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:16,327
Just little things I do.

108
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:19,118
Somebody bought 'em. Do you know who?

109
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,243
Well, the last I sold these myself

110
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:25,619
was at the fair in October.

111
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:27,661
I'd only sold a couple,

112
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:30,410
and then one man bought ten off me.

113
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:31,952
That was nice.

114
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:34,786
You know who he was?

115
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,661
You remember anything about him?

116
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:40,077
Didn't recognize him.

117
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,035
Negro man, like yourself.

118
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:46,202
Oh, he had a dead eye.

119
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:49,952
Filmy, you know, like a cataracts?

120
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:53,535
Nothing 'bout his face besides the eye?

121
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:55,369
Handsome, ugly?

122
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:59,746
Well, like I say, uh, he was black.

123
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,035
You speak to him at all?

124
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:04,952
He say what the dolls were for?

125
00:08:04,954 --> 00:08:07,410
Well, I asked, and I think he said

126
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:09,568
he had nieces and nephews.

127
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:13,851
That man...

128
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:17,202
any chance he mentioned where they live?

129
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,661
No.

130
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,866
Well, I just assume that would have been

131
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:22,200
with the rest of them

132
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:25,079
over the tracks in Davis Junction.

133
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:27,767
Thank you, ma'am.

134
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,270
Oh.

135
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:52,079
Special Investigator.

136
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:54,410
New detail.

137
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:56,871
Roland's in charge, he wants me on it.

138
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:01,995
They're reopening the Purcell case.

139
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:04,913
How 'bout that, right?

140
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,327
Yeah, but this time we get to close it.

141
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,663
Actually get to do my job again.

142
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:14,120
Good. I'm happy for you.

143
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:17,806
That what happy looks like?

144
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,598
I've been doing it
wrong all these years.

145
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,827
I'm happy for you like you were
happy for me the other night.

146
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,118
Oh.

147
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,452
Oh, good.

148
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:28,661
'Cause of course no mistake,

149
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:31,848
no slip of temper could possibly occur

150
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:34,454
without me paying double
interest for it at a later date.

151
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,520
You could just apologize.

152
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:39,661
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,942
I'm sorry I haven't expressed better

154
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:44,871
how inadequate and useless
I've been made to feel.

155
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:47,744
Yeah, "made to feel."

156
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:51,661
You're this person
things just happen to.

157
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:53,765
Your job, your marriage...

158
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:57,981
your family, your feelings...

159
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:00,160
Everything's just happening to you.

160
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:03,285
You're this grown man
with no agency of his own.

161
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,911
Fate just keeps throwing him curveballs.

162
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:09,663
How awful for you, these
trials and vicissitudes.

163
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:13,160
Look it up.

164
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,035
When have I ever not been stand-up

165
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:16,494
for you and our family?

166
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:18,993
I try, you see me tryin'.

167
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:21,118
There's guys, they're barely around.

168
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,452
They get girlfriends.

169
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,793
I wish you would. Get
a girlfriend, please.

170
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:27,202
I'm not the one my head in
the clouds the last five years.

171
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,869
"Oh, I'm 'on be a great writer.

172
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:30,619
Let me just use this awful tragedy

173
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:32,698
to take myself on to better things,"

174
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,950
because you always gotta be
on your way to better things.

175
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:37,410
'Least I have some kind of drive.

176
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,702
I can't even say what moves you anymore.

177
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:42,702
I think you stay upright out of habit.

178
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:45,368
This walking wounded, poor me.

179
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:47,663
Let me ask you something.

180
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,160
You guys okay?

181
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:56,704
Yeah, Dad.

182
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:10,744
Do not talk shit to
my face and walk away.

183
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:12,744
I don't want to be around you right now.

184
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:14,243
You want me to leave you alone,

185
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:15,577
then stop talking shit.

186
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,202
'Cause when you talk shit about me,

187
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:18,494
I'm required to defend myself.

188
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:19,797
How can you defend yourself?

189
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,993
You can't defend yourself

190
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,661
because you don't know what's wrong.

191
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:24,243
Did the wife in your scenario

192
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:26,285
play any part in the conflict,

193
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:27,661
any role the last ten years?

194
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:28,702
Let go of me, Wayne.

195
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:29,910
Stop talkin' shit about me.

196
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,079
Or what?

197
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:37,245
Or I'm gonna start cryin'.

198
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:41,621
Well, that's a first.

199
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,452
Thinking we can't understand each other.

200
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:48,120
We're never gonna.

201
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:54,196
Oh, great, Wayne.

202
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,665
Walk away. Surprise, surprise.

203
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:58,535
Well, what do you want me to do, huh?

204
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,035
You want me to yell some more?

205
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:01,869
You want me to hit you?
You want me to fuck you?

206
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,128
Just give me my orders, Major.

207
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:04,284
I want to finish this.

208
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:06,827
All on your schedule, I guess.

209
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:09,293
Be happy when you say.
Fight when you say.

210
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:12,087
Talk when you say. Fuck every so often.

211
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,160
Well, how 'bout right now?

212
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:22,332
What?

213
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:29,037
How 'bout right now?

214
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:33,938
You got some major cognitive dissonance.

215
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:57,829
Guess we 'bout six years old, huh?

216
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,202
I don't think bad of you.

217
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:06,663
What I was saying... I didn't mean that.

218
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,329
Me neither.

219
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:58,285
Want to just do a house-to-house?

220
00:13:58,287 --> 00:13:59,911
That'd be fun.

221
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,454
I thought we'd just
start at the liquor store.

222
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:06,402
Pretty fuckin' racist, man.

223
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,827
And it's one of three businesses here

224
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,704
'cause nobody uses it.

225
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:14,722
Let's flip for it.

226
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:21,744
All we know, man's got a dead eye.

227
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:23,243
Filmy-like.

228
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:25,412
Sound like anybody in the community?

229
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:31,369
Having us owe you a
favor could be worthwhile,

230
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,369
find yourself in a
difficult position ever,

231
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:35,621
police.

232
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:42,410
He's always been a good customer,

233
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:44,285
but you...

234
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:45,954
talkin' 'bout that dead eye.

235
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:51,454
Sam Whitehead got one of them.

236
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:53,788
Where's he live?

237
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:58,329
That trailer park off of Central Avenue.

238
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:25,702
Mr. Whitehead.

239
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:28,535
Wonder could we talk to you a minute.

240
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:31,035
Well, what's this about?

241
00:15:31,037 --> 00:15:33,329
Could we step inside, sir?

242
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:39,118
I'd rather stay out here,
if it's all the same to you.

243
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,702
You ever go to mass?

244
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,827
St. Michael's church?

245
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:46,494
No, I go to First Presbyterian.

246
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:48,661
You go to their church fair, maybe?

247
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:51,827
Buy some dolls made out of straw?

248
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:54,702
What? No!

249
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,577
What the hell is this?

250
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,128
What y'all tryin' to do to me?

251
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,077
Just runnin' down a coupla details.

252
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,827
Case we're workin'.

253
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,369
Dead boy, missin' girl.

254
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:07,202
You mighta seen it in the papers.

255
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:08,993
White children.

256
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:11,452
If it's in the paper,
it's white children.

257
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:16,327
Knowin' we're not gonna solve
the racial complexities of our day

258
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:19,202
here in your front yard,

259
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:22,202
maybe you could tell us where
you were the night of the 7th?

260
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:26,911
Where was I? Where you
tryin' to say I was?

261
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,827
Y'all come over here!

262
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:31,911
Come watch these nefarious men,
what they's tryin' to do to me!

263
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,869
And you...

264
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,619
How you gonna wear that badge?

265
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,704
It's got a little clip on it.

266
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:48,430
Off on the wrong foot here. It's
just a few questions, Mr. Whitehead.

267
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,952
Why y'all messin' with old Sam?

268
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:51,744
- Leave him alone.
- Be cool, y'all.

269
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,577
It's nothin'. So far.

270
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,267
Might not stay that way, certain
people don't back the fuck up.

271
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,436
- Knock it off with that shit.
- Y'all heard that?

272
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:01,227
Peckerwood lookin' to shoot somebody!

273
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,047
Ain't nobody call for the po-lice.

274
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,744
Where were you the night of the 7th?

275
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:06,619
Right here. My house.

276
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:09,719
They tryin' to fix me up! Them
white children on the news!

277
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:11,622
You know they tryin'
to put that on a nigger!

278
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:14,577
Goddamn it, calm the fuck down!

279
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,160
Hey, hey! No, no! Roland!

280
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,827
Stir up enough of this
shit, somebody gon' get hurt.

281
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,869
And brother, it ain't gon' be us.

282
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:27,369
You talk to us here or at the station...

283
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:28,954
But you're talkin'.

284
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:33,452
Lookin' for a black
male with one dead eye.

285
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:35,452
You know anybody like that, Sam?

286
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,327
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

287
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,369
I work for a goddamn living!

288
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:41,744
Two jobs, when I can get 'em!

289
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:44,663
I haul freight for the
railroad, and I trap.

290
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:47,452
You fittin' to shoot me now?

291
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,494
You spend any time at Devil's Den?

292
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,035
I do not.

293
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,452
Anybody verify you were
here the night of the 7th?

294
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:55,786
Most of the people on my goddamn lawn!

295
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:59,285
I ain't the only one-eyed
nigger in these parts!

296
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,243
Farm work, killin' line
at the chicken plant.

297
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:05,128
You know anybody else with one eye?

298
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:06,671
Half the motherfuckers out here

299
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:08,921
missin' fingers, toes, ear, somethin'!

300
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:15,410
Go ahead and shoot me now.

301
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:18,452
See how this goes first.

302
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:20,827
- Come out here!
- Take it easy.

303
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:23,077
Nobody gettin' hurt today.

304
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,619
Tell 'em, Mr. Whitehead.

305
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:27,744
It's all right so far, y'all.

306
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:29,619
But everybody be careful.

307
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,827
This white man wanna shoot somebody.

308
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:33,704
Don't take it personally.

309
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,788
Oh, that's fuckin' perfect!

310
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:49,577
Believe this shit?

311
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:53,663
I mean, bit of an
overreaction, don't ya think?

312
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:02,285
Would you've done it?

313
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:05,369
Would you've shot one of 'em?

314
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:07,993
If I thought it was between him and me.

315
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:11,913
And no, I could give a
fuck what color he was.

316
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:14,993
Sure about that?

317
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:19,369
Fact these were black folks
probably gave me more pause.

318
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:22,035
Mob of white people surrounds me,

319
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,869
smashes up my ride,

320
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,079
be a lot less hesitation what I'd do.

321
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:44,954
Can we say this was anonymous vandals?

322
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:51,287
We're not goin' with "irate Negros"?

323
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:02,369
When I was on the force in the '80s,

324
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:05,661
that woman could do more pushups
than anybody in the department.

325
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:11,454
- Hey.
- All right.

326
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:14,786
She here's a good woman.

327
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:18,494
We had a fat guy that smoked
Viceroys one after another in my day.

328
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:20,285
What's goin' on, Dad?
Why didn't you call?

329
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,243
- I'd have come to you.
- Take it easy.

330
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:24,500
I didn't drive. I... grabbed a bus.

331
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:26,202
I'm just sayin', you take a bus,

332
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:28,118
what happens, you forget to get off?

333
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,952
What happens, you don't
remember why you even got on?

334
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:32,993
I hold down this button.

335
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,621
It calls you.

336
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,117
Think I oughta walk around
with a note or somethin'?

337
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,661
Whatever you think is best.

338
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,795
I don't wanna get
arrogant with this thing.

339
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:45,577
What ya got there?

340
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,285
Oh. You know, I...

341
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:50,619
I been workin' on this thing.

342
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,972
Writin'. About the case.

343
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,816
Both times, the first
one and the second.

344
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:57,534
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, so...

345
00:20:57,537 --> 00:21:00,827
I been goin' through old
files and writin' stuff down,

346
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,452
and recording stuff, so I remember.

347
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:05,329
What's the point, you
lookin' at old case notes?

348
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:08,285
Writin's been good for me.

349
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:11,243
Maybe I got a book in
there or somethin', or...

350
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:13,160
maybe it's nothin' and
don't mean anything,

351
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,202
but it's been good for
me. My head, I mean.

352
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:18,433
You don't need to do that show anymore.

353
00:21:18,436 --> 00:21:20,627
I'm not talkin' about the show.

354
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,368
It's me. It's my life.

355
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:26,369
Tell myself the story,
I tell the case in steps,

356
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:28,827
and I'm rememberin'.

357
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,243
Rememberin' my life.

358
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:34,285
Goin' along with all that, I...

359
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:37,535
found a coupla people and details

360
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:41,035
I was wonderin' if maybe
you could look up for me.

361
00:21:41,037 --> 00:21:43,494
Man, Dad, I don't think so.

362
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:45,452
I really need your help here.

363
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:47,535
Where else I'm gonna
go than Detective Hays?

364
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:50,452
Look at it.

365
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:54,160
Just a few names and people I'd
like to see where they ended up

366
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:56,869
and never got around to
gettin' everything from.

367
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:58,619
And Roland.

368
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:01,077
What I really need is
for you to find Roland.

369
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,494
Roland? Jesus, Dad, come on.

370
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,746
I need his memory, son.

371
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,077
I'm bein' straight with you, man to man.

372
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,871
Knowin' I had a place here, as you do.

373
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,461
This right now is...

374
00:22:20,746 --> 00:22:23,037
my way of stayin' alive.

375
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:30,913
This can't be a habit
or anything, all right?

376
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,579
Yes, sir.

377
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:36,943
Thank you, son.

378
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:42,786
Roland, um... he's not dead, is he?

379
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:45,120
I guess I'll find out.

380
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,287
How are you otherwise?

381
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,785
One of my good days. Pretty clear.

382
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:56,869
Be a good day for that
director to catch me.

383
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:58,786
You seen her since?

384
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:00,661
The director? Elisa?

385
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,789
Uh... since the last day, I mean?

386
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:06,136
No, not since she pulled that shit,

387
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:08,515
criticizin' the investigation.

388
00:23:11,287 --> 00:23:12,995
Okay, son.

389
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,619
Now look, Dad, I'm gonna see
what I can do about some of these,

390
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:19,827
and I'll try to find where Roland is,

391
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:21,285
if he's still around.

392
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:22,913
I appreciate it.

393
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:26,619
Come on, Pop.

394
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,120
I'll drive you back.

395
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,077
Uh-huh.

396
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,704
Yeah, that's right.

397
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:40,993
Yes, sir.

398
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:43,535
Well, that'd be my preference,

399
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:45,537
and you'd have my gratitude.

400
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:49,037
Thank you, now.

401
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:54,704
We're good with Sallisaw PD.

402
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,409
Roland.

403
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:05,869
Major.

404
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,952
Lieutenant West.

405
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:10,287
Mr. Attorney General.

406
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,207
Roland, A.G. Kindt

407
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,409
wanted to reiterate our cause.

408
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:24,202
All the evidence at the time pointed
to the Purcell girl bein' dead.

409
00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:27,077
And whether or not this was the case,

410
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,202
state and county offices remain
convinced of the man's guilt.

411
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:32,535
The mandate of this unit is to vindicate

412
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,245
the original conviction
for Will Purcell's murder.

413
00:24:36,995 --> 00:24:38,744
Understood.

414
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:41,410
Hmm. Officer Hays, I
know it's been some time

415
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:44,433
since you've been involved
in an investigative unit.

416
00:24:44,436 --> 00:24:46,915
Roland had to do
considerable campaigning

417
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,952
to get you to, uh, be a part of this.

418
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:52,744
I'm hopin' your
involvement does not portend

419
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:54,869
to any damage to his reputation.

420
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:56,702
And I further hope, Officer,

421
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,243
that you might use this new role

422
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:01,913
to redeem an unfortunately
stunted career.

423
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,743
I'm committed to fulfillin' the
mandates just described to us, sir.

424
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:13,410
Good. This is all brought to conclusion,

425
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:16,734
I could imagine you
back at Major Crimes.

426
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:24,464
Sir.

427
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:42,409
We're not gonna do any of that
shit they just said, right?

428
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:45,454
Wasn't plannin' on it.

429
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:57,534
How right that today

430
00:25:57,537 --> 00:26:01,496
His Word to us promises justice.

431
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:07,452
Promises us liberation from the weight

432
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:11,287
of time and flesh.

433
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:16,850
And He tells us today,
the reading from Malachi...

434
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:22,329
Justice is not ours to deliver.

435
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:27,952
Justice is not in our power;

436
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,663
it is in His.

437
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:37,494
Having said as much, I would like
to ask you all for your help today.

438
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:41,118
After services, the police
will have set up some tables,

439
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,663
and I dearly hope you will assist them.

440
00:26:54,855 --> 00:26:56,786
Right hand. Mm-hmm.

441
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:58,869
I didn't see no one-eyed brother,

442
00:26:58,871 --> 00:27:00,494
but I'll tell ya this:

443
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:04,577
there's some serious ass up in here.

444
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,871
I gotta get back to church.

445
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,329
Well, don't mind me.
I'll just hang back.

446
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,202
Excuse me! Miss?

447
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,285
Thanks for helpin' us with this.

448
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:26,202
I don't know anybody'd
do it without your askin'.

449
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:29,410
Of course. We'll keep
it up through Sunday.

450
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:31,285
I noticed you didn't take the Eucharist.

451
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:34,202
I'd need to hit confession first.

452
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:36,160
Would you like to confess now?

453
00:27:36,162 --> 00:27:39,327
I reckon I'll let it
pile up a little more.

454
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:43,077
Can you tell me,

455
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,117
any member of your congregation
a black man with a dead eye?

456
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,202
- Like a cataract?
- Offhand, I don't believe so,

457
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:51,702
but we have over a
thousand parishioners,

458
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:55,246
and I regret to say only a small
portion are African-American.

459
00:27:57,037 --> 00:27:59,577
Thing of it is, Father,

460
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:03,702
we're about ninety percent sure
whoever took Julie, hurt Will,

461
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:05,952
they're one of y'all's.

462
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:09,452
I find it difficult to believe that
anyone here could do something like that.

463
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,037
They don't exactly wear
signboards, say "psycho-killer."

464
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:18,326
Be a great help to us, keep an eye out.

465
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,202
Maybe ask around about
the man I described.

466
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:25,243
I'll certainly try,
and pray to be of use.

467
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:29,118
I really would like to hear
your confession, Detective.

468
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,954
I get to feelin' penitent,
I'll let you know.

469
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:39,285
I think faith is one of the
most important things there is,

470
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:40,769
you ask me.

471
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:42,827
Well, that's nice.

472
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,744
- Ready?
- Yeah.

473
00:28:45,746 --> 00:28:47,786
I'll see ya next week, Miss Lori.

474
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:49,954
- See you then.
- All right.

475
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:57,285
Holy Spirit workin' out for you?

476
00:28:57,287 --> 00:29:00,954
God is love, brother... God is love.

477
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:27,162
- Beer man.
- Hmm.

478
00:29:28,537 --> 00:29:30,871
Only when I need my wits about me.

479
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,077
I started thinking...

480
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,702
Will's death...

481
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:53,344
Could it have been an accident?

482
00:29:55,286 --> 00:29:57,951
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
bring your office home.

483
00:29:57,954 --> 00:30:02,702
- It's okay.
- My whole life, I speak, I regret.

484
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:04,871
Never regret on my account.

485
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:14,037
How'd you do with California?

486
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,409
It was all steers and queers, man.

487
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:23,371
Lotta people...

488
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,663
ideas...

489
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:30,202
lotta confusion.

490
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,911
Figure that stops at the state lines?

491
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:35,412
Good bit of that confusion was mine.

492
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:40,412
Can I tell you a secret?

493
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:44,494
I used to be something of a mess.

494
00:30:44,496 --> 00:30:48,371
That might be the least
surprisin' thing I've ever heard.

495
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:52,386
What about you?

496
00:30:53,495 --> 00:30:55,992
Your clip-on ties as crazy as you get?

497
00:30:55,995 --> 00:30:57,746
Oh, God, no.

498
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:04,535
But I'd like to pretend
normal with you...

499
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:06,245
for as long as I can.

500
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:11,419
So later on, it'll be a surprise.

501
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,788
How much later on were you thinking?

502
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:33,079
I found this spot they
played in the woods.

503
00:31:34,537 --> 00:31:36,160
They were meetin' somebody...

504
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:38,245
The kids... out there.

505
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:42,621
Somebody gave 'em toys.

506
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:47,954
It's where the boy died.

507
00:31:50,412 --> 00:31:52,788
The way Will's body was...

508
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,329
How you were saying the toys...

509
00:31:59,204 --> 00:32:02,327
It's almost as if there was
an element of affection in it,

510
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:03,827
don't you think?

511
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:07,077
People who hurt kids think of themselves

512
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,535
as having affection for the children,

513
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:12,371
even up to the fuckin'-'em-
and-murderin'-'em part.

514
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:33,829
You want a do-over?

515
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,245
Where do they give those out?

516
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:42,871
Tell me about your family.

517
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:48,704
Mom was country.

518
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:53,995
Chopped wood, killed
chickens, build you a barn.

519
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:58,037
Worked a farm as a domestic.

520
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:02,245
I worked the fields, time I was eight.

521
00:33:06,222 --> 00:33:08,035
Dad?

522
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:10,435
You need to get that
information somewheres else.

523
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:18,954
You?

524
00:33:20,913 --> 00:33:22,285
Me what?

525
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:26,786
I'd like a full presentation
on your background.

526
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:29,371
Keepin' in mind I'm a
trained interrogator.

527
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,911
Uh-huh.

528
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:33,952
- You're my first police.
- Hm.

529
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:35,579
You gonna rough me up?

530
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:39,202
Nowhere on my list of
things to do with ya.

531
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:40,827
You got a list?

532
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:43,412
More detailed by the minute.

533
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,993
I didn't mean to overstep. I'm sorry.

534
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:56,287
You apologize a lot?

535
00:33:57,962 --> 00:33:59,587
I could start.

536
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,995
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

537
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:08,120
I don't know.

538
00:34:09,484 --> 00:34:12,023
Memories of other women
are gettin' hazy now.

539
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:13,318
Oh, brother.

540
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:17,242
You hear about cops being pussy hounds.

541
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:19,369
I don't like that word.

542
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,911
Unless it's describing a man.

543
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:23,954
What word do you use?

544
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,702
"Dick holster."

545
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,788
You never answered.

546
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:40,454
You see many girls?

547
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:45,995
Hmm. Sometimes.

548
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:51,037
Don't seem to last for long, though.

549
00:34:52,162 --> 00:34:54,204
I don't plan it that way.

550
00:34:58,454 --> 00:35:00,329
I have a mental handicap.

551
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:07,663
The other stuff don't
work for me without this.

552
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:29,869
Wanna trace fingers?

553
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:32,827
That can be kinda fun.

554
00:35:35,496 --> 00:35:37,702
I'd like to make you laugh.

555
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:39,371
I'll have to catch my breath.

556
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:44,378
Shit, you're pretty good at this.

557
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:50,285
I can see you being a real dog.

558
00:35:50,287 --> 00:35:51,871
That's down to you.

559
00:35:53,037 --> 00:35:55,786
I have no idea what I'm doin'.

560
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:55,202
He started hollerin'...

561
00:36:55,204 --> 00:36:58,118
Broke a glass, made some accusations,

562
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,952
Took a swing at Kenny.

563
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:03,118
Had your card from
when y'all talked to me.

564
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,412
What's goin' on, Mr. Purcell?

565
00:37:06,787 --> 00:37:09,409
Doin' my Bozo the Clown act,

566
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:13,127
since everybody thinks
I'm so fuckin' funny.

567
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:18,243
She was fuckin' him, ya know.

568
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:19,911
Her boss.

569
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:24,869
Shit, you're a detective...

570
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:27,744
you probably figured that out already.

571
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,494
Why didn't you call his wife?

572
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,329
Lucy's got enough problems right now.

573
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:38,284
Could press charges on ya, Tom...

574
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:40,802
but I sympathize, what
your family's goin' through.

575
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:43,138
Fuck you.

576
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,410
I'm such a joke.

577
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:05,827
You didn't need the one
nigger cop on the job

578
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:07,327
to help babysit me?

579
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,871
He's the best detective on the case.

580
00:38:12,371 --> 00:38:14,037
Tryin' to find your daughter.

581
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:22,871
I apologize.

582
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:26,579
That word I used.

583
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:32,995
Your pal wanted to kick my
ass, he'd have the right.

584
00:38:36,788 --> 00:38:39,829
You've gotten your ass
kicked enough for now.

585
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,910
You takin' me home?

586
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:46,496
Yeah.

587
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:52,537
I can't be in that house, man.

588
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:57,954
Every inch of that place is them kids.

589
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:04,077
I can't be there.

590
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,704
I can't sleep there.

591
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:11,746
I just wanna die...

592
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:14,334
all the time.

593
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,326
I got a jail cell for ya,

594
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:29,252
or I got a couch.

595
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,035
Whyn't you use that?

596
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,287
Then we see how tomorrow looks.

597
00:39:37,662 --> 00:39:39,660
Oh, my God.

598
00:39:39,663 --> 00:39:42,329
I'm so sorry I used that word.

599
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:46,077
Don't tell him.

600
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,954
He been called worse by
people meant it more'n you did.

601
00:39:55,371 --> 00:39:57,746
I'm sorry for that, too.

602
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,992
First thing. You two,

603
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,911
go over every statement taken back then.

604
00:40:33,913 --> 00:40:35,993
I want y'all finding current addresses

605
00:40:35,995 --> 00:40:38,327
for any residents we talked to in '80...

606
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:40,911
Anybody from that neighborhood.

607
00:40:40,913 --> 00:40:43,166
Detective Hays here
was lead at the time.

608
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:46,379
He's come over from Public
Information to help us out.

609
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:50,327
We had a coupla threads we
were just getting started

610
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:52,060
before the whole thing closed out on us.

611
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:53,497
What we got that's brand-new

612
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,661
is the missing girl's
prints showed up in Oklahoma.

613
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:57,702
Now, we're gonna have to...

614
00:40:57,704 --> 00:40:59,786
Wayne's gonna try to help me find her.

615
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:03,869
We figure find the girl,
who by now is 21 years old,

616
00:41:03,871 --> 00:41:06,243
we get the story of what happened.

617
00:41:06,245 --> 00:41:09,494
Now, everything pointed
to her bein' dead.

618
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:11,369
We were wrong.

619
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:13,410
Let's find out why.

620
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,045
I don't know about "we."

621
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:21,452
Her mother Lucy, she's dead. We knew.

622
00:41:21,454 --> 00:41:23,911
OD'ed outside Vegas, '88.

623
00:41:23,913 --> 00:41:26,327
She had a cousin, Dan O'Brien...

624
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:28,494
Nobody knows where he is.

625
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:31,577
Hobbs, Segar... Focus on findin' him.

626
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:35,369
Mainly, y'all seekin'
anything mighta got overlooked.

627
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:38,037
All the tips, interrogations, whatnot.

628
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,913
Yeah. You in the back.

629
00:41:45,454 --> 00:41:47,035
A secondary consideration.

630
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,471
If word's out now this girl's alive,

631
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:51,660
there's a real possibility
there's people somewhere

632
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:53,494
don't want that to remain the case.

633
00:41:53,497 --> 00:41:55,410
Imagine she escaped somewhere,

634
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,744
imagine we're not the
only ones lookin' for her.

635
00:41:57,746 --> 00:41:59,482
There's any chance that's the case,

636
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:00,982
I think it's like the last time...

637
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,777
We gotta figure there's a tickin' clock.

638
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:07,285
He's not wrong.

639
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:08,911
May not be right,

640
00:42:08,913 --> 00:42:11,202
but he's not wrong.

641
00:42:11,204 --> 00:42:13,079
All right, let's get to it. C'mon.

642
00:42:25,704 --> 00:42:27,369
We goin' to Sallisaw?

643
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:28,954
Yeah.

644
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:42,702
H-Hi.

645
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:44,788
Mind if we talk a little?

646
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:05,034
Hope I didn't interrupt anything.

647
00:43:05,037 --> 00:43:06,880
You and a friend.

648
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:08,985
No, I'm alone.

649
00:43:08,988 --> 00:43:10,614
My mistake.

650
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:13,744
I get confused...

651
00:43:13,746 --> 00:43:15,454
As you by now know.

652
00:43:17,954 --> 00:43:19,663
Sit. Please.

653
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:23,663
Well, what can I do for you?

654
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:30,243
I kinda had the impression after our
last talk you might be done with me.

655
00:43:30,245 --> 00:43:32,243
It's all right.

656
00:43:32,245 --> 00:43:34,619
Thing is,

657
00:43:34,621 --> 00:43:38,327
you shared some details I didn't have.

658
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:41,869
It's clear you have some kind
of investigator workin' this.

659
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:45,869
We have researchers, a
couple of investigators, sure.

660
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:48,118
And you'd like to talk to me some more?

661
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,035
Since we haven't addressed the
conclusion of our efforts in '80,

662
00:43:52,037 --> 00:43:54,365
much less '90, which to me

663
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:57,159
is more hauntin' than anything.

664
00:43:57,162 --> 00:44:00,160
Yeah. Of course I want
to keep talking to you.

665
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:03,243
So you want to talk to
me, I want to talk to you.

666
00:44:03,245 --> 00:44:04,911
All right, great.

667
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:06,535
But, Miss...

668
00:44:06,537 --> 00:44:08,744
you're gonna have to show yours, too.

669
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,410
- How do you mean?
- I mean, I wanna know

670
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:15,160
anything and everything
your people pulled together.

671
00:44:15,162 --> 00:44:17,327
Why are you doing this now?

672
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:19,663
You got some idea what
happened to the girl?

673
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:22,618
Are you trying to work this?

674
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:24,704
I wanna know the whole story.

675
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,535
A lot of this is my life.

676
00:44:28,537 --> 00:44:31,913
There are some pieces
I'm missin', I need 'em.

677
00:44:41,204 --> 00:44:43,911
Drained quarry in southern Missouri.

678
00:44:43,913 --> 00:44:47,619
Dental records from prison identify
the remains as Dan O'Brien...

679
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:50,951
Lucy's cousin who went missing
in '90 after resurfacing.

680
00:44:54,579 --> 00:44:55,746
This it?

681
00:44:57,537 --> 00:45:00,577
Look, I can't show you
all my cards just yet.

682
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,788
But it's not on you.

683
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:16,952
Should you happen to see my son, Henry,

684
00:45:16,954 --> 00:45:20,329
it'd be best for both of us you
didn't mention this exchange.

685
00:45:21,912 --> 00:45:25,159
Are you sure you're not trying
to investigate this again?

686
00:45:25,162 --> 00:45:28,954
That'd be a job for somebody who
knows where he is most of the time.

687
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:41,475
We're puttin' an APB on the
description, person of interest.

688
00:45:41,478 --> 00:45:43,518
Between the pose, the dolls,

689
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:46,346
and why we think this has
something to do with the church.

690
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:49,077
That's strange... the body
position bein' the same.

691
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,827
That, and the toys.

692
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:52,827
Playin' out in the
woods... This new "aunt."

693
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:55,243
Doll guy mentionin' nieces and nephews,

694
00:45:55,245 --> 00:45:56,788
little notes in her room.

695
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,202
There's an aspect we're not catching.

696
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:02,494
We're tryin' to print
the whole congregation.

697
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:04,302
Oh, speaking of... Still no match

698
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:06,034
on the bicycle's prints.

699
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:08,202
We just had our guy start
comparing to student files.

700
00:46:08,205 --> 00:46:10,330
There was this program
a couple years ago,

701
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,588
all the kids got theirs done.

702
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:12,838
What about the note?

703
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:13,993
Matched magazine ads

704
00:46:13,995 --> 00:46:16,260
to the letters, but
no real action there.

705
00:46:16,263 --> 00:46:19,160
Processing public mailboxes
that ZIP code, but...

706
00:46:19,162 --> 00:46:20,744
it's not gonna come to anything.

707
00:46:20,746 --> 00:46:23,026
Thought to look at the
toys from the woods.

708
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:26,721
Call around, see what
shops sell those specific.

709
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:29,410
We've still got those
unknown prints from 'em too.

710
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,661
Another thing.

711
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,661
How 'bout workplace
injuries going back 40 years?

712
00:46:35,663 --> 00:46:37,702
Anybody lost an eye, black male,

713
00:46:37,704 --> 00:46:39,452
Washington and surrounding counties.

714
00:46:39,454 --> 00:46:40,871
That's kind of thin.

715
00:46:42,295 --> 00:46:44,002
Any priors from that list of employees

716
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:46,786
at the Hoyt Foods plant
where the mother worked?

717
00:46:46,788 --> 00:46:48,869
Cross-reference with
workplace injuries.

718
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:51,871
You heard your prosecutor's
going on Donahue?

719
00:46:53,871 --> 00:46:55,537
What the fuck is a Donahue?

720
00:46:56,561 --> 00:46:58,142
Is the caller there?

721
00:46:58,145 --> 00:46:59,910
- Yes.
- Go right ahead, please.

722
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:02,160
Mr. Kindt, in your experience,

723
00:47:02,162 --> 00:47:04,034
do you think that dangers to children

724
00:47:04,037 --> 00:47:05,827
have gotten worse over the years?

725
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:08,702
Well, I think children
are at considerable risk.

726
00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:11,026
I mean, i-it's no
secret that our values

727
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:13,118
have lowered significantly as a society,

728
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,827
and in that environment,

729
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:18,182
certain people feel
emboldened to prey on children.

730
00:47:18,185 --> 00:47:20,213
Dickhead wants attorney general.

731
00:47:20,216 --> 00:47:22,952
Now, this crime is our
number one priority.

732
00:47:22,954 --> 00:47:24,952
And we'll be back in just a minute.

733
00:47:24,954 --> 00:47:26,786
It's beyond the fuckin' pale.

734
00:47:26,788 --> 00:47:29,243
Forget it. We got a hit on the bike.

735
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:30,661
What? Who?

736
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:31,993
That Black Sunday teenager...

737
00:47:31,995 --> 00:47:34,204
What's his name? Freddy Burns?

738
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,160
"Don't call."

739
00:47:49,162 --> 00:47:52,452
Who the fuck do you think
you're talkin' to, motherfucker?

740
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:53,702
Huh?

741
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,329
Hello? Hello?

742
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,120
What do you want?

743
00:48:05,245 --> 00:48:06,869
My name is Amelia Reardon.

744
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:08,788
I taught Will English.

745
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,202
I picked up...

746
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:15,327
the children had things.

747
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,535
Uh...

748
00:48:16,537 --> 00:48:19,122
projects in the art room, other stuff.

749
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:21,625
- I said I'd bring it by.
- Right.

750
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:24,079
I forgot.

751
00:48:25,826 --> 00:48:26,954
Sorry.

752
00:48:29,871 --> 00:48:31,079
Thank you.

753
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,995
I-I know we don't know each other.

754
00:49:00,995 --> 00:49:03,995
I can't possibly imagine
what you're going through.

755
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:08,338
But if you ever need anything,

756
00:49:08,341 --> 00:49:10,454
please reach out to me.

757
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:14,120
Can I tell you something?

758
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:16,663
Amelia?

759
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,913
'Course.

760
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:24,253
I have got the soul of a whore.

761
00:49:32,412 --> 00:49:34,037
Lot of times...

762
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:37,160
we do things to hurt ourselves

763
00:49:37,162 --> 00:49:39,704
because we think we deserve to be hurt.

764
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:46,537
Whatever you think
you did or didn't do...

765
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:51,211
you don't deserve to suffer.

766
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:54,371
You don't need to be punished.

767
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:59,954
And those children wouldn't
want you doing that to yourself.

768
00:50:02,287 --> 00:50:04,746
I never knew my momma.

769
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:09,160
All I hoped,

770
00:50:09,162 --> 00:50:11,577
when I knew enough to
hope, was that them kids

771
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,913
might have a better
time of it than I did.

772
00:50:15,537 --> 00:50:18,371
But even then, I couldn't
make that easy on 'em.

773
00:50:21,412 --> 00:50:24,120
This wasn't a very happy home.

774
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:29,079
Children should laugh.

775
00:50:34,704 --> 00:50:37,454
There wasn't a lot of
laughter around here.

776
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,579
Every parent wants to do more.

777
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,193
But people make mistakes.

778
00:50:47,196 --> 00:50:48,571
Not like this.

779
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,954
Not like I did.

780
00:50:54,144 --> 00:50:56,269
What do you mean?

781
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,663
I ran around on Tom.

782
00:51:02,913 --> 00:51:04,496
I always run around.

783
00:51:05,953 --> 00:51:07,826
And sometimes,

784
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:10,160
in this house, I know that I...

785
00:51:10,162 --> 00:51:12,010
have the soul of a whore...

786
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,461
Sometimes I couldn't
breathe in this house.

787
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:21,952
And I didn't even argue
with that part of me.

788
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:24,494
Well, what kind of woman
hates the only things

789
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:26,496
that ever shown her love?

790
00:51:32,496 --> 00:51:35,371
I got a 38 revolver in my purse.

791
00:51:37,036 --> 00:51:39,451
It's just that last bit of courage...

792
00:51:39,454 --> 00:51:41,704
Where does that courage come from?

793
00:51:45,663 --> 00:51:47,160
I've never really thought of that

794
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:49,829
as courage, Mrs. Purcell.

795
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:11,704
I have done such terrible things.

796
00:52:14,204 --> 00:52:16,037
Oh, good God.

797
00:52:19,913 --> 00:52:21,746
Oh, God.

798
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:27,162
God, forgive me.

799
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:42,076
The policeman who's looking for Julie,

800
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,869
the black man, I know him a little.

801
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:47,993
You can trust him. He's a good man.

802
00:52:47,995 --> 00:52:52,190
If there's anything that
you haven't said or shared,

803
00:52:52,193 --> 00:52:55,702
you feel you might
need to, I'm just saying

804
00:52:55,704 --> 00:53:00,037
you can trust Detective Hays,
and you should talk to him.

805
00:53:00,995 --> 00:53:03,452
Should talk to him about...

806
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:05,577
what?

807
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:07,409
What's that supposed to mean?

808
00:53:07,412 --> 00:53:11,160
Nothing, I'm just saying
I think he's a good man,

809
00:53:11,162 --> 00:53:13,287
and I think you could talk to him.

810
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:16,744
Yeah.

811
00:53:16,746 --> 00:53:20,035
Of course. Of course.

812
00:53:20,037 --> 00:53:21,893
I open up to you,

813
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:25,035
and you're tryin' to work me.

814
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:27,077
Spillin' my guts.

815
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,786
Who are you takin' this to, huh?

816
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,327
Pretendin' you're listenin'.

817
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:34,744
Get a load of the white trash
whore you're tryin' to work

818
00:53:34,746 --> 00:53:37,827
to get good with your cop boyfriend!

819
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:39,482
I didn't mean anything. I'm sorry.

820
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:41,368
You got a lot of nerve,

821
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:43,952
you know, coming
around here, bringing me

822
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,911
this shit!

823
00:53:45,913 --> 00:53:47,705
You pickaninny bitch!
You get out of here!

824
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:48,952
I didn't mean anything...

825
00:53:48,954 --> 00:53:52,077
You snooty cunt! You get
the fuck out of my house!

826
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,788
You get out!

827
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,204
Hi there.

828
00:54:12,995 --> 00:54:15,952
You think when you're finished,
you could leave the cans for me?

829
00:54:15,954 --> 00:54:19,160
Why? How much you get for 'em?

830
00:54:19,162 --> 00:54:20,827
Two cents apiece.

831
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:24,577
We ought to get a part of that.

832
00:54:24,579 --> 00:54:27,871
I can deliver you a
penny next time we meet.

833
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,826
That's fair, I guess.

834
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:32,663
I'm almost done.

835
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:37,871
Motherfucker!

836
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:48,619
We got the drug store surveillance

837
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:51,077
going back seven days
before the robbery.

838
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,619
Haven't been able to go through it all.

839
00:54:54,621 --> 00:54:56,702
Pair of lawyers tryin' to see this?

840
00:54:56,704 --> 00:54:58,202
They subpoenaed us,

841
00:54:58,204 --> 00:55:00,619
but we're not in any
hurry to help 'em out.

842
00:55:00,621 --> 00:55:02,827
So far, we haven't shared much, really.

843
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:06,371
How 'bout a lady writer,
pretty good-lookin'?

844
00:55:07,746 --> 00:55:09,202
Share much with her?

845
00:55:09,204 --> 00:55:10,535
Right.

846
00:55:10,537 --> 00:55:11,869
Pretty black gal.

847
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,537
Said her ex-husband was police.

848
00:55:17,371 --> 00:55:20,204
I'll leave you to it.

849
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:26,746
Her prints were on
aisles five and seven.

850
00:55:37,912 --> 00:55:41,242
It's been five hours, and you're
not through a whole day yet.

851
00:55:41,245 --> 00:55:43,247
You gonna watch all this video at once?

852
00:55:44,245 --> 00:55:45,412
I don't know.

853
00:55:51,204 --> 00:55:52,454
'Ninety.

854
00:55:55,244 --> 00:55:57,630
'Ninety I found the video footage.

855
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:58,758
We...

856
00:56:00,745 --> 00:56:02,284
we learned about Julie Purcell.

857
00:56:02,287 --> 00:56:05,204
That group of street kids, was that...?

858
00:56:06,412 --> 00:56:07,746
Shut up.

859
00:56:09,002 --> 00:56:10,169
Shut up.

860
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,079
Was that when I...

861
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:18,271
Yes.

862
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:22,919
That's when I lost you at the Wal-Mart.

863
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:23,995
'Ninety.

864
00:56:25,203 --> 00:56:27,785
The fuckin' Wal-Mart.

865
00:56:27,788 --> 00:56:30,952
I don't think I ever did forgive myself,

866
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,077
losin' track of you like that,

867
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,243
the way I...

868
00:56:35,245 --> 00:56:38,287
yelled, and how sad that
made you and your brother.

869
00:56:42,162 --> 00:56:44,869
Did we ever find the brown car?

870
00:56:44,871 --> 00:56:46,372
Whose was it?

871
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,287
I felt...

872
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:55,243
I felt sometimes without knowing it,

873
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,496
I felt like maybe I...

874
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:03,454
like I made y'all sick.

875
00:57:04,496 --> 00:57:05,663
Like I...

876
00:57:07,913 --> 00:57:09,619
Like I poisoned you.

877
00:57:09,621 --> 00:57:12,494
I don't know,

878
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:13,744
may have.

879
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:24,229
I may be decidin' I don't want
to stay alive without your mother.

880
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,993
Shut up!

881
00:57:26,995 --> 00:57:29,663
You're nothin'! Shut up!

882
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,746
I need to tell Roland about O'Brien.

883
00:57:39,913 --> 00:57:41,329
Where's Roland?

884
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:44,435
When did we last...?

885
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:47,537
Talk to Roland?

886
00:57:57,913 --> 00:57:59,162
I'm sorry.

887
00:58:24,454 --> 00:58:27,744
Looks like a late-model
Lincoln or Mercury.

888
00:58:27,746 --> 00:58:29,744
Maybe a Chevy.

889
00:58:29,746 --> 00:58:32,577
Do they still make Mercury?

890
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:34,202
Hmm?

891
00:58:34,204 --> 00:58:36,204
Uh...

892
00:58:39,738 --> 00:58:42,237
Sedan. Dark color.

893
00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:45,371
Deep gray under the moon.

894
00:58:52,412 --> 00:58:54,577
See him again,

895
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:56,993
may mean somebody's watchin' you.

896
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:58,204
Uh-huh.

897
00:59:28,204 --> 00:59:29,663
Have a seat, pal.

898
00:59:45,329 --> 00:59:48,494
I know we a few weeks late here,

899
00:59:48,496 --> 00:59:51,212
but I want to wish you
a happy 18th birthday.

900
00:59:51,215 --> 00:59:53,713
All the fellows pitched in
and got you life imprisonment,

901
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:56,702
and a good possibility of
chokin' in the gas chamber,

902
00:59:56,704 --> 00:59:58,160
you fuckin' shit-heeled twerp.

903
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:00,494
- Wait, wait, wait.
- So, Freddy,

904
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,035
how polite we talked
to you the first time,

905
01:00:03,037 --> 01:00:06,619
that was all behind the small
possibility you might be innocent.

906
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:10,954
Ah, but now, that small
possibility's gone down the toilet.

907
01:00:18,454 --> 01:00:19,638
Your prints.

908
01:00:21,037 --> 01:00:22,788
I didn't do it.

909
01:00:24,328 --> 01:00:26,701
I did not do it, I swear to God.

910
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:28,952
In other words, you're sleepin',

911
01:00:28,954 --> 01:00:31,135
somebody secretly
removes your fingerprints

912
01:00:31,138 --> 01:00:32,970
and puts 'em on Will Purcell's bike.

913
01:00:32,973 --> 01:00:34,847
No, I'm not... I'm not
saying I wasn't ever on it.

914
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:37,243
I took his bike, all
right? He was a nerd, okay?

915
01:00:37,245 --> 01:00:39,160
He was coming around when
we were hanging out, and...

916
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:41,693
- His sister with him?
- No.

917
01:00:41,696 --> 01:00:44,194
He was looking for her. I
don't know, he was bugging us.

918
01:00:44,197 --> 01:00:46,034
And you what?

919
01:00:46,037 --> 01:00:47,346
And I had a few.

920
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:49,993
I feel... I feel terrible about this.

921
01:00:49,995 --> 01:00:52,661
I might have shoved him, chased him off.

922
01:00:52,663 --> 01:00:54,159
And played around on his bike.

923
01:00:54,162 --> 01:00:56,202
Where'd he go, you chased him off?

924
01:00:56,204 --> 01:00:57,663
He ran.

925
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,902
Into the woods.

926
01:00:59,905 --> 01:01:01,702
We already know all that.

927
01:01:01,704 --> 01:01:04,243
You haven't mentioned that
you were gone for a half hour

928
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:06,410
before your friends saw you.

929
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,661
Just an observation,

930
01:01:08,663 --> 01:01:10,410
I don't think you're well-liked.

931
01:01:10,412 --> 01:01:13,452
What'd you do in the
woods, those 30 minutes?

932
01:01:13,454 --> 01:01:15,702
Look, I don't know what happened to him.

933
01:01:15,704 --> 01:01:18,285
I chased him just for a
minute, but I was kind of drunk.

934
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:20,327
I lost my way real fast.
Like, 'fore I knew it,

935
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:22,911
there was trees all around, and
it took a while to find my way out.

936
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:24,369
What about the bike?

937
01:01:24,371 --> 01:01:26,118
It was where he dropped it.

938
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,854
I fooled around on it, that's all.

939
01:01:27,857 --> 01:01:30,202
I hit a tree, I bent
the wheel, and just...

940
01:01:30,204 --> 01:01:32,577
you know, I threw it back in the marsh.

941
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:34,661
And you're gonna risk 20 years in prison

942
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:36,410
saying the only thing you did

943
01:01:36,412 --> 01:01:39,410
was throw the kid off and take his bike?

944
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:41,869
Which, by the way, makes you a dirtbag.

945
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:44,993
Puttin' you in the
legal category screwed.

946
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:46,412
Prior to suckin' gas.

947
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:47,913
Call him a shit-heeled twerp again.

948
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,310
You shit-heeled twerp.

949
01:01:49,313 --> 01:01:52,743
Unless you can enlist us in
the Save Freddy Burns campaign,

950
01:01:52,746 --> 01:01:54,827
which can only achieve victory

951
01:01:54,829 --> 01:01:57,452
with your complete
disclosure of the truth

952
01:01:57,454 --> 01:01:59,160
in its entirety.

953
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:00,410
What?

954
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:02,661
He's sayin' tell the whole story,

955
01:02:02,663 --> 01:02:04,911
or train your ass to be an entrance.

956
01:02:04,913 --> 01:02:08,118
I know brothers inside
will tear your guts up,

957
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,746
fuckin' you stupid.

958
01:03:13,287 --> 01:03:14,704
God damn.

959
01:05:21,621 --> 01:05:22,829
Fuck.

960
01:05:33,355 --> 01:05:36,688
That prison rape's a real
go-to for you lately, huh?

961
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:40,786
Somethin' you want to tell me?

962
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:47,535
I think he's done.

963
01:05:47,537 --> 01:05:49,869
Oh no, oh no,

964
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:52,661
oh no, oh no, oh no!

965
01:05:52,663 --> 01:05:53,954
Never mind.

966
01:05:54,954 --> 01:05:57,118
You gonna go with this?

967
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,786
We sayin' it's him?

968
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,829
What are you thinkin'?

969
01:06:02,517 --> 01:06:03,932
That probably when he's 25,

970
01:06:03,935 --> 01:06:06,619
that kid's gonna be in jail.

971
01:06:06,621 --> 01:06:08,494
But not for this.

972
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:11,713
Detectives, a couple
of calls just came in.

973
01:06:11,716 --> 01:06:14,307
Something big's going down
at that trash guy's place.

974
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,410
West Finger.

975
01:06:15,412 --> 01:06:16,663
Men with guns, they said.

976
01:06:17,589 --> 01:06:19,005
Keep him here.

977
01:06:20,204 --> 01:06:21,952
Woodard!

978
01:06:21,954 --> 01:06:25,035
You was warned off them kids!

979
01:06:26,907 --> 01:06:28,204
Woodard!

980
01:06:32,954 --> 01:06:35,704
Woodard! Get out here!

981
01:06:41,621 --> 01:06:43,327
Woodard!

982
01:06:43,329 --> 01:06:46,143
We comin' in if you ain't comin' out!

983
01:06:46,146 --> 01:06:47,563
What's goin' on here?

984
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:50,577
Back up!

985
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:56,701
