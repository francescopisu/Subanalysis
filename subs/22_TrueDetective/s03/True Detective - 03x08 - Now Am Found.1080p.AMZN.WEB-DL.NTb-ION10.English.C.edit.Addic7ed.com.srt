1
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:09,406
A good man's dead 'cause we pushed him,

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,220
knowin' we didn't like him for it,

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,190
seeing how he was
takin' it. We did that.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,570
I'm thinking about Tom.
Thinking about that note.

5
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:20,781
You see him type anything?

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,460
So, you don't know nothin'?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,740
You just makin' your money,
and milkin' they pain.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,119
Looks like this man with one
eye gave Julie a doll in 1980.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,600
Do you know who these people are?

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,700
Two ghosts?

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,400
In 2012, two former Louisiana
State Police stopped

12
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:38,349
a serial killer
associated with some kind

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,360
of pedophile ring.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,750
I think what happened
to the Purcell children

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,900
was connected. With the cousin's help.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,240
I think their parents sold them off.

17
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:47,323
Hoyt. He got something for kids.

18
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,781
Now it's all gone! Done!
Whatever he knew, gone!

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,860
I need to know everything.

20
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,140
You gotta just trust me.

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,839
Detective Wayne Hays.

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,281
Edward Hoyt.

23

24
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,820
"What will become of you and me...

25
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:48,906
besides the photo and the memory?

26
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:54,114
This is the school in which we learn.

27
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:58,031
That time is the fire in which we burn.

28
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:03,865
What is the self amidst this blaze?

29
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:06,448
What am I now that I was then,

30
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:09,239
which I shall suffer and act again?

31
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:14,989
The children shouting
are bright as they run.

32
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,989
This is the school in which they learn.

33
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:22,531
What am I now that I was then?

34
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:25,520
May memory restore again and again...

35
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,280
the smallest color of the smallest day.

36
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:32,114
Time is the school in which we learn.

37
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,900
Time is the fire in which we burn."

38
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,230
Tourin' backroads?

39
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:57,947
I've seen 'em all.

40
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,823
Wanted privacy.

41
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,820
My hope being that we could
resolve this situation,

42
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,400
just the two of us.

43
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,989
What situation is that?

44
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,820
Don't do that.

45
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,320
You got in the car. You
know what this is about.

46
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,860
Ahh.

47
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,740
You were army, correct?

48
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:55,072
Recon.

49
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,364
Saw combat?

50
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,500
Many times.

51
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,573
Mm.

52
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,740
I was 7th Infantry.

53
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,800
Korea.

54
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,030
Chosin.

55
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:13,989
We took all the casualties so
the Marines could turn tail.

56
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,989
Thirty below zero.

57
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:20,364
Lost about 5,000 men.

58
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,250
I wouldn't imagine a man like you

59
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,780
meets a man like me
to trade war stories.

60
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,260
We're both soldiers.

61
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,280
You understand triage.

62
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:38,114
My man Harris James.

63
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:43,364
I want to know what happened to him.

64
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,573
Somethin' happen to him?

65
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,860
Spoke a couple days ago
up at your offices.

66
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,860
Don't start off by
lyin' to me, Mr. Hays.

67
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,823
The last time I saw him,
all we did was talk.

68
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:01,281
What'd you talk about?

69
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,781
Julie Purcell.

70
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:10,947
That's the girl went missin',
been in the news again recent.

71
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,364
What'd he say about her?

72
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,480
Can't talk details since it's ongoin'.

73
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,940
But you think Harris had
something to do with this girl?

74
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,823
Yes, sir, I believe he did.

75
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,947
Him and some others.

76
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:32,114
And you got no idea where he might be?

77
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:39,656
Might be he took off...
we got him worried.

78
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,448
Cameras all around corporate.

79
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:45,865
Access roads to the plant, everywhere.

80
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,615
Video of Harris's car
pullin' out of the gate.

81
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:51,947
Followed a minute later by your cruiser.

82
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:56,114
Just had to follow up
with some questions.

83
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,100
Man's a hell of a talker.

84
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,400
I give you chance after chance
to speak plainly to me,

85
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,800
and you keep throwin' shit in my face.

86
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,500
You know, sir...

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,340
I've always respected
you and your family.

88
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:18,656
Family.

89
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:22,698
That's what it's...

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,060
We only had the one.

91
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,865
Then Ellen got sick.

92
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:36,989
Now our child's gone too.

93
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,323
Somethin' you want to get
off your chest, sir?

94
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:52,364
Nobody's gonna hear it but us.

95
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:59,323
Mr. Hoyt.

96
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:02,323
You wanna tell me about Julie Purcell?

97
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,600
I don't know about Julie Purcell.

98
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,030
I'm in the fuckin' dark.

99
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,360
And, well...

100
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,440
I guess Harris didn't
talk enough after all.

101
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:21,197
We know about the kids' uncle.

102
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:23,698
The phone calls from the mother, Lucy.

103
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,360
Harris goin' to Vegas,
same time she OD'ed.

104
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:31,615
What I know?

105
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:35,281
Harris's work beeper, newest thing.

106
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,380
Has a little computer chip

107
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,780
keyed to our corporate system.

108
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:42,906
Includes a GPS signal.

109
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,000
And I have exact coordinates

110
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,906
where Harris last was
before it went dead.

111
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,156
Now, you bein' the law,

112
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:56,448
and me an interested party,

113
00:08:56,531 --> 00:08:59,180
should the two of us
go out to those woods,

114
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,489
see if we can't find Harris James?

115
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,860
And can you tell me, Mr. Hays...

116
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:08,031
are we gonna need fuckin' shovels?

117
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,031
You wanna swap confessions?

118
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,300
Just what is it you think I did?

119
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,690
That's why you bring me here.

120
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,573
So you could see how much I know.

121
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,823
Word is your investigation ended.

122
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,400
So we're done now.

123
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,615
They can do what they want
with the investigation.

124
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,573
That's not gonna stop me from lookin'.

125
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:32,615
You heard that hotline call.

126
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,000
Sounds like she doesn't
want to be found.

127
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:40,239
Maybe, Mr. Hays, best thing you
could do for that young woman

128
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,620
is leave her in peace.

129
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,040
Hard walkin' away knowin'
people mean to do her harm.

130
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,900
Well...

131
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:50,489
if the police ain't lookin' for her,

132
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,364
and you're not,

133
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:54,865
can't imagine anybody else'd be.

134
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,460
In fact, I can practically guarantee it.

135
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:02,323
Otherwise...

136
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,000
could be you're givin'
these people you mention

137
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,160
reason to find her.

138
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:09,531
See?

139
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:11,489
You don't drop it...

140
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,947
there's others can't either.

141
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:20,615
What happened?

142
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:23,448
Just tell me what happened!

143
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:25,489
I don't know what happened.

144
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,197
Do I look like a man
with fuckin' answers?!

145
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:31,531
Maybe one day I'll come see you.

146
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:35,989
Try havin' this talk again.

147
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:40,031
That you hopin' to get your balls back?

148
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:44,156
Or truly wantin' me to
regard you as a threat?

149
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,520
Think about what that'd
mean to your family...

150
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,780
you bein' a murderer and all.

151
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:53,698
Think about what it'd
mean for that girl.

152
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:59,239
Mr. Hays, do you want
me to feel threatened?

153
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,610
Ahh.

154
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:12,406
I'll let you find your own way back.

155
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,000
No way Harris woulda run off.

156
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,740
He loved his family.

157
00:11:26,823 --> 00:11:29,281
He was a wonderful father.

158
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm sorry 'bout that.

159
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,550
Wonderin' if maybe

160
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:37,698
you could speak toward an old
associate of your husband's.

161
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,323
Was a black man with one eye.

162
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:44,531
You ever see your husband
with someone like that?

163
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:46,156
Know who it might be?

164
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,899
Why are you asking?

165
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,580
We're trying to find a person

166
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,031
in connection with somethin' else.

167
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,573
Description come up a few times,

168
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,640
we can't get a name.

169
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:04,072
You sure you never saw a man like that?

170
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,740
A man like that came by the house.

171
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,240
Few weeks after Harris disappeared.

172
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,860
I don't like to think about it.

173
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:21,406
I was upset at the time.

174
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:24,573
He had, uh, one white eye and a scar.

175
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,364
He said he knew Harris.

176
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,040
He upset me.

177
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:29,781
Did he want somethin'?

178
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,040
He asked did I know if
Harris had found the girl.

179
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,330
I thought maybe... maybe he meant Harris

180
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,900
hadn't been faithful to me. I...

181
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,780
- I ran him off.
- Tell you his name?

182
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:45,406
He introduced himself
as Junius somethin'.

183
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,440
He upset me. I made him leave.

184
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,280
Junius.

185
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,360
You wanna bet that's Mr. June?

186
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,156
Makin' his name Junius Watts, maybe?

187
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,281
Worth a try.

188
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,020
I checked with a gal from state records

189
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,239
about the Hoyt place.

190
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,448
Been held in trust by the estate.

191
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,500
Nobody's livin' there.

192
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:19,489
So?

193
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,460
The old maid... the other day?

194
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:26,531
She talked about some
area they couldn't go.

195
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:30,197
I wanna look at it.

196
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,690
Well...

197
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,160
I guess you're lead
detective now, Lieutenant.

198
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,072
Goddamn right I am.

199
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:49,573
You couldn't help yourself, could you?

200
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,240
Sir?

201
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:54,698
"Purcell Investigation

202
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,550
Brought to False Conclusion.

203
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:59,531
Sources Say Case Far from Solved."

204
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,531
And what sources, Detective Hays,

205
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:06,823
could this headline be alluding to?

206
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:09,740
I-I didn't know...

207
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,400
We're lookin' at suin'
your little girlfriend.

208
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:15,740
I haven't read the papers.

209
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,600
"An anonymous source
in the investigation

210
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,440
insists that there are a number of clues

211
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,440
and suspicious facts of the Purcell case

212
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,900
that are being ignored in
favor of a hasty conviction

213
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,860
of the West Finger shooter."

214
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,560
Your man here, he's suggested
you got taken advantage.

215
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,280
Like you're too pussy-struck to
have known what she was doin'.

216
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:40,364
We think you owe the
department your own op-ed.

217
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:42,072
You're gonna write a statement

218
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,950
explaining that fragments of hearsay

219
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,531
were used without your consent,

220
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,531
facts were misrepresented,

221
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:49,865
that the woman who wrote this

222
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,360
did so without your cooperation.

223
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,340
I'm not much of a writer.

224
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,380
Well, we'll write it for you.

225
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,860
All you gotta do is sign.

226
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,400
- Purple! Think about it...
- Say "thank you," Wayne.

227
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Just make it right, man.

228
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,420
You got carried away. Walk it back now.

229
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,920
If I don't?

230
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,360
D Company needs a new
Public Information officer.

231
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:33,906
Administration.

232
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:37,823
You'll never work another
Major Crimes investigation.

233
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,440
Or... you could just quit.

234
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,000
You are one lucky mother.

235
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,480
You know how hard I had to work,

236
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,360
get them to give you another shot?

237
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,700
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

238
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,650
Hey, uh, listen to me.

239
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,573
You don't ever do any kind of
shit like this to me again.

240
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:18,989
I can't figure what you were thinking.

241
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,360
Hey.

242
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,340
What the hell are you doing?

243
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,800
You heard 'em. I'm done.

244
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,740
What?

245
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,900
I get them to give you a
pass, and y-you're quittin'?

246
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,380
- Oh, I'm not quittin'.
- You can't.

247
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:41,615
This is pride, Wayne, and
it's fuckin' you up.

248
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:43,947
Take a breath, count to ten,

249
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,460
and sign their goddamn paper.

250
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:50,323
- No.
- Public Information?

251
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:54,072
You hate the public. You're a detective.

252
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,900
You don't do shit like this.

253
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,850
Anything anybody mighta
said about you...

254
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,448
- What'd they say about me?
- That you're a professional.

255
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,660
I mean... they used to say that.

256
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,865
Got away from me, man. I was pissed off.

257
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,660
Didn't really think it through.

258
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,030
It's not like me, you're right.

259
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,599
OK. All right, there we go.

260
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,079
I mean, you just sign their statement,

261
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,080
and let's you and me move on.

262
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:30,781
Except then... I'd be burnin' her.

263
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,030
Callin' her a liar.

264
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,740
She didn't really do nothin' wrong.

265
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:38,989
She didn't lie,

266
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:41,698
and I'm not sayin' she did.

267
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,860
So what? This is your job.

268
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,400
Our job.

269
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,520
You're my partner.

270
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,030
That's it? You're just
gonna go be a typist?

271
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,640
Probably a lot less bullshit.

272
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,070
Couple years, maybe it all blows over.

273
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,620
I can outlast 'em.

274
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,072
What about us?

275
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:07,156
What you talkin' 'bout?

276
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:12,072
Grab a beer, go to a game.

277
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,460
Not like we're not gonna
see each other, man.

278
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,820
Suppose somebody catches us?

279
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:25,072
We're old and confused.

280
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,820
This is where they kept her.

281
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:38,698
This is where she ran away from.

282
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:56,156
Twenty-five years.

283
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,820
And we just...

284
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,197
All this...

285
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:09,114
All this goddamn time.

286
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:15,656
What the hell have I...

287
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,480
What the hell were you doin'?

288
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,940
Thought it was the right thing.

289
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,070
I had a family.

290
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,940
Now, that must be nice.

291
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,260
I find you burnin' your clothes
in the middle of the night.

292
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,640
This morning you disappear
after a phone call.

293
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,900
If you've got somebody else,

294
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:41,150
I can take it, just say so.

295
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,360
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

296
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,400
It's the case.

297
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,781
It was only ever the case.

298
00:23:52,656 --> 00:23:54,156
And it's over now.

299
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,600
What part of the case

300
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,040
made you burn your suit
at 3:00 in the morning?

301
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,610
The bad part.

302
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,947
Can I get you a... a drink?

303
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:14,947
I'd prefer a straight answer.

304
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,380
I know what you'd prefer.

305
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,860
But supposin' that answer
would be dangerous to you?

306
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,860
I'll take a hard truth
over a nice lie any day.

307
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,300
We never really established this,

308
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,940
'cause when we met...

309
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,656
I told you too much.

310
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,448
And then for a long time,
I wasn't really a cop.

311
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:46,323
But there are aspects of my job...

312
00:24:46,406 --> 00:24:49,781
things I've seen, things I know...

313
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,114
it's not for sharin'.

314
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:54,698
And this...

315
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:57,072
wouldn't do anything but cause harm.

316
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:01,114
Maybe it's not for you to decide

317
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,780
what's harmful or not for me.

318
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,080
Except I already did.

319
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,531
It's something we
should decide together.

320
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,989
No, we shouldn't.

321
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,448
And that is my whole point.

322
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:16,489
I might have a problem with that,

323
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,615
because this morning you said
you'd tell me everything.

324
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:21,698
That was a mistake.

325
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,300
And I just realized now...

326
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,580
that I want your approval,

327
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,690
and sometimes I do the wrong thing
because it's what you want.

328
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:40,197
I'd like to stop that goin' forward.

329
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:42,114
Are we going forward?

330
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:48,947
How do we with this big
secret between us?

331
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,860
Maybe that's what we're
really talkin' about.

332
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,880
There's always been this
big secret between us.

333
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:05,031
And it's that you and me...

334
00:26:05,114 --> 00:26:08,906
who we are together, this
marriage, our children...

335
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,740
it's all...

336
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,820
tied up in a...

337
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,656
dead boy and a missin' girl.

338
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:29,114
I'll take that drink now.

339
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,989
Bud and a shot of Jack.

340
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:10,989
- You got a problem, little man?
- No. No.

341
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,540
No, sir. No problem here.

342
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,840
Then put your fuckin'
eyes somewhere else.

343
00:27:21,865 --> 00:27:23,989
What it is...

344
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:26,531
I'm just a fan of romance.

345
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:28,531
May I ask you a question?

346
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,760
She look like that before
you rode her cross country?

347
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,650
What the fuck did you
say, you little midget?

348
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,698
See, I always wondered,

349
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:41,440
all this butt-faced
human pieces of garbage

350
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,280
out there walkin' the earth...

351
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:45,323
who's makin' 'em?

352
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,440
I mean, what kind of
Frankenstein monsters

353
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,656
are out there copulatin'
to create all these

354
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,560
hunks-of-shit people in the world?

355
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:55,656
Then I come in this bar,

356
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,980
here's you two, givin' me the answer

357
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,650
I've been lookin' for
my whole fuckin' life.

358
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:06,197
Unhh! Unh.

359
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:11,489
You done buckin', cowboy?

360
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:13,300
Thank God it was you hit me

361
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:15,989
instead of that woolly
mammoth you're fuckin'.

362
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,520
Last night, listening just now...

363
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,280
I've wondered: maybe we don't
really know each other.

364
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,760
Because you're right,

365
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,420
what you said about us
and the Purcell kids.

366
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:05,197
We never really talked
about it in that way.

367
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,220
What it meant for us.

368
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:11,656
But it's ten years later.

369
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,720
You write a story,

370
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,072
you get past the start...

371
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,640
it's important to know
how you want it to end.

372
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,110
You were pregnant yesterday.

373
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:30,989
And now Henry's nine and...

374
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,120
I blink, he'll be out the house.

375
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,360
If we get there, I don't wanna
wonder how it all happened.

376
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:42,364
I don't think one date night a month

377
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,615
is gonna get us where we need to be.

378
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm writing this sequel,
you're on Major Crimes...

379
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:56,031
They tanked the case again.

380
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,060
Same as '80.

381
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,780
I oughta quit.

382
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:07,114
I've thought you should
quit for ten years.

383
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:09,114
- Why?
- "Why?"

384
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:11,906
Why wouldn't I want you to quit?

385
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,740
I don't think you realize this, Wayne,

386
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,570
you could have been good
at just about anything.

387
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,680
But what you think you
are, it made you stuck.

388
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,400
I never went to college.

389
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,470
Or California.

390
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,480
I listened to my Ma.

391
00:30:34,573 --> 00:30:37,072
I was in the army, and then PD.

392
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,100
Maybe I...

393
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,200
got too good at doin' what I was told.

394
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,460
I always think about why you
said you joined the army.

395
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,190
Didn't have money for
school, or no job...

396
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,140
No, you told me...

397
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:02,260
you said you figured that if you died...

398
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,579
that your mom would be rich,

399
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,840
because the government
would give her $10,000,

400
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,740
and that's why you ended up joining.

401
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,280
Uh...

402
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,530
I think we both...

403
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,980
we want somethin', we
get real single-minded.

404
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,080
This new thing... that's
not why you write.

405
00:31:34,698 --> 00:31:37,580
It's all the work I've done, I
don't want to see it wasted...

406
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,110
But it's not you.

407
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,947
You wanna write your
real book, write it.

408
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:47,031
It'll be great.

409
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,480
I probably won't read it,
but it'll be beautiful.

410
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,480
And I think that...

411
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:59,489
I think maybe I should quit.

412
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,150
You should too.

413
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,220
I walk away, you walk away.

414
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:08,989
And...

415
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:10,823
let's put this thing down.

416
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,364
It's not ours.

417
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:18,239
And like you said, we're
past the beginning.

418
00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:21,031
You could really quit?

419
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,906
We'll both, together.

420
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,260
You go and write the books
you want to write, and...

421
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,480
I'm gonna...

422
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,698
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

423
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,440
But the smartest person I know

424
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:39,406
told me I'd be good at almost anything.

425
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,570
Get outta here.

426
00:33:41,573 --> 00:33:43,740
We're...

427
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:57,281
Come here, buddy.

428
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,980
Ahh...

429
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:19,656
Old gal I knew still works at the DMV

430
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,860
helped us out with an address.

431
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,570
Junius Watts.

432
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,460
Might be less crazy than I thought.

433
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:32,114
Don't get carried away.

434
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,780
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch!

435
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,531
I been waitin' on you all.

436
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,060
Since the night you saw my car.

437
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,340
Probably shouldn't'a drove off, but...

438
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,230
you had that baseball bat.

439
00:36:32,114 --> 00:36:33,906
Y'all here to kill me?

440
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:35,781
Walk back in the house.

441
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,610
This is you.

442
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,920
Usually if PD or state want a statement,

443
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,531
they'll just drop it by.

444
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,323
If we get an information request,

445
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,860
then we'll just connect it to you.

446
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:56,156
You all set, hon?

447
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,980
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

448
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,650
I worked with Mr. Hoyt on
his first chicken farm.

449
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,239
Been there since he started.

450
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,120
Lost the eye in a line
accident, one of the hooks.

451
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,156
That ain't the part of your
history we're interested in.

452
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,280
I was sayin'.

453
00:37:48,406 --> 00:37:50,906
After he expands,

454
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,400
he moves me to his place,

455
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,480
I started managin' his
household for him.

456
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,480
Him and Miss Ellen, they had Isabel.

457
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,480
Miss Ellen got sick.

458
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:07,197
I helped him raise his daughter.

459
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,360
Isabel. She was a delight.

460
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,170
She go to university
and meets a young man,

461
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,040
and they have a little baby girl. Mary.

462
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,440
They was happy. Mr. Hoyt, he happy.

463
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:27,364
Then there was the... the accident.

464
00:38:27,448 --> 00:38:30,698
Her husband and her daughter
skidded off a mountain

465
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,640
on their way to meet her at Bull Shoals.

466
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:36,281
She gets very, very sad.

467
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:38,281
Worse than sad.

468
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:41,072
Won't talk, won't leave the house.

469
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:44,364
Has to take medicine. Lithium.

470
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,520
This little girl I helped raise

471
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,690
was so sad she can't talk.

472
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:54,489
Mr. Hoyt, he can't stand
seein' her this way.

473
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:57,364
So he starts travelin' again.

474
00:38:57,448 --> 00:39:01,656
Then one night... she snuck off from me.

475
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,156
Took her car and smashed it all up.

476
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,281
This patrolman, Harris James,

477
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:10,489
he help us keep it quiet.

478
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,220
Then for the first time
in almost three years,

479
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,220
somethin' stirs her.

480
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,740
Employee picnic, '79.

481
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,760
She sees this family there
with this little girl,

482
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,823
- and she runs out and tries to grab her.
- Mary!

483
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:27,620
Hmph. Miss Isabel,

484
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,860
she keep talkin' about
that girl she saw.

485
00:39:30,947 --> 00:39:33,197
Sayin' she's just like Mary.

486
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:35,615
Says she wanna see her again.

487
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:39,020
So I take the mother Lucy aside,

488
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,600
back when she worked on the line,

489
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,500
and I talked to her about
maybe lettin' Miss Isabel

490
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,900
play with her daughter a bit.

491
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:46,865
She was good with that?

492
00:39:46,947 --> 00:39:50,364
Well, she say OK, but she want money.

493
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:53,180
And she wanted the little
girl's brother along,

494
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,540
keep an eye on her.

495
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,720
And that was OK.

496
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,615
Well, for a little while we meet 'em,

497
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,140
a little spot in the woods,

498
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,780
and we just played.

499
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,840
And Miss Isabel, she get
back to bein' her old self.

500
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,680
Except what?

501
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,860
Well, we had an idea.

502
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,260
Miss Isabel want to adopt the girl.

503
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,280
She have a better life,
we thought, and...

504
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,300
well, the father, we'd just
have to figure somethin' out.

505
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:24,156
But... eh...

506
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,920
Miss Isabel, she...

507
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,080
she confused.

508
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,320
She'd stopped takin' her
medicine, I-I didn't know.

509
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,300
She'd been callin' the girl
"Mary" since we arrive.

510
00:40:34,323 --> 00:40:38,364
I heard it. I oughta knowed
somethin' was too wrong.

511
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,240
Well, we's playin' hide-and-seek,

512
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,570
- and Will was off lookin' for us.
- Will!

513
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:45,197
Julie!

514
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,290
I guess Miss Isabel had other plans.

515
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,700
We have to go home.

516
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,448
No. Mary...

517
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,500
I told the girl her brother OK.

518
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,920
He just bump his head, that's all,

519
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,860
and he'd wake up soon.

520
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,700
But she said we can't leave him there.

521
00:41:07,823 --> 00:41:10,448
And she can't calm down.

522
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,320
So I brought him up to the cave.

523
00:41:18,072 --> 00:41:21,531
It was just... just a bad accident.

524
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,760
Mr. Hoyt, he don't know none
of this, 'cause he on safari.

525
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:29,448
So I call the man Harris James,

526
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,156
he help us out before.

527
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,170
When that Woodard man went crazy,

528
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,320
Harris brought that boy's
backpack up to his place,

529
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,520
and the girl's shirt.

530
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,570
What about the mother...

531
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:45,531
Lucy?

532
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,620
Harris talked to her.

533
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,480
Explained things, the accident.

534
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,823
Offered her a lot of money.

535
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:55,573
Showed her the best thing
was for her to take it

536
00:41:55,656 --> 00:41:57,740
and let Miss Isabel have Julie,

537
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,781
just like we talked about.

538
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,740
Only, it just happened this way...

539
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,580
The little one, Julie.

540
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,140
Time we get home, she
calm with everything,

541
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,740
no trouble.

542
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,820
She happy to be there.

543
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,999
We seen the girl is happy. She is.

544
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,860
- How's the castle?
- And for a time it was workin'.

545
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:22,031
- Couple years.
- Good.

546
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,860
The little one, she thinks
she's Isabel's daughter,

547
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,698
'cause Isabel's been
tellin' her stories.

548
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:32,364
I'm just tryin' to take
care of 'em best I can.

549
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:34,700
I swear, the little one was happy.

550
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,000
I thought she was happy.

551
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,040
I didn't realize till later
what'd been goin' on.

552
00:42:43,448 --> 00:42:45,250
She'd been feedin' that little girl

553
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,380
lithium since she was ten.

554
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,050
That was why the girl
didn't have no problems

555
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,720
once we left Devil's Den.

556
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,620
Musta started then.

557
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,070
That's why she wasn't sure
about her own history.

558
00:42:57,156 --> 00:42:59,615
She'd been drugged half her life,

559
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,240
told some fucked-up fairy
tale by this woman.

560
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:07,698
And Miss Isabel was gettin'
sicker and sicker.

561
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,690
The girl is gettin'
more and more confused.

562
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,860
Then she growed up. She wants to leave.

563
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,640
She asks questions...
memories, her brother.

564
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,239
I want to help her.

565
00:43:18,323 --> 00:43:20,656
You helped her run away.

566
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,156
Yeah.

567
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,660
I make sure that the door is unlocked

568
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,110
and Miss Isabel was in her bath.

569
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:33,239
And I gave her a map how to
get to a place I had nearby.

570
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,906
But she never showed.

571
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:42,364
And I was lookin' for her ever since.

572
00:43:42,448 --> 00:43:44,947
Tryin' to save what I could.

573
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,281
That's real heroic of ya...

574
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,100
you cyclops motherfucker.

575
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:52,865
What happened to Isabel?

576
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,240
After the girl run off...

577
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,989
she had another break.

578
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,900
She put on her weddin' dress...

579
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,197
she took all her pills...

580
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,560
she go to sleep

581
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,440
and never wakes up.

582
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,190
Did ya ever find her?

583
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,020
'Ninety-seven.

584
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,320
I'd been passin' Julie's
picture around for ten years.

585
00:44:28,406 --> 00:44:31,989
This runaway girl tells
me about this shelter

586
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,989
nuns in Fort Smith run.

587
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:39,031
The girl says she saw Julie
workin' there at the convent,

588
00:44:39,114 --> 00:44:41,448
and they say her name is Mary,

589
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,573
which I knew it must be her.

590
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,531
Mary July.

591
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,220
"Like summertime," she said.

592
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:51,114
She didn't have any ID.

593
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:56,489
She stayed for three and a half years.

594
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:01,060
First getting help, then helping others.

595
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:05,615
She'd been in bad shape
when she arrived.

596
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:10,420
She had what's known as
disassociation issues.

597
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,740
I believe she found a home here.

598
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:16,531
But her time outside,

599
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:19,020
things she'd done...

600
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:24,440
She had HIV, it turned out.

601
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,650
We took care of her in the infirmary

602
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,610
when she got sick.

603
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,780
A few months, she was gone.

604
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,280
I was too late.

605
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,260
Something she'd done
out there on her own

606
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,580
got her real sick.

607
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:56,920
And I told her... I told
her that I would meet her.

608
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,980
I drew her a map.

609
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:05,114
But she wasn't there.

610
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,740
It's always too late...

611
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,180
whatever we do.

612
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,530
That's why I's sittin'
outside your house.

613
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,820
I was just tryin' to get up the nerve.

614
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,560
Tryin' to tell you what happened.

615
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,720
So... you can kill me or take me in.

616
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,100
I want it.

617
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:46,364
I don't wanna live with this no more.

618
00:46:50,031 --> 00:46:51,364
Take me in.

619
00:46:54,698 --> 00:46:57,531
We don't have the authority.

620
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,906
You don't wanna live with it...

621
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:12,281
fuckin' don't.

622
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,060
Hey!

623
00:47:17,156 --> 00:47:19,281
Y'all come back here!

624
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,160
Y'all punish me!

625
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,180
I need y'all to punish me!

626
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,900
Y'all punish me!

627
00:47:32,156 --> 00:47:34,406
Your name was Julie Purcell.

628
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,230
I'm sorry I didn't do
a better job for ya.

629
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,570
I'm real, real sorry for that, miss.

630
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,080
Failure was mine.

631
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,230
You deserved better than this.

632
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,280
Better than me.

633
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,070
Oh!

634
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,140
- Sorry, mister.
- There you are.

635
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,300
All right, that's enough
runnin' around, Lucy.

636
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,740
Why don't you go ahead
and jump in the truck.

637
00:48:25,823 --> 00:48:27,406
OK.

638
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,900
I'm sorry 'bout that. She
likes to run around.

639
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,960
No problem.

640
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,110
You been takin' care of the place long?

641
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,698
Oh, yeah. My dad started the business,

642
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,240
and he used to do the convent for free.

643
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,698
And I kept doin' the same.

644
00:48:42,781 --> 00:48:44,615
That's nice of you.

645
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,900
Y'all have a good day.

646
00:48:47,031 --> 00:48:49,489
Thank you, sir.

647
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,114
You too.

648
00:48:51,197 --> 00:48:53,531
All right, Lucy, let's
get your seat belt on.

649
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,840
That's enough.

650
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,380
I'll get the rest tomorrow.

651
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:17,656
Yeah.

652
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,320
I oughta throw it out now.

653
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,120
But it's all hers.

654
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,000
Maybe we'll write a book about it.

655
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,615
Have to keep startin' over.

656
00:49:39,197 --> 00:49:41,573
We got an ending, I guess.

657
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,500
But I don't, uh...

658
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,020
Hmm.

659
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,620
Do you feel like any kinda closure?

660
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,030
I don't.

661
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,440
Me neither.

662
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,070
Talkin' to your boy.

663
00:50:04,156 --> 00:50:07,656
I's been wantin' to get closer to town,

664
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,781
and we were thinkin', uh...

665
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:15,960
How'd you feel, me crashin' here
with you a few nights a week?

666
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,190
I guess so.

667
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,960
I keep a neat house,
though. I'm just sayin'.

668
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,960
I'll keep the dogs out back.

669
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:35,072
Hey.

670
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:37,531
Your little girl's comin' here tomorrow.

671
00:50:37,615 --> 00:50:40,406
Oh, that's right. I remember.

672
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,660
Henry mentioned you're
all havin' dinner.

673
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,980
Invited me over.

674
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,800
Good. You should come.

675
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,480
OK.

676
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,980
You be all right tonight, buddy?

677
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,060
I'm good, brother. I'm good.

678
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,030
OK.

679
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,580
Hi.

680
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,610
Hey. Tell me what we're doing.

681
00:52:11,698 --> 00:52:13,989
You're not talkin' to me,

682
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:16,239
don't return my calls.

683
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,900
We're playing games now?

684
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,120
I don't play.

685
00:52:25,573 --> 00:52:27,865
Is this about what I wrote?

686
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,900
You read it. You... encouraged me.

687
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:36,823
What's going on with you? What happened?

688
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,880
Wait right here a minute.

689
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,620
That's all your stuff.

690
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,120
That's how you say

691
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,010
"I don't think we should
see each other anymore"?

692
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,030
What the hell is wrong with you?

693
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,340
You don't like how I am,
get out of my house.

694
00:53:24,197 --> 00:53:26,865
All right, give it to me then.

695
00:53:26,947 --> 00:53:28,970
I want a... clear picture

696
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,960
of who I've been spending time with.

697
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,980
Clear picture is, I don't
wanna see you anymore.

698
00:53:36,156 --> 00:53:39,072
And I'm not the asshole here.

699
00:53:39,156 --> 00:53:40,947
You're the asshole.

700
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,150
Me?

701
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,940
- How?
- You used me.

702
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:49,531
Fuckin' around with me so you could
hear what the police are doin'.

703
00:53:49,615 --> 00:53:51,323
Like you're better than me. Right?

704
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,560
When I landed back in the States,

705
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,240
some high yellow bitch like
you called me a baby killer.

706
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,620
I'm sorry that happened...

707
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,197
Shit, you're whiter than my partner.

708
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,740
Former partner.

709
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,980
What's the matter with
you? What happened?

710
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,947
I'm fucked's what happened!

711
00:54:08,031 --> 00:54:12,323
Twelve years on the job, and
I'm a fuckin' secretary now.

712
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,920
So you got in trouble. What did they...

713
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,070
Is that why you're doing this?

714
00:54:18,156 --> 00:54:21,573
I'm tryin' to pull my head out
my ass, regards to you. You...

715
00:54:21,656 --> 00:54:24,600
I don't know. Maybe you
didn't mean it all the way,

716
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,560
maybe it just happened,
but you was workin' me.

717
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,420
Always askin' questions,
always talkin' about the case.

718
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,240
That's not what I did. You
know that's not what I did.

719
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,156
No, I don't!

720
00:54:35,865 --> 00:54:38,740
But I just about decided...

721
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,979
that you don't know

722
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,800
what you're really up to
most of the time, do you?

723
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,280
Bein' a good-lookin' woman
like you are, I mean.

724
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,190
People don't really expect
you to take responsibility.

725
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,000
You're just like a pretty bird,

726
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,070
flyin' around, shittin'
on people's heads.

727
00:54:55,156 --> 00:54:57,114
I don't need one of them.

728
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:00,700
I was doin' real good without
no head-shittin' birds in here.

729
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,140
You're a mean drunk.

730
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,690
But it's good to see how
weak you really are.

731
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,070
You've got a badge and a gun,

732
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,531
couple of other things

733
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,300
that you learned from watching movies.

734
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,190
But there's nothing here.

735
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,180
They wanted me to burn you down.

736
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,030
Sign a statement sayin' you were lyin'.

737
00:55:30,114 --> 00:55:31,920
That you took pieces of what you heard

738
00:55:31,947 --> 00:55:34,239
and made up all that shit you wrote.

739
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,160
You should.

740
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:40,406
I don't want you in trouble.

741
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:43,448
I don't want anything from you, ever.

742
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:46,989
Go ahead, sign their statement.

743
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,260
I'm gonna be fine.

744
00:55:54,197 --> 00:55:55,615
I don't need the rest.

745
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,960
I don't want this shit in my house!

746
00:56:59,656 --> 00:57:02,573
"Among the children who knew her,

747
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,020
a ten-year-old named Mike Ardoin

748
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,000
seemed to take Julie's
disappearance hardest.

749
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,140
I knew Mike to be a shy, artistic boy,

750
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,040
and he often played with Julie,

751
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,300
or at least sought out her company.

752
00:57:15,323 --> 00:57:18,947
His father ran a small
lawn servicing business,

753
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:21,080
and when he spoke about Julie,

754
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,070
the boy's lip trembled
and his eyes flooded.

755
00:57:24,156 --> 00:57:27,323
My attempts at comfort were
completely insufficient,

756
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,420
but I tried to let him
talk about his feelings.

757
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,360
He started crying.

758
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,720
He said he always thought
he'd marry Julie

759
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,531
when he grew up."

760
00:57:49,573 --> 00:57:51,656
"Tell me a story.

761
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,540
Make it a story of great
distances, and starlight."

762
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,560
No. Please.

763
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,650
Please.

764
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,760
What if the ending isn't
really the ending at all?

765
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,906
What if Julie did find a
life at that convent?

766
00:58:23,989 --> 00:58:26,520
Friendship, love.

767
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,740
And what if that little boy
who loved her so much,

768
00:58:29,823 --> 00:58:33,170
that little boy whose
daddy, and later himself,

769
00:58:33,197 --> 00:58:35,656
took care of the yard at that convent?

770
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,960
What if he recognized her?

771
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,250
"'If you knew time as well
as I do,' said the Hatter,

772
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,030
you wouldn't talk about wasting it.'"

773
00:58:46,114 --> 00:58:49,656
What if he knew her...

774
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,114
even if she didn't know herself?

775
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,760
And what if those nuns
who cared about her,

776
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,031
those women who knew
she'd had a hard life...

777
00:59:04,114 --> 00:59:07,573
they knew bad people
were looking for her?

778
00:59:07,656 --> 00:59:10,072
What if they wanted to protect her?

779
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,440
Protect her how?

780
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,400
The only way they could...

781
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,400
by telling a story.

782
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,320
And...

783
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,600
And then...

784
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,940
Oh!

785
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,280
Sorry, Mister.

786
00:59:38,448 --> 00:59:40,740
The little girl...

787
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,460
that was her.

788
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,580
Oh... my God.

789
00:59:49,364 --> 00:59:52,239
What if there's another story?

790
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:55,323
What if something went unbroken?

791
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,980
All this life, all this loss,

792
01:00:02,072 --> 01:00:04,250
what if it was really one long story

793
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:06,489
that just kept going and going

794
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,840
until it healed itself?

795
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,680
Wouldn't that be a story worth telling?

796
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,030
Wouldn't that be a story worth hearing?

797
01:00:41,698 --> 01:00:43,072
Information.

798
01:00:43,156 --> 01:00:45,531
I need a address for Northwest Arkansas.

799
01:00:47,698 --> 01:00:49,947
Uh, Mike, uh, Ardoin.

800
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:52,560
Um, that's, um...

801
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,110
um...

802
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:58,239
A-R-D...

803
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,615
O-I-N.

804
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,531
Ardoin Landscaping.

805
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,220
Just a moment.

806
01:02:40,781 --> 01:02:43,489
Pop, what's up? I was
about to come get you.

807
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:48,220
I, uh...

808
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,489
Henry... uh...

809
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,280
- think I'm lost.
- What do you mean?

810
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,030
You on foot?

811
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,650
Uh...

812
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,323
I'm in my car.

813
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,360
I don't know where I am.
I don't recognize it.

814
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,980
Dad, Becca came in,

815
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,700
you were comin' here for dinner.

816
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,560
And I'm tellin' ya, I
don't know where I am!

817
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:13,820
Hey, hey, hey, it's gonna
be all right, Pop.

818
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,260
We'll come and get you.
Just take a beat.

819
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,340
Is there someone around you
can ask where you are?

820
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:22,906
You see anybody around?

821
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,860
Mom.

822
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,300
I'm sorry to bother you, miss.

823
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:44,573
I, uh...

824
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,800
I have this, uh...

825
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,440
I'm sorry, uh, I'm lost.

826
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,740
Can you just tell me where I'm at?

827
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:01,420
Oh, of course. You're in Greenland.

828
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,780
This is Allegra Lane.

829
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,160
Uh...

830
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,520
Allegra Lane, in-in Greenland.

831
01:04:14,573 --> 01:04:18,947
House at, uh... 1-2-0-8.

832
01:04:19,031 --> 01:04:21,114
Greenland? What are you doin' out there?

833
01:04:21,197 --> 01:04:23,615
I don't know. I...

834
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,330
I was... I don't know.

835
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,800
All right, it's OK.
Stay at your car, Dad.

836
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:31,880
We're comin' to get you, all right?

837
01:04:31,906 --> 01:04:33,740
Keep your phone handy.

838
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:34,906
OK.

839
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,570
Thank you, son.

840
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,650
Yeah...

841
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,300
my son's comin' to get me.

842
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,900
I, uh...

843
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:48,531
have this condition.

844
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:50,520
I forget things, and...

845
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,030
Thank you. Thanks for your help.

846
01:04:55,114 --> 01:04:58,114
Glad I was out here to help.

847
01:05:00,573 --> 01:05:02,930
Uh, would you like
some water or anything

848
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,320
while you wait for your son?

849
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:11,560
Actually... if it truly
wouldn't be any trouble,

850
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,250
I'd be grateful for some water.

851
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,740
Throat's dry.

852
01:05:15,865 --> 01:05:17,865
Lucy, will you get this
man some water, please?

853
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:18,989
Yes, ma'am.

854
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,610
Uh...

855
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,320
Beautiful day, isn't it?

856
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,860
Yeah.

857
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,940
Sure is.

858
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,820
Oh. Thank you, miss.

859
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,323
You're welcome.

860
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,440
Well, uh...

861
01:06:03,531 --> 01:06:06,197
I-I'll let you get back to it.

862
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,800
Thank you much.

863
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,740
You're welcome, sir.

864
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,240
Hey.

865
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,300
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

866
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,900
It's OK.

867
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,640
Dad?

868
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,440
Hey, Dad!

869
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,072
Hey.

870
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,740
It's different than I remember.

871
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,440
I'm surprised, it feels different.

872
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,610
Maybe you could stay longer.

873
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,400
Maybe.

874
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,980
Did I lose you?

875
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,530
No. No, Dad.

876
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:45,800
How could you?

877
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,780
I don't know.

878
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,980
Seems like I'm losin'
the hour and the day.

879
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,360
Oh, I sure missed you.

880
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,690
I miss you too, Dad.

881
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,980
I miss you right now.

882
01:08:08,406 --> 01:08:11,156
I haven't... I haven't really...

883
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,920
I don't...

884
01:08:26,197 --> 01:08:27,906
Had this in my pocket.

885
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,197
I... don't know, uh...

886
01:08:31,865 --> 01:08:33,740
Eh.

887
01:08:33,823 --> 01:08:35,615
It's nothin'.

888
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:39,020
Go play with your grandkids, Pop.

889
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:51,040
Throw Papa the ball.

890
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,031
Wait. OK...

891
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:06,900
- Oh, he did!
- It's what you call a slow break.

892
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,947
Uh-oh.

893
01:09:10,031 --> 01:09:11,865
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

894
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,320
You doin' all right?

895
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,656
Yeah, yeah, man, how are you?

896
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,197
Still upright, baby.

897
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:45,989
Real glad to see you.

898
01:09:46,072 --> 01:09:49,239
Glad to see you too, pal.

899
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:50,780
Mr. West,

900
01:09:50,906 --> 01:09:52,720
this is my wife, Heather.

901
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,531
- Hello.
- Welcome.

902
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,120
Oh. Thank you, ma'am.

903
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,070
Come on, hurry up!

904
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,197
Come on!

905
01:10:56,281 --> 01:10:57,656
Thank you.

906
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,520
This what you settled
on doin' with yourself?

907
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:21,080
I don't recall you mentionin'
time in the armed forces.

908
01:11:23,573 --> 01:11:26,989
I don't let people talk
to me the way you did.

909
01:11:27,072 --> 01:11:29,989
A few women, no men at all.

910
01:11:32,197 --> 01:11:35,197
- OK.
- I want you to understand that.

911
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,600
You don't strike me as tolerant
of that sort of behavior.

912
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,615
No.

913
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:46,520
That was the point, wasn't it?

914
01:11:52,323 --> 01:11:56,323
But I'm trying to remember that a
few weeks ago your friend was shot

915
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:58,239
and you almost died.

916
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,190
You want a do-over?

917
01:12:13,656 --> 01:12:16,656
I guess I want to know if you meant it.

918
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,947
If you meant what you said.

919
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:24,240
I want to know if you want us to stop.

920
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,660
That's all.

921
01:12:29,947 --> 01:12:31,573
I don't know.

922
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,200
Wayne, what do you want?

923
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,380
You want to yell at me again?
You want me to tell at you?

924
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,360
No.

925
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:49,323
I'm sorry for what I said to you.

926
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:53,600
I-I haven't been myself.

927
01:12:57,906 --> 01:12:59,989
You want me to leave?

928
01:13:05,865 --> 01:13:07,573
You want me to stay?

929
01:13:09,698 --> 01:13:11,698
I don't know.

930
01:13:11,781 --> 01:13:13,781
You're gonna have to decide.

931
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,610
I, uh...

932
01:13:21,323 --> 01:13:23,072
I'm not myself.

933
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,680
I don't know. I don't like this.

934
01:13:28,656 --> 01:13:30,114
But I want...

935
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,980
I think I wanna marry you.

936
01:13:37,865 --> 01:13:40,323
I didn't think that'd happen for me.

937
01:13:42,323 --> 01:13:45,197
I didn't let myself...

938
01:13:45,281 --> 01:13:48,072
I didn't expect this.

939
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,520
You.

940
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:58,281
And how would you make that happen?

941
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:03,239
Guess, uh...

942
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:05,781
Guess I should sober up, for a start.

943
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,364
For a start, yeah.

944
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,900
I mean it.

945
01:14:19,906 --> 01:14:22,364
Then let's get you home.

946
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:31,740
You can think about how
you're gonna propose.

947
01:14:35,698 --> 01:14:38,406
I can think about if I'm gonna accept.

948
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,700
I'll do it.

949
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:48,540
Get on my knees, with a
ring and everything.

950
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,260
I ain't messin' with you. I don't play.

951
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,400
