1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,320
Africa.

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,520
In the four years of making this series,
we've been to some astonishing places

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,560
and seen animals behaving in ways
that have never been filmed before.

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,360

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,280
But Africa has another story to tell.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,840
The wildlife of this continent has seen
more changes in the last 50 years

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,480
than it has in the last two million.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,680
Changing landscapes and changing climate.

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,440
Today's animals are facing
unprecedented challenges

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,680
whilst, around them,
Africa's human population

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,000
is growing at nearly
double the global rate.

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,720

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,000
There is an increasing urgency
to understand

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,120
and, crucially, to conserve
the wildlife of this great continent.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,240

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,920
Today, there is a new generation
of naturalists and scientists

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,520
who're fighting to save the wild places
and the animals that live in them.

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,000
One, two, three!

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,840
This is the greatest
wildlife continent on the planet.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,880
And what happens here
is relevant to us all.

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,640
So, what is the future of wild Africa?

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,680
This animal has become the world's
number one target for poachers.

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,040
Its kind has been hunted
almost to the point of extinction.

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,040
It's now so rare that this individual
is watched over day and night.

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,160
This is the black rhinoceros.

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,320
And black rhinoceros are

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,560
notorious for being rather grumpy
and suddenly charging.

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,760
But he is in great danger...

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,320
because he has, on his nose...

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,280
that horn...

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,560
which is worth its weight in gold.

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,200

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,440
The demand for rhino horn has rocketed.

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,240
There has been a 3,000% increase in poaching

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,120
just in the last five years.

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,320

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,760
Today, powdered rhino horn
can fetch up to $65,000 a kilo.

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,600
Rhinos are a lucrative target
for organised crime.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,960
In Chinese medicine, it's believed that
rhino horn can reduce fever.

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,000
And some Vietnamese sell it
as a cure for everything,

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,160
from cancer to hangovers.

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,000
It's made of keratin,
the same substance as hair and nail

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,640
and it has no clinically proven
medicinal value.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800

45
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,480
But it has made every black rhino
in Africa a target.

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,600
They've all been killed
in Uganda and Rwanda,

47
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,440
and there are only
around 600 left here, in Kenya.

48
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,800
But these are not poachers.

49
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,360
These are protectors.

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,560

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,640

52
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,320
And that protection is overseen
by rhino expert Dr. Matthew Mutinda,

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,440
one of the Kenya Wildlife Services' top vets.

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,480
Black rhinos are critically endangered.

55
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,800
And that is what we at Lewa Wildlife
Conservancy, we're trying to do.

56
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Save the animal, provide a safe
and secure sanctuary,

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,320
where the animal can breed
and live freely.

58
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,040
There aren't many true wild rhinos left in Africa.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,080
Most, like these,
in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,120
are under armed guard.

61
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,720
This young female has reached the age
when Matthew must do some health checks,

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,880
including taking blood samples.

63
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,760
This will help deter
poachers and traffickers,

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,000
as DNA in illegally traded rhino horn
can be tracked back to its origin.

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,120
If you have to do
anaesthesia in the wild,

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,680
you will expect some degree of risk.

67
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,480
This female has reacted
badly to the anaesthetic.

68
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,680

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,040
She's not breathing. It's a rare
and extremely serious situation.

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,280
He knows that the next few minutes are crucial.

71
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,640

72
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,280
And when an animal is this big,

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,080
there's only one way to get the heart
going again when you're out in the bush.

74
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,280
Thanks to Matthew's quick thinking,

75
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,120
they can hear that she's breathing again.

76
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,480

77
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,000
They've got to get her back on her feet.

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600

79
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,600
Not surprisingly, she's disorientated.

80
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,760

81
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,440

82
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
Mission accomplished.

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,160
It's been an ordeal,

84
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
but now this rhino can be tracked
and protected for the rest of her life.

85
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,400
Within minutes, she's grazing peacefully
again, with her mother.

86
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,960
It may seem heartless
to treat an animal like that,

87
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,520
but we have to keep tabs on them
and be able to identify individuals.

88
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
They're in great danger.

89
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,640
Even now, on average, one rhino is
killed by poachers every day in Africa.

90
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,240
There are so few black rhino
left in Kenya

91
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,160
that we're getting to know
each individual.

92
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,600
But this is still a creature
that can surprise us.

93
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,280
Previously, it was widely believed
that black rhinos

94
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,680
were largely solitary creatures.

95
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,640
Here, in the Kalahari,
a starlight camera reveals

96
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,720
that they may be much more sociable
than many thought.

97
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,640

98
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,720
This waterhole gathering
is an enchanting window into the past.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,720
Early explorers reported seeing
a rhino behind every bush.

100
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,680
Before the invention of the gun

101
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,480
there were probably
hundreds of thousands of rhinos

102
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,920
across the continent.

103
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,880
The people protecting rhinos in Africa

104
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,080
are striving to ensure that we'll
still be able to witness

105
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,080
wonderful scenes like this
in 50 years' time.

106
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,080
Right across Africa,
conservationists have realised

107
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,480
that if we want to save our big animals,
then now is the time.

108
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,200
The human population of the continent
has just exceeded one billion,

109
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,520
and many wild animals are being hunted
commercially for food.

110
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Some legally.

111
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,000
But many illegally.

112
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,200

113
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,080
Wildlife meat is often sold
as goat or beef.

114
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,600
The amount is astonishing.

115
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,160
Millions of tonnes are eaten
across Africa every year.

116
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,360
At this rate, some species are almost
certainly heading for extinction.

117
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,960
But commercial hunting
is not just affecting the grazers.

118
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,400
As the prey decreases,
it's affecting the predators, too.

119
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,040
Fifty years ago, there were about
half a million lions in Africa.

120
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,000
Today, there are less than 30,000.

121
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,400
But in one particular part of Africa,

122
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,440
things are improving
in a quite extraordinary way.

123
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,960
These hunters have become
part of a new and unlikely alliance.

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,840
In recent years, hungry lions have
increasingly been killing livestock.

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680

126
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,520
One group of traditional Maasai have
reacted in a very untraditional way.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,200
The Maasai are cattle herders
who don't eat wild animals.

128
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,040
But when lions attack their herds,
they've always retaliated.

129
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
Maasai and lions are ancient adversaries.

130
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,160
A lion hunt is still a rite of passage
for young Maasai warriors

131
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,440
like Olubi Lairumbe.

132
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,200

133
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,320
For me and any Maasai,

134
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,840
killing a lion is the ultimate fulfilment

135
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,680
of a truly accomplished Maasai.

136
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,400
Nothing compares to that.

137
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,520
There is nobody who knows
more about living alongside lions

138
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,200
than the Maasai themselves.

139
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,400
I met Olubi and some of
the other warriors in his village

140
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,680
to find out about their relationship
with the local pride.

141
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,480
How many lions are there around here?

142
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,040

143
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,760
Around here there are about a hundred.

144
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
- Oh.
- Yeah.

145
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,880
So they all have names?

146
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,520
Every single lion has a name.
A Maasai name.

147
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,880
And when you see a lion,
do you know how it's going to behave?

148
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,840
It depends on the lion.

149
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,400
For a Maasai warrior,
lions are nothing to be scared of.

150
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,280
If I saw a lion...
A lion would be likely to attack me.

151
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,200
Only if you threaten it.

152
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,200
Hmm, well,
I hope the next lion knows that.

153
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,240

154
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,480
Olubi killed his first
lion when he was just 17,

155
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,360
after it attacked his cattle.

156
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,840
Unfortunately,
the lion turned out to be pregnant.

157
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,120
And that led to a remarkable turnaround.

158
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,800

159
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,480
The Maasai respect all living things.

160
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,720
And I began to feel guilty
about the lion that I had killed.

161
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,080
In the end, I came to admire the lions.

162
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,680
Olubi had a dramatic change of heart.

163
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,000
He turned his back on hundreds of years
of Maasai tradition.

164
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,360
Along with some other warriors,
Olubi became a lion guardian.

165
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,720
Instead of hunting lions,
Olubi would be protecting them.

166
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,960
He teamed up with Stephanie Dolrenry,
who helped pioneer the project.

167
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,880

168
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,160
Just by respecting their traditions

169
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,360
and also bringing in
their ecological knowledge,

170
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,080
it's been hugely successful.

171
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,840
They know their areas,
they know how to track lions,

172
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,320
they've been doing it
for generation after generation.

173
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,000
They know how to track them,
they know how to hunt them,

174
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,160
they know how to find them.

175
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,960
This is only a small-scale project.

176
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
But with lion numbers
as low as they are,

177
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,520
they need all the help they can get.

178
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,920
Olubi is tracking radio-collared lions.

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,840
He's able to warn villagers
to move their cattle

180
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,040
when the pride is in the area.

181
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,760
And so they're avoiding conflict.

182
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,680
No lions have been killed
in the immediate area

183
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
since the project began.

184
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,960
By combining the science,
both ancient and contemporary,

185
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,200
they're beginning to make
a real difference.

186
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,680
There's so much to be learned.

187
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,240
I feel I bring in modern technology,
modern knowledge,

188
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,160
and, in return, they teach us
about the environment,

189
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,320
and how things have changed
in their environment.

190
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
And it's a really neat exchange...

191
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,600
You can't say the biologists
are the teachers

192
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,880
or the guardians are the teachers.

193
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,080
We're both teachers
and we're both students.

194
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,400
And I think that's...
That blend is amazing.

195
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,800
Critically,

196
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,160
at the heart of this project
is a huge attitude change

197
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,440
by these Maasai warriors.

198
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,920
An animal that was once
their sworn enemy, they now protect.

199
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,240
And their willingness to share knowledge
with other communities

200
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,440
means that projects like this could be
repeated in other parts of Africa.

201
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,080
Traditionally, when a warrior killed
a lion, he took the name of the lion.

202
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
Now, it's the other way round.

203
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,560
Now the lion takes the name
of the warrior who protects it.

204
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,240
The scheme is a huge success.

205
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,280
There are about 100 lions involved
in this scheme in this neighbourhood.

206
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,800
This is 21st century
conservation in action.

207
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,840
Perhaps the biggest threat to wildlife
is the competition for space

208
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,000
with the rapidly growing
human population.

209
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,440
The Virunga volcanoes straddle
the borders of Rwanda, Uganda

210
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,840
and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,800
The rich volcanic soils
are extremely fertile.

212
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,560
It's one of the most intensively
cultivated areas in Africa.

213
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,240
But the farmers also share this region
with one of our closest relatives.

214
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,200
This is home to the last 800 or so

215
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,360
wild mountain gorillas left on Earth.

216
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,640
We know a great deal
about these animals.

217
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,520
They've been closely studied
for 50 years.

218
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,240
One strong silverback male
keeps everyone in order.

219
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,520
And gorilla family life
is mostly peaceful.

220
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,520

221
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,840
Until a few generations ago,
mountain gorillas,

222
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,080
hidden in the seclusion
of their forests,

223
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,320
were seldom seen by human beings.

224
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,280
But their habitat was steadily
being carved away.

225
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,640
And now these gorillas are marooned

226
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,720
on the volcanic slopes
in a sea of farmland.

227
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,960
The fact that gorillas now
regularly come into contact with people

228
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,280
not only means an increased
threat of poaching,

229
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
but also of disease.

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,520
Gorillas have little or no resistance
to the bugs that we carry.

231
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,000

232
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Numbers here once dropped to around 250.

233
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,400
They were facing extinction.

234
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
Action had to be taken.

235
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,280
The boundaries of the national park
were strictly enforced,

236
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,560
halting the encroachment of farmland.

237
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,760
And it was decided
that the only solution

238
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,120
was to intensively manage
the remaining gorillas.

239
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,600
Teams of scientists
constantly monitor them.

240
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,000
Their forests are patrolled
to cut poachers' snares.

241
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480

242
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,440
And vets watch their health closely.

243
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,200
This is funded mostly
through ecotourism

244
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,640
and donations from all over the world.

245
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,400
Mountain gorillas are now
back from the brink.

246
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This level of human intervention
might not be ideal, but it's working.

247
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,680
Every year there are
a few more mountain gorillas

248
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,360
and possibly just
a little more optimism.

249
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,520
Intensive management
within a protected area

250
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,480
may represent the only future
for many African species.

251
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,440
But for some animals
that is simply not possible.

252
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,960

253
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,480
What happens if the animal
you're trying to protect

254
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,280
is not suited to park life?

255
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,920
Elephants require vast amounts
of space to roam.

256
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,640
They have a range
of up to 1,300 square miles.

257
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,880
Given the chance,

258
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,760
they will even move between countries
in search of the best food,

259
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,520
particularly if conditions get rough.

260
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,880
This was the scene in
Amboseli National Park in 2009.

261
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,120
The park is home to nearly
one and a half thousand elephants.

262
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,560
And this was the worst drought
for half a century.

263
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,080
60% of zebras and 95% of wildebeest
were wiped out.

264
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,840
The seasonal rains had failed
for the last two years.

265
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,080
And the elephants that lived here
were slowly starving.

266
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,400
The park created to protect them
is now surrounded by farmland.

267
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,120
The elephants had little choice
of where else to go.

268
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,000
Caught up in this catastrophe
were three sisters.

269
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,880
They are the frontline
for elephant protection in the park.

270
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,440
And they know these animals
better than anyone else.

271
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,360
Nora Njiraini,

272
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,400
and Katito and Soila Sayialel.

273
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,120
All the elephants have been given names.

274
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,600
They're a family to us.

275
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,640
Hello, Anastasia.

276
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,080
The sisters have been following these elephants

277
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,840
for over 25 years,

278
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
trying to ensure their safety,

279
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,240
particularly at times when life
is tough for these animals.

280
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,200
It really was terrible.

281
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,360
There was nothing, actually, to feed on.

282
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,440
We even went and asked
the old Maasai men

283
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,720
whether they have ever
experienced such a drought.

284
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,000
The only time it was close
to what was then, was in 1961.

285
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,640
In 2009,

286
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,640
we lost quite a number of elephants.

287
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,480
I think we lost about 400 elephants.

288
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,800
And it started with the young ones.

289
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,960
Elephants usually escape drought

290
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,640
by moving into other less affected areas.

291
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,400
But Africa's human population
is growing at double the global rate.

292
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,880
And traditional migration routes
have been cut

293
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,880
by the developments
of towns, cities, farmland and roads,

294
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,040
leaving these elephants stuck.

295
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,160
This young calf is starving,

296
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,000
and there is nothing they can do to help.

297
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,680
For the sisters,
who know each elephant personally,

298
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,080
this is a terrible moment.

299
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,800
It is something
that we feel in our hearts.

300
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,760
You can imagine
the kind of feelings that we get.

301
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,480
You know, knowing those elephants
and seeing something like that happen,

302
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,600
it really touches us.

303
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,480
It was a tough year for all 
the young elephants in the region.

304
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,400
We lost all the calves
who were born that year.

305
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,360
All of them. We lost them.

306
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,000

307
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,600
There was nothing the sisters 
could do to save the baby.

308
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,000
But they were determined
to save any elephants they could,

309
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,280
especially mothers who could breed again.

310
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,280

311
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,000
They found this female
stuck in the mud, exhausted,

312
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,960
in a dried-up lakebed.

313
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,080

314
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,720

315
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,240
The elephant that got stuck
in the mud was Qualida.

316
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
Poor thing, you know,
she was there for quite a long time.

317
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,200
The Maasai reported it to us,

318
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,800
and we had to combine efforts with
the Kenya Wildlife Services people.

319
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,360

320
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,760
Weighing about three tonnes,

321
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,720
Qualida is just too heavy
to shift by hand.

322
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
She's weakening fast.

323
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,200
So the next morning,
heavy machinery is brought in.

324
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,120

325
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,280

326
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,680

327
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,960

328
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,080
After two days stuck in the mud,

329
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,400
Qualida is exhausted.

330
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
But she is up on her feet again.

331
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,000

332
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,880
The rains did return to Amboseli,

333
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,960
and, thanks in part to the work
of those dedicated three women,

334
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,400
elephant numbers
are now beginning to rise again.

335
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,160
There's no doubt
that this was an extremely severe event.

336
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,080
But is it an isolated incident
or a developing pattern?

337
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,920
Especially with global warming,

338
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,800
we actually don't know
what's going to happen,

339
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,840
but we just have to cross fingers
and hope for a better future.

340
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,160
Given the opportunity,
the numbers of elephants

341
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,120
in East Africa will recover.

342
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,240
Especially if they are given
the freedom to range widely,

343
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,800
and so avoid the harshest conditions.

344
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,200
One solution to help elephants
find the space they need

345
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,040
is to link parks together
and provide safe routes between them.

346
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,920
Elephants are great travellers,

347
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,920
and here, in this part of Kenya,
they regularly moved from the lowlands

348
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,280
up the side of the mountains
to feed in the forests up there.

349
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,440
But then, the human population of Kenya grew,

350
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,680
and roads like this one were constructed.

351
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,240
Penning the elephants
down in the lowlands

352
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,320
where they created havoc
amongst the farms.

353
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,560
Not only that, there were dangers
of collisions on the road.

354
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,720
And then someone suggested
building an underpass.

355
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,600
Within 24 hours of it being completed,

356
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,400
one elephant had passed through,

357
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,320
and now all the elephants use that route

358
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,920
to go up the mountain,
often at night, to feed.

359
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,360
Simple ideas like this underpass
are a lifeline for these elephants.

360
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,760
Especially in times of drought.

361
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,160
Africa's climate is certainly changing.

362
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,400
Some parts of the continent

363
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,080
have become three and a half degrees
centigrade hotter

364
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,760
in the past 20 years.

365
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,200
At the summit of Africa's
most famous mountain, Kilimanjaro,

366
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,800
80 percent of its permanent ice fields
have disappeared.

367
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,680
Soon, it will be free of ice altogether.

368
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,600
All over Africa

369
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,520
the mountainous regions are often
the first indicators of climate change.

370
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:39,080
Here, in the Ethiopian Highlands,
live very unusual-looking creatures.

371
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,680
Gelada baboons.

372
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,600
Climate change refugees.

373
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,040
Although this region of Ethiopia
lies in the tropics,

374
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,560
up at 4,000 metres,
it doesn't feel like it.

375
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,320
Unlike most African animals,

376
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,080
geladas are adapted
to life in the cold.

377
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,560
They used to be one of Africa's
most successful primates,

378
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,720
found all over the continent.

379
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,000
At one stage, there were
six different species.

380
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,000
Now there is only one.

381
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,680
With the warming climate,

382
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,400
their grazing is becoming
more and more scarce,

383
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,120
restricted to cooler and higher places.

384
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,600
These geladas are being forced
higher into the mountains.

385
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,240
Soon there will be nowhere left to go.

386
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,880
This is a species living on the edge.

387
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,360
Even though they're isolated
on the mountain tops,

388
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,920
they're not immune to our influence.

389
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,080
As a result of changing climate,

390
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,040
these gelada baboons
may soon be gone from our planet.

391
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,600
Africa is the world's hottest continent.

392
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,680
And there is no doubt,
it's getting warmer.

393
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,960
The Sahara is the largest
hot desert in the world.

394
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,120
Very little can survive
in these harsh conditions.

395
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,320
Along the desert edge, life clings on

396
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,560
in the face of encroaching sands.

397
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,400
But for how long?

398
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,800
Alongside the wildlife,

399
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,600
22 million people struggle to make a living

400
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,560
on these desert margins.

401
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,160
Can anything be done to stop the sand
overwhelming this fragile land?

402
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,760
One idea is to build
a green wall of trees

403
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,320
across 11 countries.

404
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,960
The project has already started,
in Senegal,

405
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,400
but, like all big ideas,
it has big problems.

406
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,960
Getting 11 countries
to work together is not easy,

407
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,680
and simply irrigating
a 5,000-mile-long belt of trees

408
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,800
is an ambitious task.

409
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,840
But, all over Africa,
people are recognising

410
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,040
how important it is to have trees

411
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
as part of their local landscape.

412
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,040
This group of volunteers has planted
nearly 100 million saplings.

413
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,840
And they're just one of countless
similar groups and individuals,

414
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,440
taking it upon themselves

415
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,560
to reforest their own part
of this great continent.

416
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Trees are essential
for the future of the continent,

417
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,880
and indeed to the rest of the planet.

418
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,800
This is the Congo basin.

419
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,680
It's one of the most biologically
important forests on Earth,

420
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,760
and it's not just because
of the concentration

421
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,000
of plants and animals that live here.

422
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,400
It's because it's also one
of the powerhouses

423
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,680
behind the planet's wind and rain.

424
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,080
Each hectare of trees releases as vapour

425
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,200
almost 190,000 litres of water a year.

426
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,640
This water passes into the atmosphere,

427
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,440
to be transported
around the entire globe.

428
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,120
That means the heart
of the world's weather

429
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,760
lies in tropical forests.

430
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,800
Unfortunately, there's an almost
insatiable demand in Europe and China,

431
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,920
for hardwood from these very forests.

432
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,880
And that is having an enormous impact.

433
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,400
As more tropical forest is felled,

434
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,680
some scientists are
seeing a correlation

435
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,840
with changing storm patterns
across Europe and America.

436
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,880
And it's likely to become more extreme.

437
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,920
Staggeringly,
50 percent of the Congo basin forest

438
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,160
has been allocated for logging.

439
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,400
The future of Africa's forests
has never been more critical for us all.

440
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,520
But the consequences of global warming
aren't limited to the land.

441
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,560
Africa is almost completely
surrounded by oceans.

442
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,400
Here, on the east coast,

443
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,840
there are animals feeling
the change in climate

444
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,760
in a most surprising way.

445
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,640
This is a young female green turtle.

446
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,600
During her lifetime,
she will travel thousands of miles

447
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,880
through the ocean, looking for food.

448
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,760
Turtles return to the same beach
from which they hatched

449
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,640
to lay their own eggs.

450
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,240
The eggs are buried in the sand,

451
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,280
and the hatchlings will emerge
after about two months.

452
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,680
Now, there's a strange thing.
about turtle eggs,

453
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,840
and that is the temperature
at which the eggs are kept

454
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,720
will determine the sex
of most of the hatchlings.

455
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,600
If the sand temperature is high,
they will be female.

456
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,320
If it's low, they will be male.

457
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,080
So global warming
could have a crucial effect

458
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,720
on turtle populations.

459
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,760
And this young female

460
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,800
may find it very difficult,

461
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,080
in years to come,
to find a male with which to mate.

462
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,640
But a local conservation group
recognised that the odds are stacking up

463
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,360
against these little turtles.

464
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,960
There's not much they can do
about climate change,

465
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,800
but they have got together
with the local fishermen

466
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,080
to try and improve
the turtles' chances of survival.

467
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,560
Every turtle counts.

468
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,720
So each time one is found injured
or accidentally caught in the nets,

469
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,200
it's brought to Kahindi Changawa
and his team.

470
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,600
So we began with only
16 fishermen altogether, in 1998,

471
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,960
and now we have hundreds
of fishermen working with us.

472
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,520
Grazing by turtles

473
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,840
is essential for the health
of the beds of seagrass.

474
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,880
And these are the home
of shrimps and lobsters,

475
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,480
and that, of course,
helps fishermen, too.

476
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,760
The project has a turtle
rehabilitation centre,

477
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,280
and for the last two years,
it's become home to Shella.

478
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,800
She had an accident with a boat, 
was hit from behind.

479
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,080
She lost three ribs
and her spine was, as well, damaged.

480
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,200
It's now in the process
of healing back together.

481
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,600
Shella's injuries have affected her buoyancy.

482
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,160
She's healed well,

483
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,960
and to encourage her
to exercise her flippers properly,

484
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,120
she has, every day,
a little trip to the seaside.

485
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,280
So we usually take Shella
for a sea bath on daily basis,

486
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,440
and the whole reason why
we're doing that,

487
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,480
we're trying to give her
enough room to get exercises.

488
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,360
And she gets an opportunity
to eat her natural food.

489
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,600
We believe that it keeps her fit,

490
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,120
and the other thing is she gets
to use her rear flippers quite often.

491
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,120
For Kahindi, it's one
of the rewards for all his hard work.

492
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,840
It's really, really enjoyable.

493
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,560
Very few people have the privilege,
like I do,

494
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,680
swimming with the turtles,
and having that fun.

495
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,840
I do enjoy what I'm doing.

496
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,840
Shella certainly did get stronger,

497
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,760
but the hope that someday
she might swim out in the open

498
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,400
was not to be fulfilled.

499
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,000
Unaccountably, she became weaker
and eventually died.

500
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,880
This kind of work will
inevitably have setbacks.

501
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,240
But there are always
new turtles to be cared for.

502
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,160
Is she healthy?

503
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,400
Yeah, this one is healthy.
I mean, she has a few bruises,

504
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,160
could be from the fishing gear.

505
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,200
Um, like these ones here.

506
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,760
Oh, yeah, but otherwise healthy?

507
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,320
Otherwise, the turtle
is obviously really healthy.

508
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,640
Shall we let her go?

509
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,880
Since 1998, till now,

510
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,040
we've released over 8,200 turtles.

511
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,240
It fills me...
feel proud and privileged.

512
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,840
We've done lots of work
with the community,

513
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,480
on changing their attitudes

514
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,200
and their behaviours and everything.

515
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,480
So I guess...

516
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,600
our job as an organisation
is really successful.

517
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,520
A young turtle like that

518
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,000
could lay 6,000 or 7,000 eggs

519
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,320
in her lifetime.

520
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,800
So the survival of just one

521
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
could have huge consequences.

522
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,600
Saving just one individual
requires huge effort,

523
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,760
and of course, saving a species
requires even more.

524
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,960
But these heroic efforts are only
ever going to be a partial solution.

525
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,760
Every individual animal is part
of a much bigger story,

526
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,760
part of an interconnected web
of plants, animals,

527
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,240
and the landscape itself,

528
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,000
that make up an entire ecosystem.

529
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,720
Saving ecosystems is the key
to Africa's wild future.

530
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,400
Gorongosa in Mozambique,
is a modern-day Jurassic Park.

531
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,920
It's ruled by some
of the world's biggest crocodiles.

532
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,280
Some of these monsters
are six metres long

533
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,440
and close to 50 years old.

534
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,600
Somehow, they managed to escape
a civil war lasting nearly 20 years,

535
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
which swept through Gorongosa.

536
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,800
95% of all the other large animals
were wiped out.

537
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,040
But 50 years ago
the scene was very different.

538
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,120
This was a thriving tourist attraction,
a wild paradise.

539
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,640
Visitors flocked from around the world,

540
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,280
drawn by the vast range
and abundance of the wildlife.

541
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,840
The most popular spot for tourists

542
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,320
was an old restaurant,

543
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,160
a lookout post for the local lions.

544
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,800
The restaurant has long gone.

545
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,080
Along with the lions.

546
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,880
Gorongosa looked empty
and beyond rescue.

547
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,880
But not to everyone.

548
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,600
A brave and ambitious project began

549
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,360
to try and restore the park
to its former richness and splendour.

550
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,680
The first stage
is to find out which animals,

551
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,680
as well as crocodiles, are still here.

552
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,440
So the team is mapping and counting all
the big animals they see in the park.

553
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,640

554
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,200
But it soon became clear that these
big animals were only part of the story.

555
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,160
Perhaps even more important

556
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,520
might be the little ones
hidden underfoot.

557
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,680
It's understanding these creatures

558
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,440
that is attracting
some of the best minds

559
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,080
in the scientific world.

560
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,400
You were going to show me something?

561
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,160
Yeah, something new.

562
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,480
Professor Ed Wilson

563
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,200
is a world expert on biodiversity.

564
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,880
And at a mere 83,
he's still pursuing his passion -

565
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
ants.

566
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,760
You see, there's a big nest of...
I think they're Myrmicarias.

567
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,200
Wow! Let me just get one specimen.

568
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,320
If you look down at your feet,

569
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,880
you may see them,

570
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,400
walking by here and there, an ant,
a little beetle...

571
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,680
What I like to call
the little things that run the earth.

572
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,600
It's the rich diversity
of insect life here

573
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,640
that gives Gorongosa
the prospect of a future.

574
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,480
These creatures form
the basis of life in the park.

575
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,200
This is so much fun.

576
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,360
These little invertebrate creatures,

577
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,080
the creatures that do most of the work,
turn most of the energy,

578
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,160
save most of the material,

579
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,880
and allow us to re-insert big animals
with some confidence.

580
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,640
Have you got it in the vial yet?

581
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,280
Yeah, I got three of them.
Oh, good.

582
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,920
Professor Wilson was one of the first scientists

583
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,960
to explore this area,
together with local wildlife biologist

584
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,520
Tonga Torcida.

585
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,920
That's a good one.

586
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,160
If you could gather them all up,

587
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,640
all these little invertebrate creatures,

588
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and weigh them,

589
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,160
they would weigh...

590
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,640
far more than all of the big animals
put together,

591
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,240
even in a fully restored park.

592
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,920
It's these little creatures,

593
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,960
together with the plants and trees,

594
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,840
that still make this place
a viable option

595
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,400
for re-introducing bigger animals.

596
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,560
I can't be sure that's a new species

597
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,200
but, you know, this is the kind
of thing that might be.

598
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,440
This park came...

599
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,400
that close to vanishing.

600
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,920
And I'm happy to report
it is coming back.

601
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,880
And this is one of the great stories.
It's inspirational, I think.

602
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,720
And it's a fine shining example
of what to do with all our parks,

603
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,920
even those that have been damaged
by human activity.

604
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,720
But there's another reason

605
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,680
why Gorongosa is important
for the future of Africa,

606
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,920
and perhaps for us all.

607
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,520
So it is here, in this park,

608
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,280
that people come to see...

609
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,840
not just the big animals
that thrill us,

610
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,480
but they will see Earth
as it looked and felt

611
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,040
before the coming of humanity.

612
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,000
Saving big animals is important,

613
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,280
but to do that with any real success,

614
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,440
we have to start understanding
and preserving the plants and insects

615
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,600
that support an ecosystem.

616
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,840
It's this that will allow
the large animals to thrive.

617
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,920
Gorongosa is a real success story.

618
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,080
The government and the management team

619
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,480
have pledged themselves to a plan

620
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,360
to restore the land to what it was.

621
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,800
While it can never be exactly
the same as it was before the war,

622
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:09,080
it can still become a rich
and thriving ecosystem.

623
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,320
The scale of the challenge
across Africa is enormous.

624
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,440
After all, it's a huge continent.

625
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,440
The United Kingdom, China,
the United States of America,

626
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,360
India, Japan and most
of the rest of Europe

627
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,040
would all fit within its borders.

628
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,080
Africa still retains 45 percent
of the Earth's uncultivated land.

629
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,360
It's still the greatest wilderness
on Earth.

630
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,720
And that is why it's important.

631
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,640
Human beings have lived
alongside wildlife here

632
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,760
longer than anywhere else.

633
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,600
But now, in the 21st century,

634
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,320
animal numbers are at a critical level.

635
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,880
Like it or not,
this generation is responsible

636
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,800
for handing on the world's wildlife
to the next.

637
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,160
Come on...

638
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,800
That means taking care of the animals
and lands where they live,

639
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,080
so there is still space
for us all to coexist.

640
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,760
Nobody knows...

641
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,760
what the future has in store
for this little calf.

642
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,600
Or, indeed,

643
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,440
how the changes that inevitably
are going to take place in Africa

644
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,000
will affect the rest of the world
and this little animal.

645
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,960
But one thing is certain -

646
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,360
what happens here

647
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,720
is more important
than it has ever been,

648
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,280
and that the relationship
of the rest of the world

649
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,240
to this great continent
and the creatures that live in it

650
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,440
is more important than ever before.

651
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,920
On whichever part of the planet we live,

652
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,920
we all have a part to play

653
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,480
in what sort of future
this wild continent has.

654
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,120
Africa, the final shoot.

655
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,040
It's one of our most ambitious trips,

656
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,240
with lots of locations to visit

657
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,800
and many technical hurdles to overcome.

658
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,480
Five, take one.

659
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,240
To the west, a vast rainforest
the size of India.

660
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,520
Helicopters enable us to go
to extraordinary landscapes.

661
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,320
We're heading off
to do the very first piece to camera,

662
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,640
the opening of the whole Africa series
with David.

663
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,160
Well, how do you like
the view from my office?

664
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,880

665
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,560
And attempt air-to-air filming.

666
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,280
Standby, David, and action!

667
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,760
I'm flying over the Great Rift Valley
in East Africa.

668
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,480
But perhaps the most ambitious task for this shoot

669
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,080
is the filming with black rhinoceros.

670
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,000
They have a reputation
for being aggressive

671
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,440
and, with poor eyesight,

672
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,680
they're likely to charge objects
or people they don't recognise.

673
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,080
But the plight of the rhino
is such an important story

674
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,760
that we want to get as 
close to them as possible.

675
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,320
We also want to meet the people
who are working to protect them.

676
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,920
So our team have come to assess
the viability of filming up-close

677
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,600
with a rhino called Elvis,
who's been reared by humans.

678
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,680
He should be safer than a wild rhino,

679
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,520
but there's still a risk he could be
unpredictable with strangers.

680
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,160
Wildlife ranger Tonga Casio
has bought up Elvis by hand

681
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,040
and knows that tickling him gently
with a stick keeps him calm.

682
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,120
But if anything were to go seriously wrong,

683
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,120
there would be little he could do
against the one-tonne Elvis.

684
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,120
And this fact hasn't escaped
cameraman Mike Fox.

685
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,000
He knows we're here.
We're here on his terms.

686
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,560
If he decided to bat us all
into the next world, he would do.

687
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,600
Director Kate Broome checks with Tonga

688
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,080
that it's safe for the crew to get closer.

689
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,600
Normally we have to stay in the Land Rovers.

690
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,200
He's saying it's okay to go in.

691
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,880
This is such an extraordinary opportunity,

692
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,960
to be this close to a black rhino.

693
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,520
The trial goes well with Elvis.

694
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,160
And the stage is set for future filming.

695
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,920
What I'm saying...

696
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,880
Several weeks later,
the team are back.

697
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,720
And this time I've joined them.

698
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,800
But Elvis's mood has changed.

699
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,200
He seems more wilful.

700
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,120
Now, I've stood by many wild animals
in my time,

701
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,120
but I'm not as fast on my pins
as I used to be.

702
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,160
We don't want to test Elvis's patience,
so we get on with filming.

703
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,920
A horn that is worth its weight in gold.

704
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,640
And one way...

705
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,360
of protecting him...

706
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,480
would be...

707
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,840
to cut that horn off the nose.

708
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,640
How is it?

709
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,240
Looks great.

710
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,760
The team check that they have what they need,

711
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,640
and Elvis lets us know
that he's had enough.

712
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,040
Just watch out everybody. Yeah.

713
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,320
- Okay.
- Right then.

714
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,560
But, actually,
it's a positive sign

715
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,440
that Elvis is not as friendly this time.

716
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,240
Tonga and his colleagues want Elvis
to live more like a wild rhino

717
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,640
and develop a wariness of humans,

718
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,440
that may offer him some protection
from poachers.

719
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,560
Good luck to you, Elvis.

720
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,840
Whilst filming, we are lucky enough
to have a very well-equipped camp.

721
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,520
It's in the bush and there's no escaping
the wild animals.

722
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,680
One of the great, wonderful things
about camping out

723
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,080
in the middle of the open
is the animals.

724
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,920
But it could also be one of
the dangerous, stroke, annoying things.

725
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,200
Absolutely.

726
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,760
In the annoying category - vervet monkeys.

727
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,880
Vervet monkeys have stolen
my Ferrero Rocher,

728
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,400
and one of my glow sticks
from our medical supplies.

729
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,360
Um, so if we see a luminous-faced monkey
in the night, um,

730
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,120
I'll identify the naughty one
that's been stealing our stuff.

731
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,720
And they leave little, uh,
presents for us

732
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,080
when they've been in,
just as a calling card.

733
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,200
But camp manager Andres
finds more worrying animal signs.

734
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,480
Well, the lions were quite close, um,
just behind the tents.

735
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,600
And some must have come in,

736
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,240
and I don't know, uh...

737
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,680
You can see a few scratches.

738
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,000
I think maybe he was wanting to look
at himself in the mirror.

739
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,160
Lions in camp are worrying enough,

740
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,040
but there I was reading my book,
when...

741
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,960
- Uh, uh...
- Whoa!

742
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,520
A Cape buffalo arrives.

743
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,400
The most grumpy and dangerous
of the big five African animals.

744
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,600
Mike, stay in your tent.

745
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,280
Should we get David to get in the tent?

746
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,400
Buffalo usually move in herds,

747
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,240
so there's something odd about him.

748
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,480
It may be that it was brought up
as a calf, and is humanised,

749
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,840
or it may be that he's an outcast
from the herd, in some way,

750
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,200
and that he's rather grumpy
and fed up with life.

751
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,440
Uh, but I think it's just hot,
and he's just trotting around

752
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,680
and wondering where he might
get a drink and a decent sandwich.

753
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,600
Because I feel the same way
myself actually.

754
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,040
The team's filming has coincided 
with the newest arrival

755
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,120
at Lewa.

756
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,640
A baby rhino in need of 24-hour care.

757
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,640
This little chap was born blind
and is guided everywhere by his keepers.

758
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,320
They took him away from his mother
a few weeks ago

759
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,760
because she couldn't protect him any more.

760
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,120
He's very vulnerable, so he would have
been killed by predators.

761
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,600
It's like filling up a petrol tank.

762
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,720
Every rhino is precious.

763
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,960
And so it seems a fitting end
for the final scene of the series.

764
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,160
No one knows what the future holds
for this little creature.

765
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,880
Nor, indeed,
what changes will take place

766
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,240
in the great continent
on which he lives.

767
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,240
David, I found that...

768
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,920
Gosh, there's ants.

769
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,880
They're everywhere, yeah, hang on.

770
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,840
Ants! Ants attack.

771
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,120
I just found that
extraordinarily moving, actually.

772
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,280
- What I said was all right?
- Yes.

773
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,360
You sure?

774
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,520
And how you did it... I just...
It made me cry.

775
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,000
I'm afraid so.

776
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,800
David Attenborough has made me cry.

777
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,600
But just as we think we're finishing,

778
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,840
someone won't let us go.

779
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,240
Hello, little friend.

780
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,960
He starts to squeak.

781
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,600
And we're able to have a little chat.

782
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,880

783
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,480

784
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,360
Think about it.
He's got a black world, doesn't he?

785
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,400
And, uh, he's got smell.

786
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,840
And he's got sound, so...

787
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,040
He's more likely to be responding to sound

788
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,440
if he hasn't got the vision.

789
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,920
And yet, just inquisitive, I suppose.

790
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,600
You coming back?

791
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,240

792
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,320

793
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,600
There is hope for this little fellow.

794
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,240
He's due to have an operation
on his eyes,

795
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,680
which may mean that, as an adult,
he could be returned to the wild.

796
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,920
Just like Elvis.

797
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,800
I do hope he gets a cataract operation.
It'd be marvellous if he did.

798
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,360
Well, what an enchanting creature.
