00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:05,250
<i>Beloved countrymen,</i>

2
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,878
the New Liberalism party
is the only force in Colombia

3
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:11,423
that is not afraid of narcotraffickers.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,926
"There are
three ways the narcotraffickers...

5
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:19,139
- try to weaken extradition."
- ...try to weaken extradition.

6
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:20,599
- "Bribery..."
- Bribery...

7
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:22,476
"...intimidation through violence..."

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,561
...intimidation through violence...

9
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:26,730
- "...and extortion."
- ...and extortion!

10
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:32,068
- "A dark and terrible scourge."
- A dark and terrible scourge.

11
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:34,195
What are you doing?

12
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:36,573
Just making sure he gets it right.

13
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,495
You wrote it, you should know.

14
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,334
- Mm.
- Look, I brought you this.

15
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:48,836
What's this?

16
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:53,632
Clean socks.
Your wife dropped them off before we left.

17
00:00:55,843 --> 00:00:57,135
How's Galán doing?

18
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:00,597
All right.

19
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:04,184
I wish he didn't focus so much
on extradition of narcos.

20
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:07,061
There are other things to mention.

21
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:09,815
Galán's got some balls.

22
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:14,486
Brave men have a way of dying quickly.

23
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:20,450
Well, then, you don't have to worry...
do you?

24
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:24,830
Aah...

25
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:27,040
Pass me the socks.

27
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,594
First thing
is that we get you out of Bogotá.

28
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:05,096
- OK.
- There's an orphanage in Cumaral.

29
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:08,266
It's out of the guerrilla zone
and away from the narcos.

30
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,684
And then what?

31
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:12,186
We get you a passport.

32
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:17,025
From another country, we can depose you
about Escobar and the siege.

33
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:21,822
You may have run away from your country,
but I'm not running away from mine.

34
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:37,086
This is about keeping you alive.

35
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:41,883
Do you sleep with all your informants?

36
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,805
I'm not your responsibility.

37
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:55,355
If Pablo Escobar finds you...
he'll kill you in a heartbeat.

38
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,360
Not if I kill him first.

39
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:06,282
Yeah, she's a live hand grenade.

40
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,410
She's the only witness we got that
can tie Escobar to the palace massacre.

41
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:11,913
Hard to bring her in when
she gets turned over to the Colombians

42
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:14,415
and she gets disappeared.
Are you ready for that?

43
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:15,709
No.

44
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,585
So what's our options,
since we have none?

45
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:19,546
Well, we keep her in hiding
until things cool down,

46
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:21,548
and get her immunity
in exchange for her testimony...

47
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,925
Are you gonna get us immunity?

48
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,511
We are going to jail
if we get caught with this woman.

49
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:29,430
Well, the next time your wife decides
to bring home a human hand grenade,

50
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,307
how about she hands it to you?

51
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:35,812
Are you fucking her?

52
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:38,648
Sleep with a communist?

53
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,693
That would be downright un-American.

54
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:48,282
Any intel to support the DEA theory

55
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:51,411
that Escobar is behind
the Palace of Justice siege?

56
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:52,954
No, ma'am.

57
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:55,999
Agent Peña claims to have an informant
that can testify to that effect,

58
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,834
but he hasn't brought him forward.

59
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:00,211
In my book,
there's only two of them that know that.

60
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,674
And one of them is Elisa Alvaro,
girlfriend of Alejandro Ayala.

61
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:07,928
The other one is Ernesto Sobrino,

62
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:13,224
a radical priest who gave shelter
to M-19 fugitives in Los Altos <i>comuna.</i>

63
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:15,560
Is one of these people your informant?

64
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:19,856
Ambassador, this is...
unofficial wiretap information.

65
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:23,234
We, uh, intercepted
a discussion between narcos.

66
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:25,904
What? Which narcos?

67
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:29,574
- Sounded like Pablo Escobar.
- We're almost certain.

68
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:32,035
It was, uh...
It was hard to tell.

69
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,495
The... connection was bad.
They were calling from Panama.

70
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,414
- Panama?
- They know Galán's gonna win

71
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,458
and they know
that he'll support extradition,

72
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,377
and they're not gonna sit around
and await being sent back to the US.

73
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:44,923
Ambassador, word is Manuel Noriega
is providing safe harbor for the narcos,

74
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:47,717
and possibly shipping points
for their cocaine.

75
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,970
They're moving
their drug operations to Panama?

76
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:52,597
That's horseshit, Peña.
Excuse me, Ambassador.

77
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,517
On one hand, you're saying Escobar's
in bed with left-wing communists.

78
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,812
Now you're saying
he's in bed with Manuel Noriega.

79
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:01,397
You can't have it both ways, son.

80
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:06,111
Ambassador, Manuel Noriega has helped us
fight communism all over Latin America

81
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:07,361
for the last two decades.

82
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:11,783
I take great offense at any attempt
by the DEA to smear his good name.

83
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:15,162
<i>I couldn't help but laugh.</i>

84
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,246
<i>Right wing, left wing...</i>

85
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,792
<i>For Manuel Noriega,
it was all about the money.</i>

86
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:25,421
<i>When Bush was head of the CIA,
Noriega pretended to be a commie hater</i>

87
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:30,426
<i>so the US would ignore the fact that he
was heavily involved as a drug trafficker.</i>

88
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,263
<i>When Noriega realized he could
make even more money shipping his drugs</i>

89
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,809
<i>by siding with communists,
he switched teams.</i>

90
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:41,980
<i>So, we invaded Panama,
and arrested "Old Pineapple Face."</i>

91
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,649
<i>But, that was later.</i>

92
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:48,820
<i>For now, the trusted friend and ally
was a right-wing CIA asset</i>

93
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:52,240
<i>who was taking money from Bush...
and right from the narcos.</i>

94
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:01,958
<i>Pablo had knocked off half the Colombian
Supreme Court to fight extradition.</i>

95
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:04,878
<i>And now, he was offering
to pay off Colombia's national debt</i>

96
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:06,171
<i>in exchange for a truce.</i>

97
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:09,132
<i>Guess he missed home.</i>

98
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:29,652
Look at this
shit. We are spending millions of dollars,

99
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:34,032
and can't even get a decent meal anywhere.

100
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:39,662
Listen, the problem isn't the food,
the problem is Noriega.

101
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:43,208
First chance he gets,
he'll sell us to the Americans.

102
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,625
You guys stay calm.

103
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,712
Once we reach an agreement with the
government, we'll be back in our homeland.

104
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:52,550
Pay the Colombian
national debt for amnesty?

105
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,595
I'd rather go live in Spain.

106
00:07:55,678 --> 00:08:00,141
I say we go back and fight.

107
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:03,394
No, sir, none of that.
War is bad for business.

108
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:05,772
We will negotiate with them
as Pablo agreed.

109
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:14,530
Look, Gustavo,
none of this would've happened

110
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:16,657
if he hadn't started
killing politicians and judges.

111
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:19,077
Tell me what we are supposed to do, then.

112
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:22,330
Do you want to sit here
and cry over spilled milk?

113
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:24,124
You know something, Pablo?

114
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:30,463
Sometimes, I think you kill these men
because they won't let you in their club.

115
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:33,382
You better watch your mouth, asshole.

116
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:55,780
The Colombian government
has refused our amnesty offer.

117
00:08:57,448 --> 00:09:00,118
Get used to the food, gentlemen.

118
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:04,080
It's not safe to go back home.

119
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:30,106
They've rejected our amnesty deal.

120
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,320
We may have to stay.

121
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:41,534
I hate this place.

122
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:46,831
We can go someplace else.

123
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:50,335
I hear Switzerland is very beautiful.

124
00:09:50,418 --> 00:09:52,753
In Switzerland,
we are nobody, Pablo.

125
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:57,258
What good is having all the money
in the world if you can't go home?

126
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:09,312
If we go back...
I'm going to have to fight.

127
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:20,031
Do whatever is necessary,
my love.

128
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:33,836
<i>So, there it was.</i>

129
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:37,215
<i>The decision that would
change Colombia forever.</i>

130
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:44,555
You're way ahead in the polls.

131
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:48,726
In my opinion,
the outcome is decided.

132
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:52,063
My question is... why do you
keep getting involved with the narcos?

133
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:55,191
I want a country at peace.

134
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,985
And if I don't do it, who will?

135
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:00,488
You're backing them into a corner.

136
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:03,783
I'm wearing a vest.

137
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:06,911
I'm afraid that a bulletproof vest...

138
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:10,415
isn't enough to ensure
that you have a future.

139
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,129
Don't worry, my friend.
There will be a future.

140
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:33,062
<i>Luis Carlos Galán
took the stage in Soacha on August 18th,</i>

141
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:36,899
<i>against the advice
of his campaign manager, César Gaviria.</i>

142
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:48,869
<i>The bullets entered just below
his vest and he was dead within minutes.</i>

143
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:51,956
<i>For a brief shining moment,
there was hope...</i>

144
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,543
<i>extinguished by the pull
of an assassin's trigger.</i>

145
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:03,009
<i>To mourn Galán's death, every hut in the
countryside lit a candle in remembrance...</i>

146
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,139
<i>and in the cities, thousands took
to the streets in a march of the silent,</i>

147
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:11,725
<i>a mute protest
against the violence of the narcos.</i>

148
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:17,857
<i>With Galán's murder... came the end
of hope for a peaceful future.</i>

149
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:24,531
Let's speak clearly, brother.

150
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:29,452
Galán's dead.

151
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:32,163
You had him killed,
didn't you?

152
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:35,542
You didn't tell us shit,
and you killed him, you son of a bitch.

153
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,336
- I want to go home, Fabio.
- Home?

154
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,963
Why are we going home?
So they can capture us?

155
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:47,220
All this shit you talk about partnership,
and then you do this on your own? Huh?

156
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:56,020
Galán was the only threat.

157
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,815
There is no one left to challenge us.

158
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,359
And you know why, Fabio.

159
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:05,363
Because no one
has the balls that we have.

160
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:10,284
Going home.

161
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:16,040
<i>Pablo was right.</i>

162
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:18,792
<i>Who would have the balls
to fill Galán's shoes?</i>

163
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:24,298
...that unique honesty.

164
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:27,468
As the people now rise
and call for justice,

165
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:31,556
I pray to God
that this sacrifice will serve at last...

166
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:37,520
as motivation for society
to react and bond...

167
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:42,942
to support the government...
and institutions...

168
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:47,696
while also demanding
a more effective leadership,

169
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,784
one undeterred by the hitmen,
the hijackings,

170
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:55,413
or any other manifestations of violence.

171
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:58,583
My father, Luis Carlos Galán,

172
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,918
will be remembered
for awakening the Colombian people

173
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,130
to the danger of the narcos.

174
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:10,344
The assassin's bullets...
will not stop what my father began.

175
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:15,433
As he fell,
another rises in his place.

176
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:19,395
I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...

177
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:23,483
in the name of the people of Colombia,
and my family...

178
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:29,196
that we entrust my father's ideals to him,
and that he can count on our support...

179
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:33,451
to become the president
Colombia wants and needs.

180
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:39,957
Dr. César Gaviria, save Colombia!

181
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:45,379
Gaviria! Gaviria! Gaviria!

182
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:56,599
<i>Dr. César Gaviria...
the new hope of Colombia.</i>

183
00:14:56,807 --> 00:15:00,687
<i>If he took Galán's position on
extradition, the narcos would declare war.</i>

184
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:04,565
<i>If he didn't,
the country would become a narco state.</i>

185
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:14,950
Phone!

186
00:15:16,827 --> 00:15:19,246
Let it go to the answering machine.

187
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:27,338
The machine's full.

188
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:29,590
I wish it would stop ringing.

189
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:33,135
It's your friends.
They're calling to offer support.

190
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:38,224
Or opinions about what I should do.

191
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:42,645
Why can't you run
without backing extradition?

192
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,778
- I wrote those speeches.
- Yes...

193
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:53,531
but do you even believe in them?

194
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,119
I don't know what I believe.

195
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:03,541
I don't want the narcos having free reign.

196
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:08,755
But I don't want the United States
involved in our affairs.

197
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:11,549
So say nothing.

198
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:15,678
That's the best way to stay alive.

199
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,195
Gentlemen.

200
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:37,617
Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink.

201
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:39,577
We're going home!

202
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:46,917
- How are you? Hm?
- Fine, my love.

203
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:50,421
What about you?

204
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:51,547
Give me one.

205
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,050
Margarita, right?

206
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,094
Let's see.

207
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,265
- Son of a bitch, that's good.
- Right?

208
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:05,144
Thank you.
Listen, I've got a question for you.

209
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:07,438
Why are we going back?

210
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,817
We're walking into a world of shit.

211
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:14,027
Relax, brother.

212
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:18,616
Spain's too far away
to protect our interests.

213
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,202
We have a better chance
of influencing Pablo at home.

214
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:27,583
We need to be close by.
Relax.

215
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,794
Don't you get it?

216
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:35,048
He's only comfortable at war.

217
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:37,551
He's taking us to the slaughter.

218
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,247
How's business?

219
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:12,879
Fucking Noriega is charging us a fortune,
but we got 175 tons to Miami.

220
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:17,257
Gacha's Mexican routes
are opening up Los Angeles.

221
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,888
But do you know what matters most
for our business, Pablo?

222
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:26,809
That the situation at home stays calm.
Know what I mean?

223
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:28,143
Sure.

224
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,703
You should have
consulted with me about Galán.

225
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:49,916
You would have tried to talk me out of it.

226
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,375
Yes.

227
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:55,045
I would have tried.

228
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,760
The amount of money we are losing
is because of that bullshit.

229
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,765
Are you listening?

230
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:09,017
Look at those peaks, Gustavo.

231
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:18,986
I'll die...
before I ever leave Colombia again.

232
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:28,120
What's happening, Carrillo?

233
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,496
Thank you for coming.

234
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,248
I understand the narcos
are back from Panama.

235
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:33,125
So you practice your English with me?

236
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,711
Because these men
aren't cleared, and if we speak Spanish,

237
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:37,212
it could get back to Pablo.

238
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:42,009
So I started this to monitor
Pablo's <i>sicarios' </i>communications.

239
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:44,678
SAT phones, landlines, you name it.

240
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:46,096
I've got dozens of wiretaps,

241
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:49,141
but I've only managed to seize
about ten kilos in the last month.

242
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:52,352
Probably because I've listened
to my own men tipping the narcos off.

243
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:53,854
So I've had to start surveilling them.

244
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:57,399
I listen to them
tell their girlfriends they're afraid...

245
00:19:57,483 --> 00:20:00,068
cry to their mothers
when one of our men gets shot down.

246
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:04,490
But every once in a while...
I hear them trade secrets with Pablo.

247
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:07,868
Do your bosses know you're doing this?

248
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:10,162
I trust them even less.

249
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:12,790
Most of my men are from here,

250
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:16,168
where they can get to your mother,
your aunt, your cousin.

251
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:21,632
How do I fight... when my soldiers
are already working for Escobar?

252
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:25,177
Well, do they have to be from Medellín?

253
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:34,561
Yes.

254
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:36,730
I definitely like the red one best.

255
00:20:37,564 --> 00:20:39,984
- Really?
- Mm.

256
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,485
I prefer the gray.

257
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:45,238
Red is the color of the party,

258
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:49,117
and it makes you more...
sociable and close to the people.

259
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:52,287
- That's important.
- Mm.

260
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:56,625
I wonder what Luis Carlos
would have chosen?

261
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:01,547
You know, we should
also hire an image consultant.

262
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:08,345
We have to make you more appealing
to the youth, give you a more modern look.

263
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,430
Now you are going to give me image advice?

264
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:12,349
I'm just thinking about the polls.

265
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,352
Anyway...

266
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:22,192
Galán had professionals at his side,
but which could he trust?

267
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:24,070
Hm?

268
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:27,531
And you know perfectly well
that you can trust me, right?

269
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:29,075
Mm-hm.

270
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:33,871
Well, what are you going to choose,
red or gray?

271
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:45,424
Luis Carlos said something to me
before he died.

272
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,802
"There will be a future."

273
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,516
Now let's see what kind of future it is.

274
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:03,191
We worked together in the ministry.

275
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,694
The idea that
he's a presidential candidate

276
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:08,072
shows you our sad state of affairs.

277
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:11,658
I need to know which side he is on.

278
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:15,788
He speaks with
the Foreign Press next week.

279
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:17,831
They'll certainly ask his position.

280
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:20,626
Don't worry, Pablo.
He'll be easy to influence.

281
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,128
- No, I disagree.
- Why?

282
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:26,006
I did an interview with him once,
when he was an economic advisor.

283
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,593
I found him sitting in the parking lot
in his beat-up Renault,

284
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:35,141
eating a bag of apples...
and reading economic reform textbooks.

285
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:38,018
He was testifying to the cabinet
and wanted to be ready.

286
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:41,438
He's a bookworm, not a leader.

287
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:43,816
- No... No...
- No, no, no, you're missing my point.

288
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:45,859
- No.
- He's not an oligarch.

289
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:48,946
He's from modest circumstances.

290
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,948
Like you,
he's worked for everything he has.

291
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,409
You have to be careful
with people like that.

292
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:05,838
I want you to deliver a message.

293
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:09,299
We've made a lot of money.

294
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:14,847
What we have to decide is do we stick
with Pablo... or chart our own course?

295
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,144
We should talk to our friends down south.

296
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,815
No, no. It's not time. No. Mm?

297
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:27,693
Whatever you say.

298
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,361
Have you seen Marina?

299
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:31,030
She told me she was
going to buy a new brush.

300
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,866
You know your sister.

301
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:38,245
Her shopping expeditions take weeks.

302
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:47,004
You have no idea how much
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.

303
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:48,421
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

304
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:51,925
I could tell that you really wanted to.

305
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,511
- Come here, baby.
- You are very patient.

306
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:55,888
Yes, of course.

307
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,850
All your people were there,
your brothers...

308
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:11,070
My brothers are driving me crazy.

309
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:15,157
- You know what?
- What?

310
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:17,701
They can go fuck themselves.

311
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:20,120
If they want to,
they can go live in Spain...

312
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:23,040
...but you're staying here with me.

313
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:32,258
Let's not hide anymore.

314
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:35,302
Not anymore.

315
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:37,596
All right.

316
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:42,142
What do we do about my wife?

317
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,355
Ask Pablo to do us a favor.

318
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,027
Just like he took care of Galán,
he can take care of your wife.

319
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:01,787
You...

320
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,332
are very evil for such a young girl.

321
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:12,756
You've moved up, Fernando.

322
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:19,805
From government minister
to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.

323
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:23,934
I guess the pay is much better.

324
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:26,603
I'm not doing this for the money.

325
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:32,234
What country sends its own citizens
to an iron tomb in the United States?

326
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:34,820
I understand your dilemma.

327
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:40,784
Speak out in favor, you're seen as a US
puppet and you might not win the election.

328
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:45,289
Speak out against,
you anger the US...

329
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:49,335
and are criticized by our media
as a shill of the narcos.

330
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:52,921
César, I was thinking I would love
to dedicate a program for your campaign.

331
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:56,842
It would be an honor for me,
and would benefit us both.

332
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:00,304
What a great idea.

333
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:03,807
You guys are really shameless,
aren't you?

334
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:08,770
- How do you sleep at night?
- César, it doesn't have to be this way.

335
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:12,691
If Luis had been as smart as you,

336
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:14,901
perhaps we could have avoided
this horrible tragedy.

337
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:18,822
We could have had peace.

338
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:20,240
Easy.

339
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:26,413
Get out.

340
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:29,457
Read Pablo's letter.

341
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,669
Maybe you will have a future.

342
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:48,352
They just picked up
that commie priest, Father Sobrino.

343
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:52,314
He's gonna talk. And when he does,
I hope you DEA boys understand

344
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:54,066
what's important in this hemisphere.

345
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:57,569
Well, how about you, uh...
clue us in?

346
00:26:57,652 --> 00:27:01,156
Drug dealers, I mean, bad as they are,
they want your money.

347
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:03,283
Communists want everything.

348
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:08,788
I don't know about you, Peña, but I...
I like to own shit.

349
00:27:08,997 --> 00:27:10,249
Right.

350
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:12,918
Good talk, Lou.

351
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:16,004
- Very, uh... enlightening.
- Yeah.

352
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:18,173
Oh...

353
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,178
This... priest?

354
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:27,515
If it comes out that he was your informant
and you protected him...

355
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:30,310
I'm gonna make sure
you're tried for treason.

356
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:39,986
<i>Peña had to figure out
how to get fake papers for Elisa.</i>

357
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:42,864
<i>So he did what he does best.</i>

358
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:46,034
Let me guess: it's a very
sad and complicated situation

359
00:27:46,118 --> 00:27:47,660
involving you and a beautiful local.

360
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:51,498
You got your nails done.
It's... It's your color, Colleen.

361
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:54,293
- What do you want, Javier?
- It's simple.

362
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,836
I just need your signature...
right there.

363
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,340
You want me to create an embassy ID?

364
00:28:00,424 --> 00:28:02,217
- Who is this woman?
- What I want you to do

365
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:05,262
is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy
and help someone stay alive.

366
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:09,557
You really think I'd be asking you
if it wasn't important?

367
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:11,351
She's my informant.

368
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:13,853
And she could be the key to bringing down
the whole Medellín cartel,

369
00:28:13,937 --> 00:28:16,064
so come on, Colleen,
whose side are you on?

370
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:34,374
Cousin, what happened?

371
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:36,751
Where were you?

372
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,546
- In the office.
- In the office?

373
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:40,755
Yes.

374
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:43,383
Is that where you were?

375
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:48,138
That's weird...

376
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:52,434
because I called
and they said you hadn't been in all day.

377
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:56,396
I don't know which office you called,
but I was there.

378
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,982
They're seizing everything, Pablo.
All the accounts...

379
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:01,609
We knew there would
be a reaction with Galán, right?

380
00:29:01,818 --> 00:29:03,695
Yeah.

381
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:05,655
Relax, Gustavo.

382
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:09,909
Relax, because everything
will calm down later.

383
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:22,714
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna kill us both?

384
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:25,925
- You afraid to die?
- No. Are you?

385
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:36,686
- Put it out.
- Where were you?

386
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:38,605
Put it out, Pablo.

387
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,567
Put it out, Pablo!

388
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:51,826
Are you with me or what?

389
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,498
And when have I not been with you?

390
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:03,505
From the beginning,
it has been you and me.

391
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:08,927
I cannot do this without you.

392
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:15,725
Are you doubting my loyalty, Pablo?

393
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,938
No.

394
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:26,653
But I'm having serious doubts
about the Ochoas.

395
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:52,804
<i>Gaviria read Pablo's letter.</i>

396
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:57,809
<i>The terms were simple.</i>

397
00:30:58,017 --> 00:31:01,771
<i>He promised peace
if the narcos were left alone...</i>

398
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,817
<i>and if not...
he promised all-out war.</i>

399
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:16,286
<i>Carrillo with his wiretaps
knew a storm was on the horizon.</i>

400
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:20,290
<i>Pablo became his duty
and his obsession.</i>

401
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:23,376
<i>He came to recognize Pablo's voice,</i>

402
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,379
<i>his sleep patterns,
what he liked to eat,</i>

403
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:29,966
<i>his tastes in art,
his love of silk sheets,</i>

404
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:31,510
<i>and his favorite music.</i>

405
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:45,982
<i>He would die
for the love of his wife</i>

406
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:47,526
<i>when you'd hear him over the airwaves.</i>

407
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:55,200
<i>But did she know
how easily he ordered his men to kill?</i>

408
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:58,995
<i>He came to understand
that Pablo spoke in code.</i>

409
00:31:59,162 --> 00:32:00,539
Time to thin the herd.

410
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:03,916
<i>"Cattle" were judges
or politicians who supported extradition.</i>

411
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,918
But did we score a goal?

412
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:07,920
The reporter, right.

413
00:32:10,256 --> 00:32:12,551
Let's make sure
we score a goal on him as well.

414
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:14,761
<i>A "goal" was a targeted assassination.</i>

415
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:16,722
Come on, come on.

416
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:19,307
<i>If you spoke out against him,
you were dead.</i>

417
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:21,518
<i>- The list grew by the week.</i>
<i>- </i>Ooh!

418
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:25,813
<i>Guillermo Cano, editor of </i>El Espectador,

419
00:32:25,897 --> 00:32:28,274
<i>and his reporter, Luis Camacho.</i>

420
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:33,739
<i>Jaime Rodríguez, the former head
of the anti-drug squad before Carrillo.</i>

421
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:36,282
<i>The drumbeat went on and on.</i>

422
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,077
<i>For Carrillo,
the war had already started.</i>

423
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,079
<i>But he just couldn't trust his army.</i>

424
00:32:41,162 --> 00:32:44,624
You are aware
that I can end your military career?

425
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,459
- I don't give a fuck.
- Excuse me?

426
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:49,462
Horacio... don't give up.

427
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:54,008
You've always been the leader
of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.

428
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:56,219
Is this how you show your appreciation
for all we've done?

429
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,346
This operation
could be a failure before it starts.

430
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,724
I'm not here for fun.

431
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:02,434
What's gonna happen
is the defense minister

432
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:05,937
will give you credit for the evidence
that we found at Hacienda Nápoles.

433
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,066
So... then if you resign,
I will look really bad.

434
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:12,277
Is that what you're doing?
Is that what you want?

435
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,487
Horacio...
you remember when were cadets,

436
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:19,284
we never thought they would call us
to lead the country's most important unit.

437
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:23,204
Horacio, as your friend...
I'm asking you to think about it.

438
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:25,832
Rodrigo, I don't even know who Pablo pays.

439
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,209
It could be any of us three.

440
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,964
- Horacio, please.
- I've put my family at risk.

441
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:36,593
If there is going to be a war,
I need the right tools.

442
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:39,554
All right.

443
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:40,888
Perfect.

444
00:33:42,474 --> 00:33:44,559
Then tell me what you need.
Hm?

445
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:48,438
Incorruptible men.

446
00:33:48,647 --> 00:33:51,357
<i>And that's how the Search Bloc came to be.</i>

447
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,499
<i>But Carrillo
wasn't the only one recruiting soldiers.</i>

448
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:16,675
Hey, punk.
Are you all right?

449
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:18,844
- Sure.
- Come here.

450
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:23,682
<i>La Quica and Poison
had kids deliver packages.</i>

451
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:25,308
<i>And if they didn't look inside,</i>

452
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:29,187
<i>it meant they could be trusted
to deliver anything from cocaine to...</i>

453
00:34:30,522 --> 00:34:31,523
<i>well, anything else.</i>

454
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:48,748
How are you, son?

455
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,377
- How are you?
- Good.

456
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,356
I have to kill that son of a bitch.

457
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:19,696
Carrillo's a cop.
You can always buy a cop with money.

458
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:23,241
- I've tried, believe me.
- Then offer more.

459
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:28,788
Or I can loan you Navegante.
He will do whatever I ask.

460
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,877
That's true.

461
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:40,174
It's silver or lead.
That's the choice for that bastard.

462
00:35:40,258 --> 00:35:45,263
Speaking of lead,
I'm getting a shipment of weapons in.

463
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:47,181
Uzis, grenades...

464
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:53,187
If I could find a nuclear weapon...
But now I'm negotiating a fucking missile.

465
00:35:53,271 --> 00:35:56,357
- A missile? No fucking way.
- Yes.

466
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:57,734
- Boss.
- Eh?

467
00:35:57,817 --> 00:36:01,237
<i>This is crack cocaine,
seized a few days ago</i>

468
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,489
<i>by drug enforcement agents,</i>

469
00:36:03,573 --> 00:36:06,785
<i>in a park just across the street
from the White House.</i>

470
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:10,246
<i>And our message
to the drug cartels is this:</i>

471
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:11,957
<i>the rules have changed.</i>

472
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:14,333
He's bullshitting, right?

473
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,713
He's smoking that shit.
I guarantee it.

474
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:23,509
Motherfucker.

475
00:36:25,678 --> 00:36:27,680
Mm...

476
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:36,689
Mrs. Quiroga told me
the neighbors on the block took a vote.

477
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:38,065
They want us to move.

478
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:42,654
But we have guards stationed
outside the house 24 hours a day.

479
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:44,280
That's what scares them.

480
00:36:47,826 --> 00:36:49,327
Come here.

481
00:36:51,245 --> 00:36:53,790
It won't always be like this,
my love.

482
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:20,274
- Rodrigo.
- Hello, Horacio.

483
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:22,276
- Everything OK?
- May I speak with you?

484
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,945
Yes, sure. Come in, come in.

485
00:37:25,738 --> 00:37:27,532
<i>Let's talk about the incorruptibles.</i>

486
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:30,702
I'm listening.

487
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:42,088
I've been instructed to tell you that
if you cease and desist your operations,

488
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:45,675
you will receive
a one-time payment of six million.

489
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:49,512
Horacio... that's US dollars,
not pesos.

490
00:37:52,264 --> 00:37:53,933
Instructed by whom?

491
00:37:55,894 --> 00:37:57,812
I think you can guess.

492
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:01,148
Say the name.

493
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:02,984
You know who.

494
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:05,653
Say the name, Rodrigo.

495
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:11,617
Escobar.

496
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:21,252
Don't look at me like that, Horacio.
I've always cared for you.

497
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:25,715
I'm making this suggestion to save
you and your family from terrible grief.

498
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:30,219
This man has tentacles.

499
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:33,139
I'm surprised
he hasn't killed you already.

500
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:36,183
Get out.

501
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:40,063
Horacio, please...

502
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:49,697
Horacio...

503
00:38:58,456 --> 00:38:59,707
Take care.

504
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:09,926
I was driving to the church.

505
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,762
Was with my buddy, John.
He was my best man.

506
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:16,849
We were late.

507
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:19,978
It was fucking blazing outside,
110 degrees.

508
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:23,230
Whole bridal party was there
sweating their balls off, I'm sure.

509
00:39:24,816 --> 00:39:28,069
And all of a sudden, I stopped the car.

510
00:39:28,153 --> 00:39:30,196
Please don't tell me
you left her at the altar.

511
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:32,991
I don't know if she actually
made it to the altar.

512
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:39,246
Well, you saved her
a lifetime of hell.

513
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,001
Yeah, she forgave me. Eventually.

514
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:46,587
- Married a stockbroker from Dallas.
- Hm.

515
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:49,548
Randy... I think.

516
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:55,221
Trust me, she's better off.

517
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:01,686
What if Father Sobrino talks?

518
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:05,106
He's gonna talk.

519
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:37,429
It's about time, Navegante.

520
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:44,812
Sorry I'm late. I couldn't came before.

521
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:46,898
What do you got?

522
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:50,317
Gacha's going tonight to Cartagena.

523
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:56,699
I can help you get him.

524
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:59,368
You said you had information.
You didn't say Gacha.

525
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,872
I guess is your lucky day.

526
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:12,631
- What's the informant's motivation?
- Could be money.

527
00:41:12,798 --> 00:41:16,177
The reward for Gacha is one million US.
I'd say that's pretty good motivation.

528
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:19,097
He spends his life on the run
if we don't catch him.

529
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,100
- Something else going on with this guy.
- It's worth taking a risk.

530
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,523
Peña, you go to Cartagena.
Solely in an observational capacity.

531
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:33,236
We want this man captured alive,
if possible.

532
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:34,653
Murphy stays here in Bogotá.

533
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:37,115
Gaviria's press conference is tonight,

534
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:41,035
and I wanna be sure whatever
he plans to say, he gets to say it.

535
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:44,789
Yes, ma'am.

536
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:47,166
That's a beautiful dress,
Ambassador Noonan.

537
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:52,338
Come on, Father. Ah, yeah. Talk!

538
00:41:55,258 --> 00:41:58,010
Huh?

539
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:03,975
Huh?

540
00:42:04,183 --> 00:42:07,228
More? You want more?

541
00:42:07,312 --> 00:42:10,689
No! No more, please! No more!

542
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,900
No more!

543
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:15,486
Ah, he's all yours.
He's ready to talk.

544
00:42:16,445 --> 00:42:17,613
Father...

545
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:21,993
how did Elisa Alvaro get away?

546
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,504
She left with the American woman.

547
00:42:35,547 --> 00:42:38,550
Murphy's wife.

548
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:44,140
I just don't understand.
How'd you get involved with communists?

549
00:42:44,223 --> 00:42:46,225
Have you actually met a communist?

550
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:48,686
Yeah, I have, actually...
and she lied to me.

551
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:50,604
Well, I'm not a communist, Connie.

552
00:42:50,813 --> 00:42:54,233
I'm fighting against poverty,
corruption, injustice and greed.

553
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,944
But I guess Americans
don't have the same problem.

554
00:42:57,028 --> 00:42:58,321
Don't we?

555
00:42:58,404 --> 00:42:59,947
It's not the same.

556
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:02,283
Look, I just wish
you'd been straight with me.

557
00:43:03,742 --> 00:43:04,994
I'm sorry.

558
00:43:05,703 --> 00:43:07,038
Perhaps I should go.

559
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:12,043
You can't just go.
Look, if they find you, they'll kill you.

560
00:43:13,878 --> 00:43:17,048
I fell in love with a man...
with a good man.

561
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:19,717
And I was hoping
to do something good.

562
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,722
But instead, I fell into something...
else, something more violent.

563
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:28,642
Yeah, that makes two of us.

564
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:36,025
I'll see you when I get home.

565
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:43,782
Here, Elisa's ID.

566
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:46,952
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Take her to Cumaral.

567
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:48,537
My contact there agreed to hide her.

568
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,039
While you go to Cartagena?

569
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:52,250
I can't believe this shit.

570
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,044
- Who made this?
- Brother, what do you suggest we do?

571
00:43:55,127 --> 00:43:56,587
Jump out of a window?

572
00:43:59,048 --> 00:44:00,341
Look, she's...

573
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:04,845
- She's important.
- To who?

574
00:44:05,804 --> 00:44:07,098
To us.

575
00:44:14,605 --> 00:44:19,277
I take care of Elisa...
you better fucking get Gacha.

576
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:29,703
Finally, a romantic date.

577
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:32,331
It's been a long time
since we've been alone.

578
00:44:32,415 --> 00:44:37,920
Mm. Just you, me...
and our bodyguard.

579
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:44,551
Like the old days when we were young
and your father watched us.

580
00:44:44,635 --> 00:44:48,139
- Mm. My father adored you.
- Yeah, right.

581
00:45:07,992 --> 00:45:10,119
Garcia...

582
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:27,678
Hello? Yes.

583
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:33,309
Yes.

584
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:37,688
But he's all right?

585
00:45:40,691 --> 00:45:42,026
All right.

586
00:45:58,584 --> 00:46:00,378
Ana?

587
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:12,515
Ana?

588
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:23,025
Ana?

589
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:28,406
Ana!

590
00:46:31,576 --> 00:46:35,871
A little bird... came into the house.

591
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:37,582
I'm helping it out.

592
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,010
What?

593
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:57,351
There was an assassination attempt...

594
00:46:59,437 --> 00:47:01,897
on Colonel Carrillo.

595
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,274
Did someone die?

596
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:06,902
One of his men.

597
00:47:08,987 --> 00:47:11,240
It must be terrible,

598
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:13,534
the position you're in.

599
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:16,912
I want you to know
I think you are very brave.

600
00:47:19,748 --> 00:47:23,502
I'm not brave. Not like Galán.

601
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:26,797
That fear keeps you alive.

602
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:30,926
That's what none of them understand.

603
00:47:34,763 --> 00:47:38,309
I will support any decision you make.

604
00:47:45,732 --> 00:47:49,528
<i>It's been said that
nothing gives the fearful more courage...</i>

605
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:52,448
<i>than another's fear.</i>

606
00:47:55,826 --> 00:48:01,081
<i>Luis Carlos Galán
had made a decision that cost his life.</i>

607
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,003
<i>And now, it was Gaviria's turn.</i>

608
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,133
Welcome, American press.

609
00:48:11,216 --> 00:48:14,219
Tonight, I have the great pleasure

610
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:18,307
of introducing candidate César Gaviria.

611
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:42,206
It has long been
our government's policy...

612
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:49,838
to deal with every man equally...
in the eyes of the law.

613
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:53,217
So...

614
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:15,239
Colombians say...

615
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:19,702
God made our land so beautiful...

616
00:49:20,786 --> 00:49:23,288
it was unfair to the rest of the world.

617
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,167
So to even the score...

618
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:34,258
God populated the land...
with a race of evil men.

619
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:42,683
<i>The primary impediment
to a free and uninhibited future</i>

620
00:49:42,891 --> 00:49:48,731
<i>is the violence and terror
that currently grips our beloved country.</i>

621
00:49:50,148 --> 00:49:54,903
A violence initiated by these evil men...

622
00:49:55,987 --> 00:49:58,407
will be brought to justice...

623
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,994
in the name of decency...

624
00:50:05,581 --> 00:50:08,083
and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.

625
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:10,711
<i>We will extradite.</i>

626
00:50:11,462 --> 00:50:15,966
<i>This decision...
will not come from fear.</i>

627
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:20,887
It has come from a clarity of judgment...

628
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:25,768
free from the cloud of terror
that surrounds us

629
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:27,311
and obscures our view.

630
00:50:29,938 --> 00:50:34,443
I can say only one thing to Colombians
in these times of peril:

631
00:50:38,864 --> 00:50:41,492
There will be a future.

632
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:49,541
Thank you.

633
00:51:40,008 --> 00:51:41,259
<i>Hello?</i>

634
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:44,680
You think you're hot shit?

635
00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:47,140
You should change your satellite phone.

636
00:51:49,017 --> 00:51:50,435
Who is this?

637
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:54,105
<i>Your mother's in Rionegro
with that tub of lard you call your son.</i>

638
00:51:55,232 --> 00:51:58,527
<i>And your wife was at Carrera 11 today,
shopping for clothes.</i>

639
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,655
You bastard son of a bitch,
you think that...

640
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:04,575
What, you think because you're a cop
I'm afraid of you or something?

641
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:07,912
<i>You know where my family is, fag,
well, I know where yours is, too.</i>

642
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:09,996
<i>- Don't forget that.</i>
- Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.

643
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,249
Why don't you take money
like everyone else?

644
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:15,085
I could have had you living like a king.
But now, guess what?

645
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:20,591
Time to kill your dad, your mom,
your kids, your entire family,

646
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:22,885
and you should be smart enough to realize

647
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:27,472
I have each and every one of them
under watch, you fucking bastard.

648
00:52:27,556 --> 00:52:30,058
<i>Not everyone's for sale, Pablo.</i>

649
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:32,978
<i>You just keep hiding,
and I will find you.</i>

650
00:52:33,061 --> 00:52:34,438
<i>Don't know when...</i>

651
00:52:34,646 --> 00:52:36,440
but I will find you.

652
00:52:37,232 --> 00:52:38,901
And when I find you...

653
00:52:39,902 --> 00:52:41,695
- I'm going to kill you.
- <i>I'm going to kill you</i>

654
00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:44,197
and your entire family,
you son of a bitch!

655
00:53:05,594 --> 00:53:07,679
It's war, then.

656
