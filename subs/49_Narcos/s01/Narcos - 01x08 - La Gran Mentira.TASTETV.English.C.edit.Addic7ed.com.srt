1
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:06,457
There's no respect.
I couldn't even grab the cigarettes.

2
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:11,462
I'm gonna shoot every fucking hostage
in the head. That's right.

3
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:12,671
Who's doing this?

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,549
Carrillo and Search Bloc,
I'm sure of it.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,220
- In the middle of our negotiations?
- Either Gaviria is trying to catch me...

6
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:28,104
...or Carrillo doesn't give a shit
about the negotiations.

7
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:32,566
You know what we have to do, Pablo.
We have to close the deal fast...

8
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,819
before they find us and kill us.

9
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:40,241
Not before we build our own jail.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,954
And that fucking pussy president
will have to agree to that,

11
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:48,833
even if I have to stick a bomb up his ass.

12
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,919
It's so fucking cold.
Is there a jacket there for me?

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,340
- Check it out, fag.
- What's up?

14
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:01,052
It's a miniskirt with your name on it.

15
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:03,348
- "Gustavo Gaviria."
- Give me that.

16
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:09,312
All right, let's call the boys.

17
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:16,402
And what about you?
Are you all right?

18
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:19,363
If Gaviria'd let us put US boots
on the ground,

19
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:21,657
we would've caught the son of a bitch
in five minutes.

20
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:24,784
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Escobar is a lot smarter than he looks.

21
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,953
- Oh, shit.
-  Hold on, hold on!

22
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,831
We picked up a signal in the woods
surrounding the target area.

23
00:01:29,832 --> 00:01:31,875
OK, boys, we're in the clear.

24
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:34,711
Pick us up at El Mariano pass.

25
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:38,423
- We got new Escobar coordinates.
- Smarter than he looks, huh?

26
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:40,051
Yeah, don't count your chickens just yet.

27
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:44,262
We have a tracking signal
on the phone presumed to be Escobar's,

28
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:46,390
five clicks from the finca.

29
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:49,351
Request Colombian units to be sent ASAP.

30
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:50,894
Search Bloc,

31
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:54,606
we are registering the latitude
and longitude at a fixed point.

32
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:57,193
The subject appears
to have stopped moving.

33
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,531
You've gotta be shitting me.

35
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:42,256
I know.

36
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:51,056
He got away.

37
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:54,268
Again.

38
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:56,854
- Shh.
- You hear what I said?

39
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,150
Come on.

40
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:06,196
Yeah, I'm a little preoccupied, Steve.

41
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:08,533
I think she's got colic.

42
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:10,742
What is that?

43
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:13,996
Well, it means she can't sleep,
which means neither can I.

44
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:18,333
Did you call the orphanages?

45
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:21,879
You think I could explain the situation
in English, let alone Spanish?

46
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:25,048
I still don't understand
why you brought her back here.

47
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,676
Well, let's take her to a hospital.

48
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:30,928
No, Steve, we can't just take her to
a hospital. It's not like a puppy shelter.

49
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:34,266
Look, I know you're busy, but we've gotta
figure out what we're gonna do with her.

50
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,892
There's a war going on, Connie.

51
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:38,311
You said it was only
gonna be for a couple of days.

52
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:41,357
It's already been a week.
What are we doing here?

53
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:46,194
- Is that my t-shirt?
- We're out of diapers.

54
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:49,615
Why don't you go get some more before
she shits through your whole closet?

55
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,506
How nice to see
that you have made friends.

56
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:09,593
Careful, son.
This woman is very clever.

57
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:12,637
She can grab your gun
and shoot you in the head.

58
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:14,181
My apologies, boss.

59
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:28,237
How do you feel?

60
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:32,909
As well as one might expect.

61
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,704
I need you to record another tape for me.

62
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:39,874
No.

63
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:43,502
No, not until you free more hostages.

64
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:48,757
Maruja is very ill.
Ricardo has an ulcer.

65
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:51,635
I'm the only one you need to negotiate.

66
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:55,180
Then why does the Colombian government
keep trying to capture me?

67
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:58,684
Look...

68
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,438
I admire your bravery very much.

69
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:09,402
But Gaviria is a piece of shit, and,
with all due respect, so is your father.

70
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,280
And what did you expect?

71
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,366
To get into Congress
like it was nothing?

72
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,621
Without it mattering that you,
in fact, traffic drugs?

73
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,541
I expected respect.

74
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:28,213
You had respect
when you built homes for the poor.

75
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:34,177
But when you didn't get that respect
from a herd of egocentric bureaucrats,

76
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,930
you threw a tantrum.

77
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:43,813
I was going to do marvelous things
for this country.

78
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:50,861
If I have made myself into a monster,
like all of you say,

79
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:54,698
that is the fault of people
like your father...

80
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,576
and those politicians "of always."

81
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,996
Those oligarchs and those people

82
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:05,082
were never going to tolerate
that little paisa from Medellín

83
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:10,923
who had more money
and was more intelligent than all of them.

84
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,885
Yes.

85
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:17,596
You would have done marvelous things.

86
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:20,975
And that is the saddest part.

87
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:27,731
Mr. Escobar has promised
to free two more hostages.

88
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:33,110
But in exchange, he has asked that you
continue negotiations with transparency.

89
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:37,991
President Gaviria...
he knows what you are doing.

90
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:40,410
He knows.

91
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:44,749
If you insist on trying to capture him
with the help of the Americans...

92
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:49,003
they're going to kill us all.

93
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,634
You are risking my daughter's life!

94
00:07:56,635 --> 00:08:00,179
No, Nydia, with all due respect,
we are not risking anyone's life.

95
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,976
Our priority is the life of your daughter
and the lives of the rest of the hostages.

96
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,688
But our priority
is also to capture Escobar.

97
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:10,440
You cannot have both things at once.

98
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:13,527
Negotiate with Escobar
while trying to capture him?

99
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:16,238
Do you know what he is demanding?

100
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,578
That we call a constitutional referendum
to abolish extradition.

101
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:28,041
That he only plead guilty
to having trafficked drugs one time.

102
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:31,669
And worst of all,
he wants to build his own jail

103
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,131
and have his own guards
to watch over him.

104
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:37,509
This is a deal with the devil.

105
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:42,056
You are the president of a country
that became a living hell some time ago.

106
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:45,476
With whom else did you expect
to be making a deal?

107
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:50,647
Gaviria could easier
cut a hundred deals with the devil

108
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,983
before he could cut one with Pablo.

109
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:56,694
Bowing to Pablo's demands
was political suicide.

110
00:08:56,695 --> 00:09:00,615
So, he did what politicians do best:
he stalled.

111
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:04,243
He kept our planes in the air
and prayed to God that we got a hit.

112
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,871
Hello. It's Gorilla.

113
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,207
Ground units,
begin trilateration for signal origin.

114
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,130
And when we did, it was
not the hit that we were hoping for.

115
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,258
Forgive me, Gorilla, I don't feel well.

116
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,346
Miss Diana...

117
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,183
why are you so unpleasant with the boss?

118
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,980
You are loyal like a sheep,
aren't you?

119
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:39,029
That man is your kidnapper... and mine,
and that of the whole nation.

120
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,614
Here, you go first.

121
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,858
Hide in here, quickly!

122
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,967
Who would've thought a failed raid
would result in Escobar's biggest victory?

123
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:46,889
Pablo didn't even have
to pull the trigger. We did it for him.

124
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,434
Guys, we have a problem.

125
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:58,066
For the battle-fatigued
citizens of Colombia,

126
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:00,902
Diana's death was the final straw.

127
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:03,362
This wasn't just an oligarch dying.

128
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:07,826
Her presence on the nation's TV screens
and in their homes transcended class.

129
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,037
The people were devastated.

130
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:14,833
For President Gaviria,
there was little room left to move.

131
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,255
Mr. President!

132
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,924
You killed my daughter.

133
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,426
Let her pass.

134
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:26,137
Wait...

135
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,433
If you had accepted his terms,
my daughter would still be alive!

136
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,938
Give him whatever he wants.

137
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,691
Don't let others go through the suffering
we've had to endure.

138
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:43,237
Mr. President... we need to leave.

139
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:51,954
God be with you, Nydia.

140
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,640
There's something
I want to make very clear.

141
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:17,688
You are not to blame for Diana's death.
OK? That has to be clear.

142
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:22,317
Escobar has the resources
for this to go on forever.

143
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,068
Yes, and so do we.

144
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,778
We are the state.

145
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,699
We are going to fight, do whatever we have
to do, and we are going to finish him.

146
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,367
We have options.

147
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:36,331
For instance, why don't we allow
the American military to come in?

148
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:40,251
I know-- We don't like it.
I personally don't like it.

149
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:43,129
But if it's a specific, clear mission--

150
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,421
- No.
- Something covert.

151
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:45,549
No!

152
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,348
It's time to end all of this.

153
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:59,063
Give Escobar what he wants.

154
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:03,817
Let's go.

155
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,583
If your Congress
abolishes extradition, we lose our teeth.

156
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,544
- We're a paper fucking tiger!
- Everything we have done is lost.

157
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:24,338
We have no choice.

158
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:28,423
The people, the public... it's tired
of all these bombs and bloodshed!

159
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,051
Right, and business goes as usual,

160
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:32,387
- he just runs it from that jail.
- Exactly!

161
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:36,016
All things considered,
it's a victory to put Escobar in jail.

162
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:38,810
For public relations?

163
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,645
It's capitulation.

164
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,981
You want Escobar.

165
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:45,734
Why?

166
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,736
Why?

167
00:13:48,737 --> 00:13:53,824
Because you want to parade him
in your DEA jackets?

168
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:55,827
You think this is a game, right?

169
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,330
This is Colombia,
and our people want peace!

170
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:01,499
This is not a fucking game!

171
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:12,927
Well...
at this time, our friend, Fernando,

172
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:15,680
is going to tell us a little something.

173
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:22,019
The Colombian government is going
to allow Pablo to turn himself in,

174
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:28,067
accepting only one simple charge:
drug trafficking.

175
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,278
And...

176
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,655
they are going to let him build a jail

177
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:38,702
which the police
cannot be within three kilometers of.

178
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:42,206
At last...
we have liberated ourselves from tyranny!

179
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:45,543
- Long live Colombia, motherfuckers.
- ¡Viva!

180
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,213
- Fernando...
- Mm?

181
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:52,467
- ...thank you very much.
- No problem, Pablo.

182
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:57,305
And do you know when Congress
is going to vote to abolish extradition?

183
00:14:57,306 --> 00:15:02,393
Mm! Yes, it's--
It's a matter of... of weeks.

184
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:06,272
And at that time, you will be able
to turn yourself over to the authorities.

185
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,859
It pleases me very much to finish my work
with you with such a great victory.

186
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,031
No, brother. Now is when I am
going to need your services the most.

187
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,787
- How-- How's that?
- Fernando...

188
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:28,462
now it's time for us to find legal means
to reduce my sentence even more.

189
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:33,967
Right?

190
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:58,241
And what does this mean for us, huh?

191
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:04,331
It means, my love...
that now I have a jail.

192
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:11,422
And for you,
visiting days will be...

193
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:15,216
every day.

194
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:17,802
- I'm serious, Pablo.
- So am I.

195
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:22,973
The problem, Pablo, is that...

196
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:26,477
now that you have admitted
to trafficking in narcotics,

197
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:30,023
my image as a journalist
cannot be associated with yours.

198
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:34,570
Hm.

199
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,240
So then...

200
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:47,624
now you think I am going to damage your
credibility as a journalist... is that it?

201
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,961
You understand what I'm saying.

202
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:54,923
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do.

203
00:16:56,925 --> 00:17:02,638
I think that... it's time for me

204
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,604
to set you free, so that...
you can find a boyfriend who's honest...

205
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:15,025
so that you can get a little house,
have little kids,

206
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:17,445
- little dogs...
- Don't joke around, Pablo.

207
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:19,406
No, I'm not joking.

208
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,286
I just want you to know...

209
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,789
that you, Valeria...

210
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:32,336
are a bandit, just like me.

211
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:39,635
So don't come to me with bullshit.

212
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,487
Looks like you got away with it,
eh, asshole?

213
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,289
Shit, I'd thought you'd gone crazy.

214
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:21,800
Geniuses...
are always branded as crazy.

215
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,638
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

216
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,729
- The Ochoas...
- The Ochoas what?

217
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:36,815
You can bet
they're going to be pissed off.

218
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,694
Because of the treaty?

219
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,739
Or because you're fucking their sister?

220
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:58,255
That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo.

221
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,472
Let's hope they don't
charge you for it later.

222
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:09,890
The race was on.

223
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:13,603
Pablo needed to build his jail
as fast as possible.

224
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:17,898
As for his enemies, they needed
to get to him before that happened.

225
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:21,569
As soon as he walked inside,
Pablo would be safe.

226
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,197
And everyone on the outside wouldn't.

227
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:28,534
We got an official cease
and desist order for any further operation

228
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,787
when Pablo officially surrenders.

229
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:34,249
- Search Bloc is gonna be disbanded.
-  We heard the terms.

230
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,794
- No cops within two miles of the prison.
- This is a fucking sham.

231
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,171
It's a death warrant for my men.

232
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,508
I won't be able to protect them.

233
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,178
I won't let that happen.

234
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,769
There are cops that hate Escobar
just as much as I do.

235
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:56,313
More.

236
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,651
They're not gonna stop
just because they're told to.

237
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,028
You talking about vigilantes?

238
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:09,116
Call it what you like... but I'm still
gonna need those intel reports.

239
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:12,035
- We'll get you anything we find.
- Javi, you gotta cool it with that shit.

240
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,706
They know we've been helping.
One more and we're out.

241
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,583
I thought you said you were all in.

242
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:20,044
The soccer field will be over here.

243
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:26,342
Here, I want to have
a little doll house for Manuela,

244
00:20:26,343 --> 00:20:31,847
and downstairs,
a bar with a Jacuzzi for the guys.

245
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:34,392
My family will live in a house
down the hill.

246
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:38,647
I'm going to install a telescope
so I can look at them whenever I want.

247
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:41,774
Yeah, right. More like
you can look at other girls' asses.

248
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:46,655
No. The family, the family.
To see my kids.

249
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:52,034
- What can we do to help you, Pablo?
- Well...

250
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:55,245
while we're in prison,
Gustavo and me,

251
00:20:55,246 --> 00:21:01,085
I will count on you, Moncada, and you,
Galeano, to oversee operations.

252
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,505
Thank you, Pablo.

253
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:09,760
We're privileged to be given
that responsibility. You can count on us.

254
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:13,556
We've already spoken about the operational
plan and everything's clear, right?

255
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:15,684
Yes. We won't let you down, Pablo.

256
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:18,019
Did you tell them about the tax?

257
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:21,564
- No, I didn't.
- The tax?

258
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:23,525
What tax is this?

259
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:28,029
Who paid for the war we fought?

260
00:21:28,238 --> 00:21:29,614
You.

261
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:34,745
- You, Don Pablo.
- That's right.

262
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,748
We have peace now.

263
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:42,419
You're going to directly
benefit from that.

264
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,883
It's only fair that you contribute
to the legal and security costs

265
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:51,636
that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.

266
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:55,431
And about how much will that be?

267
00:21:55,432 --> 00:22:00,061
We agreed to what,
$200,000 a month, right?

268
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,396
Yes, 200 grand.

269
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:04,732
200 grand?

270
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:08,736
That's a lot of money, brother.
A lot of money.

271
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:10,696
But consider it done.

272
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:14,992
And again... thank you
very much for this responsibility,

273
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,579
- and for considering us.
- All right, then.

274
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:21,416
Don Pablo. All right. Gustavo.

275
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:33,176
Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?

276
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:37,139
Why should I let them
reap the fruits of our labor

277
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,975
without compensating us for it, Gustavo?

278
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:43,730
I agree with you.

279
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:49,152
But right now, we really
need those two fags to be loyal.

280
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,405
And what?
You don't think I inspire loyalty?

281
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:55,950
My loyalty?
Yes, you know you have it.

282
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:58,077
But I'm not sure about everyone else's.

283
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:02,873
You know, the thing is, Pablo...
you won.

284
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:05,250
There's no arguing that.

285
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,169
But you gave in.

286
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,840
And there are people
who will see that as weakness.

287
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:15,762
We've gotta keep our enemies close,
now more than ever.

288
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:21,726
Thank you.

289
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:26,731
It's great to see you again, Valeria.

290
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:31,485
Likewise, Pacho.
I'm very happy to see you.

291
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:35,866
Although, I must say...
it was a little unexpected.

292
00:23:37,074 --> 00:23:39,494
We are worried about you.

293
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:43,665
And... why are "we" worried?

294
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:47,167
Pablo's cutting a deal
with the government.

295
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:49,128
He's going to have
to admit to certain things.

296
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:53,591
Things that may damage
your reputation by association.

297
00:23:56,093 --> 00:24:01,349
If I'm good at anything,
it's protecting my reputation.

298
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:04,519
Listen, this time it's different.

299
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:10,984
Look... you helped create
that "Robin Hood Paisa" bullshit.

300
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:15,738
And when it all goes to shit, you'll have
to take responsibility for that.

301
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,616
Maybe he tricked me, too.
Like the rest of the world.

302
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,868
You have enemies, see?

303
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,746
They're not gonna
let you get away with it.

304
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:26,040
Look, Valeria...

305
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:31,629
we have a lot of connections in New York,
a strong presence, you could say.

306
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:35,007
You should go there,
at least for a little while.

307
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,384
And leave Colombia.

308
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:39,720
There are a million Colombians there.

309
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:42,556
A new audience.

310
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:45,602
And they don't care if you shared your bed
with a monster or not.

311
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,899
Just for a while.

312
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,986
When this is all over, you'll be able to
come back here with your head held high,

313
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,154
I guarantee it.

314
00:24:58,155 --> 00:25:03,160
And not only that, you'll have earned
a brand-new audience in the United States.

315
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:09,124
- Betrayal is not my style.
- What betrayal?

316
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,962
And what would you be betraying?

317
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:15,256
Your role as his mistress?

318
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:22,512
You remain loyal to a man who has never
thought you good enough to be his wife.

319
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:25,265
His wife? Me?

320
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:28,018
No, no, no,
you're very much mistaken, my dear.

321
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:29,980
The last thing I want
is to be married to him.

322
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:34,275
Besides...
do you think I'd want to be his wife?

323
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:40,864
Do you think I want to be locked up,
waiting all day at the Monaco building,

324
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:42,659
while he's out with...

325
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:46,329
with me?

326
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:49,457
No.

327
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,585
That's too boring.

328
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:03,596
I missed you so much.

329
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:06,432
I missed you, too.

330
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:18,486
No, it was terrible.

331
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,071
It was terrible.

332
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:23,783
Every day in a different house...

333
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:27,620
worried about you...

334
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:30,707
the kids...

335
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:38,089
The truth is...

336
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:43,594
it's very good to be home.

337
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,223
- You look happy.
- Of course.

338
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,521
That time has passed.

339
00:26:54,898 --> 00:26:59,152
It's the happiest face I've ever seen
on a man about to go to jail.

340
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:07,993
- The kids!
-  The kids, Pablo!

341
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,452
- The kids!
- No, Tata!

342
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,663
- I have to go to them!
- Stay here!

343
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,290
- My children!
- Stay here!

344
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:16,460
I'll go get them. Stay here.

345
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:20,631
Juan Pablo!

346
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:23,508
Juan Pablo!

347
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,468
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

348
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:26,763
Come on.

349
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:34,437
Go to your mother.
Go to your mother.

350
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,567
Come on, come on.

351
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:51,203
The explosion was
from a car bomb on the street below,

352
00:27:51,204 --> 00:27:53,622
about 800 pounds' worth of dynamite.

353
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:56,499
It made little Manuela
forever deaf in one ear.

354
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,877
In this war,

355
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:01,589
the innocent always seemed
to be the ones who got hurt.

356
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,929
For Escobar, the Monaco bombing
told him two things:

357
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:13,350
First, it showed him that the cops
weren't his biggest problem.

358
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:16,728
They would never use a bomb.

359
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:22,318
This was a new player, one that
wasn't above going after his family.

360
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:25,238
Don't worry, cousin.

361
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,575
We're going to kill them all.

362
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:34,956
Second, and the one
that fucked with his head the most...

363
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:43,589
was that for the first time in his life...
someone had given him up.

364
00:28:45,382 --> 00:28:48,845
And worse yet,
he had no idea who.

365
00:28:57,228 --> 00:28:58,436
Hello?

366
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:02,065
Valeria, there was an attempted hit
at the Monaco building.

367
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:06,987
- Just now?
- Yes, a few minutes ago. A car bomb.

368
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,325
- Who was inside?
- We don't know.

369
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:13,618
What other information do you have?

370
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,663
That's all the information
we have right now.

371
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:18,415
OK, thanks.

372
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:45,526
He always takes her to the same motel.

373
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:51,574
- Marina.
- Where are you going?

374
00:29:53,076 --> 00:29:55,160
I'm going to the city.

375
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,372
I have to get out of this prison.

376
00:29:58,373 --> 00:30:01,167
- Come here, Marina.
- Yes?

377
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:06,838
Have a good time.

378
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,674
Be safe.

379
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,094
Thanks.

380
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,022
You know what he's going to do, right?

381
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:26,566
He's going to continue conducting
his business behind those walls

382
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:30,153
that are protected
by the Colombian government.

383
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:33,115
We should give him credit.
The man is a genius.

384
00:30:33,116 --> 00:30:37,161
Well... all the more reason
that we should negotiate our surrender.

385
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,789
But you know that Pablo
took it upon himself to close that door.

386
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,999
So we need to take advantage
of your political contacts,

387
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,586
especially General Jaramillo.

388
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:48,338
Can you talk to him for us?

389
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:50,840
Yes, of course.

390
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:53,509
But I don't think it will be enough.

391
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,886
What are you saying?

392
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:58,140
That you're going
to have to offer something more,

393
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:01,894
something that interests them enough
to make a deal with you.

394
00:31:03,854 --> 00:31:05,440
Gustavo Gaviria.

395
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:09,318
He is the key to Pablo's business.

396
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,612
If that son of a bitch goes down,
the whole empire goes down.

397
00:31:14,449 --> 00:31:16,367
Indeed, that could work.

398
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:19,287
That could work.

399
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:25,959
It is often said
there is no honor among thieves.

400
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,711
That's doubly true of drug dealers.

401
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:32,425
The Ochoas, with the help of Cali,
made their own surrender deal.

402
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:35,677
No extradition, no stiff sentence.

403
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:39,349
The Colombian government
was willing to overlook their part

404
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:43,977
in the largest cocaine empire
on the face of the earth.

405
00:31:43,978 --> 00:31:46,521
Instead, they would
serve reduced sentences.

406
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:48,648
- The charge?
-  Follow me.

407
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:52,694
Illegally importing bulls from Spain.
I shit you not.

408
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:55,489
They went to jail
with smiles on their faces,

409
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,116
'cause all they had to do
was use their sister as bait

410
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:01,120
to catch a fish the cops actually wanted.

411
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,733
Kiss me.

412
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:51,420
- You look pretty, baby.
- Yeah, sure.

413
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:54,465
What I mean is
you've always looked pretty.

414
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:07,311
Gustavo.

415
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:13,943
What's happening?

416
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:16,528
Nothing.

417
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:20,449
Nothing is happening here.
Isn't that right, Colonel Carrillo?

418
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,326
That's up to you.

419
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:28,790
- Say goodbye.
-  No.

420
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,167
No, no, no.
Gustavo, look at me. Gustav--

421
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:33,002
Does your family know where you are?

422
00:33:33,003 --> 00:33:34,713
- Gustavo!
- Calm down, Marina.

423
00:33:38,134 --> 00:33:41,971
You're making a big mistake, Carrillo.

424
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:47,225
We're already in negotiations
with the government.

425
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:50,563
- You have no reason to be doing this.
- You're right.

426
00:33:52,189 --> 00:33:54,066
That's why I'm not here.

427
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,071
Then what the fuck do you want?

428
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:02,866
Don't act stupid.

429
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:07,997
Give me your cousin...
and I'll let you live.

430
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:16,464
All right.

431
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,551
Kill me, then, motherfucker.

432
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:23,596
I won't do that myself.

433
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:29,726
But I want to introduce you to some people
who would love to do it for me.

434
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:33,897
This guy? This is Lastia.

435
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:40,903
His sister died in a bookstore in Bogotá
in a bombing you coordinated.

436
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:42,948
She was 17 years old.

437
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:45,868
And this guy here...

438
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:51,248
this is Trujillo.

439
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:57,921
You killed his father
and his brother for being cops.

440
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:02,968
- That has nothing to do with me.
- No?

441
00:35:04,554 --> 00:35:10,059
You know...
if you support evil, you are evil.

442
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,936
Look at them.

443
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:15,523
I just want you to look at their faces.

444
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:18,859
A few of the victims
you've left in your wake.

445
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:21,612
Tell me...

446
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:27,076
have you ever felt
the swift vengeance of justice?

447
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:33,915
Give me your cousin...

448
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:37,587
or I'll let these men
show you that vengeance with their fists.

449
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:55,020
Do it, then...
you sons of bitches.

450
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,813
OK, then.

451
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:04,447
We'll see how you feel...
after ten minutes.

452
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,116
Do it.

453
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:35,852
Tell me where your cousin is.

454
00:36:36,771 --> 00:36:39,440
It doesn't have to end like this.

455
00:36:59,502 --> 00:37:01,712
Tell me where your cousin is.

456
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,470
We...

457
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:15,518
are bandits...
not snitches, motherfucker.

458
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:36,788
You're--
You're all gonna die, motherfuckers!

459
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,666
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

460
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,377
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

461
00:37:42,378 --> 00:37:48,424
You, your families,
your wives are all dead, motherfuckers!

462
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:49,635
You're all dead!

463
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:56,725
Dump his body on the road to Sabaneta.

464
00:37:56,726 --> 00:37:59,353
Colonel, they're going
to make us pay for this.

465
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:05,692
Report his death as a result
of a shoot-out with the police.

466
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:08,362
Make sure you report that he fired first.

467
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:10,531
But Colonel, he's all beat up.

468
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,206
That work for you?

469
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:37,182
There is nothing... more beautiful
and more important in my life than this.

470
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:42,354
We're all here together... united.

471
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:49,069
Now let's eat and enjoy
this marvelous food.

472
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:54,991
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, yeah, the beets.

473
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,453
- Tata?
- Boss?

474
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,873
Hello, son. Have a seat.

475
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:04,835
- Sit down--
- Boss, I don't know how to say this.

476
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,172
Tell me like a man.

477
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,342
- Gustavo is dead.
- What?

478
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:19,098
They found his body on the outskirts
of Sabaneta, badly beaten.

479
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:21,017
How's that?

480
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,645
They also shot him, boss.

481
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:25,856
No, no!
How dare you come to my house saying that!

482
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:29,150
How dare you!
Leave! Get out of my house!

483
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:32,946
You... you are leaving right now!
Get out of my house! Go on!

484
00:39:32,947 --> 00:39:36,616
No! Gustavo, no. Pablo...
Go on! Get out of here!

485
00:39:36,617 --> 00:39:40,913
It's OK.
Everything's going to be fine.

486
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,425
Are you sure about this?

487
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:55,511
Yes, boss.

488
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:02,559
I want you to take him
to the funeral home...

489
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:07,731
and guard his body the entire time
until it's buried.

490
00:40:08,858 --> 00:40:10,526
- All right.
- Go on.

491
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:23,914
How are you doing, son?

492
00:41:00,993 --> 00:41:03,495
I'm going to miss him so much, Mama.

493
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:10,126
When...

494
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:19,427
you were nine... or ten...
do you remember?

495
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:23,557
How you would
ride around on your bicycles.

496
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,855
You'd go up into the mountains
and just disappear.

497
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:34,693
The whole day would go by...

498
00:41:36,946 --> 00:41:38,447
Oh, my.

499
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:41,533
And we would call you...

500
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:47,664
We seemed crazy,
yelling for you all over the place...

501
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:53,336
until finally you would appear.

502
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:56,757
Oh, my God.

503
00:41:57,758 --> 00:41:59,969
"Where were you?"

504
00:42:00,803 --> 00:42:04,264
"Where have you been, son?"
I would yell out.

505
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:08,351
"In the mountains, Mama."

506
00:42:09,436 --> 00:42:15,943
"Higher than the clouds, Auntie,"
Gustavo would say, laughing.

507
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:24,784
He...

508
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:27,370
He always wanted to go farther.

509
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,834
He always did.

510
00:42:32,835 --> 00:42:35,253
But with you.

511
00:42:36,212 --> 00:42:38,298
Only with you.

512
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:46,056
I didn't think it would end this way.

513
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,176
Good afternoon.

514
00:43:25,137 --> 00:43:29,933
Boss? Someone came
all the way out here to see you.

515
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:35,271
Miss Valeria.

516
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:51,747
Good day, ma'am. Pablo.

517
00:43:52,622 --> 00:43:54,207
What's she doing here?

518
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:57,210
I'm here only because
I have important information.

519
00:43:57,211 --> 00:43:58,670
I hope it's very important.

520
00:43:58,879 --> 00:44:01,339
It's about Gustavo.

521
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,300
Tell us, then.

522
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:09,138
I've been told the Ochoa brothers
have been seen in Cali.

523
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:12,391
They are the ones
who turned Gustavo over,

524
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:16,145
in exchange for the cartel helping them
seal a deal with the government.

525
00:44:16,146 --> 00:44:17,480
How do you know that?

526
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:20,150
You know me, Pablo.

527
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:22,903
I have my ways.

528
00:44:31,912 --> 00:44:34,248
Who in Cali?

529
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,168
Pacho Herrera.

530
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:43,839
Pablo wanted to send a message to Cali,

531
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,094
so he ordered his sicarios
to hit them during a soccer match.

532
00:44:48,095 --> 00:44:51,431
It was very effective.

533
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:58,021
He did get 14 Cali men that day.

534
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,316
The problem was, everyone on
the soccer field was dressed the same.

535
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:12,367
By the time the sicarios spotted Pacho,

536
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:14,121
he was already running away.

537
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:20,585
"Will you hide yourself forever, Lord?

538
00:45:21,795 --> 00:45:24,755
Will your wrath burn like fire?

539
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:27,883
Remember how fleeting is my life,

540
00:45:27,884 --> 00:45:32,345
for what futility
you have created the children of men."

541
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:35,641
Pablo had Gustavo
buried in the hills of Medellín,

542
00:45:35,642 --> 00:45:37,935
where the cousins had played as kids.

543
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,645
In his mind,
losing his best friend

544
00:45:39,646 --> 00:45:43,232
was a price he had to pay
to defeat extradition.

545
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:46,736
So he ordered the burial
to take place at the exact same time

546
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:50,114
that Congress was voting to repeal it.

547
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:54,660
Whether it was Gaviria's support,
Pablo's "plata or plomo,"

548
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:57,247
or maybe people
were just sick of the violence...

549
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:00,667
extradition was defeated by a landslide.

550
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:04,295
Hours after the vote,
a military helicopter

551
00:46:04,296 --> 00:46:07,422
was dispatched to coordinates
just outside Medellín,

552
00:46:07,423 --> 00:46:09,634
where Pablo was waiting.

553
00:46:21,104 --> 00:46:24,106
As you know,
I come on behalf of President Gaviria

554
00:46:24,107 --> 00:46:25,275
and the Colombian government.

555
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:29,988
This is the offer of our terms
for your surrender.

556
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:33,406
Peña and I
had to go see it with our own eyes.

557
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:37,745
A terrorist, a drug dealer and a murderer
surrendering to a grateful nation

558
00:46:37,746 --> 00:46:40,789
who gave him everything he asked for.

559
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,920
It was the closest we'd ever come to him,
and we never felt further away.

560
00:46:45,879 --> 00:46:47,797
All right, then.

561
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,094
Let me hand over my gun.

562
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:59,142
- You won.
- We both did.

563
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:03,605
Now Gaviria can announce
that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.

564
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:08,067
Except that's not so true.

565
00:47:08,068 --> 00:47:10,320
You and I know it's a big lie.

566
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:12,155
Mm.

567
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:20,247
Lies are necessary... when the truth
is too difficult to believe. Right?

568
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,919
It wasn't a fucking surrender.

569
00:47:26,128 --> 00:47:28,922
Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.

570
00:47:29,131 --> 00:47:34,636
He was escaping it.
And all anyone could do was watch.

571
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:44,771
Once again, Escobar had used violence
to bend the world to his will.

572
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:50,067
They called it "la gran mentira,"
"the big lie."

573
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,279
And it was a lie.

574
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:57,909
Except as I watched him
fly away to his luxury prison...

575
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:01,662
I couldn't help but think
there was some truth in it.

576
00:48:01,663 --> 00:48:04,123
Damn it. Fucker.

577
00:48:04,124 --> 00:48:06,918
A truth that I hadn't
been willing to accept.

578
00:48:10,672 --> 00:48:14,217
He'd beat us because
he was willing to do what we weren't.

579
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:17,637
Bad guys don't play by the rules.

580
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,265
That's what makes 'em bad.

581
00:48:21,515 --> 00:48:23,809
Maybe that's what lets 'em win.

582
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,645
Lagarto,
are we gonna party tonight or what?

583
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:30,150
I got Poison at 400
to 1700 megahertz, gentlemen.

584
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,319
La Dispensaria.

585
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:35,737
So who do we give this to? DEA?

586
00:48:35,738 --> 00:48:39,241
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

587
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:41,119
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

588
00:48:41,911 --> 00:48:45,164
I made a promise to myself
that when the time came

589
00:48:45,165 --> 00:48:47,500
that I could strike a blow
against Escobar,

590
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:50,669
even if it meant breaking the rules,
oh, I was gonna do it.

591
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,756
- Hello?
-  Hey, Central Spike here.

592
00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:55,549
All right.

593
00:49:00,722 --> 00:49:03,891
You wanna tell me a good guy
wouldn't have pushed the buttons

594
00:49:03,892 --> 00:49:05,519
on these motherfuckers?

595
00:49:07,354 --> 00:49:09,563
You wanna call me a bad guy?

596
00:49:16,905 --> 00:49:21,450
Fine. But if you do, it just means
that you haven't met enough bad guys yet

597
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:22,618
to know the difference.

598
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:27,081
There's one thing I've learned
down here in Colombia,

599
00:49:27,082 --> 00:49:30,501
good and bad are relative concepts.

600
00:49:30,502 --> 00:49:33,628
<i>Yesterday, I fought the devil
Who they say is very brave

601
00:49:33,629 --> 00:49:38,217
<i>I hacked him with my machete so bad
That even I got freaked out

602
00:49:38,218 --> 00:49:41,262
<i>I jumped back, dodging his attack

603
00:49:41,263 --> 00:49:45,808
<i>And in one fell swoop
I cut off his tail

604
