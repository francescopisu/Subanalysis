_

3
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,424
I'm sure you recognize
some of these people, right?

4
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:40,064
Agent Peña?

5
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,128
It looks like you raided
the family album...

6
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,006
Mrs. Moncada.

7
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,263
Please, call me Judy.

8
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:53,349
Let me tell you...

9
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:57,228
before this son of a bitch
killed my husband and my brother,

10
00:00:57,311 --> 00:01:00,231
all these people were my friends.
What do you think of that?

11
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:04,777
Well, it looks to me
like you made some new friends. No?

12
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:06,413
We might say that we

13
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:09,640
share a common goal.

14
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:14,412
- The same as yours, Agent Peña.
- Is that right?

15
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:16,330
Yes.

16
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:22,002
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

17
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,380
Wait, Javier.

18
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:28,048
I'd like you to listen
to what we have to say.

19
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:32,889
You want to catch Escobar,
just like we do.

20
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:35,850
But let's not lie to ourselves.

21
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:39,312
You haven't been able
to get close to him.

22
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:44,201
The only play you had to get to him
was using Carrillo.

23
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:46,938
And we know how that ended, right?

24
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:52,075
So, you're taking a break
from burning down villages?

25
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:57,218
What we do is fill in
for an absent government.

26
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:02,140
We're going to kill everyone
close to Escobar one by one.

27
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:06,338
Until he's alone. With nothing.

28
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:10,092
What we want, Mr. Peña,

29
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:13,513
is to make Escobar understand
he is not untouchable.

30
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:15,848
We want him to be afraid.

31
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:18,309
There's just one small problem.

32
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:20,686
Just one?

33
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:27,960
To catch him, we need the satellite
technology and surveillance

34
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:29,987
that your government has, Agent Peña.

35
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:34,575
And I'm just going to...
hand that over to you?

36
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,079
We have been partners for a while now,
Agent Peña.

37
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:41,665
All the information that he gave to you,
I gave to him.

38
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:48,089
We are simply making...
a small adjustment.

39
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:02,854
Thanks for the drink.

40
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,626
Too much stupidity for my liking.

41
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,256
The Castaños can be useful.

42
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:33,009
I was talking about you.

43
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,179
Yes, Javier.

44
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:39,890
I'm a narco.

45
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,519
And I believe in honor and loyalty,
like you.

46
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:46,939
Pablo doesn't.

47
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:50,026
Berna. Go get the car.

48
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:04,040
Are you going to give me a cigarette
or what?

49
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:18,512
Mmm.

50
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,224
Well...

51
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:28,230
we really want you to realize,
Agent Peña,

52
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:31,984
the potential of what
we're offering you. Mmm?

53
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,824
Because, well...
with all the information in the world,

54
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:41,077
you still have to be a policeman, right?

55
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:49,001
I know what it feels like
when Pablo kills someone close to you.

56
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:53,673
What's that?

57
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,676
Information that would be
very valuable to you.

58
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,929
That was very easy for us to find.
Take it.

59
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:09,563
She's staying with a friend.
That little girl, Maritza.

60
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,900
The woman that betrayed you
and got Carrillo killed.

61
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:14,402
You'll find her there.

62
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:21,701
I told you we have an enemy in common.

63
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,545
If you change your mind, give us a ring.

64
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,743
Life goes on, right?

65
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:32,623
And for Escobar,
that was a pretty good thing.

66
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:36,418
He remained at large,
protected by an army of sicarios...

67
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,964
in a city that refused to give him up.

68
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:43,675
Pablo kept his lawyers
working overtime...

69
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:46,986
continuing to negotiate his surrender

70
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:49,330
with Colombian Attorney
General De Greiff.

71
00:07:50,182 --> 00:07:52,101
But it was bullshit.

72
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:54,937
Why surrender when
you're holding all the cards?

73
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:59,024
He was free. And business was booming.

74
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,651
LEADER OF THE SEARCH BLOC KILLED

75
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:03,528
For those of us tasked
with catching Escobar,

76
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:05,614
Carrillo's death was a punch in the gut.

77
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:09,785
But life went on for us as well.

78
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:13,664
Centra Spike was still busy
gathering intel.

79
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,252
The brass was still
reviewing and approving it.

80
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:21,589
And it was still finding its way to us.

81
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,550
But, shit, man...

82
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:28,637
you can have all the intelligence
in the world,

83
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,891
but if nobody's there to act on it,
what's it worth?

84
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:35,686
Nothing.

85
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:41,901
All it adds up to
is a growing stack of unread files

86
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:43,861
on a dead man's desk.

87
00:08:44,486 --> 00:08:47,990
nowhere.

88
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:51,035
Look, Dad.

89
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:52,161
Let's see.

90
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,295
- Nine point seven.
- Why?

91
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:05,382
I would've given you a ten,
but here, next to me,

92
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:09,720
is an Argentinian judge
who's very picky.

93
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:13,182
Very picky.

94
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,101
Why don't you jump in here with me?

95
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:19,271
If I dive in there,
I'd splash all the water out of the pool.

96
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:26,445
Sir, Fernando Duque is here.

97
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,574
And you...
And what are you doing, my little love?

98
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:34,411
That's it. Little kicks, little kicks.
Like a little pair of scissors.

99
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:36,455
That's right, like a little puppy.

100
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:38,040
That's it, beautiful.

101
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:40,709
Hey, ladies.

102
00:09:43,712 --> 00:09:46,340
My kids are in the pool.
Does someone know how to swim?

103
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:49,677
- Yeah, boss, they call me "Flipper."
- Flipper?

104
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,660
You talk so much shit, Blackie.

105
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:53,913
You'd sink like a rock
tied to a heavier rock.

106
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:55,308
Eat shit, Velasco.

107
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:57,768
- Velasco, I'm putting my trust in you.
- Yes, sir.

108
00:09:57,851 --> 00:09:59,019
Not in Flipper.

109
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:01,689
Flipper.

110
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:05,776
"They call me Flipper."

111
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:12,658
- What's the score?
- Two to zero.

112
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:14,952
The National team is winning.
We're killing them!

113
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:16,787
That's it!

114
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:37,016
Careful with that little dance.
You're starting to put ideas in my head.

115
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:40,269
Love, who is picking up Carlos?

116
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:43,355
La Quica. He's on his way.

117
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:47,192
Hey, that smells good.

118
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:51,530
Pablo, the kids love this place.

119
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:53,615
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

120
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:13,552
On your feet. Now!

121
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:18,974
I didn't know. I didn't know, I swear.
Limón lied to me.

122
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,812
No, please. When they find me,
they're going to kill me.

123
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,647
- No! No!
- Stay still!

124
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:27,816
Please.

125
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,029
Do you think I wanted this?

126
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:35,616
They used me
and they're throwing my life away.

127
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:38,619
You're breaking my fucking heart, baby.

128
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:44,249
You're all the same.

129
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,294
You don't listen. Nobody listens!

130
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:50,714
And all those people
dying for no reason.

131
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:57,930
What's up, Peña?
What should we do with her?

132
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,522
She's good with kids.

133
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:14,238
I'm so sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Carrillo.

134
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:25,165
I keep wondering
if it's better to know the truth.

135
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:28,877
I don't follow.

136
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:35,175
The things they said about my husband,
about what he did before he was killed.

137
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:38,262
Did he shoot a child?

138
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:43,141
Did he kill that boy
like they said on the news?

139
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:48,313
No. Absolutely not.

140
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,733
Your husband

141
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,302
did everything in his
means to get Escobar.

142
00:12:56,697 --> 00:12:58,657
But he did not cross the line.

143
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:08,709
Well, that was rough.

144
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:16,133
- I just kept looking at her, thinking...
- Hey.

145
00:13:17,718 --> 00:13:20,721
It's not gonna happen to me,
it's not gonna happen to us.

146
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:25,100
You want me to come home?

147
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:33,734
Just make sure you're still you
when it's all over.

148
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:44,202
So three years in the jungles
fighting FARC.

149
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:49,499
Hugo Martinez chose his own path
a long time ago

150
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,752
and he hasn't deviated from it since.

151
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:57,299
He's methodical, favors procedure
and strict protocol.

152
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:59,134
Do you think you can get him to do it?

153
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:05,025
How do you get a man
to take a job that nobody wants?

154
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,165
Don't get me wrong.

155
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:09,478
There was no shortage of brave men
in the Colombian National Police.

156
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:13,649
But signing up to replace Carrillo
as the head of the Search Bloc

157
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:15,943
would take a lot more than bravery.

158
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:19,529
Gaviria couldn't count on someone
raising their hand.

159
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:23,659
It would take a certain kind of pressure
to find the right volunteer.

160
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:25,535
Is that your father?

161
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,663
Over there with the president?

162
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:34,294
That's cool.

163
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,183
To all those present,
it is my honor to present

164
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:51,520
the President of the Republic...

165
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:58,402
His Excellency,
Don César Augusto Gaviria Trujillo.

166
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,246
Congratulations, Class of 1992.

167
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,499
Recent events...

168
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:17,004
contrast heavily with today's ceremony.

169
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:24,261
Each one of you has decided to sacrifice
your personal interests...

170
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:29,933
and dedicate your lives
to the service of the nation.

171
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:35,022
There is no higher honor...

172
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:39,192
than to serve your homeland.

173
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:49,911
- Colonel, how are you doing?
- Very well.

174
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:52,372
I enjoyed your speech very much,
Mr. President.

175
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:54,750
I'm glad. It was also for you.

176
00:15:56,501 --> 00:16:02,132
Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,
I've been discussing with my advisors

177
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:04,926
who should be at the head
of the Search Bloc.

178
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:07,888
They mentioned many names.

179
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:11,432
But I would like it to be you,
Colonel Martinez.

180
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:15,242
That's an honor, Mr. President, but...

181
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:19,065
at this point in my career, I'm sure
you can find a better candidate.

182
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,841
Colombia wants to end this nightmare.

183
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:25,530
And I know you're the man to do it.

184
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:29,201
The nation deserves someone
better than me.

185
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:36,249
Your son was one of the best
in the academy. He's an excellent cadet.

186
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,627
He worked very hard.
I'm very proud of him.

187
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:44,591
We asked the best in the class
to join the Search Bloc.

188
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:47,719
And your son happily accepted.

189
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:52,933
I ask that you at least
consider my request.

190
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:56,603
For Colombia.

191
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,831
- Carlos!
- Tata!

192
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:23,171
Come on, come on. Let's see.

193
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:25,424
Go ahead.

194
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:28,969
- I can't believe it. Look at you.
- Slowly, slowly.

195
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:31,680
I don't want any more visits
to the doctor.

196
00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:34,190
Manuela, you're so beautiful.
Look at me.

197
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:35,791
Look how tan he is.

198
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:38,604
He looks like a movie star, right?

199
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:39,855
Yes, boss.

200
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,940
- He looks like Tom Cruise.
- Well...

201
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:43,233
Look at her, Pablo.

202
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:46,194
I can't believe you brought me
from Miami to see my sister like this.

203
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:49,448
No. I'm just so happy to see you.

204
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,702
Oh, my God. Carlos!

205
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:58,623
Welcome, sweetie.
I'm so happy to have you home.

206
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:02,461
Tonight, I am going to make
the best meal this family has ever had.

207
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,590
Well, then...
ready to go for a little walk?

208
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,719
It's incredible how much
the children have grown, Pablo.

209
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:13,596
Manuelita is a princess.
She is beautiful.

210
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,601
She's the one who controls everything
around here. I just pay the bills.

211
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:20,687
I heard about Carrillo.

212
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:25,108
If that son of a bitch was still alive,
many more policemen would have died.

213
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:29,154
I did the police a favor. Believe me.

214
00:18:29,237 --> 00:18:32,157
Do you think the police agree with you?

215
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,167
No one wants war, Carlos.

216
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,560
Especially when they
know they would lose.

217
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,206
But all that's in the past.

218
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:45,670
And I'm ready to get back to business.
I'm all in.

219
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:49,174
- Tell me about Miami.
- What can I tell you, Pablo?

220
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:52,969
The demand keeps increasing
and the merchandise keeps on coming.

221
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:55,972
Business hasn't been affected
by what happened at La Catedral,

222
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:57,682
nor by what you did.

223
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:02,479
Well, business can always
get better, right?

224
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:05,899
Business was pretty good.

225
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:09,778
And a large part of that
was due to a guy they called the Lion.

226
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,197
You might remember him
as a Medellín hustler

227
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,244
who used to stuff bricks of cocaine into
his jacket and smuggle them into Miami.

228
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:22,332
Well, he stayed in Miami
and he made it his town.

229
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,379
He was responsible
for a smuggling network

230
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:31,257
that brought in Pablo's cocaine
by the ton. He was great at it.

231
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:35,804
But getting cocaine into the States
wasn't really the problem.

232
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:39,808
The problem was,
what do you do with all that money?

233
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:42,957
Sure, some of it could
stay in the States.

234
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,670
And the narcos did that.

235
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:49,276
They bought crooked banks,
real estate, car dealerships,

236
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,861
race horses, art, you name it.

237
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:55,322
But if you're gonna
run a cocaine empire,

238
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:57,433
you need to have a lot of cash on hand.

239
00:19:57,492 --> 00:20:00,745
And getting cash back into Colombia
wasn't easy.

240
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:03,456
Let me put it this way:

241
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:06,084
This is what a ton of
cocaine looks like.

242
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:09,691
And here's what the same
ton of cocaine looks like

243
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:12,238
when it's converted into cash.

244
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,342
See the problem?

245
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:17,846
Lion had to be creative
with how he got that money to Pablo.

246
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:22,225
And he was.
His shipments showed up like clockwork.

247
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:28,106
But the deeper Pablo went into his war
with the government...

248
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:32,152
the more important these shipments were.

249
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:35,405
Pablo needed more money than ever.

250
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:38,033
Without it, he was fucked.

251
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:41,286
Let's bring the Lion over here.

252
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:45,665
I want to speak to him face to face,
like the old days.

253
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:48,376
- Okay.
- Make some new arrangements.

254
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,170
Some better ones.

255
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:52,213
Quica.

256
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:57,344
Give Velasco a call.
Tell him to find the Lion.

257
00:20:57,427 --> 00:20:59,888
Carlos and I want to speak to him
about business.

258
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:06,311
It's time to get back
to making money, brother.

259
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:08,772
- Like the good old days, Pablo.
- Exactly.

260
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:22,786
What's up, Maritza?

261
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,246
What happened?

262
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:31,878
The police are looking for me.
They want to put a bullet in my head.

263
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:35,799
I'm sorry, Maritza. I thought
something good would come from all this.

264
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:37,342
Something good?

265
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:44,099
Let me come work with you.

266
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:46,768
No, Maritza, you're crazy.

267
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:51,523
I have to get this.

268
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:52,941
Give me one second.

269
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:57,445
What's up?

270
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:01,950
Where the fuck are you, Limón? Think you
can make me wait around for you, bitch?

271
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:04,160
I'm close by, man.

272
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:06,530
I mean, there's a lot of
goddamn traffic, but...

273
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:07,771
I'm on my way.

274
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:11,543
I don't give a fuck if there's traffic.
I need you here now!

275
00:22:11,626 --> 00:22:15,338
You have to take this shit with you,
so get your ass over here. Right now.

276
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:19,259
Yes, I know, I know.
Forgive me. I'm on my way.

277
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:34,691
Maritza, I have to go.
I can't help you right now.

278
00:22:34,774 --> 00:22:37,861
We already gave you money.
I'll call you later.

279
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:41,030
And we'll figure it out,
but I can't right now.

280
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,493
Okay, here we go.

281
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:03,154
-  Search Bloc.
- It's Peña.

282
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:06,950
I'm here with Trujillo at the corner of
38th and 24th streets. We need back up.

283
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:09,452
Sorry, but there's no authorization
to dispatch patrols.

284
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:13,957
We're watching one of Escobar's guys.
He just entered the building.

285
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,853
Return to base with the location.

286
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:17,859
We can ask for
authorization from Bogotá.

287
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:20,213
Sure.

288
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,424
And you'll show up
next Tuesday, son of a bitch.

289
00:24:27,387 --> 00:24:30,473
What time were you supposed to be here,
asshole?

290
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:33,893
You knew you had to make the delivery
before I pick up Lion tomorrow.

291
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:36,479
No, brother, don't get mad.
It's just that...

292
00:24:36,563 --> 00:24:37,814
Limón!

293
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:41,124
You're going to take this goddamn
bag and get out of here now!

294
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,092
I'm watching you.

295
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:43,861
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

296
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:47,240
This is the last time you pull shit
like this, Limón. The last time!

297
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:53,205
- This is the last time you make me wait.
- Come on, man...

298
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:56,541
- I told you. Get out of here.
- Oh, shit. That's Velasco.

299
00:24:56,624 --> 00:24:59,502
Shit. What do we do?

300
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:02,214
We stick with Velasco.
The other one doesn't matter.

301
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:06,217
How many guys
do you think are inside, Peña?

302
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:09,470
Too many for just us two, no?

303
00:25:09,554 --> 00:25:12,390
Yeah. We'd be screwed.

304
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:17,061
Son of a bitch.
We should call for backup, right?

305
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:26,070
Who are you calling?

306
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:52,597
- What's going on, Peña?
- I'll handle this.

307
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:08,821
This is Trujillo. You can trust him.

308
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:12,492
You're finally seeing the light.

309
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:16,162
Let's just see if this works.

310
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:19,707
You two coming?

311
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:26,756
Okay, then. You two,
in the front with me.

312
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,842
Berna, with his men, around back.
Understood?

313
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:33,763
Just stay clear of the windows.

314
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:35,973
- Let's go, then.
- Let's move.

315
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:02,727
- They're everywhere.
- Let's go down.

316
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,043
Hey!

317
00:29:21,264 --> 00:29:24,350
Where were you going,
you filthy son of a bitch? Huh?

318
00:29:38,197 --> 00:29:40,032
Here it is, Mrs. Escobar.

319
00:29:41,534 --> 00:29:44,203
- What's that?
- It's a delivery.

320
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:46,873
- But who told you to buy this?
- It was me.

321
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:49,792
It's some clothes.

322
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:51,961
Hermilda.

323
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:54,969
Hermilda, for God's sake...

324
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:57,073
you can't send him out
with so much money.

325
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,719
- Oh, Tata!
- They are going to know where we are.

326
00:29:59,802 --> 00:30:01,846
You worry too much.

327
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,787
It's going to affect the children.

328
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:07,167
Do you want Juan Pablo
and Manuela to worry?

329
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:12,773
You're right.

330
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:18,988
When Pablo was a little boy...

331
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:25,036
he came home from school one day,
very angry.

332
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:30,416
A little girl made fun of his shoes.

333
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:34,003
They were ragged.

334
00:30:34,795 --> 00:30:37,882
And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

335
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:43,346
But that night, I went into town
and I stole a pair from a store.

336
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:45,848
The next day, Pablo went back to school.

337
00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:55,024
Being poor is not an excuse
to look like you are.

338
00:30:57,526 --> 00:31:00,571
You've always just taken
what you wanted, right?

339
00:31:00,655 --> 00:31:02,406
And Pablo as well.

340
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,078
Mr. Ambassador,

341
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:10,915
I believe people fall
into two categories, basically:

342
00:31:10,998 --> 00:31:12,416
those who rely on hope...

343
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:16,128
and those who rely on faith,

344
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:20,383
who see a system at work in the world
and are devoted to it.

345
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,723
It may be religion,

346
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:26,371
but in the case of
police work, a method.

347
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:30,226
I'm guessing that you fall
on the faith side.

348
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:31,519
Correct.

349
00:31:32,311 --> 00:31:35,105
We can catch Escobar
in any number of ways.

350
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:37,349
But if the one we choose

351
00:31:37,374 --> 00:31:39,760
furthers an already
strained relationship

352
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:42,655
between the Colombian people
and its police,

353
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:46,951
a strain caused by
years of corruption and abuse,

354
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:48,661
then we'll have lost.

355
00:31:48,744 --> 00:31:50,204
Even if we catch him.

356
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,582
Your philosophy is our philosophy,
Colonel.

357
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,502
Yeah, we'll see about that.

358
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:57,795
Thank you very much.

359
00:31:59,547 --> 00:32:02,174
- Good to sit down with you.
- Mr. Ambassador,

360
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:04,969
the whole world is watching
how we handle this.

361
00:32:05,761 --> 00:32:08,001
I won't allow it to be corrupted by...

362
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,581
outside interests or darker instincts.

363
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:26,157
It worked.

364
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:28,868
We're even.

365
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:34,206
I need you to help me get a visa
and get my family out of Medellín.

366
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,459
Somewhere Pablo can't find us.

367
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:39,879
It doesn't work like that.

368
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:41,839
I'm sorry.

369
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:44,050
So, then...?

370
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:47,053
How am I supposed to be okay?

371
00:33:14,997 --> 00:33:17,875
Is this how things are going to work
from now on, Peña?

372
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:23,214
Don't worry about it, okay?
It won't happen again.

373
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:27,885
No. I'm not worried.

374
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,897
Leave us.

375
00:33:47,363 --> 00:33:49,281
Life's funny, Velasco.

376
00:33:50,324 --> 00:33:53,369
This could easily
have ended up in reverse.

377
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:59,291
Me lying there,
you and your men ready to torture me.

378
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,045
Look how everything's changed.

379
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:18,060
We are both loyal soldiers.

380
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,192
Serving our generals.

381
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:28,446
But you know what?

382
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:32,741
When it's time to give up your boss...

383
00:34:36,787 --> 00:34:38,998
...we give up our boss.

384
00:34:46,922 --> 00:34:51,343
Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but...
he gave up this.

385
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:04,940
- Three of his accountants.
- And their addresses.

386
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:07,850
He also told me Pablo
still has a large army

387
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,010
and a lot of money.

388
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:11,590
Yes, but that could be
complete bullshit, no?

389
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:13,004
To scare us off.

390
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,078
Or it could be true. To scare us off.

391
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:27,505
There lies the key.

392
00:35:28,255 --> 00:35:31,967
If we leave him without money,
we leave him without an army.

393
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:34,178
Something else.

394
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:36,388
Velasco was going to
the airport tomorrow

395
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:39,433
because the Lion will be arriving
in the afternoon from Miami.

396
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:50,486
Excuse me, sir. It's Judy Moncada.

397
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:00,704
Mrs. Moncada.

398
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:04,333
How can I help you?

399
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:25,396
How was your trip? You must be beat.

400
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:27,022
Let's go. Get in.

401
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:28,691
Where's Velasco?

402
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:51,422
There he is.

403
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:54,258
Welcome.

404
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:58,512
- Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.
- Lion.

405
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:01,473
This is my brother, Miguel.

406
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:04,226
And this gentleman is our associate,
Pacho Herrera.

407
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,980
I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.
It's a pleasure.

408
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:11,275
Lion... May I call you that?

409
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,237
- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink. Relax.

410
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:19,700
They say, over there,
that you like whiskey.

411
00:37:21,285 --> 00:37:25,164
Listen, gentlemen,
if I did something to offend you, or...

412
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:30,794
What? Would we offer you a drink
if we were offended?

413
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:33,339
Have a seat.

414
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:47,186
Tell me something, Lion.

415
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,856
Do you like working for a thug?

416
00:37:57,905 --> 00:37:59,281
One...

417
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:03,118
two, three!

418
00:38:03,202 --> 00:38:05,496
Very good.

419
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,206
Good job.

420
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:08,832
Look after your sister.

421
00:38:14,296 --> 00:38:15,673
What happened?

422
00:38:15,756 --> 00:38:17,383
Hey, boss...

423
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:20,886
Lion just called, sir.

424
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:24,515
He said Velasco never showed up
at the airport, sir.

425
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:28,602
Lion got scared shitless and left.
He took a plane back to Miami.

426
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:33,190
Fucking Lion.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?

427
00:38:33,273 --> 00:38:37,486
- And where is Velasco?
- Boss, I have no idea.

428
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:41,532
Find him for me.

429
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:43,534
Right away, boss.

430
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:56,508
I can't believe you're cooking.

431
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,990
But you know I always helped my mother.

432
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:01,510
Uh-uh. I helped while you ate.

433
00:39:05,097 --> 00:39:09,643
You know, I'm very happy
that Pablo brought me here.

434
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:11,687
But I'm worried about you.

435
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,690
No. There's no reason to worry.

436
00:39:14,773 --> 00:39:16,567
For God's sake, Tata.

437
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,737
Every cop in the country
is looking for Pablo.

438
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:23,615
Every drug trafficker
who's not from Medellín wants him dead.

439
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:27,202
And you're telling me there's no reason
to worry? Don't kid yourself.

440
00:39:29,204 --> 00:39:31,540
Today is a good day, Carlos.

441
00:39:31,623 --> 00:39:34,585
My family is all together. You're here.

442
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:42,217
Pablo is a strong man.
He's always had to be.

443
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:45,262
There's no reason to
change anything now.

444
00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:58,734
I hope you're hungry.

445
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:14,750
Come inside, I'm packing.

446
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,377
Are you going to let me go to Medellín
or what?

447
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:20,214
Is that why you accepted the job?

448
00:40:20,297 --> 00:40:22,549
You never should have volunteered.

449
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:26,929
But you can't be reassigned now,
because it would end your career, right?

450
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:29,723
Sure, only now I'm gonna be
"the boss's son."

451
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:35,395
It appears to me you don't understand
what's happening.

452
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:39,191
I accepted because I wanted
to help my country.

453
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:43,195
Come here, I want to show you something.

454
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,494
I received this urn with my name.

455
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:56,625
Look. On behalf of Pablo Escobar.

456
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:01,421
It's an obituary.

457
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:08,262
Look, son, you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

458
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:10,931
I'm going to make sure you survive this.
Understand?

459
00:41:17,396 --> 00:41:20,148
We're polishing
this bottle off pretty fast.

460
00:41:20,232 --> 00:41:23,652
Listen, I am not missing my flight
for anything tomorrow.

461
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:25,279
Mmm?

462
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:27,406
No.

463
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:31,285
You sure you can't stay?

464
00:41:33,996 --> 00:41:37,040
I can't leave Olivia
with my sister forever, Steve.

465
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,878
- Anyway, you'll be in Medellín.
- Ah.

466
00:41:41,461 --> 00:41:45,298
You know,
I met the new head of Search Bloc.

467
00:41:45,382 --> 00:41:47,217
- Yeah?
- He's an interesting guy.

468
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,554
I have a good feeling about him.

469
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:56,685
Before I forget, I want you...

470
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,521
I want you to give this to Olivia.

471
00:42:03,108 --> 00:42:04,443
Meant to be good luck.

472
00:42:08,697 --> 00:42:10,157
You keep it then.

473
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:18,957
I am gonna miss you.

474
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:24,171
From now on,

475
00:42:24,254 --> 00:42:27,674
the Search Bloc is going to operate
in a more systematic fashion.

476
00:42:29,426 --> 00:42:33,347
Since we unfortunately cannot
rely on the information given to us

477
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,098
by the people of Medellín...

478
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:40,354
we are going to implement
a quadrant search.

479
00:42:41,563 --> 00:42:43,941
We will position ourselves
in the neighborhoods

480
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:47,235
where we believe Escobar
and his allies might be,

481
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:50,072
proceed to search them...

482
00:42:51,406 --> 00:42:53,951
and if we don't find
what we're looking for,

483
00:42:54,034 --> 00:42:57,663
we'll process anything of value
and continue on to the next one.

484
00:42:58,288 --> 00:43:01,333
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel!

485
00:43:03,752 --> 00:43:05,462
A fucking grid search?

486
00:43:06,296 --> 00:43:08,840
Isn't that how they caught the guy
who shot Abraham Lincoln?

487
00:43:08,924 --> 00:43:12,511
- It's a change.
- Yeah, it's dated and conventional.

488
00:43:14,846 --> 00:43:18,100
Well, we tried going
bullet for bullet with him,

489
00:43:18,183 --> 00:43:20,018
and you saw how that ended up.

490
00:43:21,853 --> 00:43:23,188
Oh, so that's it?

491
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:26,441
A week ago you volunteered
to jump into a chopper with Carrillo

492
00:43:26,525 --> 00:43:27,943
and now it's a change?

493
00:43:30,612 --> 00:43:34,616
Don't worry about it, man. We'll all
feel better once Escobar's in the ground

494
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,036
- one way or another, right?
- There is no other way, Javi.

495
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,831
Search Bloc is the only game in town.

496
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:45,502
You really think this asshole
can get it done?

497
00:43:45,585 --> 00:43:47,837
I don't know. Maybe he'll surprise us.

498
00:43:50,257 --> 00:43:51,466
Okay.

499
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:54,469
Grid search it is.

500
00:44:11,153 --> 00:44:13,447
What did you find out from Velasco?

501
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:17,993
Not a fucking thing.

502
00:44:18,744 --> 00:44:22,414
That son of a bitch turned out to be
a lot tougher than I thought.

503
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,847
Is that what I think it is?

504
00:44:43,977 --> 00:44:45,729
Rules of the game:

505
00:44:46,938 --> 00:44:50,859
We only go after armed people. Sicarios.

506
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:57,908
There won't be any information
about businesses or labs or shipments.

507
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,619
This isn't about helping Judy.

508
00:45:00,702 --> 00:45:02,788
This is about killing Pablo.

509
00:45:09,753 --> 00:45:11,421
Well, then...

510
00:45:13,715 --> 00:45:15,842
here's to killing Pablo.

511
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:22,391
Of course, Peña knew
the information he had given Berna

512
00:45:22,474 --> 00:45:23,809
was already bearing fruit.

513
00:45:27,437 --> 00:45:28,647
For Colombia!

514
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:50,752
The Castaños and their men
were efficient, if not always subtle.

515
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:53,588
It didn't matter.

516
00:45:53,713 --> 00:45:55,840
What's newsworthy
about a few dead sicarios

517
00:45:55,924 --> 00:45:57,592
in the murder capital of the world?

518
00:46:03,515 --> 00:46:06,142
Of course, I'm not sure Javi knew

519
00:46:06,226 --> 00:46:09,104
just how fucked up things
were really gonna get.

520
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,693
Follow me and cover me!

521
00:46:17,153 --> 00:46:20,323
Hard to feel sorry for a bunch
of drug dealers getting whacked, right?

522
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:25,739
These guys had sown a lot of
violence over the years...

523
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:28,013
killed a lot of people.

524
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:31,794
It was about time they got some payback.

525
00:46:33,837 --> 00:46:36,923
But turning a bunch
of well-armed vigilantes loose

526
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:38,800
on the streets of Medellín...

527
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:44,890
was like pouring gasoline on a fire
that was already out of control.

528
00:47:01,907 --> 00:47:03,158
Boss?

529
00:47:07,037 --> 00:47:12,626
Sorry to bother you, but something bad
is happening in the city, boss.

530
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:16,046
Five of our men, dead.

531
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:18,798
Who was it?

532
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:23,720
I don't know, boss. If I knew,
I'd kill the son of a bitch that did it.

533
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:27,599
Boss, I'm so sorry,
but La Quica's on the phone.

534
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:44,199
- And Velasco?
- It looks like a battlefield, boss.

535
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,457
No one's seen Velasco
and no one knows where he is. Boss...

536
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,960
you know that if someone
grabbed Velasco...

537
00:47:55,794 --> 00:47:56,920
Yes.

538
00:48:07,347 --> 00:48:09,307
Start packing.

539
00:48:12,477 --> 00:48:15,647
Your turn, let's do it again.

540
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,149
My little rock made of paper...

541
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,822
how much do you want to eat?

542
00:48:23,905 --> 00:48:27,534
Show your grandmother
how you washed your hands.

543
00:48:38,962 --> 00:48:40,672
Looks good.

544
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:43,550
Pardon me.

545
00:48:48,263 --> 00:48:49,597
Should we start?

546
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:52,684
Dig in, dig in.

547
00:48:55,311 --> 00:48:56,771
So good.

548
00:48:56,855 --> 00:48:58,106
A spoon?

549
00:48:58,189 --> 00:49:00,983
There's no spoon, love.
How about a fork?

550
00:49:20,253 --> 00:49:21,880
Martinez was right.

551
00:49:22,672 --> 00:49:24,299
We all need a method.

552
00:49:25,884 --> 00:49:29,444
Something to cling to when the
shit around us gets so deep,

553
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:30,955
we might go under.

554
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:36,936
Something to guide us home
when we feel we've lost our way.

555
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:42,609
If we're lucky, someone gives us
a method and we follow it.

556
00:49:43,902 --> 00:49:46,113
If not, we find our own.

557
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:50,491
Pablo's enemies
had found their own method.

558
00:49:50,575 --> 00:49:52,452
And it was an ugly one.

559
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:55,864
They had opened up
a new war against him,

560
00:49:55,889 --> 00:49:57,981
striking from the shadows.

561
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:02,879
Showing him that, even in his hometown,
he wasn't safe.

562
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:07,200
The Castaños are very efficient.

563
00:50:07,926 --> 00:50:10,053
But not very discreet.

564
00:50:12,972 --> 00:50:16,569
No one can know
we had anything to do with this.

565
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,522
And the moment
their method became apparent...

566
00:50:20,605 --> 00:50:22,065
Excuse me.

567
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:23,983
...the message was clear.

568
00:50:24,818 --> 00:50:26,987
There was a new player in town.

569
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:29,614
What does it say?

570
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:31,908
And they weren't fucking around.

571
00:50:31,991 --> 00:50:35,912
"Your days are numbered, Pablo.
No one around you is safe."

572
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:38,331
Signed "Los Pepes."

573
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:43,044
Who in the hell are Los Pepes?

574
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:01,877
