1
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,621
You threaten a man's family,
and you find out what he's made of.

2
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,751
Pablo Escobar was made of rage,
revenge and terror.

3
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,465
Unable to lash out directly
at his enemies in Cali,

4
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,343
he went after their prized
legitimate business,

5
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,848
their beloved chain of drugstores.

6
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:43,395
And he blew them to shit along with anyone
unlucky enough to be standing nearby.

7
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,064
We're talking dozens of bombs.

8
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:51,445
He put the city of Bogotá on edge
and the Colombian government on notice.

9
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:56,617
Continue to ignore Los Pepes, refuse to
acknowledge their crimes, and you're next.

10
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,912
But terror brings more terror,

11
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,625
and Los Pepes responded
with their own special brand.

12
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,918
We came up with a name for their displays.

13
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,796
- Colombian folk art.

14
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,134
Like I said, you can't make this shit up.

15
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,681
The point of all this?
Psychopaths sending a message...

16
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,893
No matter how far you go...

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,648
...we'll take it one step further.

18
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,735
The gates of hell were officially opened.

19
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,533
And everyone was scrambling
to get out of the fire.

20
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,702
Or climb into it.

21
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,945
Tata.

22
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,024
Hey, I need you
to run a trace on this name.

23
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,692
- Okay.
- Find this guy.

24
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,570
All right? You look tired.

25
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:40,041
Pablo was right. The government
couldn't stop his family from leaving.

26
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,921
But if you remember, he had
some bad history with Avianca Airlines.

27
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,092
And they made sure as shit
that everybody knew

28
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,637
the Escobars were trying to fly the coop.

29
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:59,769
What we know is that Escobar
bought tickets for his family

30
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,272
on eight different outgoing flights
from Bogotá.

31
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,943
Destinations ranging
from Barcelona to Toronto.

32
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,529
Mr. President,
we need to prevent that from happening.

33
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,241
We need to keep the family in play.
If they're allowed to leave Colombia,

34
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,284
we're gonna lose leverage
in the hunt for Escobar.

35
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,746
Legally, there's no way we can stop them
from flying out of the country.

36
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,248
By applying pressure behind the scenes,

37
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,458
we can prevent the family
from being accepted upon arrival.

38
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:27,088
And if they're kept in Colombia,
he's gonna be worried about their safety.

39
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:33,302
He'll be more likely to make phone
contact, more likely to... make mistakes.

40
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,682
Because they're more likely
to become victims of Los Pepes.

41
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,692
Mr. President... if the family gets safe
haven, there's no telling what comes next.

42
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,904
Maybe Escobar surrenders,
maybe he goes to war.

43
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,784
The family is leverage. We have to use it.

44
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,670
I agree.

45
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,927
I want one of your people with them
giving us updates, running interference,

46
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,055
and have them find out
where they're going. And stick with them.

47
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,488
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's Messina.

48
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,617
I need you to grab your passport
and head to Bogotá International.

49
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,534
Where?

50
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,954
The Escobars are trying to flee the
country. Wherever they go, follow them.

51
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,333
- Yeah. When?
- Now. Once you spot them, check in.

52
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,336
- And Murphy, keep this under wraps.
- Yes, ma'am.

53
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,838
Who was that?

54
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,214
Messina.

55
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,345
- Where you going?
- Going out.

56
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,473
- With your passport?
- Yep.

57
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,725
- Oh, that's all I get?
- Yep.

58
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,572
- Uh, I'd like to get some tickets, please.
- For... which flight, sir?

59
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,658
Let's see. Madrid, London...

60
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,466
It's Murphy. Get me Messina.

61
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,095
- Messina.
- Hey, it's me. It's the Frankfurt flight.

62
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,888
Germany. Shit.

63
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,934
Yes, Mr. Foreign Minister, but I'm not
talking about some Turkish date farmer

64
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,729
looking to drive a taxi in Berlin.
I'm talking about Pablo Escobar's family.

65
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,652
No. No, they haven't committed any crimes.

66
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,947
Due to events in their fairly recent past,

67
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,659
Germany had some of the softest
immigration standards in Europe.

68
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,080
If you had a pulse,
they tended to let you in.

69
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,041
Now maybe that was good for mankind,

70
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,294
and it was certainly good
for the Escobars.

71
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,422
It was very bad for us.

72
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,551
Got a bump on your guy.
About an hour ago.

73
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:52,640
Credit card belonging to Fernando Duque.
Used twice, restaurants.

74
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,434
Here, here, a couple streets over.

75
00:23:56,393 --> 00:24:00,105
Check this out.
Ran him through the CNP database.

76
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,025
A complaint got filed this morning.
Your boy's wanted.

77
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,028
- For what?
- Kidnapping and car theft.

78
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,657
Filed by his ex-wife. It's a blue Volvo.

79
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,036
He's running. And he's taking his kid.

80
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,871
He's 14 years old. Fuck.

81
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,673
Peña.

82
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,392
- Peña?

83
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,623
- Messina.
- Hey, boss.

84
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:03,669
I think Fernando Duque's on the run.
He's got his kid with him.

85
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,672
If he's that scared, maybe he's willing
to drop privilege and cooperate.

86
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,549
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I...

87
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,136
I might have an idea where he's holed up.

88
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,305
If he comes through for us, you think
we can get him out of the country?

89
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,726
- If he'll cooperate, yes. Look into it.
- You got it.

90
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,436
- And Peña.
- Yeah.

91
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,062
How did all this come up?

92
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,443
My CI knows a girl he sees.
Kind of fell into my lap.

93
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,113
- Mmm-hmm. Get on it.
- Yeah, boss.

94
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:46,920
Okay.

95
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,408
Attention, ladies and gentlemen:

96
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,828
We will be passing around
immigration cards.

97
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,590
Foreign ministry isn't cooperating.
We need more time.

98
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,682
Don't let them leave the airport.

99
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,728
- They do, it's over.
- Right, right, right. Talk to you soon.

100
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,908
Sir, I'm with the United States DEA.

101
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,577
There's passengers on this flight
who can't be allowed into this country.

102
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:56,748
Heard of Pablo Escobar? Cocaine? That's
his family. You can't allow them in.

103
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,669
Unless there is a problem with
their passports or any type of contraband,

104
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,878
they may enter Germany.

105
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,468
What about if they're transporting
a large amount of foreign currency?

106
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,972
- You would be certain of this how?
- I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes.

107
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,058
I work with the DEA, been with
this family, I've been tracking Escobar

108
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,061
for a long goddamn fucking time.
It is in that bag.

109
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,480
- In which item of luggage?
- The maroon bag.

110
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,566
...Perdón?

111
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,110
- Do you speak English?
- No.

112
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,238
I'm a hundred percent certain.
That burgundy bag.

113
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,157
Fucking hell.

114
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:37,706
- Hello. Pablo Escobar? Familia Escobar?
- Sí.

115
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,501
- You speak English? German?
- No.

116
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,839
Come with us.

117
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,471
To be honest, I'd never actually
seen any cash in the bag.

118
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,352
But I knew Pablo
would never let his wife go anywhere

119
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,855
without some serious walking around money.

120
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,001
- Please come now.

121
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,052
- Shh.

122
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,848
Fernando Duque.

123
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,351
Javier Peña.

124
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:54,402
While the authorities were using
all the political pressure they could

125
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,863
to keep Escobar's family in play,

126
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,742
Pablo was practicing
his own special form of diplomacy.

127
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,371
...First, he called the German embassy

128
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,580
in Bogotá.

129
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:22,097
Then he threatened to bomb
a couple of Lufthansa planes.

130
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,445
Then he dialed up President Gaviria.

131
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,489
Who couldn't take the call.

132
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,992
Because he was already on the phone
with the German ambassador.

133
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:51,835
And then, Pablo did something
he'd never done before in his life.

134
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,672
He called a cop and he asked for help.

135
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,801
Not just any cop,
but the top cop in the country:

136
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,928
Attorney General De Greiff.

137
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,487
Agent Peña.

138
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,951
I don't think Don Berna's
gonna make it tonight.

139
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,006
What is this?

140
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,716
Just a friendly chat.

141
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:15,181
You're making some very scary people
pretty nervous, Javier.

142
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,394
Which puts me in a spot because...

143
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,438
I'm the one who suggested
they approach you in the first place.

144
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:28,319
Now, I don't know what you know
about what it is I do,

145
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,321
but understand this:

146
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,866
I have our nation's
long-term interests in mind.

147
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,952
That's the beat I walk.

148
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,455
And sitting here tonight,
that means making sure the right folks

149
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,875
are left standing when Escobar
gets his bullet.

150
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,631
So do Uncle Sam a solid.

151
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,385
Don't complicate that.

152
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,022
These folks are prone
to emotional decision-making.

153
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:10,153
Which can lead to bush league nonsense
like... killing a federal agent.

154
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,824
By the way, they found the lawyer.

155
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,452
Even without your help, so...

156
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,755
Trujillo!
You follow me to the fucking hotel?

157
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:53,881
Huh?

158
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,871
You can't treat us like criminals.

159
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,387
- DEA!
- Get on the ground!

160
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,223
220 pounds of C-4.

161
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:49,726
Same as a bomb on an F-16.

162
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,355
Dozens were killed.

163
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:58,235
Scores were injured,
many of them children.

164
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,905
Pablo never took credit for the bomb.

165
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,367
He didn't have to.

166
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,176
Elena?

167
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,182
Elena!

168
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:31,935
Elena!
