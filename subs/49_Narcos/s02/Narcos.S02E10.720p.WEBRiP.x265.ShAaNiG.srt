1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,623
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

2
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:12,877
Look up "magical realism"
in the dictionary,

3
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,588
and it'll describe a literary style

4
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,757
incorporating fantastic
or mythical elements

5
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,050
into otherwise realistic fiction.

6
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,720
Colombia is where it began.

7
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:26,098
And anyone who's spent real time here
knows why.

8
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,393
It's a place where the bizarre
shakes hands with the inexplicable

9
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,519
on a daily basis.

10
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,149
But just like in the novels
of Gabriel García Márquez,

11
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:39,361
the weird shit usually pops off
at certain critical moments.

12
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:42,448
When the whole place is on edge.

13
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,869
When everything's about to change.

14
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:53,793
Of all the people who had
a vested interest in nailing Escobar,

15
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,629
Javier Peña deserved to be there
when it went down.

16
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,425
No American had given more or done more.

17
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,180
Well...

18
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,474
To, uh...

19
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,393
the Drug Enforcement Administration?

20
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,522
I'll drink to that while I still can.

21
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,315
You're a fucking lifer, Javi.

22
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:24,949
Well, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out which long-term DEA agent

23
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:27,076
was linked to the Los Pepes death squad.

24
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,119
Well, the Board of Professional Conduct

25
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,539
has never been accused
of being geniuses, so...

26
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,375
Yeah, and who reads
the Miami Herald anyway, right?

27
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,216
Murphy, listen.

28
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,760
I meant what I said.

29
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,932
Anyone starts asking questions, just
tell them what they want to hear, okay?

30
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,561
- It was always on me.
- Fuck you, Javi.

31
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,813
And anybody who comes around asking.

32
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:03,320
Well, you do me a favor. You...

33
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,825
You get him.

34
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:11,996
Attention passengers.

35
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:18,419
We will now start boarding Flight 464
to Washington, D.C. at Gate Two.

36
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:21,422
All right, well, I gotta...
I can't finish this. It's...

37
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:22,548
I gotta go.

38
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,390
Take care of yourself.

39
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,859
All it took was the whiff of a scandal

40
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:44,111
out of the mouth of an exiled drug queen

41
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:47,281
and Peña was gone, like fucking magic.

42
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,626
# Happy birthday to you #

43
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,630
# Happy birthday, dear Pablo #

44
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,591
# Happy birthday... #

45
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,886
This signal is coming from Medellín.

46
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,266
- Pablo's come home.
- I think so.

47
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,190
Hopefully he will
speak to them again tomorrow.

48
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,028
Pablo...

49
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,059
Hermilda.

50
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:09,624
Nelson Mandela?

51
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:10,730
- Yeah!

52
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,457
Tata?

53
00:33:25,544 --> 00:33:26,504
Pablo?

54
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,725
Captain.

55
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,555
Perez!

56
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,769
This is the house.

57
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,192
Pablo.

58
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,924
Pablo. Pablo.

59
00:41:11,843 --> 00:41:13,261
Go, go, go!

60
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:38,263
All that time hunting him...

61
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,893
and just like that,
I'm looking down at Pablo fucking Escobar.

62
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,522
For years I'd been building
this son of a bitch up in my head.

63
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,859
What a monster he'd be.

64
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:53,236
But here's the thing.

65
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,115
When you lay eyes on him,
the devil's a real letdown.

66
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,242
Just a man.

67
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,994
Beard grows if he doesn't shave.

68
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,830
Fat and shoeless.

69
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,792
You take a good long look at evil,
and it reminds you of one...

70
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,886
Sir, do I need a lawyer?

71
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,265
You're the review board, right?

72
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,061
Professional conduct or some bullshit?

73
00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:46,107
We're not the review board.

74
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,029
So who are you?

75
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,241
We're from Operations.

76
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,539
What do you want from me?

77
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:14,719
In 1992, do you know how much cocaine

78
00:50:14,802 --> 00:50:17,013
we estimated came into the US
from Colombia?

79
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,683
311 metric tons.

80
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:38,034
And in 1993, during the hunt for Escobar,
372 metric tons.

81
00:50:38,117 --> 00:50:40,578
Now that piece of shit is on his last leg.

82
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,664
Every one of his labs has been shut down.

83
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:45,083
And cocaine production goes up.

84
00:50:55,843 --> 00:50:57,845
Can you imagine what happens next year?

85
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,616
Now the king is dead. Long live the kings.

86
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:27,709
Agent Peña, how much do you know
about the Cali cartel?
