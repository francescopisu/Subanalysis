1
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,568
Escobar had made a career out of terror.

2
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,613
And for the most part, it had worked.

3
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,158
But when he parked 220 pounds of TNT

4
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,036
outside of a downtown Bogotá
shopping center

5
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,705
a week before school started up again,

6
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,166
no one could deny he had gone too far.

7
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,836
The whole nation was enraged.

8
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,882
There was no explaining this one away.

9
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,512
And no hiding from it.

10
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,128
That's right.

11
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:14,133
A guy who knew no bounds, no limits,
had finally gone too far.

12
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:18,095
He probably didn't know it then,
or maybe he just couldn't accept it,

13
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:22,767
but the end was coming for him,
and it was about time.

14
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:29,388
Our situation with Escobar
is coming to a head.

15
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:31,932
Due to our efforts,
his organization is shrinking.

16
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:37,062
Intel suggests that his inner circle
has been reduced to a few loyal sicarios.

17
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,772
Bit of a mixed blessing.

18
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,692
Fewer sicarios,
less radio chatter for me to trace.

19
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,153
We had a tap put on that lawyer's phone,

20
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,238
but I guess he isn't
taking any more calls.

21
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,490
It's Los Pepes.

22
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:54,955
They kill Fernando Duque,
but they also killed his son... his wife.

23
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,208
But they also stabbed, viciously,
his innocent mother.

24
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,505
But I accepted a sad truth.

25
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:08,302
No one is willing to police Los Pepes,
so we're gonna concentrate on Escobar.

26
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:13,015
I would also like to say that...

27
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:18,771
I know that someone
has been in contact with Los Pepes.

28
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,190
And while it sickens me...

29
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,528
there's nothing I can or will do about it.

30
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,741
But the man standing over Escobar
when this is over

31
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:33,661
needs to be a Colombian police officer.

32
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,121
And not some vigilante.

33
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:41,377
- Thank you.

34
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,883
Guten tag.

35
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,930
Join the DEA, see the world, right?

36
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:55,849
The airport, anyways.

37
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,529
Listen...

38
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,449
I need you to prepare yourself
for some blowback.

39
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:15,577
It goes high up.

40
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,874
And these people aren't gonna like it
when I try to get myself out of it.

41
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:27,423
If they come after you
about what I've been doing,

42
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,383
you protect yourself first.

43
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:32,970
You didn't know anything.

44
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:35,889
Understand?

45
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,351
What are you gonna do?

46
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,480
I don't fucking know.

47
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,025
We've all gone off the rails down here,
Javi.

48
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,110
You heard what Martinez said.

49
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:51,655
If we're standing over Pablo
at the end of this, we win.

50
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,325
We can get out of this clean.

51
00:08:58,537 --> 00:08:59,913
So I want you to think about that

52
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,417
before you make any more decisions
that you might regret.

53
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:24,206
Blackie...

54
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:44,518
Remember when people used to
call Pablo Escobar the paisa Robin Hood?

55
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,687
Well, that shit was over.

56
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:50,941
The bombing had shocked
even his staunchest supporters.

57
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:54,278
Many of the folks of Medellín
who had always protected him

58
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,238
were seeing him in a different light.

59
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,001
And no one knew that better
than Los Pepes.

60
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:00,659
They took out ads in local papers,

61
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:03,829
getting the word out
to Escobar's former allies:

62
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:05,873
Pablo was through. Join Los Pepes or die.

63
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,794
And the traffickers
who didn't read the newspapers,

64
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,548
like the Gallón gang, for example,
who I doubt could even read,

65
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:18,260
got an in-person visit from Los Pepes'
most glamorous ambassador.

66
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,345
- Héctor.

67
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:32,269
Quica.

68
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,183
You want to get that?

69
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:58,563
- Murphy.
- Get to Bogotá right away.

70
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,399
- Yeah? What for?
- A tier-one sicario

71
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,483
in police headquarters.

72
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:04,277
- Oh, who?
- Nelson Hernández.

73
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,863
You know a Nelson Hernández?

74
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,700
- No.
- Yeah, tier-one my ass.

75
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,119
AKA Blackie.

76
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,662
No shit. Blackie.

77
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:16,415
CNP just picked him up
outside of the Tequendama.

78
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,498
Get in a room with him
and see what he can give us.

79
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,709
We're already gone.

80
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,422
Bogotá police just busted Blackie.
Maybe he'll cut us a deal.

81
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,300
Nabbing Blackie was a huge deal for us.

82
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,177
Bad news for Pablo.

83
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:32,013
And there was more bad news
coming his way.

84
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,438
The thing about drug dealers is
you can't trust them for shit.

85
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:43,775
The Lion had been running Pablo's
Miami operation for years,

86
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,860
and gotten rich too.

87
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,530
But the moment Cali
offered him a better deal,

88
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:51,408
he welcomed his new partners
with open arms.

89
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,286
I mean, who could blame the Lion?

90
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:57,664
Pablo was on his way out
and Cali was the future.

91
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,208
He had introduced them
to Pablo's bankers...

92
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,126
Oh, thank you.

93
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,211
...his smugglers, all of it.

94
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,213
Though Pablo didn't know it yet,

95
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,549
his biggest rivals
had pulled off a silent coup.

96
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,431
They had stolen the crown jewel
in his empire right out from under him.

97
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:17,809
- Guys.
- And they didn't even have to fire a shot.

98
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:25,794
While everyone could agree
that Escobar had to go down,

99
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:28,797
there was a lot of disagreement
on how to make that happen.

100
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,260
Escobar was still dangerous and many
in government wanted him to surrender.

101
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,096
To them, holding his family
was not only immoral,

102
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,181
but it could lead to more violence.

103
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,726
An upcoming presidential election
made it a big issue.

104
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,980
Gaviria was under a lot of pressure
to let the family go.

105
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:48,525
And it was getting harder and harder
for him to resist.

106
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,817
Blackie...

107
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,990
Blackie, Blackie, Blackie.

108
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,469
This is the biggest lead we've ever had.

109
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:34,193
- La Quica can give us Pablo.
- We can help triangulate from the air,

110
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:36,307
but really only units on the ground
can find him.

111
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,895
So that means that we have to drive around
Medellín hoping to get lucky

112
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,258
and La Quica is using his phone?

113
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:45,066
He will be because we'll be calling him
with Blackie's phone.

114
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,151
He picks up, we get a signal.

115
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,571
Tracking phones like this
is all about proximity.

116
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,491
- If you have the number.
- The number we got.

117
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,412
Okay. And who else has his number?

118
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:02,667
I mean, who else is gonna show up
when we track it down?

119
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,505
Just us.

120
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,884
Okay.

121
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,929
- Trujillo.

122
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,921
Pablo?

123
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,427
Tata.

124
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,735
- Hi, there.

125
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,307
Pablo!

126
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:48,943
Tata?

127
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,119
Valeria.

128
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,267
With Hugo Jr.'s RDF surveillance
team using Blackie's phone,

129
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:12,271
we had a real chance of tracking La Quica.
We just needed a little luck.

130
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,656
Go ahead, Murphy.

131
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,033
Copy that. Centra Spike, you standing by?

132
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:30,456
We are in the air.
Condition one, Murphy. Make your call.

133
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,084
All we had to do was call him,
hope he was in the area,

134
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,669
pray he picked up,

135
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:39,631
and then keep him on the line long enough
for our triangulation to pick up the ping.

136
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:44,094
And then snatch him up
without getting killed. Easy, right?

137
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,475
Hello? Hello?

138
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,235
It was him.

139
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:13,290
I need him on longer, guys.

140
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:17,085
Get him back on the phone. Keep him on.

141
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:32,142
Hello?

142
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:35,187
Quica.

143
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,772
Hello.

144
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,706
Hey, guys, we got a hit. He's in Laureles.

145
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:27,155
- Murphy, Peña, one more time.
- Copy, copy. We're calling again.

146
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:36,957
Hello?

147
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:41,730
Motherfucker.

148
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:44,149
Here we go.

149
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,578
We got eyes on La Quica. He's
traveling in a blue Sedan, heading east.

150
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,374
Pussies.

151
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,810
He's making a right
on calle cuatro. All units!

152
00:41:25,857 --> 00:41:27,818
Trujillo, double back on my six.

153
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:58,765
Come on, box him in!

154
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:20,495
- Stop!

155
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,831
Now I had my own history with La Quica,

156
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:26,418
and believe me, I would've liked
to beat him to death right then and there.

157
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:28,211
And I bet nobody would've cared.

158
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,131
La Quica's exploits were legendary.

159
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,301
He was Escobar's most prolific killer

160
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:37,888
and the guy credited for putting
the Avianca bomber on the plane.

161
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:41,725
But he was also his most trusted guy.
And if we could get him to flip...

162
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,853
...that would close the book on Pablo.

163
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,022
Limón.

164
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,022
Where is the staging point for this raid?

165
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:59,756
He says he wants
a new life in the US of A.

166
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,844
You give us Pablo Escobar,
and I'll take you there myself.

167
00:46:45,218 --> 00:46:48,346
The narcos always talk about loyalty...

168
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,598
till their own asses are on the line.

169
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:19,169
Quica.

170
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,666
Okay.

171
00:48:47,423 --> 00:48:48,842
Tata.

172
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:14,696
There you are, motherfucker.

173
00:51:46,185 --> 00:51:49,564
It's after nine.
He's not showing up. He's fucking onto us.

174
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,696
Goddammit.
Almost fucking had him again.

175
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:59,615
- Oh, fuck this!
- Peña, goddammit!
