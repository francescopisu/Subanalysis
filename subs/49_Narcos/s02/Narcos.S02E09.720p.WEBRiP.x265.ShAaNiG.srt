1
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,915
I read in a book somewhere
about a rich guy who goes broke.

2
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,420
When he's asked how it happened,
how he had lost everything, he answered:

3
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:02,218
"Slowly at first.
And then... all at once."

4
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,056
For Pablo Escobar,
"all at once" had finally come.

5
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:12,478
His empire in shambles,
his army all dead or in jail,

6
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:17,525
Escobar did the one thing
he could still do: A disappearing act.

7
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,237
One month, 14 days and seven hours...

8
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:25,825
with no sightings, no intercepts, nothing.

9
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,995
While we waited
for his eventual reemergence,

10
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,957
the machine built to capture him
found itself idle.

11
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,794
And that brought
a different kind of danger.

12
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,214
One that comes
with too much time to think.

13
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:45,594
Some started to look inward
at the path we had taken to get here...

14
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,808
asking, "How much of this blood is on me,
and how do I get clean?"

15
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,150
Under mounting political pressure,

16
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,279
Gaviria finally publicly denounced
Los Pepes.

17
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,865
And Los Pepes responded
with their own press release.

18
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,493
They said their job was done.

19
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,204
They were packing up and going home.

20
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:16,208
But Los Pepes wasn't something
you could turn on and off.

21
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,836
Its members were looking to the future.

22
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,965
One without Escobar.
And they each had their own version of it.

23
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,552
Los Pepes had knocked Pablo
out of the narco business

24
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:30,598
and that had created a vacancy
for a new cocaine king of Medellín.

25
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,518
Or, depending on who you asked,
maybe a queen.

26
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,114
Los Pepes may have disbanded,
but that didn't mean they were done.

27
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:56,869
The story of a vigilante army taking down
Escobar made for great headlines.

28
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,582
And while no one was named, it's not
to say it wasn't cause for concern.

29
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:04,209
Yes, ma'am, as far as I know.

30
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:07,254
No, we're, uh, crystal clear on that.

31
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:09,715
- Messina.

32
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,551
Yeah. Uh, he just got in.

33
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,350
- Hey, boss.
- Murphy fill you in?

34
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,268
Yeah.

35
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,897
This article's getting more traction
than we thought.

36
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,442
International news outlets keep calling,
want a statement from the ambassador.

37
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,861
- Are we giving one?
- No. Nobody is.

38
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,144
But we're watching it closely.

39
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,948
I don't need to tell you
it could look very bad for us.

40
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,408
I want to make sure we're covered.

41
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,827
Well, Los Pepes is disbanded.
It's basically over.

42
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:43,082
Look, I tend to agree. But the press may
shake a few more trees, see what falls.

43
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,291
What if someone talks?

44
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:47,419
The only people that are gonna
talk about Los Pepes is Los Pepes.

45
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,379
And they're not talking.

46
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,423
So we're covered.

47
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,800
We better be.

48
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,363
- Peña.
- Javier.

49
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:19,928
What's going on?

50
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,182
Nothing that's my problem anymore.

51
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,185
Where you going?

52
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,354
I just want to make sure.

53
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,694
Fuck it. I don't want to know.

54
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,148
And you can go fuck yourself.

55
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,193
Best way to make a bad story go away

56
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,028
is to come up with a better story...

57
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,447
and sell it hard.

58
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,076
This is one of the cornerstones
of American foreign policy,

59
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,788
and one we learned through years
of trial and error in Latin America,

60
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:18,417
Chile, Guatemala, Panama.

61
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,002
Getting caught with your pants down sucks,

62
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,630
but if at the same time
you give the folks a big win,

63
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:28,218
like, say, dismantling the second biggest
drug cartel in the world,

64
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:31,221
well, then nobody's paying attention
to the bad story.

65
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,598
They're too busy patting you on the back.

66
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:38,937
Risky plan? Yes.
But pressure will force you to take risks.

67
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,314
It'll force you to do a lot of things.

68
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:11,000
Don Berna!

69
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,278
Where's Peña?

70
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,197
What do you need?

71
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:48,705
I got a tip. A guy.

72
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:50,498
He says he may have a lead, man.

73
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:55,003
Yeah, well, why don't you, uh,
give it to Martinez?

74
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:58,715
Or you could give it
to your Los Pepes pals.

75
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:01,885
He wants to give it to an American.

76
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,514
Yeah, what's he got? Who is this guy?

77
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,974
He's a guy I know.

78
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,895
Come on, Murphy. He's safe.
He knows I work with you.

79
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:13,438
What, he doesn't trust you?

80
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:20,153
All right. Bring him in.

81
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,197
He's in Bogotá.

82
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,533
So I gotta go to Bogotá
to meet your friend? Forget it.

83
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:28,495
Come on, Murphy.

84
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:30,622
You want Escobar, don't you?

85
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:34,542
Please, talk to him.

86
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,836
It's really important.

87
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,341
- All right. Set it up.
- Okay.

88
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,804
In English, please!

89
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,532
Those are the codes and frequencies.

90
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:14,786
Pablo is using a radio.

91
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:16,913
That's the way he communicates
with his wife.

92
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:19,791
And these are the codes, Murphy.

93
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,420
Yeah? Where did it come from
and how did you get it?

94
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:29,300
Lugo is a fiscal at the Tequendama.
He guards the family.

95
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,389
What do you want for this? Money? Visa?

96
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,429
It don't work that way, bud.

97
00:25:10,174 --> 00:25:13,094
So? What do you think?

98
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:21,978
Javi, he's given us everything.
We got codes, frequencies.

99
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:24,981
- I think it's real.
- Take it to Martinez.

100
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,078
I'm at the embassy. I gotta call you back.

101
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,152
What you doing at the embassy?
What's going on?

102
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,739
Nothing I can't handle.
I'll fill you in when I can.

103
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:36,033
- Javi, let's get on this.
- Murphy, take it to Martinez.

104
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,535
I'll call you later.

105
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,122
Peña's in Bogotá?

106
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:45,168
Yeah, Javi's into something. Shit.

107
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:48,129
I'll take the codes back.
You stay with Peña, okay?

108
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:51,052
No fucking way. The codes are staying
with me. I'll take it to Martinez.

109
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:58,890
We give Judy immunity,
take her testimony and we are covered.

110
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:00,683
Don't lie to me again, Peña.

111
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:07,732
This is a tier-one narco who's
ready to flip on other tier-one narcos.

112
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,112
She's been in the business for 30 years.
She knows Cali's operation.

113
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,948
It's not intel anyone can provide.

114
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,408
She has leverage over you.

115
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,455
Her information on Escobar
crippled his business.

116
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:24,832
She'll do the same to Cali,
only this time for us.

117
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,003
The moment she goes on record,
her leverage is gone.

118
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:37,512
She doesn't get immunity
until after she talks.

119
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,931
Get her on record
and we'll see what she's got.

120
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,642
Nobody seems to want to take on Cali.

121
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:45,812
They've been off-limits,
but this may do the trick.

122
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,024
And Peña. Be discreet. Tell no one.

123
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,860
There are people in this building
who won't like it.

124
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,248
Going down?

125
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:17,844
So... how's it going?

126
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:19,019
All right, say he picks up
the phone. How close can we get?

127
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,648
If Pablo talks in Medellín,
we'll know every word he says.

128
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:26,277
- Can you get his exact location?
- If it's within range, yes.

129
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,615
All right, if Pablo uses the phone
outside of Medellín with the same codes,

130
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,908
can you hear him?

131
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:38,581
No. The antenna is not that strong.

132
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:43,312
Fuck!

133
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:40,799
Limón.

134
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,516
- No.

135
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,853
- No. No.

136
00:45:08,413 --> 00:45:09,915
Jhon!

137
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,171
She's on her way.

138
00:51:14,195 --> 00:51:16,072
Hey, man. How's it going?

139
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,075
Everything good at the safe house?

140
00:51:20,868 --> 00:51:22,954
- Where's Messina?
- Oh, she's gone.

141
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,791
Reassigned. Headed home.

142
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:30,878
Likely to spend the rest of her career
busting meth labs in Indianapolis.

143
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,214
Something about chain of command.

144
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,883
- And Judy?
- You didn't hear?

145
00:51:36,634 --> 00:51:41,848
Judy has an interview
with the Miami Herald in, uh...

146
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,850
oh, about five hours.

147
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:47,895
Now I can't be certain,
but I bet she has a story to tell

148
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,191
about the involvement of a certain
DEA agent with Los Pepes.

149
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,488
All I know for sure is,
whatever Judy has to say,

150
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,657
it won't be pointed in my direction.

151
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,910
You should've stayed in your lane.

152
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,204
Wow.

153
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,374
And Cali too, right?

154
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,586
They get a pass?

155
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,800
How much do they pay you
for your protection?

156
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,218
Pay me?

157
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:23,890
Let me tell you something, Agent Peña.

158
00:52:24,682 --> 00:52:27,101
Maybe it'll make you feel better,
but maybe not.

159
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:32,690
We're gonna get them someday.
But not your way.

160
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:37,904
For everything you know, you're, uh...
extremely naive.

161
00:52:38,988 --> 00:52:40,656
Anyway, I've enjoyed this.

162
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,408
The laughs.

163
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,452
Um... Oh.

164
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:46,579
I think the ambassador wants to see you.

165
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,417
I guess word about this Miami Herald thing
is spreading like a prairie fire.

166
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,836
And bring your passport.

167
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,714
I think you're going home, but...

168
00:52:58,299 --> 00:53:00,093
you didn't hear that from me.

169
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,616
Tata?

170
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,541
Pablo?
