Narcos 2x06
<i>Los Pepes</i>

3
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,217
<i> Colombia is a Catholic country,</i>
<i>so Christmas is a big deal.</i>

4
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:04,513
<i>But the people of Medellín
always take it to the next level.</i>

5
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:07,938
<i>And despite the manhunt
for Pablo going on around them,</i>

6
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:09,759
<i>this year was no different.</i>

7
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:13,229
<i>Call it faith, optimism,
or stubbornness,</i>

8
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:16,691
<i>the people of Medellín thought
they'd seen it all, but they hadn't.</i>

9
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:19,798
<i>In fact, they hadn't seen anything yet.</i>

10
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:31,320
PABLO MERRY CHRISTMAS
LOS PEPES

11
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:35,063
HAPPY HOLIDAYS

12
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,046
<i>Medellín was about to get a show
they would never forget.</i>

13
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:29,157
So Los Pepes
is an interesting new wrinkle.

14
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:34,430
Well, are you surprised?
Escobar's got a lot of enemies.

15
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:38,054
I heard from Messina this morning.
There's a lot of eyes on them

16
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,469
and us, so she wants us to steer clear.

17
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:46,466
- Are you working for Los Pepes, Murphy?
- No, I'm not.

18
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,782
Then I guess we're good.

19
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,487
<i>For Los Pepes, it was easy.</i>

20
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,466
<i>They had all the man-on-the-street
intelligence they needed.</i>

21
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:10,284
<i>If they'd heard a guy, take Jairo
for example, was in a certain vicinity,</i>

22
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:12,886
<i>they just asked around
and they'd find him.</i>

23
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:16,389
<i>But for us, well,
we had to go door-to-door,</i>

24
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:19,767
<i>asking for help from people
who don't tell cops shit.</i>

25
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:27,095
<i> Los Pepes, on the other hand,</i>
<i>had no problems.</i>

26
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,039
<i>They were quite persuasive.</i>

27
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,163
<i>Sure, once in a while,
we got lucky and picked somebody up.</i>

28
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,702
<i>But it was rarely the guy
we were looking for.</i>

29
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,274
<i>It was slow-going.</i>

30
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:05,647
We're too late.
Says they already got him.

31
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,853
We finally get corroboration on Jairo,
Martinez orders the raid...

32
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:19,910
So?

33
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:22,659
Well, so, how does Los Pepes
get here first?

34
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,043
Maybe he got followed.

35
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:31,505
Or the dumb fuck shot his mouth off
and somebody else got lucky.

36
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,383
Mmm. That's it?
That's all you got to say on that?

37
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:37,932
Yeah.

38
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,485
If it worries you, look into it.

39
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:47,522
<i>"Look into it"? Right.</i>

40
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:52,182
<i>Nobody was looking into it.
Why would they?</i>

41
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,571
<i>Pablo's crew was turning up dead
all over Medellín,</i>

42
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:57,907
<i>and Jairo became the latest victim.</i>

43
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,368
<i>The terror that Pablo had spread
across the country</i>

44
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:02,667
<i>was finally back on him tenfold.</i>

45
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:05,063
<i>Los Pepes' method was working.</i>

46
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:07,814
<i>And you better believe
it was getting to Escobar.</i>

47
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,168
IN DEFENSE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE

48
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:39,949
Pablo.

49
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:28,372
- Thank you.
- Oh!

50
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:56,275
<i>As gratifying as
these displays may feel,</i>

51
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,483
Centra Spike
give us anything good for Christmas?

52
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:54,092
Well, Blackie's been getting calls
from Envigado.

53
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,804
The son of a bitch has got a girlfriend.

54
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,975
Here, I'll give that to Martinez.
I'm sure it's gotta get vetted.

55
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:06,807
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

56
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,405
<i> I didn't know how Los Pepes</i>
<i>was beating us to the punch.</i>

57
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,772
<i>Not yet anyway.</i>

58
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,591
<i>What I did know was that if Search Bloc</i>

59
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:45,578
<i>was gonna have any kind of impact
on the hunt for Pablo,</i>

60
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:47,873
<i>we'd have to play the game
better and faster.</i>

61
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,467
All right, Blackie's had a girlfriend
in Envigado for a while.

62
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:53,015
According to Centra Spike,

63
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,835
the last known intercept
places her somewhere in this vicinity.

64
00:16:57,038 --> 00:16:59,547
Yeah. And how's that relevant?

65
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,571
Intel says she's pregnant.

66
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:05,381
I know protocol is to vet intel,
wait for corroboration,

67
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:07,483
but I feel this one in my gut, sir.

68
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:09,305
Blackie's gonna show.

69
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:13,602
Los Pepes keeps getting the jump on us,
<i>sicarios</i> are gonna keep winding up dead.

70
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:15,504
This way, we get to Blackie first,

71
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:18,640
bring that son of a bitch in
and get something out of him.

72
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:26,863
Well, we could set up a perimeter.

73
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:28,217
No one walks in or out.

74
00:17:28,242 --> 00:17:30,224
Collapse that perimeter house by house.

75
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,418
- Yeah.
- Sounds good to me.

76
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,925
- Hey!
- Hey.

77
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,176
What's going on?

78
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,850
Martinez gave the green light
to go after Blackie.

79
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:20,446
- It's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. Right.

80
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,562
Goddamn Christmas miracle.

81
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:07,751
We're moving in. Let's go.

82
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:50,798
- What's going on?
- Some shit's going down at checkpoint.

83
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,143
What the fuck is this?

84
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,271
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

85
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,952
- Put the fucking gun down!
- Easy! Easy!

86
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:52,590
- Let them pass.
- Okay.

87
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:56,946
Well then, thank you.

88
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,638
Trying to avoid a bloodbath, brother.

89
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:29,561
When were you gonna tell me
about your new friend Carlos Castaño?

90
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:38,053
He's not a friend, he's a...

91
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:40,080
he's a man with a shared interest.

92
00:24:40,326 --> 00:24:42,598
Jesus Christ.
I hope you know what you're doing.

93
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:44,709
Don't worry.
It's not gonna blow back on you.

94
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,943
- No, it's not me I'm worried about.
- I can handle it.

95
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:49,146
These aren't the guys
you wanna be messing with.

96
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,701
They're gonna do what they're gonna do
with or without me, right?

97
00:24:58,028 --> 00:25:02,545
At least this way...
I'm on the inside and I can control it.

98
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,709
- Make sure it doesn't go too far.
- So that doesn't go too far?

99
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,568
The good guys, they got guns
pointing at their fucking head

100
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,537
- and the bad guys get away with it?
- Who are the good guys, Steve?

101
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:15,639
That's us?

102
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,392
<i> Los Pepes may have</i>
<i>seemed to be running the board,</i>

103
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,963
<i>but Escobar still had a trick or two
up his sleeve.</i>

104
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:32,509
<i>Remember I told you Ricardo Prisco
was a licensed doctor?</i>

105
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,004
<i>Well, he was.</i>

106
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:38,334
<i>And as such, he had privileges at just
about every hospital in Medellín.</i>

107
00:26:38,634 --> 00:26:42,346
<i>Including the one where the Los Pepes
gunman he shot was recovering.</i>

108
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:46,646
<i>Unfortunately for that guy,
Dr. Prisco paid him a visit.</i>

109
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,105
Cheers!

110
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:35,722
Right?

111
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:31,298
Did you see this?

112
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,653
Reports of a massive bombing
in Cali last night.

113
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:36,511
Gilberto Rodríguez's
daughter's wedding?

114
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,198
I know of only one person in Colombia

115
00:36:39,223 --> 00:36:41,392
with the balls big enough
to go after that guy.

116
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:43,078
Yeah, Pablo Escobar.

117
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:45,176
He had to have had a damn good reason.

118
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:49,169
I'd like to shift some of our resources
from Medellín to Cali.

119
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:51,118
Now's a bad time
to deviate from Medellín.

120
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,629
Cali is trafficking
in the billions right now.

121
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,028
- If they get a free head start...
- You're not wrong.

122
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:58,223
But you're thinking about this
too logically.

123
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,679
The best thing for you right now
is to keep your head in the game.

124
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:06,403
Because right now,
the game is Pablo Escobar.

125
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,106
Right. Escobar.

126
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:14,785
I'll see you at the party tonight.

127
00:37:16,078 --> 00:37:18,840
We could all use a few hours' break
from this shit.

128
00:37:20,692 --> 00:37:22,110
I'll see you there.

129
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,877
Manuel.

130
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:21,103
Welcome, Mr. President.

131
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,386
Welcome, Ma'am.

132
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,622
Yeah, Bogotá is beautiful.

133
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:30,075
It's a lot more like
an American city than I thought.

134
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,602
I didn't know it'd be so cold.

135
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,228
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

136
00:39:21,451 --> 00:39:24,412
MERRY CHRISTMAS

137
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,344
Mr. President.

138
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:52,742
Lovely party, Ambassador.

139
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:57,108
It's nice we can pretend
we're all friends.

140
00:39:57,744 --> 00:40:01,331
Believe it or not, the State Department
does the guest list, not me.

141
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,851
I can't wait to tell them that

142
00:40:03,876 --> 00:40:06,070
he wants us to legalize drugs.

143
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,326
He thinks I should
publicly condemn Los Pepes.

144
00:40:11,588 --> 00:40:13,257
They're criminals.

145
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,867
Their activities cannot be condoned.

146
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:20,155
Even if one does approve of the results.

147
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:25,171
Mr. President, I'm no one to bullshit.

148
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,501
Maybe that's hurt me in my career.

149
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:30,695
Yes, Los Pepes are an ugly business.

150
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:35,626
They're getting to Escobar.

151
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,078
That's all that matters at the present.

152
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:43,484
If I condemn them,

153
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:45,711
I have to police them.

154
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:48,953
With politics and war...

155
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,349
the trick is in the timing.

156
00:40:51,835 --> 00:40:53,742
Watch how they evolve,

157
00:40:53,782 --> 00:40:56,789
how their actions are received.

158
00:40:56,845 --> 00:41:01,882
And, uh, up till then,
pretend they don't exist.

159
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:04,877
Well, we can if you can.

160
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:25,793
What are you up to in here?
Have a drink.

161
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,336
Thanks.

162
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,213
Saved me a trip to the bar.

163
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,757
Call it inter-agency cooperation.

164
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,304
Hmm. That's a joke.

165
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:38,367
And it's funny.

166
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:40,992
Cheers.

167
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,109
So where are you from, Bill?

168
00:41:43,405 --> 00:41:45,117
Originally, Oregon.

169
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,788
You were in Afghanistan, right?

170
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:52,083
Well, I could tell you that
but then I'd have to...

171
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,580
Funny.

172
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,921
I know Bill Haler.
He was our guy in Afghanistan.

173
00:42:01,665 --> 00:42:03,016
Oh, yeah.

174
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:05,832
DEA Bill, we used to call him.

175
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,351
I liked him. Stayed in his lane.

176
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:14,245
So, as I'm sure you know,

177
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:18,845
I recently asked for a resource redirect
into some emerging players

178
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,288
in the trafficking world.

179
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,958
A group based in Cali. Ring a bell?

180
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,005
We're not gonna talk
about work, are we?

181
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,610
My request was denied, Bill.

182
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,554
- We were just getting to know each other.
- So I spoke to DEA Bill.

183
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:32,593
- He's in Washington now.
- You don't say.

184
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:36,624
And he told me the roadblock
was caused by the agency.

185
00:42:37,574 --> 00:42:39,868
Something about an ongoing operation.

186
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:44,179
He actually said,
"That sounds like CIA Bill."

187
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:49,348
Look, I don't care what you do
with the commies and the paramilitaries.

188
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:53,914
But as soon as your
ongoing operations involve narcos...

189
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:56,828
you're in my backyard.

190
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,914
Quickly!

191
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:04,429
Carlos!

192
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,724
- Pablo!
- Carlos!

193
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,388
No!

194
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,535
Carlos!

195
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:35,027
No!

196
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:49,784
