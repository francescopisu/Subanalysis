La Quica made him Escobar's chauffeur.

179
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:42,290
This girl Maritza was actually in
the back seat serving as a cover

180
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,292
while Escobar was in the fucking trunk.

181
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,128
- And he knows her how?
- They grew up together here.

182
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:50,006
[Carrillo scoffs softly]

183
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,260
So this guy Limón,
there's no record of him.

184
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:57,180
There's no known connection
between him and Escobar,

185
00:30:57,263 --> 00:30:59,223
yet somehow he ends up the driver.

186
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:02,518
Makes sense for La Quica to hire
someone the police didn't know about.

187
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:04,896
What does she want out of
this? A ticket to Disneyland?

188
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:07,440
She knows she doesn't get
shit if it doesn't pan out.

189
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,889
[in Spanish]

190
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:19,160
[in English] You were
there. You trust her?

191
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:23,081
Yeah.

192
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:25,708
Yeah, I do.

193
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,345
When we get the location, I want
Centra Spike up in the air to confirm.

194
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,596
[in Spanish]

195
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:44,477
- [in English] All right. This is good.
- Let's go.

196
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:51,984
[in Spanish]

197
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,355
[sighs] [clears throat]

198
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:31,167
[resumes typing]

199
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:34,337
[phone rings]

200
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,764
[softly]

201
00:34:39,986 --> 00:34:44,824
[laughing]

202
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,834
[grunts]

203
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:24,966
[phone rings]

204
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:25,883
Peña.

205
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:39,313
[in English] I need to know if
there's activity around this address.

206
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,774
You get a match on a voice,
you find me immediately.

207
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:43,359
Okay. You got it.

208
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:04,255
[distorted voices over recording]

209
00:37:04,964 --> 00:37:06,190
This was recorded about

210
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:07,699
- five minutes ago.
- You can barely hear it.

211
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:08,759
Let me clean it up.

212
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:16,892
[Pablo in Spanish]

213
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:18,686
- That's Pablo.
- We have to move now.

214
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,896
- Yeah.
- [Messina] You two are staying here.

215
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:22,898
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

216
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:25,032
Crosby finds out you
went on another raid,

217
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:25,800
we all get a ticket home.

218
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,166
Crosby doesn't have to know shit.

219
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:29,864
It's not negotiable.

220
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,578
We'll be in radio contact.

221
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:39,415
Jesus.

222
00:37:49,925 --> 00:37:53,429
[in Spanish]

223
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:58,184
[man]

224
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:14,658
[indistinct chatter over radios]

225
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,547
[in Spanish]

226
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:31,258
[in English] Copy that.
Watch your six, guys.

227
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:33,928
<i>How's it looking out there?</i>

228
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,781
[in Spanish]

229
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:40,142
[chuckles]

230
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:41,477
[in English] Cheap bastards.

231
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:45,272
<i>Don't forget to pick me and
Peña up some cigars on the way.</i>

232
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,525
[in Spanish]

233
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,449
[indistinct shouting over radio]

234
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:05,501
[man shouts in Spanish]

235
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,508

[men yelling]

239
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:27,356
[in English] Goddamn it, speak
to me! We need people there.

240
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:31,443
[grunts]

241
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,487
[man yelling in Spanish]

242
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,209
Fuck!

243
00:40:24,163 --> 00:40:25,289
[in Spanish]

244
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,841
[whispers]

245
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,274
[sirens wailing in distance]

246
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:40,591
[in English] I'll go back to Bogotá
with the body until the funeral.

247
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:44,261
They call his wife?

248
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,388
Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.

249
00:42:48,223 --> 00:42:51,810
This ain't on you,
Javi. It's on Escobar.

250
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:54,230
And one way or another, he pays.

251
00:42:55,981 --> 00:42:59,026
We all do. Right?

252
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:19,755
[ambulance siren wailing]

253
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,602
[knocking at door]

254
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,578
This isn't your fault, Peña.

255
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,039
- No?
- No.

256
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:02,339
- I got played.
- We all got played.

257
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:05,342
We all had the information, it
was backed up by Centra Spike...

258
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:06,468
Stop.

259
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:10,180
Just...

260
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:15,602
You know, you coming here...

261
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,691
you say all the right things.

262
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:27,072
Doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

263
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,832
Colonel Carrillo's
funeral will be tomorrow.

264
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,711
[door closes]

265
00:44:40,794 --> 00:44:42,838
I don't do funerals.

266

00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:14,039
Hey.

276
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,001
What are you doing here?

277
00:52:22,964 --> 00:52:24,341
Where's Olivia?

278
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:27,385
She's at home. With my sister.

279
00:52:38,146 --> 00:52:39,648
Hey, you okay?

280
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:49,658
- [whimpers]
- Hey.
