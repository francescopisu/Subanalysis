00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,838
[IN SPANISH] I turned in
my weapon and my badge.

519
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,217
Good luck.

520
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,636
Colonel...

521
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,724
I'm sorry.

522
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:43,027
Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

523
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,448
You did everything right, Peña.

524
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,202
But now you're all alone.

525
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,413
[IN ENGLISH] Take care.

526
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,194
[IN SPANISH] We need to
talk about your security.

527
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,906
Let me be in charge.

528
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,201
I'll protect you, Dad.

529
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,165
Now's not the time for a change.

530
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,091
We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

531
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,556
What if he doesn't come back?

[PAOLA] Jorge.

534
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:11,823
Jorge.

535
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,385
- They got Gilberto.
- [PACHO]<i> I don't understand.</i>

536
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,221
I thought Gilberto had
this all under control.

537
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:35,764
<i>So did I.</i>

538
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:38,976
And what now?

539
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,978
<i>This could get messy.</i>

540
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:45,149
<i>Stay where you are. Right now,
we look out for ourselves.</i>

<i>For now, we wait.</i>

543
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,576
You stay there a while longer.

544
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,746
We have to keep everything running.

546
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,129
Yes. Of course.

You listening to me, motherfucker?

548

[IN ENGLISH] Hey, listen,
buddy, I don't speak Spanish.

549
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,516
No speak Spanish.

550
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,936
Okay.

551
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,021
Have a nice day.

Hey, boss. Good day today, huh?

The Jurado tapes.

554
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,185
Well, we probably shouldn't call them
that because they're not legal, per se.

555
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,478
I want all of them.
