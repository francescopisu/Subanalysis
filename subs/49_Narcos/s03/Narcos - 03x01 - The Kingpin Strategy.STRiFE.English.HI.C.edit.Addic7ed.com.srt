The last time I saw Danny, he was
riding a big wheel down the sidewalk.

10
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,511
It means a lot to your
<i>tía</i> that you're here.

- Don Chucho.
- [in Spanish] Luis, how are you?

12
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,714
How are you, sir?

13
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:02,477
- Javi.
- [in English] Hey, Luis.

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,522
We heard about what you did in
Colombia. We sure are proud of you.

15
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,009
- Thanks, Luis. Have a good night.
- You, too.

Hey!

19
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,169
- [in English] Be right back, Pops.
- Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,338
- Here you go, sweetheart. You got that?
- [boy] Yummy!

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,584
Hey, Lorraine.

22
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,012
Javi. Heard you were back.

23
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,182
I mean, the whole
town's talking about it.

24
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,391
I had some time off.

25
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,145
Decided to spend it here?

26
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,022
Actually, I'm...

27
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,786
trying to quit.

28
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,031
Doing the Nicorette thing.

29
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:56,619
Look at you. A whole new man.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,293
Listen, Lorraine...

31
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,840
I just wanted to say I've
thought about things...

32
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,841
and I'm real sorry about all of it.

33
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,803
You waited ten years
to tell me you're sorry?

34
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,847
I know what I did.

35
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,392
I was, um...

36
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,356
It was wrong.

37
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,566
I forgave you a long time ago, Javi.

38
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,071
The truth is, I'm grateful.

39
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,032
I ended up where I'm supposed to be.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,159
Maybe we both did.

41
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,661
If you hadn't come into my
life and disappeared from it,

42
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,289
none of that would have ever happened.

43
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,709
Can you imagine if we
were actually married?

44
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,380
- Here you go, baby.
- Thank you.

45
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,634
- Hey, Jav.
- Randy.

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,759
- How are you?
- Good.

47
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,387
Yeah, I just... I just wanted to say hi.

48
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,390
Yeah.

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,351
You hungry?

50
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,646
[Lorraine] Oh, you are getting so big.

51
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,620
I know you didn't like it
tonight, all the attention, but...

52
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,955
folks want to pay their respects.

53
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,583
You're a hero to them.

54
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,295
I'm not a hero.

55
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,530
[in Spanish] Will you tell me something?

56
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:03,840
What happened to you over there?

57
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,476
- Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.
- But you want to go back?

58
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,719
[in English] When you
were a kid, a little guy,

59
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,720
all you wanted to do
was get out of here,

60
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,515
out into the world.

61
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,100
But you didn't like what you found.

62
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,520
A lot of people don't.

63
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,064
But don't try to change it.

64
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,402
More likely, it'll change you.

65
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,655
It was right here, wasn't it?

66
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,991
The last time we had this conversation.

67
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,454
You didn't listen to me then, either.

68
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,414
Nope.

00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,834
[grunts]

70
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,214
So, Cali.

71
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,302
Cali.

[in Spanish] Sir, here you are.

75
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,778
Thank you.

00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,579
[Peña] <i>I'm not a hero.</i>

77
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,498
<i>There were some in the hunt for Escobar.</i>

78
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,586
<i>A lot, actually.</i>

79
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,839
<i>But it's tough to see them
through all the blood.</i>

80
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,531
<i>To kill a monster, sometimes you have
to get in bed with other monsters.</i>

<i>If that surprises you,
pick up a history book.</i>

<i>The enemy of my enemy is my friend,

<i>The day Pablo went down, the Cali
cartel became Public Enemy Number One.</i>

86
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,821
<i>And the fact that they helped us
bring him down didn't mean shit.</i>

87
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,659
Many observers fear Colombia's
other large cartel, the Cali cartel,

88
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,994
will now simply step up
its own drug production.

89
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,913
[Peña] <i>And that's exactly what happened.</i>

90

<i>While the world was focused on Escobar,</i>

91
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:42,056

grown exponentially,</i>

00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:49,092
<i>Where Pablo sought the love and
protection of the masses of Medellín,</i>

94
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,427
<i>these guys rubbed shoulders
with Colombia's elite</i>

95
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,311
<i>and called themselves
"the Gentlemen of Cali."</i>

96
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:58,441
<i>And whereas Escobar craved the spotlight,
these guys stayed in the shadows,</i>

<i>Pacho Herrera, head of
distribution and security.</i>

<i>He led a team of young psychopaths

<i>Grew up with the Rodríguez brothers.</i>

113
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,521
<i>He was in charge of U.S. operations</i>

00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:53,110
<i>and responsible for Cali's
crown jewel: New York City.</i>

115
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:57,698
<i>He actually lived there, under
an assumed name, of course.</i>

116
00:08:58,616 --> 00:09:02,284
<i>Cartel's number two was operations
chief: Miguel Rodríguez.</i>

[in Spanish] Palmira's
police superintendent.

118
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,632
Didn't we just take care of him?

119
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:08,541
- I'm talking about the new one, Arango.
- How much?

120
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:10,291
- Should I put $20,000?
- No.

121
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:12,672
Put 17.

122
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,464
- Seventeen?
- Yes.

123
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,883
[Peña] <i>Miguel watched over
all the money coming in,</i>

124
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,846
<i>and what bribes they were paying out.</i>

125
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:23,722
<i>And last but not least, cartel CEO, the</i>

126
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:26,809
<i>man with the plan: Gilberto Rodríguez.</i>

127
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:30,231
<i>They called him the Chess Player,
because he was always one move ahead.</i>

128
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,151
<i>They were the pinnacle of trafficking
evolution. Apex drug dealers.</i>

129
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:38,612
<i>And being number two
allowed them to quietly grow</i>

130
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:41,699
<i>into the biggest cocaine
cartel in history.</i>

131
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,868
<i>Except now, that was over.</i>

132
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,495
<i>Now that the guy that occupied
our attention was gone,</i>

133
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,624
<i>they were number one
with a fucking bullet.</i>

134
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:53,460
<i>And there was no chess move
that would get them out of it.</i>

135
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,739
<i>But I was looking forward
to seeing them try.</i>

No.

140
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,733
I'll speak for the both of us.

- Did you talk to the North Valley people?
- Yes.

142

And?

143
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:24,450
They said what they
thought I wanted to hear.

144
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:27,870
But tonight, after the
announcement, we'll know the truth.

[Córdova] Gentlemen. Let's
start with the obvious.

159
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:47,700
Tonight is fucking important.

160
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,785

organization in one place.

162
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:56,806
That simply never happens. But
tonight, they're going to do it.

163
00:11:58,295 --> 00:11:59,714
So we have to be sharp.

164
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:03,549
- Eyes in the back of the head, understood?
- Yes, sir.

165
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,593
- Jorge.
- Stay focused.

166
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:09,555

168

He's leaving us to become
a fancy businessman.

169
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:18,897
Let's leave a good impression.

170
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,358
Maybe he'll hire us one day.

00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:24,029
Let's go.

00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:33,914
What do you think Gilberto
is going to announce tonight?

174
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,125
I think it's a move
into the Asian market.

175
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:39,793
I have no idea.

176
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:42,045
After Friday, it's not my problem.

177
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:43,591
Are you really leaving?

178
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:45,843
I promised Paola.

179
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:51,305
I promise things to my
wife every day, brother.

180
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:52,639
[chuckles]

181
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,423
Relax, you'll find someone
else to make you look good.

182
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,895
I hope so, buddy.

183
00:12:57,897 --> 00:13:00,733
Because right now, I'm
surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

184
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:14,077
[Stoddard in English]
Congratulations on the promotion, sir.

185
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,537
Tell me what you do again.

186
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,375
I'm the deputy country attaché.
I'll also be your driver.

187
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:20,544
I drive myself.

188
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:25,925
You know, you're kind of a big
deal around here. Since Escobar.

189
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,511
- Katie.
- Good morning.

190
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:33,098
Sir, can I ask?

191
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:35,184
What was Escobar like?

192
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:37,186
Never met him.

193
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:42,815
[Peña] <i>Just because we'd been focused
on Escobar the past few years</i>

194
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,692
<i>didn't mean we were completely
ignoring the Cali godfathers.</i>

195
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:49,029
I want updates from Duffy and Lopez
on where we're at with Cornerstone.

196
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,524
- ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:02,835
Those are our intelligence
summaries on the Cali cartel.

198
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,504
I don't want summaries.
Where's everything else?

199
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:08,465
[Peña] <i>We had agents
on them the whole time.</i>

200
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:09,635
<i>Good agents.</i>

201
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,556
<i>And recently, we had gotten lucky.</i>

202
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:17,726
You got some kind of medical condition?

203
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:21,186
Oh. No, I got one.

204
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:23,272
[Peña] <i>The latest break
in the case against Cali</i>

205
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:26,694
<i>came from a joint Customs-DEA
operation called Cornerstone.</i>

206
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:32,449
<i>And it put a lot of mid-level Cali
guys behind bars in the States.</i>

207
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,994
<i>And while they weren't
eager to help us,</i>

208
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:39,913
<i>you could always count on some
poor relative in Colombia...</i>

209
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:41,540
[phone rings]

210
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:45,226
<i>who would do whatever it takes to
get their brother or son back home.</i>

211
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:46,795
[in Spanish] Who am I speaking with?

212
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:49,339
<i>And if that sounds harsh,
that's because it is.</i>

213
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:51,550
This is Andres, his brother.

214
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:53,010
<i>The DEA doesn't fuck around.</i>

215
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:54,346
And how can I help him?

216
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,808
[cumbia music playing]

217
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:09,319
Here we go.

218
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:13,157
[in Spanish] Hey, brother. Have a seat.

219
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:17,661
Something to drink?

220
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:24,166
[in English] You're fine, brother.
Nobody out here knows us.

221
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,001
Cali cops don't even know we're here.

222
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:28,295
[in Spanish] Relax. You're safe here.

223
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:30,130
[Duffy in English] Lay it on him.

224
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:32,549
[in Spanish] Let's talk
about tonight's party.

225
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:35,719
We need info on the people attending.

226
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,387
Cops, politicians.

227
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:39,395
- Cops and politicians?
- Yes.

228
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:43,486
Who work for the cartel. These
people are ruining your country.

229
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,120
[Duffy in English]
And the why. Tell him.

230
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:49,659
[in Spanish] Look, the thing is, these

231
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:52,277
people never get together in one place.

232
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,072
We need to know why now.

233
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:57,950
Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez

234
00:15:57,952 --> 00:16:00,246
is making some kind of
important announcement.

235
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:02,053
Understand?

236
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,347
[in English] If no...

237
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:07,644
bye-bye, <i>hermano.</i>

238
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:17,179
- How are things in Texas, Agent Peña?
- Hot.

239
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:22,683
How's the family? You know, you
had a few more weeks off coming.

240
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:24,248
Could've spent more time at home.

241
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,586
Yeah, well, I guess they
couldn't wait to get rid of me.

242
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:33,360
Sir, this operation in Miami,
Cornerstone, shook some leads loose.

243
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:34,905
Could be a break on Cali.

244
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:39,535
- Anyone testifying?
- No, but it put an asset in play.

245
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,301
Could shed some light
on their next move.

246
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,920
Things won't be like
Escobar, Agent Peña.

247
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,881
It can't be. Things
have changed down here.

248
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,218
New President coming in.

249
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:59,333
Gaviria put up with things
that this guy might not.

250
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:03,643
Just take it a little slowly.

251
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:06,399
Get your feet under you,
get used to the new job.

252
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:11,734
Sir, the CIA station chief...

253
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,611
he and I have history.

254
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,570
I'm hoping it won't be
an issue moving forward.

255
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:19,573
I know you and Stechner
have your differences.

256
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:22,284
- It won't be a problem.
- I'm not sure I share your confidence.

257
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:24,371
Stechner signed off on your appointment.

258
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,124
In fact, he wanted you back.

259
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,793
The CIA and the DEA need to
work together on this one.

260
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:33,297
We have the same goal.

261
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,643
[knocking on door]

262
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:52,107
Come in.

263
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:58,072
<i>Hola,</i> brother.

264
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:01,365
We were starting to
worry. Everything cool?

265
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:04,659
[in Spanish] We were getting
worried. Everything okay?

266
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:07,037
Yes, but... I thought
someone was tailing me.

267
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,082
- He thinks he may have been followed.
- No, yeah, I figured.

268
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,169
I had to make sure I was alone.

269
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,369
Let's get you suited up.
Run through the plan again.

270
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:17,466
[in Spanish] Take off your shirt. Sit.

271
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:23,512
Okay.

272
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:24,471
Ready.

273
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:25,474
We're good to go.

[Spanish language music playing]

275
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,375
[in Spanish] Look, don't you think you

276
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,552
should fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

277
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:23,490
He's a boss.

278
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,452
We're in their territory, right?

279
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:32,956
Yes. Yes.

280
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,334
I'll fix it tonight.

281
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,336
María.

282
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,671
María.

283
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:44,801
For our children, and
our children's children.

284
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,683
That sounded great, brother.

285
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:50,807
Let me do it from the top.

286
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:55,063
No one gives a shit about your
speech. We can hear it after...

287
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,898
- Pacho!
- Chepe!

288
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,985
Come here, you crazy motherfucker.

289
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:04,279
What's up?

290
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:07,032
Look at you. How's New York?

291
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:10,954
Cold. But if you ask nicely,
the girls make up for it.

292
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,707
I brought you something, baby-face.

293
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,587
Lovely. Thanks.

294
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:24,468
It's been too long since
we were all together.

295
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:30,924
Tonight is our night,
because we've earned this.

- Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!
- Cheers!

297
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,188
I think there is business
to discuss first, Gilberto.

298
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,902
You're acting like someone
just pissed you off.

299
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:45,986
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

300
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:47,405
But I work harder than him.

301
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:48,990
Cheers, then!

302
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:49,952
To the Pope!

Look, Gilberto...

306
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:03,672
you know I have a personal issue

307
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:06,677
with that son of a bitch,
Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

308
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,263
And he's downstairs.

309
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,348
I would like to solve it.

310
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:15,976
[Gilberto] Okay, Pacho.

311
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:22,107
I understand your need for revenge,
but this isn't the time to get into it.

312
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:23,527
There's too much at stake.

313
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,698
Well... shall we enjoy this
expensive party or what?

314
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,579
No. Instead, let's listen
to Gilberto's speech again.

315
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,079

Look, that's Menga's chief of police.

00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:02,482
I pay him money every month.

320
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:05,775
I pay all these people.

321
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:08,737
Well done, big shot.

322
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:10,155
It's not your money.

323
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:12,073
But I'm the one who controls it.

324
00:22:12,075 --> 00:22:14,659
- Who bought you these earrings?
- Guillermo. Enough.

325
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:16,747
Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.

326
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:23,045
Shit. Get out of here.

327
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:40,185
- How are you, sir?
- Pallomari.

328
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:42,105
- Enjoying the party?
- Yes.

329

Yes.

Nice to see you.

- Welcome, Mr. Mayor.
- Don Gilberto, how are you?

[man] Good evening, Don Gilberto.

334

- Good evening.
- Can I have <i>aguardiente</i> with ice?

339

- Of course.
- Thank you.

340

Are you...

341
00:23:47,504 --> 00:23:49,212
enjoying yourself?

342
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:51,716
Yes. Very much, thank you.

00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:29,711
Mr. Rodríguez would
like for his associates

348
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:32,048
to join him in the equestrian
ring for an announcement.

349
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:33,844
Please, go right ahead.

350
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:38,219
Gentlemen, please follow the
ushers towards the stables.

351
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:39,557
Thank you.

352
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:45,562
Stop there.

353
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:48,980
You must be using
some high-end equipment

354
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:51,109
if you're getting anything
in this shitty light.

355
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,602
Who are you?

356
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,774
I'm in charge of security
for the Rodríguez brothers.

357
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:57,949
See that man over there?

358
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:00,535
His name is Navegante.

359
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,454
Guess what he does?

360
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:07,999
Either you come with
me, or you go with him.

361
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,508
You understand?

362
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:11,963
Follow me.

363
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:31,773
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

364
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:33,818
You live with your mother
in commune number 3.

365
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,405
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

366
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:41,199
Your brother is Lucho.

367
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:44,661
He's in federal custody
in the United States.

368
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:47,121
That's why you agreed
to work for the DEA.

369
00:25:47,123 --> 00:25:48,750
Don't lie to me.

370
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:51,876
Andrés, you made a bad decision.

371
00:25:51,878 --> 00:25:55,298
But I think you're smart
enough to realize that.

372
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:57,842
You have another decision to make,

373
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,846
and it's the only way to get out alive.

374
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,055
Leave Cali.

375
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:07,350
Don't say goodbye to your
mother or to your girlfriend.

376
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:09,015
I need you to disappear.

377
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:14,651
Associates.

378
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:16,778
Friends.

379
00:26:18,113 --> 00:26:19,821
Our enemy is dead!

380
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:21,781
[supportive cheers]

381
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:24,411
Our business is strong!

382
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:27,745
Together we have taken this business

383
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:31,374
to heights that our predecessors
couldn't have imagined.

384
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:38,049
But friends... there's circumstances
that we need to acknowledge.

385
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:45,888
Stoddard!

386
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,890
[Gilberto] <i>Listen to me.</i>

387
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:51,150
<i>The law enforcement spotlight will shine</i>

388
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:54,568
<i>brightly on us, as it
once did on Escobar.</i>

389
00:26:55,817 --> 00:26:58,901
<i>And so, while we celebrate,</i>

390
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:03,742
<i>they will do everything they can to
take away everything we've built.</i>

391
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,120
<i>An American named Joseph Kennedy</i>

392
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:12,540
made his fortune selling
bootlegged liquor,

393
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,876
but he turned that
money into legitimacy.

394
00:27:14,878 --> 00:27:17,128
His children, great politicians.

395
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,717
And one of them was
even elected president.

396
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:26,304
Yes, gentlemen, we have been
negotiating with the authorities,

397
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:28,139
and soon we will reach an agreement.

398
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:29,351
[low murmurs]

399
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:39,277
Our organization, within six months,
will be out of the cocaine business.

400
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:44,113
We will surrender our labs,

401
00:27:44,115 --> 00:27:46,366
our safe houses,

402
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:48,618
and our trafficking routes.

403
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,081
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake

404
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:55,541
of thinking it won't be on our terms.

405
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:58,878
Any prison sentences will be minimal.

406
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,673
Our money will remain ours.

407
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:04,594
Our legitimate businesses
will continue to grow.

408
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:09,265
We have six months to make
as much money as possible!

409
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:13,059
And gentlemen, as a
token of our friendship,

410
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:18,439
we'll give each of you a juicy share

411
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:21,444
of the final profits from this year.

412
00:28:22,654 --> 00:28:24,406
[scattered supportive cheers]

413
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:31,828
To the bright future
we'll all soon enjoy.

414
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,834
For our children... and
our children's children!

415
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:40,338
- Cheers...
- Cheers!

416
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:43,297
- Cheers, gentlemen!
- Cheers!

417
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:46,428
- What did you think?
- I think it's a great move.

418
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:50,974
- Congratulations!
- For the future!

419
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:56,980
Thank you, brother.
Thank you for coming.

420
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:16,789
[bartender in Spanish]
What would you like?

421
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,084
Whiskey. Dry.

422
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:24,507
[in English] Hey, sir!

423
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:28,885
We were wondering if we
could get you a drink.

424
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,972
I'm good. Thanks.

425
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,851
Okay.

426
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:40,231
[in Spanish] Six months.

427
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,026
I'm going to bleed New York dry.

428
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:47,612
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty
and fuck her right up her ass.

429
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:50,033
[chuckles]

430
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:54,913
And then what?

431
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,959
We only have six months of
doing whatever the fuck we want?

432
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:10,166
Hello.

433
00:30:14,808 --> 00:30:15,934
I love you, brother.

434
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,022
I'll see you on the dance floor.

435
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:35,578
[indistinct chatter]

436
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,668
- Can you get in the car, please?
- Why do you want to leave so early?

437
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,128
Because it's time, okay?

438
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,930
- Why are you treating me like this?
- Enough!

439
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:49,050
Get in the car.

440
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:57,849
[car door opens and closes]

441
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,894
[engine revs]

442
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,571
[chatter over radio]

443
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:15,950
[knock on door]

444
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:17,585
How was everything tonight, Jorge?

445
00:31:18,718 --> 00:31:19,956
Very good, sir.

446
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:25,710
Do you think we surprised them?

447
00:31:25,712 --> 00:31:29,048
Yes. I think you surprised many people.

448
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:35,513
I'm told we had an uninvited
guest. What happened there?

449
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:40,935
Don't be modest.

450
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:43,146
Córdova told me.

451
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:45,857
It's your talent.

452
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:49,527
Spotting the threat, knowing
when they're going to fuck us.

453
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:52,697
It's priceless.

454
00:31:54,532 --> 00:31:55,533
[chuckles]

455
00:31:57,327 --> 00:31:59,329
I'm told you want to leave.

456
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:06,419
I'm grateful to you
and your family, but...

457
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:11,132
I'm starting my own security firm.

458
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:17,138
I only wanted to stay until...
Escobar stopped being a threat.

459
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:21,726
And we are very grateful. Honestly.

460
00:32:22,894 --> 00:32:25,770
You have done great things
for us over the years.

461
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:28,274
For my family. For me.

462
00:32:30,735 --> 00:32:33,238
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

463
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:47,792
With all due respect, I've
already made arrangements...

464
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:49,295
Arrangements can change.

465
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:55,176
Look, we didn't get where we are
by allowing good people to leave.

466
00:32:57,011 --> 00:33:00,014
We will need you more than
ever in the months ahead.

467
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:03,601
It's only six months.

468
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:08,189
Can I count on you, Jorge?

469
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:11,526
Yes?

470
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:16,990
Of course, boss.

471
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:19,158
Miguel.

472
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,597
[in English] Pretty girl.

473
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:46,185
Displays some shaky
judgment in men, though.

474
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:51,774
Welcome back, Agent Peña.

475
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:54,275
<i>Mazel tov</i> on the promotion.

476
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:59,113
That extra, what, 9K a year
is really gonna come in handy.

477
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:00,158
[in Spanish] The same.

478
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:02,657
[in English] So?

479
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,785
You signed off on me
coming back to Bogotá.

480
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:06,245
Did indeed.

481
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:09,081
Because you know how things work.

482
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,044
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

483
00:34:14,047 --> 00:34:17,340
To the folks back in
D.C., Escobar was a win.

484
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:18,426
[in Spanish] Thanks.

485
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:23,264
[in English] But down here...
we know what it cost, don't we?

486
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,043
Medellín was a failure.

487
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:27,503
Thousands of Colombians dead,

488
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:30,144
and coke still flooding
American streets by the ton.

489
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:33,900
Oh, come on. You don't care about
American streets or dead Colombians.

490
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,131
What was accomplished, Agent Peña?

491
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:46,829
We do Cali differently.

492
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:50,333
No swallowing the spider
to catch the fly this time.

493
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,169
America's got plans for Colombia.

494
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,631
Another bloodbath complicates them.

495
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,053
So...

496
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:05,181
what's the play?

497
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:08,681
Surrender.

498
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:10,226
Cali cartel throws in the towel.

499
00:35:10,228 --> 00:35:13,523
Hands over the keys to the biggest
criminal enterprise in history.

500
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:17,441
As far as I'm concerned, the
DEA can even take the credit.

501
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:19,112
And these fucking guys walk?

502
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:22,321
Negotiations are on the two-yard line,

503
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:25,410
but it has backing from Washington.

504
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:31,288
So, what the fuck do you need me for?

505
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,335
Well, you're the dashing DEA
agent that took down Escobar.

506
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:37,755
Always helps to have a hero on board.

507
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:41,551
Don't worry. Cali will serve some time.

508
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,178
Technically speaking.

509
00:35:46,222 --> 00:35:47,265
And that's enough for you?

510
00:35:48,558 --> 00:35:53,646
If there were any justice in this
world, Javier, you'd be in jail.

511
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,572
I know your guys are running
an operation on Cali tonight.

512
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,490
Please.

513
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:10,788
I can tell you this:
it'll come up double zeros.

514
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,251
These guys don't make mistakes.

515
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:19,380
You try to go after the Cali bosses,
all you'll get are more bodies.

516
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:43,696
I don't know, man.

517
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:46,655
I met him at an embassy
thing about a year ago.

518
00:36:46,657 --> 00:36:47,573
Yeah?

519
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:49,742
Couldn't drink it or fuck
it, dude wasn't interested.

520
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:51,329
[chuckles]

521
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:55,333
I hear you. I mean, he's not a bad guy.

522
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:59,253
He was in my class at the Academy.

523
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:03,883
