00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,982
[David in Spanish] Careful.
You already lost one.

3
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,360
Good.

4
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,988
- Faster, gentlemen, please.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:35,158
How's it coming?

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,202
This is fucking cool.

7
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,122
- What did I tell you, motherfucker?
- [laughs]

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,625
Stop fucking around.

9
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,794
I don't want to be here
all night. Understood?

10
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,003
Yes, it's all good.

11
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,632
Let's go.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,302
Fucking idiot.

13
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,683
My dad had 20 years in this
shit. I only have six months.

14
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,144
Pedal to the metal then, bitch.

15
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:07,704
How many of these things
do we have to empty?

16
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:10,277
[David] How much fucking
money do you want to make?

17
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,736
[Dario] A fucking lot.

18
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,366

[Peña in English] <i>In its
prime, the Cali cartel</i>

22
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,427

a month into America...</i>

23
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,594
<i>most of it through
their New York operation</i>

24
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,305
<i>and an alliance with Mexican
traffickers out of Juárez</i>

25
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,995
<i>that brought tons of
product across our border.</i>

26
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:49,666
<i>That means that in an
average six-month period,</i>

27
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,338
<i>they could put 180 tons on the street.</i>

28
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,480
<i>But there was nothing
average about this.</i>

29
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:02,157
<i>These were the last six months
in the life of the Cali cartel.</i>

30
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,202
<i>They were going for it, making
sure there were no loose ends.</i>

00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,205
[woman in Spanish] Mrs. Salazar?

[knock on door]

34
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,627
Mrs. Salazar, housekeeping.

35
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,549
- Come back later, please.
- As you wish.

36
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,029
If you want something done right...

37
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,282
you have to do it yourself.

38
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,366
Just like in life, Don Gilberto.

39
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,163
If you don't play, you're
going to watch others score.

40
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,585
My organization has four partners,

41
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,879
but only one leader.

42
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,047
I wanted to meet with you

43
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,928
to make sure there are no
misunderstandings in the North Valley

44
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,179
regarding the restructuring,

45
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,014
and the necessary house cleaning.

46
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:14,646
No, we were simply curious
about Claudio Salazar's absence.

47
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,523
I will be honest with you.

48
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,942
Salazar never contributed a thing.

49
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,985
He never gave anyone work.

50
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,071
He made more noise than money.

51
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,742
Better said, too much noise.

52
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,332
We are moving forward with the plan,

53
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,963
and we would like to know if
our friends are in agreement.

54
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,507
Your message about the
surrender was very clear,

55
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,887
and was very well received by
all of us in the North Valley.

56
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,057
Have a safe trip home.

57
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,852
Henao... thank you for your friendship.

58
00:05:53,457 --> 00:05:54,604
Excuse me.

59
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:58,817
Pacho.

60
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:05,365
Pacho.

61
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,534
Let's take advantage of this
window to maximize our profits.

62
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,163
I'd like to double our
output through Mexico.

63
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,247
Why don't you go there?

64
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,586
Meet with Carrillo
Fuentes. He likes you.

65
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,130
Make one last deal.

66
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:26,094
We both know that isn't the only
reason you're sending me there.

67
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,513
Pacho.

68
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,474
Look, Pacho...

69
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,269
I think it would be best if
you left Cali for a bit...

70
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,940
while things cool off.

71
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:46,239
Remember, Pacho, we're going to
walk away from this happy and rich.

72
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,700
[Peña in English] <i>Like I
said, they were going for it.</i>

73
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,620
<i>While they were building up
their retirement accounts,</i>

74
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,373
<i>what were we doing about it?</i>

75
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:57,607
<i>Jack shit.</i>

76
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:04,124
[Vargas] I don't want to rub
your noses in that, gentlemen.

77
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:07,258
My concern is that your men in Cali

78
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,804
didn't so much as contact
my senior officer there.

79
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:17,562
We've agreed that we can't have
those kinds of unilateral operations.

80
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,315
Our laws, our rules, will be respected.

81
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,192
Of course, General.

82
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,780
We apologize for the misunderstanding.

83
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,030
Won't happen again.

84
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:34,162
Well, I'm sorry, but I will
need more than your assurances.

85
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:44,381
Colonel.

86
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,293
Agent Peña.

87
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:51,004
How's your son?

88
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,887
Oh, he's fine.

89
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,809
He got transferred to technical
services. Better fit for him.

90
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,227
Maybe I should join him.

91
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,146
Not a lot of police work these days.

92
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,981
Yeah.

93
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,775
What did you expect?

94
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,572
When you sell your soul to the devil,
you're not allowed to ask for it back.

95
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:17,791
The men who let loose Los Pepes on
Colombia should have been arrested.

96
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,458
Instead, they got promoted.

97
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,794
[elevator beeps]

98
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:26,089
Excuse me.

99
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,767
There he is.

100
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,939
Javi Peña, <i>el jefe.</i>

101
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,523
Never thought I'd see the day, but
I'm sure as shit glad to see you now.

102
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,777
- Duff, it's been a
long time. - Mm-hmm.

103
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,653
- Lopez.
- Hey.

104
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,530
Can't believe you two
were in the same class.

105
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,323
Miracle this place is
still standing, huh?

106
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,910
[all chuckle]

107
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,207
Some bullshit, huh, Javi?

108
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,462
Come on. Is this where you go
all <i>Bad Lieutenant</i> on us?

109
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,674
- Like you and Murphy were never made?
- Yeah.

110
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,427
You guys are famous.

111
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,143
Sometimes you get them,
sometimes they get you, huh?

112
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,396
Next time, we get them.

113
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,107
There isn't gonna be a next
time. They're rotating you home.

114
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,446
The Colombians are pulling your
visa. You're outta here tonight.

115
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:33,990
Come on.

116
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,117
Who's running things here, man?

117
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:39,788
They are.

118
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,628
Well, thanks for getting our back, sir.

119
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,686
[in Spanish] Wouldn't you have liked
to be born in this era? Take a look.

120
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,689
- Just like the Cauca River, right?
- Identical.

121
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,402
Dad, where are we with the government?

122
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,209
They won't let us use the drug stores

123
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:18,157
as collateral for the Centenario property

124
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,451
until they're cleared through surrender.

125
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,580
I know, but eventually they will be.

126
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,837
And that's all you can tell me?

127
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,882
You know the rule.

128
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,633
You can't be a part of this.

129
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,553
I didn't send you to law school so
you could worry about our surrender.

130
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,679
That's been planned.

131
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,724
I sent you to take advantage
of what happens after it's done,

132
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,896
when our family is a leader
in the business community.

133
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,774
- You're reading it again?
- [phone rings]

134
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,068
You should read it once in a while.

135
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,736
Wise words.

136
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,572
Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt.

137
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,118
You have a call from our
friend in the capital.

138
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,044
Hello?

139
00:11:11,618 --> 00:11:14,130
[female reporter] <i>Four people,
including three children,</i>

140
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,215

141
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,927
<i>in a mysterious gas leak in
the area of Yumbo in Cali.</i>

142
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,221
<i>Investigators are at the
scene of the incident,</i>

143
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,975
<i>but have not yet discovered
the source of the gas leak.</i>

144
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:31,733
<i>State officials told residents there
will be a formal investigation.</i>

145
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,277
[people coughing]

146
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,492
Silvio.

147
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,829
Can I bum a smoke?

148
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,463
Isn't it dangerous?

149
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,381
No more than it ever was.

150
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,717
If it was a natural gas leak,

151
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,971
I want to know before lighting up.

152
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,850
Unless it's not.

153
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,769
I think you should talk
to the captain, Carolina.

154
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,898
He doesn't have the balls to talk to me.

155
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,234
Silvio, help me out. You have kids.

156
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,404
Off the record.

157
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,407
I don't know, Carolina.

158
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,575
Why don't you talk to him?

159
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,911
He is the district safety inspector.

160
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,874
He'll issue the report. Why
don't you ask him for a comment?

161
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,378
[man] Silvio!

162
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,297
Excuse me.

163
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,131
[man] Careful picking it up.

164
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,719
Lift it up. Careful.
Grab the other side.

165
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,726
That's good. A little bit more.

166
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,477
If they connect us to this, our friend

167
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,816
doubts the government
will honor our deal.

168
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:01,531
We'll be seen as no different than
Escobar, killing women and children.

169
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,616
Months of negotiations
and money down the drain.

170
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,204
Just like the poison you monkeys dumped.

171
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,417
There's a reporter
asking questions in Yumbo.

172
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,418
This safety inspector in
charge of the investigation.

173
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,463
I wouldn't worry about the
reporter. We have lots of reporters.

174
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,258
But a government investigator!
If the motherfucker goes...

175
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,802
Dad, let me take care of
it. I said I would handle it.

176
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,849
You've demonstrated very
clearly that you can't handle it.

177
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,809
Take care of it. Discreetly.

178
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,146
Without any violence. That's
the last thing we need.

179
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,317
What? You have another bright idea?

180
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,288
That's why I didn't want
our children in the business.

181
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,292
We made a mistake, Gilberto.

182
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,756
[woman] Let go. Turn. Run.

183
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,507
You need to let out some
string. Careful with Grandma.

184
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,927
You see?

185
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,553
Mm-hmm.

186
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,805
- This is the bedroom.
- Uh-huh.

187
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,892
No, sorry, Dad.

188
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,187
- No, this is the living room.
- The living room.

189
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,272
It's big, Jorge.

190
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,609
And the pool will go here.

191
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,653
- And there, the kitchen.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,989
And look...

193
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,408
Right in front there,
I'm putting in a jacuzzi.

194
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,743
A jacuzzi?

195
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,746
[chuckles]

196
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,168
I always thought your
brother would have...

197
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,046
the house on the hill.

198
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,802
You were just always lost
in your engineering ideas.

199
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,930
What was the last one?

200
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,224
Bio-diesel.

201
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,185
Bio-diesel.

202
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,187
Vegetable gas?

203
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,316
Yes, that's right. Well, conversion.

204
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,901
Well...

205
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,321
Very good.

206
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,991
Better late than never.

207
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,078
I'm glad you like it, Dad.

208
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,830
- Thank you.
- Jorge, the girls are calling you.

209
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,123
Yes, I'm coming.

210
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,385
Paola.

211
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,463
You'll be very happy when
you build the house here.

212
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,675
- It's all very nice.
- [Paola] Affirmative, General.

213
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,518
You impressed him.

214
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,855
I don't care what he thinks.

215
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,191
That's why you haven't
told him who you work for?

216
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,153
It was always temporary.

217
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,573
Temporary?

218
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,283
Right.

219
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,535
You know this lot is
bigger than we need.

220
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,330
Yes, but it's the one we want.

221
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,792
It's the one you deserve.

222
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,256
Six more months.

223
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:08,176
Okay?

224
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,219
I promise.

225
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,222
[beeping]

226
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,978
Go.

227
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,813
I'll go with your parents.

228
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,066
I'm sorry, honey.

229
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,689
- [Gilberto] <i>Hello?</i>
- It's me.

230
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,692
<i>Chepe!</i>

231
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,402
- How's everything going, brother?
<i>- All right.</i>

232
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:14,448
We're about to beat our
profit record, brother.

233
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,535
Good. Keep me posted.

234
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,622
<i>You should be happy, Gilberto.</i>

235
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,957
<i>Chepe, do me a favor.</i>

236
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,088
Keep a low profile. At least for now.

237
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,757
I got a lot of stuff going
on up here at the moment.

238
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,719
I just need more ether to reach
the numbers we talked about.

239
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,222
<i>Why? Is everything all
right? You sound weird.</i>

240
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,977
I'm dealing with a problem
that is stressing me out.

241
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,352
It's our fault.

242
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,604
Actually, it's David's, the dumbass.

243
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,566
<i>Is it bad?</i>

244
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,607
I hope not.

245
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,237
<i>But it could complicate
our surrender.</i>

246
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,612
Okay.

247
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,907
<i>I'll be careful.</i>

248
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,534
So good you're coming back, brother.

249
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,662
You'll leave behind the
hustle and shit of that city.

250
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,455
<i>It's not so bad.</i>

251
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,419
I love the trees in fall.

252
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,297
The park looks gorgeous.

253
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:12,819
<i>I love you, brother. Talk soon.</i>

254
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:13,823
Okay.

255
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,520
Miss, the valet says
the car hasn't returned.

256
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,441
- I see. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

257
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,152
- María.
- Luisa.

258
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,194
What's happening?
Claudio hasn't returned?

259
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,196
No. And Diego?

260
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,077
Diego dragged his drunk ass
in at six in the morning.

261
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,869
Okay.

262
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,997
- Bye.
- Bye.

263
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,756
[in English] Spell that for me.

264
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,509
What the fuck are you doing?

265
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,262
- Prime real estate opened up.
- You vulture.

266
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,306
You know, Lopez is probably
still at the airport.

267
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,476
Yeah.

268
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,560
Got it.

269
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,187
Thanks. We'll run these down.

270
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,232
And Eddie, hey, congrats again.

271
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,041
Eddie?

272
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:14,777
Yeah, Kacerosky.

273
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,071
Cornerstone's his. Good haul on Cali.

274
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,076
He's got addresses,
numbers, a couple of names.

275
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,529
Now you and your badass
sunglasses and hockey hair

276
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:25,032
want to go ring some doorbells?

277
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,077
Cali's the front line, Dan.

278
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:31,954
More like the express lane home.

279
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:35,376
I got a soon-to-be ex waiting to
serve me the second I get back.

280
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,585
Well, I didn't transfer to
Colombia to file wire reports

281
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:40,839
and drink stale Bud at Mr. Ribs.

282
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,842
I'm moving you to Duffy's desk while
you're gone. I feel alone up here.

283
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:47,179
Okay, knock yourself out.

284
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:52,140
You got a minute, sir?

285
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:53,060
Yeah.

286
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,602
Wanted to talk to you about all this

287
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:58,113
intel coming out of
Miami with Cornerstone.

288
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:02,555
Paper trail from the warehouse
they busted threw up some flags.

289
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:06,363
- What's this?
- A shitty diagram,

290
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:09,491
but there's five or six
companies that show repeatedly.

291
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,702
Now, my buddy in
Customs did some digging.

292
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:15,163
They're all owned by Cali or are the
address of record for shell companies.

293
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:17,499
They're moving Swiss
francs from Liechtenstein,

294
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:20,377
bearer bonds from Luxembourg,
but even they leave tracks.

295
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:22,421
- What's your name?
- Feistl.

296
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:23,922
Chris Feistl.

297
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,467
Feistl, what are you asking me?

298
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:27,970
Send me to Cali, sir.

299
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:31,682
You know, I want it, sir.

300
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:37,229
I mean, these companies, this is
the cartel's financial brain stem.

301
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
It's overstating it a
little, wouldn't you say?

302
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:43,734
It's a start.

303
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,697
We're not sending any
personnel to Cali at the moment.

304
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:49,823
I don't understand.
Who's the new Cali team?

305
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,158
For now, there isn't one.

306
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,120
There... Sir.

307
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:55,718
We have arrest warrants for Gilberto

308
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,664
and Miguel Rodríguez, Pacho Herrera...

309
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,916
I'm aware who runs the Cali cartel.

310
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:02,379
Is there anything else, Agent Feistl?

311
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:06,465
No, sir. That's... I'm good.

312
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:07,384
Good.

313
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:12,306
Nice office, by the way.

314
00:21:16,894 --> 00:21:18,020
Thanks.

315
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:33,160
[in Spanish] I got your
message. What's going on?

316
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:36,912
We have a problem with the
fucking safety inspector.

317
00:21:36,914 --> 00:21:38,582
He won't accept the money?

318
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,127
He has three crucifixes
in his office. Three.

319
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:45,631
- Reasoning with him is impossible.
- I see.

320
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:51,845
Tell me, what the hell was David
doing with the chlorine gas?

321
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:54,139
Do you really want to know?

322
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:59,770
About a year ago, Don Miguel and
Don Gilberto bought a fungicide lab.

323
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:06,193
The idea was to replace the gas
with cocaine and send it to the U.S.

324
00:22:07,277 --> 00:22:08,987
They don't check it at Customs...

325
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:11,532
because it's a poisonous gas.

326
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:18,330
So that's why David
spilled the gas in Yumbo?

327
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:25,879
We should let him clean up his own mess.

328
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:29,423
That's not going to happen, Jorge.

329
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:33,053
If the fucking inspector doesn't
say what we need him to say,

330
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,220
we're all fucked.

331
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:37,097
Do you think they're
going to honor the pact?

332
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:39,182
Do you think there's really
going to be a surrender

333
00:22:39,184 --> 00:22:41,143
between the cartel and the government

334
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:43,270
if what happened in Yumbo goes public?

335
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:44,523
Never.

336
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,695
What do we know about
the safety inspector?

337
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:52,561
Here's everything. We have phone

338
00:22:52,564 --> 00:22:54,952
numbers, his home and
office addresses,

339
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:59,037
bank accounts, income tax, properties.

340
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:02,040
And the only thing we're sure about?

341
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,210
This motherfucker is clean.

342
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:13,719
There's no one clean in
this world, Córdova. No one.

343
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,265
Find something on him, then. Quickly.

344
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:21,268
[Jorge] Gentlemen!

345
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:26,106
We're going to put all
our assets on this man.

346
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:33,113
<i>We have to watch his wife, his
kids, even his fucking dog.</i>

347
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:35,739
<i>We need to watch his house,</i>

348
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:37,324
from the inside and out,

349
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:40,579
every single corner, 24/7.

350
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:44,581
I want to know what he does at work,

351
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,042
<i>who he meets and where.</i>

352
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:48,587
<i>I want to know his agenda.</i>

353
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:54,257
Whatever he does,
we're going to find out.

354
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:57,346
<i>We will be in charge of his fucking life!</i>

355
00:23:58,472 --> 00:24:02,057
And, of course, we have
to tap all his phones.

356
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:05,560
At home, at the office,
and his cell phone.

357
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:07,397
- Do you understand?
- [all] Yes, sir!

358
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,403
Come to my house this
Saturday after soccer.

359
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:16,949
My dad gave me permission.

360
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,866
<i>Awesome, I'll see you there.</i>

361
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:21,203
<i>Cool, bye.</i>

362
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:24,331
- [beeps]
- [woman] <i>End of call.</i>

363
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:33,964
<i>- Recording number two... 2:16 p.m.</i>
- [inspector] <i>Yes.</i>

364
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:36,258
The company is registered

365
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,221
under one of the
Rodríguez's fake companies.

366
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:43,809
[woman] <i>Recording number
three... 4:32 p.m.</i>

367
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:48,564
I want to suck your dick. Tomorrow.

368
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:50,566
At the same place.

369
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:55,195
[phone ringing]

370
00:24:58,615 --> 00:24:59,864
Hello?

371
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:02,242
[María] <i>Ma'am, I'm so
sorry to bother you.</i>

372
00:25:02,244 --> 00:25:05,080
It's María. Is Claudio there?

373
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:08,834
No. Isn't he with you?

374
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,002
No. He didn't come home last night.

375
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:13,795
<i>I'm worried.</i>

376
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:14,881
Hmm...

377
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:17,799
You're fighting again.

378
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:20,176
<i>You're the reason he
seeks pleasure elsewhere.</i>

379
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:21,597
Nobody's seen him.

380
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:25,100
No one's seen him?

381
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:28,852
What did you do, María?

382
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:30,729
- No...
- I'm sending the boys.

383
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:33,984
No, that's not necessary. I'll
let you know if I hear anything.

384
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:46,997
[clerk] Mrs. Salazar, will
you be checking out today?

385
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,208
[mutters] No...

386
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,598
[whimpers softly]

387
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:16,443
Hello, sir.

388
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:19,237
They're always in room 105.

389
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:21,657
Very good, thank you.

390
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,316
[woman laughing]

391
00:27:43,405 --> 00:27:45,949
[woman moaning]

392
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:54,958
What a woman.

393
00:27:57,461 --> 00:27:59,129
This was well done.

394
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:01,546
[Jorge] Thank you, sir.

395
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:04,676
The inspector has a press
conference scheduled this afternoon.

396
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,263
Someone needs to talk to him.

397
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:11,641
Finish the job.

398
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:14,267
Don Gilberto, he knows me.

399
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:15,979
They won't let me in.

400
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:18,148
Jorge.

401
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:22,734
Jorge... you should handle it.

402
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,819
You've done such great work.

403
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:26,156
Great work so far.

404
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:29,034
And no one knows who he is.

405
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:35,038
I appreciate that.

406
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,167
But I only gather information.

407
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:41,838
Sir, the truth is, I'm
a man of... few words.

408
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:47,714
Look, Jorge, sometimes even the largest

409
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:50,261
companies depend on a small outcome

410
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:52,222
to determine their future.

411
00:28:52,224 --> 00:28:54,184
Like the success of one operation...

412
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,897
or an employee who
is discreet and loyal.

413
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:02,400
This is the final stretch.

414
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:06,861
We all have to do our part. Understood?

415
00:29:06,863 --> 00:29:08,073
Yes, sir.

416
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,459
[Peña in English] <i>The Cali cartel</i>

417
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:18,623
<i>came to New York for the cocaine market.</i>

418
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,500
<i>It's the largest in the world.</i>

419
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:22,629
<i>But they stayed for the ether.</i>

420
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:25,338
<i>You can't make coke without ether.</i>

421
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,092
<i>And while export restrictions had
made it hard to come by in Colombia,</i>

422
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,887
<i>it flowed freely in the States.</i>

423
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:34,683
<i>But maybe not as freely as
the godfathers would've liked.</i>

424
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:39,561
[in Spanish] Was there a
problem with your last order?

425
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:40,647
No. No problems.

426
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:44,568
I need to add another 300
barrels to my next order.

427
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:49,904
300 barrels? Mr. Crespo,
that's nearly double.

428
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:51,533
I can't do it.

429
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,741
How come?

430
00:29:53,743 --> 00:29:57,455
There's a new buyer. Their orders
are getting bigger and bigger.

431
00:29:58,123 --> 00:29:59,875
We're already stretched very thin.

432
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:04,296
I've been your most
important client for years.

433
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:08,089
I understand, but you told me
you were leaving the business.

434
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:10,927
- However, this other organization...
- Isn't.

435
00:30:11,928 --> 00:30:12,929
I'm sorry.

436
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,141
So who are they?

437
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:20,185
They're kids.

438
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:21,702
Hmm.

439
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:22,956
Dominicans.

440
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:26,818
Running out of some
beauty parlor in Queens.

441
00:30:28,153 --> 00:30:29,154
I see.

442
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:32,824
They'll probably end
up dead or locked up.

443
00:30:33,992 --> 00:30:36,661
You know, it's a young man's world.

444
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:40,415
We all have to make way
for the next generation.

445
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:47,505
This beauty parlor in
Queens, give me the address.

446
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,423
But...

447
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:51,509
[chuckles]

448
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:16,201
[in English] Can I get one of those?

449
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:22,958
Quit four months ago.

450
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:26,378
Looks like it's going well.

451
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:38,848
Carolina Alvarez. <i>El Tiempo.</i>

452
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:46,982
So...

453
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,568
what conclusions should be drawn from
the fact that the new DEA attaché

454
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,238
has this intimate
history with Los Pepes?

455
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,551
And does the fact that
the Los Pepes death

456
00:31:57,554 --> 00:31:59,701
squad being financed by the Cali cartel

457
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:02,537
explain why no one
seems to be interested

458
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:06,124
in going after Gilberto Rodríguez
Orejuela and his partners?

459
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:09,294
You can call the press office if
you want a comment, Miss Alvarez.

460
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,839
Carolina, please.

461
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:14,716
Have a nice day.

462
00:32:14,718 --> 00:32:17,262
Have you heard much
about the Cali accident?

463
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:19,598
Four more people dead.

464
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:20,765
Children.

465
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:22,517
Dozens more sick.

466
00:32:26,187 --> 00:32:29,355
An empty chlorine gas
canister was found nearby.

467
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:32,525
And there's a rumor its manufacturer
is linked to a front company

468
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:34,571
operated by the Cali cartel.

469
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:39,198
Looks like you said, it was an accident.

470
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,077
By the end of the day, it will be.

471
00:32:41,703 --> 00:32:43,413
No matter what the truth is.

472
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:48,043
[in Spanish] Thanks for the cigarette.

473
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:57,427
Transportation came
out to $5 million each.

474
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:01,429
You can see here that the
product loss was very little.

475
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:02,557
And the bribes?

476
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:06,102
Well, the payoffs...

477
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:08,855
they went up this week.

478
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:13,318
Went up this week to six million, sir.

479
00:33:16,237 --> 00:33:18,156
- Guillermo.
- Yes, sir?

480
00:33:19,449 --> 00:33:24,371
What happens in six months when
these people stop receiving money?

481
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:31,127
No more friends.

482
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:35,632
This is everything, right?

483
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:38,802
This is everything down
to the last penny, sir.

484
00:33:39,761 --> 00:33:43,304
And we have here coded pages
for all the politicians,

485
00:33:43,306 --> 00:33:46,226
the senators, congressmen, all the cops.

486
00:33:47,435 --> 00:33:49,602
I want an exact copy of this book.

487
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:50,753
Yes, sir.

488
00:33:50,756 --> 00:33:53,800
It's our insurance if they
try to fuck us afterward.

489
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:58,027
You think someone would
dare do something to you?

490
00:33:58,029 --> 00:33:59,195
[scoffs]

491
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:01,950
Anything can happen. If
you're a pussy, they fuck you.

00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:10,083
Any news about Salazar's wife?

493
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:12,210
Yes, Don Miguel.

494
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:16,131
The girl has been asking
about Claudio everywhere.

495
00:34:20,176 --> 00:34:22,429
You want me to handle it?

Yes, I do.

Good. Tell me.

at the Palace Motel at 3:45 p.m.

502
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:41,883
After she dropped the kids
off at soccer practice.

503
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:49,548
So?

504
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:54,020
At your press conference
this afternoon...

505
00:35:54,646 --> 00:35:58,983
you will announce that the gas
leak was a municipal accident.

506
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,445
We have video and audio as well.

507
00:36:04,113 --> 00:36:07,075
Look... you bought-off monkey...

508
00:36:07,742 --> 00:36:10,785
take these pictures and fuck yourself.

509
00:36:10,787 --> 00:36:14,205
At the press conference this
afternoon, I'm going to tell the truth,

510
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:17,208
so that the world will
know what you people do.

511
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,253
And don't worry about
my wife. I already knew.

512
00:36:20,255 --> 00:36:24,008
Sometimes we make compromises
to keep a happy home.

513
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:30,723
I can appreciate you wanting
to take the high road.

514
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:34,976
However, you're not understanding me.

515
00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:37,196
The men that I work for don't care

516
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,730
about your relationship
with your wife.

517
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:42,775
They care what your
children might think,

518
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:45,488
what their classmates might think.

519
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:48,908
And your distinguished family.

520
00:36:50,451 --> 00:36:53,661
Think of what they
would say at your church.

521
00:36:53,663 --> 00:36:56,833
If you don't do what I tell you,

522
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:01,836
the men I work for will make sure

523
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,717
that the whole world will
have a copy of this tape.

00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:13,516

00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:03,898
So you've never had a
relaxation treatment before?

528
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,027
I've never heard of it.

529
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:09,113
Relaxation treatment?

530
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:11,407
That sounds nice.

531
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:15,368
You have a funny accent.

532
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,872
- Where are you from?
- Colombia.

533
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:22,041
- Colombian.
- This guy is Colombian, too.

534
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:25,797
- Check it out. Both.
- Really?

535
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:43,731
And I suppose that guy at
the door is also Colombian?

536
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:47,610
What a small world, right?

537
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:54,242
All right. What do you want?

538
00:38:57,453 --> 00:38:59,537
I want you to go through that door.

539
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,958
The one with the English
writing I don't understand.

540

Tell the men back there
that Chepe Santacruz-Londoño

is getting a relaxation treatment...

542
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:11,634
and would like to speak with them.

543
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:14,387
Go.

544
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:21,310
You stay.

545
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:32,739
Cool.

Please, take a seat.

548
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:48,731
It's better if I stand.

549
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:53,025
A drink?

550
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:54,987
No. Thank you.

551
00:40:56,781 --> 00:40:59,116
I'm sorry for the way
you were brought here.

552
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:05,122
I understand you have a question.

553
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:09,250
I've spent all day
asking about my husband.

554
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:11,669
And you think I know the truth?

555
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:12,505
Yes.

556
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:15,923
And I don't think you
are afraid to tell me.

557
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:17,009
And if I don't tell you?

558
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:18,928
Then I was wrong.

559
00:41:19,554 --> 00:41:20,638
And you are a coward.

560
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:32,650
Your husband is dead. He was
killed by an associate of mine.

561
00:41:34,026 --> 00:41:35,653
For a personal injury he caused.

562
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:08,704
This market, we made it ourselves.

563
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,330
It's ours.

564
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:13,042
We can't just give it up to you.

565
00:43:13,793 --> 00:43:16,212
You haven't heard my proposal yet.

566
00:43:17,546 --> 00:43:19,380
Say what you got to say.

567
00:43:19,382 --> 00:43:24,426
The first thing you're going to do
is vacate this place immediately,

568
00:43:24,428 --> 00:43:26,845
and never come back.

569
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,389
Oh, yeah?

570
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:30,182
And the second? What?

571
00:43:30,184 --> 00:43:31,644
Second...

572
00:43:33,229 --> 00:43:36,190
There is no second.
Just the first thing.

- So you think this is a joke?
- Gentlemen.

575
00:43:44,532 --> 00:43:49,745
Part of being an adult is accepting
things that you wish weren't true.

576
00:43:50,538 --> 00:43:54,792
Recently, I have had to accept
some things that I don't like.

577

I advise you to do the same.
