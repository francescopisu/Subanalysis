1
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,240
It was raining that day as well…

2
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,220
You didn’t come because of the rain?

3
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,920
I was supposed to kill you…

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,350
That day…

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,950
…if I had killed you…

6
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,930
…I would have been free.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,760
So why didn’t you?

8
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,130
Why did you choose to be pursued?

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,840
Why…

10
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,840
…did you…

11
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,640
…love me?

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,590
Let’s just run away somewhere.

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,620
Truly escape from this world…

14
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,030
…and go where no one else is…

15
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,000
Just the two of us…

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,540
THE REAL FOLK BLUES
(Part II)

17
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,860
What about him?

18
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,690
He got away.

19
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,270
All our men were defeated,
we ran out of weapons…

20
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,200
…and lost all means to…

21
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,470
Why did you come back?

22
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,510
Where is Julia?

23
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,980
I don’t know…

24
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,310
Shin.

25
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,150
Don’t follow in Lin’s footsteps.

26
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,160
Keep going, and pass the place.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,270
What?

28
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,040
Someone might have gotten here already.

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,500
Wait here.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
Annie?

31
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,730
I told them that you weren’t here.

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,500
That you were already dead.

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,860
I told them…

34
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,100
Don’t talk.

35
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,440
Vicious…

36
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,910
…killed off the elders, they said.

37
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,310
Everyone has lost sense
of where they want to be…

38
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,910
Just like kites with no strings.

39
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,090
I see… you were able to meet Julia…

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,390
I’m glad…

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,660
Annie!

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,900
It’s… rather chilly… today…

43
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,960
You don’t need weapons like
that just to run away.

44
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,170
You’re going to go.

45
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,110
I’ll go with you.

46
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,810
Until the very end, I’ll be with you.

47
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,550
I’m sorry.

48
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,620
I’m gonna make a bit of a scene.

49
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,580
You sure are a lucky woman.

50
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,880
Really.

51
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,980
I came back just at the right time,
and got involved in just the right way.

52
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,610
I really am lucky.

53
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,990
The Red-Tail won’t be
mobile for a while.

54
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,030
You’re doing pretty well yourself…

55
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,660
Getting the short end
of the stick and all.

56
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,890
He’s probably not coming back,
you know that?

57
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,100
He might have been
offed somewhere already.

58
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,730
Maybe so.

59
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,670
But, so what?

60
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,270
Do you want me to go looking for him?

61
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,500
You’ve got to be kidding!

62
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,910
He went off to do away with his past!

63
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,180
You made him go.

64
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
My leg was shot, my ship is busted!

65
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,110
Hell, yeah! He was nothing but trouble!

66
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,550
Like I care!

67
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,390
So what kind of a woman was Julia?

68
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,360
A normal woman…

69
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,900
A beautiful, dangerous but normal
woman that you can’t leave alone…

70
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,440
I see.

71
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,810
Like a devilish angel…

72
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,310
…or maybe an angelic devil.

73
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,640
This way!

74
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,010
Get down!

75
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,870
Julia!

76
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,800
Hey!

77
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,040
Where is Spike now?

78
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,050
All organisms…

79
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,380
All beings with life…

80
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,420
…all have their own stars.

81
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,260
The moment a new life is born…

82
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,630
…a new star is born,
and becomes the guardian star.

83
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,370
This star we stand on is
someone’s guardian star as well.

84
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,270
That red star, that blue star…

85
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,550
When a life ends,
the star falls and disappears.

86
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,680
Please don’t say that.

87
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,110
“Running Rock.”

88
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,450
Don’t call me by such a name!

89
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,480
His star is about to fall.

90
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,720
This is stupid. I can’t believe it.

91
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,020
Do not fear death.

92
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,500
Death is always at your side.

93
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,300
When you show fear,
it will spring at you faster than light.

94
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,710
If you do not show fear,
it will only gently look over you…

95
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,890
Sir Vicious, I found this.

96
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,290
The woman’s passport is
inside it as well.

97
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,190
Surely she cannot escape
from this planet easily.

98
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,960
A beast that has lost a place to go…

99
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,660
He has nowhere to return to now.

100
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,340
He will come.

101
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,730
Spike, you…

102
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,620
Do you have anything to eat?

103
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
I’m starving.

104
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,640
The food you cook
tastes horrible, as usual.

105
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,540
For that, you sure are eating a lot.

106
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,010
Hunger is the best spice, they say.

107
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,720
Do you know a story
that goes like this?

108
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,720
There once was a tiger-striped cat.

109
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,250
This cat died a million deaths
and was reborn a million times…

110
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,230
…and was owned by various
people who he didn’t care for.

111
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,670
The cat wasn’t afraid to die…

112
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,840
One day, the cat was
a free cat, a stray cat.

113
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,650
He met a white female cat, and the two
cats spent their days happily together.

114
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,890
Years passed, and the
white cat died of old age.

115
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,660
The tiger-striped cat cried
a million times, and then died.

116
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,600
It never came back to life…

117
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,110
That’s a good story…

118
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,610
I hate that story.

119
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,840
I hate cats.

120
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,670
That’s what I thought.

121
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,720
Spike.

122
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,620
Can I ask you one thing?

123
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,690
What?

124
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,160
Is it for the woman?

125
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,870
There is nothing I can
do for a dead woman.

126
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,910
Where are you going?

127
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,620
Why are you going?

128
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,090
You told me once…
that the past didn’t matter…

129
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,730
You’re the one who’s
tied to their past!

130
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,200
Look at these eyes.

131
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,380
One of them is a fake,
because I lost it in an accident.

132
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:45,090
Since then, I have been seeing the past
in one eye and the present in the other.

133
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,320
I had believed that what I saw
was not all of reality.

134
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,190
Don’t tell me things like that…

135
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,060
You never told me
anything about yourself!

136
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,930
Don’t tell me stuff like that now!

137
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,460
I thought I was watching a dream
that I would never awaken from.

138
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,380
Before I knew it,
the dream was all over.

139
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,220
My… memory came back.

140
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,290
But… nothing good came out of it.

141
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,520
There was no place
for me to return to…

142
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,630
This was the only place
I could go back to!

143
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,090
But now…

144
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,700
Where are you going?!

145
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,800
Why do you have to go?!

146
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,840
Are you telling me you’re going
to just throw your life away?!

147
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,770
I’m not going there to die.

148
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,650
I’m going there to see
if I really am alive.

149
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,950
Shin!

150
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,680
Where’s Vicious?

151
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,250
On the top floor. This way.

152
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,270
Shin!

153
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,870
Shin!

154
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,350
Please defeat… Vicious…

155
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,250
Actually…

156
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,380
…I wanted you to come back…

157
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,620
So, you are finally awake.

158
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,590
I told you before, Spike…

159
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,990
…that I am the only one
who can kill you.

160
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,100
I’ll return those words
back to you, Vicious.

161
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,070
Either way, we were destined
to end up like this.

162
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,500
Julia passed away.

163
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,270
Let’s end it all.

164
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,710
If that’s your wish.

165
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,160
This is…

166
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,660
…a dream…

167
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,830
Yeah…

168
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,300
Just a bad dream…

169
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,840
Bang…
