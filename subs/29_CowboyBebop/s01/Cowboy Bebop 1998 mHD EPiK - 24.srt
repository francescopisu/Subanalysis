1
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,620
S-Since when were you…

2
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,490
Water sploosh…

3
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,330
You know this?

4
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,700
I think I know, I don’t think I know.

5
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,260
I don’t think I know that I know.

6
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,610
I think I know even though
I don’t think I know…

7
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,380
Which is it?!

8
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,480
Hey!

9
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,290
HARD LUCK WOMAN

10
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,150
Hey Spike, where the hell are we?!

11
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,340
Isn’t it Earth?

12
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,820
Earth?!

13
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,320
Hey, this ship was headed for Mars!

14
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,620
Why the hell are we on
Earth all of a sudden?!

15
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,920
Dunno.

16
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,690
Shit, this isn’t funny.

17
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,460
While we’re wasting time,
our fugitive!

18
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,460
It was the first big one in a while.

19
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,270
In any case why the hell are we on?

20
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,830
Jet.

21
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,030
The women are gone.

22
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,140
<i>Listen, if you lead me to</i>
<i>that “water sploosh” place…</i>

23
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,240
<i>…I’ll give you something good.</i>

24
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,880
<i>Good thing? What?</i>

25
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,950
Something very, tremendously,
wonderfully good.

26
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,680
Something very, tremendously,
wonderfully good!

27
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,890
Hot!

28
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,790
Hot! Hot! Hot!

29
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,350
This!

30
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,350
Water sploosh!

31
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,590
I knew I shouldn’t have trusted you…

32
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,090
Hey, I found Ed!

33
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,100
Ed has been found?

34
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,300
What, you know them?

35
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,640
35 point 38 point 0, 35 point
48 point 1, 35 point 48 point 2…

36
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,770
This!

37
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,500
This, this, this!

38
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,100
Hey, can I have your nails?

39
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,950
Nails?

40
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,350
I’m collecting them!

41
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,280
Can I, please?

42
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,750
—Just the pinky one will do!
—35 point 52 point 3, 35 point…

43
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,340
This, this!

44
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,480
—Come on… can I have it? Please?
—What are you guys?!

45
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,650
Hey!

46
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,630
Ed?!

47
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,800
Is that really you… Ed?

48
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,020
I’m sorry about that.

49
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,220
That’s the best way
to make the kids listen.

50
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,090
It’s all right.

51
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,020
Is Ed from this place?

52
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,230
She wandered in about five years ago.

53
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,630
Before I knew it, she was eating with
us as if it had always been that way.

54
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,330
And about three years ago,
she wandered away.

55
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,310
As if she was a cat or something.

56
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,370
I was wondering how she
was doing nowadays…

57
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,640
…but I didn’t think she
would suddenly appear.

58
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,210
All right, it’s time to eat!

59
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,520
Dear Lord up in the heavens…

60
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,960
Never mind the rest.
Let’s eat!

61
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,330
Let’s eat!

62
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,400
I have to get going now…

63
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,670
What, you can stay longer, right?

64
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,300
I’m actually looking for something…

65
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,040
Ed knows where it is.

66
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,550
We just came here for food.

67
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,050
You…

68
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,820
You have to gimme something good!

69
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,360
Oh yeah, Ed.

70
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,790
There’s something good in
the desk drawer over there.

71
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,160
Something good?

72
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,600
Go get it.

73
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,430
Something good!

74
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,400
Inside that drawer.

75
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,810
Not that.

76
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,640
Yeah, that. Open it!

77
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,820
Her father.

78
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,250
Whose?

79
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,120
He came looking for Ed
about 2 months ago.

80
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,620
He said he forgot that he
had put her in an orphanage…

81
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,500
…and that he had been looking for
7 years, hopping around the world.

82
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,660
I hope she will be able to meet him…

83
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,940
People have to cherish
what ties they have…

84
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,250
Yeah!

85
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,240
Are you… Faye?

86
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,240
Impossible…

87
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,800
Really?

88
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,750
It’s me, Sally Yung!

89
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,470
I was in your high school
graduating class!

90
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,880
Are you all right?

91
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,430
I was really surprised.

92
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,090
I thought you were a ghost.
You look just like back then…

93
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,840
You know, they say ghosts appear in
places where they have regrets…

94
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,700
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

95
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,140
You were put in cold sleep
after that accident.

96
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,010
And that’s why you
look like back then…

97
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,940
Accident?

98
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,070
You don’t remember, Faye?

99
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,040
I-I…

100
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,550
Grandma!

101
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,890
Grandma, we gotta go back now.

102
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,360
Is it that time already?

103
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,440
Do you know who this is?

104
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,570
I bet you don’t know.
Actually, she’s…

105
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,610
…a ghost.

106
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,480
Good-bye. Take care.

107
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,280
Hey, you guys!

108
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,120
What’s with this course
change without asking?!

109
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,850
Our plans have all been
screwed because of it!

110
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,790
I don’t appreciate you
doing things on your own!

111
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,140
You want to smell
something really good?

112
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,290
What’s with them?

113
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,490
What are they being
so secretive about?

114
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,530
Leave them alone.

115
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,760
Maybe they’re too hungry
for their own good…

116
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,240
Humans go insane if
they don’t eat food.

117
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,180
50 million?

118
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,750
I see… pretty big.

119
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,940
Appledelhi Siniz Hesap Lutfen.

120
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,530
Would you like one, Mackenroe?

121
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,150
That’s McIntire.

122
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,490
No thank you, Mr. Appledelhi.

123
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,000
You sure? Eggs are good.

124
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,840
As they say, power and charge.
That’s what’s important, Macintosh.

125
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,600
That’s McIntire.

126
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,200
Why is it that you can’t ever
remember your assistant’s name?

127
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,010
Hm, don’t worry about
the small things in life.

128
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,720
Hurry, Macky-Mike!

129
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,920
That’s McIntire!!

130
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,010
Watch where you’re going!

131
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,680
Hey?

132
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,190
Sorry…

133
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,240
Sorry?

134
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,120
I-I…

135
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,130
I have to go…

136
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,170
Going out?
Where are you going?

137
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,650
I finally remembered where I belong.

138
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,610
Where you belong?

139
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,390
You have someone waiting for you, too.
You have somewhere you belong.

140
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,660
You should go look for it, too.

141
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,990
That’s the best thing, you know…

142
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,310
This one is a piece of cake.

143
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,370
50 million is right there!

144
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,550
If they can eat sukiyaki
filled with meat, then they…

145
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,260
Faye went out.

146
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,380
Again?

147
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,820
Where the hell did she go this time?

148
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,760
A woman’s heart and
the skies of Ganymede, was it?

149
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,130
You’re Appledelhi?

150
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,570
Can you come along with us?

151
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,810
Cooperate with us if you
don’t wanna get hurt.

152
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,640
Who are you guys?
Don’t interrupt our work!

153
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,880
Work?

154
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,820
What does this Earth need
to regain a peaceful peace?

155
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,090
This Earth of wild chaos!
Is it the cosmos?

156
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,600
That is a map! A map!

157
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,790
Yes, happiness comes in
the form of a map!

158
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,070
We are creating maps to save the Earth!

159
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,570
A map?

160
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,270
But, meteors fall often
and change the landscape.

161
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,050
That’s why we’re globetrotting.
We’re chasing after every meteor!

162
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,710
Until every single meteor
falls onto Earth!

163
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,350
Enough with the excuses!

164
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,760
You!

165
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,020
I wasn’t expecting someone this adept.

166
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,610
Is that you, Ed?!

167
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,060
That’s enough! Stop!

168
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,640
Françoise!

169
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,450
How’s that?

170
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,110
And that, and that?

171
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,150
This is father-person.

172
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
Father?

173
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,530
Your father?

174
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,130
She had such a thing?

175
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,400
This is Spike-person and Jet-person.

176
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,660
I see.

177
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,970
No, father. Good people.

178
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,100
Oh? I see.

179
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,850
Thank you for taking care of my son.

180
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,920
Or was it daughter?

181
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,820
Oh well, it’s all right either way.

182
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,820
That’s a token of my appreciation.

183
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,790
Then Ed, were you the one
who put the bounty on?

184
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,760
Fifty point zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero, zero?

185
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,230
Only 50 Woolongs?

186
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,830
So, you wanna come with me?

187
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,780
Hurry, Michael-duck!

188
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,280
That’s McIntire!!

189
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,340
Hey, wait!

190
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,350
Father!

191
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,990
He’s gone.

192
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,620
Hey, it’s dinner time…

193
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,070
Spike, dinner.

194
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,050
You can’t come with me, Ein.

195
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,190
Ed is going someplace far, far away.

196
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,960
I might not be coming back.

197
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,360
So Ein, you should go back home.

198
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,860
Do you want to come with Ed?

199
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,820
Let’s go, Ein!

200
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:44,260
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

201
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,600
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

202
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,300
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

203
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:03,040
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

204
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:12,290
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

205
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,300
The real folk blues.

206
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:25,710
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

207
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:33,340
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

208
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,840
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…

209
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:46,760

and an end.
COMING EPISODE

212
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,760
Everything has a beginning…
and an end.

213
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,800
Life is just a cycle of them.

214
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:17,670
With unwanted endings, becoming an adult
is to experience the inevitable finale.

215
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,750
It’s been a fast trip for Bebop,
with only two episodes left.

216
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,980
But make sure you pay
close attention to how it ends.

217
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,280
Next episode:
“The Real Folk Blues Part 1”.
