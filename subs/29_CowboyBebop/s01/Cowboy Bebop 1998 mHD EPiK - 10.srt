1
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,180
Shut up!

2
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,690
Ow…

3
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,750
W-Wha?

4
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,630
Hey, Jet.

5
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,450
I’m asking ya, how much
longer before we land?

6
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,960
How long ya been standing there?

7
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,830
I’ve been here for a while.

8
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,800
I see…

9
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,970
What’re ya spacing out about?

10
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,000
Where’s my bounty?

11
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,810
Can’t you land quickly so I can
hand over that musty-looking fugitive?

12
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,820
What, you haven’t even
gotten permission to land yet?

13
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,580
I know. You guys are so obnoxious.

14
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,520
Don’t rush so much!

15
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,490
And take care of the
airport end for me.

16
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,030
I thought Ganymede was your homeland.

17
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,970
Were you perhaps thinking about some
woman in the past that cried over you?

18
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,170
…or perhaps a woman
that made you cry.

19
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,540
Didn’t ya hear me when I said
you’re being obnoxious?!

20
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,710
<i>Yes…</i>

21
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,340
<i>This is Ganymede police.</i>

22
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,880
Donelly?

23
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,820
<i>Oh, Jet! Jet, it’s you!</i>

24
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,760
<i>There is no mistake…</i>

25
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,630
<i>The top of your head’s gotten rather</i>
<i>lonely, but it’s still Jet all right!</i>

26
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,220
Long time no see, Donelly.

27
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,600
<i>I’m surprised that you’re working</i>
<i>around here. Has it been…</i>

28
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,700
<i>Seven years? Eight?</i>

29
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,260
<i>What the hell’s up with you</i>
<i>to come back so suddenly?</i>

30
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,900
I wanna hand over a bounty.

31
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,110
Wanted ad number EX41285.
Baker Panchorero.

32
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,550
<i>To think you’re a bounty hunter…</i>

33
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,110
<i>You, who was called the Black Dog…</i>

34
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,750
<i>…a mad dog that never let</i>
<i>go of things bitten into?</i>

35
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,160
I thought you had already retired.

36
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,430
<i>Hey, I’m still an active officer!</i>

37
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,430
<i>Don’t judge things on your time</i>
<i>scale, you Rip Van Winkle you.</i>

38
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,460
—He used to be a cop? That explains…
<i>—That example is completely reversed!</i>

39
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,140
—What?
<i>—I’m just glad to see yer still kickin’.</i>

40
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,910
—…why I don’t get along with him.
<i>—Yeah, you, too.</i>

41
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,440
<i>Oh yeah… what was her name…</i>

42
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,410
<i>You know…</i>

43
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,440
<i>I know! Alisa!</i>

44
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:58,030
GANYMEDE ELEGY

45
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,020
She’s got a little joint
in the port of Marvis.

46
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,630
A small bar called “La Fin”…

47
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,070
But in this recession, I hear
she’s got a lot of debts to pay…

48
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,440
I’m sure there are a lot of problems
for a woman trying to live alone…

49
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,830
Sense of justice and duty, huh?

50
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,960
First time in a while he’s home,
of course he’s gonna go visit.

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,490
You’re totally wrong if you think
your old woman still thinks about you.

52
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,400
You’re totally wrong yourself if you
think every other woman thinks like you.

53
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,970
Justice and duty, duty,
three o’clock tea!

54
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,940
Really, men…

55
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,890
…are hopeless romantics.

56
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,320
Hey, why are you
rubbing that stuff on?

57
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,300
Beautiful skin is maintained by
continued effort that seems futile.

58
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,770
Do you understand?

59
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,000
I know! Futile! Useless!

60
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,990
This is…

61
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,330
…La Fin, right?

62
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,820
Yeah… and you are?

63
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,200
An old friend.

64
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,230
I was in the area for
the first time in a while…

65
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,470
Alisa… isn’t here.

66
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,470
Jet?

67
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,010
That can’t be…

68
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,920
Are you really Jet?

69
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,910
Rhint…

70
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,050
…he is my guest.

71
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,420
It’s all right.

72
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,430
You don’t mind?

73
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,200
I don’t…

74
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,930
Anyway…

75
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,530
How about it? You want a glass, right?

76
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,910
You’re my last customer.

77
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,080
I’m closing shop.

78
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,340
The number of ships decreased,
and this area has gotten desolate…

79
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,020
I’m thinking of moving to a new town.

80
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,050
Are you all right?

81
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,090
On the new island cities,
mortgage is expensive.

82
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,860
Are you able to manage all that?

83
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,500
That’s so like you to
worry about such things.

84
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,540
I’m planning to change
myself in the new town.

85
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,840
Don’t worry…

86
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,850
Rhint is here with me…

87
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,310
That guy that was just here?

88
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,880
Something on your mind?

89
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,010
Yeah.

90
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,520
To tell the truth,
I already have 3 kids…

91
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,560
I’m just kidding. It was a joke!

92
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,390
Rhint is just my boyfriend.

93
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,560
How are you doing?

94
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,860
Have you gotten married yet?

95
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,730
I live and wander with
a group of weirdos.

96
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,140
And on top of it,
I’m a bounty hunter now.

97
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,650
Do you remember?

98
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,030
<i>Where’s Jet?</i>

99
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,030
Doing personal stuff.

100
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,160
<i>You’re his partner, right?</i>

101
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,260
Yeah.

102
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,290
<i>I’ve got news on a bounty,</i>

103
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,030
<i>This hasn’t been</i>
<i>publicly broadcast yet…</i>

104
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,640
<i>Rhint Celonius.</i>

105
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,480
<i>A thug in the port of Marvis.</i>

106
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,710
<i>Last night, he contacted</i>
<i>financial broker Law Rentzuo.</i>

107
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,850
<i>This guy was another tough guy…</i>

108
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,580
<i>…but he was killed!</i>

109
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,220
And so?

110
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,630
<i>Rhint… is Alisa’s gigolo.</i>

111
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,060
<i>I thought I’d warn you guys.</i>

112
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,460
And how much is the bounty?

113
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,070
Back then…
when I got home from work…

114
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,480
You always waited for me.

115
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,040
That was all I needed.

116
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,320
But that day…

117
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,760
When I came home,
only that watch was left…

118
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,630
…and a small note with
one word: “farewell”.

119
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,000
For some reason, I didn’t feel sad.

120
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,340
It just lacked reality.

121
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:04,110
And I gradually felt something
inside me go numb…

122
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,350
After 6 months,
I made a bet with myself.

123
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,550
That I would leave this
planet if you didn’t return…

124
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,860
…by the time this clock stopped.

125
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,040
I didn’t come here to blame you.

126
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,200
I just wanted to know…

127
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,530
…why you disappeared back then.

128
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:39,650
You seem to think that
time on Ganymede had stopped.

129
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,820
That’s a story from long ago…

130
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,330
I’ve… forgotten it.

131
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,000
I don’t need time that stands still.

132
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,100
Farewell, Jet…

133
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,300
A bounty hunter? Then can he be?

134
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,140
Rhint…

135
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,200
He’s after me…

136
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,680
I have a bounty on my head…

137
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,140
It’s all over!

138
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,820
It’s not your fault.

139
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,060
It’s because I borrowed
money from a guy like him…

140
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,230
…and you protected me…

141
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,790
I can’t be saved if I get caught.

142
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,390
I…

143
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,630
…killed a guy…

144
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,640
Let’s get outta here…

145
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,610
Let’s get outta here,
just the two of us!

146
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,240
This must be because
I have good karma…

147
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,180
Sorry, but it’s business.

148
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,700
Steer for me, please!

149
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,230
<i>Hey? What’s wrong?!</i>

150
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,440
I’m after a bounty worth 1.8 million.

151
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,910
—<i>What?!</i>
<i>—Here, I’ll send it to you.</i>

152
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,240
He’s a bounty?

153
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,310
<i>Yeah, a secret bit of info from Donelly,</i>
<i>He apparently killed a loan shark.</i>

154
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,820
Dammit!

155
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,330
<i>I’ll do this. You can go back.</i>

156
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,330
You’re not gonna let him go, are ya?

157
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,770
<i>This is the land where I was a cop…</i>

158
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,240
I’m the Black Dog…
Once I bite, I never let go.

159
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,940
I have no regrets about her, but I’ll
settle this score on my home turf.

160
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,980
Sense of justice and duty, huh…

161
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,590
<i>Can you hear me…?</i>

162
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,520
<i>Stop the boat, now!</i>

163
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,520
Jet?

164
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,080
Stay away!

165
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,290
Please, let us go!

166
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,490
There are other bounties to find!

167
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,270
Even if I let you go,
someone will come for you someday…

168
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,310
If you run, you will
become an accomplice.

169
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,370
Stay away!

170
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,850
You still have time.

171
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,820
Don’t worry about me anymore!

172
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,300
You were like this back then, too…

173
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,330
You decided everything.

174
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,340
And you were always right…

175
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,970
When I was with you,
I never had to do anything.

176
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:27,040
All I had to do was hang on to your arm
like a child, with no cares in the world.

177
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,280
I wanted to decide how to
live my life by myself…

178
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,030
Even if that was a mistake…

179
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,650
Let go! I don’t wanna
go to prison! Let go!!

180
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,650
Help! Help me, please!

181
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,760
Be strong…

182
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,790
…and protect her…

183
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,840
Self-defense seems to
be how they see it.

184
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,450
What are you going to do now?

185
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,390
I won’t be going anywhere anymore.

186
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,060
I will wait in my store… for Rhint.

187
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,960
It won’t take long…

188
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
…because time is flowing along.

189
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,320
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

190
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,660
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

191
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,360
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

192
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:52,100
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

193
00:22:52,140 --> 00:23:01,350
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

194
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,360
The real folk blues.

195
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:14,770
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

196
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:22,400
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

197
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,900
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

198
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:35,820
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

199
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:51,840
