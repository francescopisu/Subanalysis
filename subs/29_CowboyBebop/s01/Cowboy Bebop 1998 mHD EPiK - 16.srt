1
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,440
Hey, did you do that by yourself?

2
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,730
Pretty good!

3
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,970
Hey, let’s be amiable.

4
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,030
We shouldn’t waste what our
whimsical god has given us.

5
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,310
God?

6
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,610
Or rather, for these guys,
it would be the devil.

7
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,380
Want some? It’s Dom Perignon.

8
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,090
Cheers.

9
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,600
To this ship that has
charmed the devil.

10
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,150
BLACK DOG SERENADE

11
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,520
What in the world is going on
with the showers in this place?!

12
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,820
This is the fourth time!
The fourth time!

13
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,350
Even Buddha gets upset
after the third time!

14
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,950
Hey, are you listening?

15
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,190
The shower broke, and only
cold water comes out.

16
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,170
And the faucet fell off.

17
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,670
If you know about it, fix it!

18
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,970
I’m busy right now.

19
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,630
You can do that any time you want…

20
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,470
We’re busy!

21
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,510
Don’t just hang up!
What if it’s an emergency?

22
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,020
Oh, all right.
You’ll be happy if I fix it, right?

23
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,360
Hi, he’ll call you back.
What’s your name?

24
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,300
OK, Fad. I’ll tell him.

25
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,630
Fad?

26
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,530
Did you say Fad?

27
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,040
It’s not hot?

28
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,680
Why don’t you fix that?

29
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,350
I told you I’ll fix it.

30
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,850
No, your arm.

31
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,720
I mean, reconstructive surgery
doesn’t cost that much nowadays, right?

32
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,020
This ship is my ship.

33
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,650
And this arm is my arm.

34
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,350
Don’t tell me what I need to do.

35
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,960
Now, you death row inmates.

36
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,340
I’m sorry to say, but the cruise to
the prison on Pluto has been canceled.

37
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,000
This ship will now
enter a mystery tour…

38
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,540
What are you going to do?

39
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,640
Do you think this ship
is enough for you to escape?

40
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,680
I wasn’t talking to you…

41
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,790
S-Stop wasting your time like this.

42
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,420
If you surrender peacefully…

43
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,090
I told you to shut up.

44
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,890
Don’t get so hotheaded, Dig.

45
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, man… there goes
our precious hostage.

46
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,510
I’m not letting anyone
tell me what to do.

47
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,770
If you got a problem with
that, step forward!

48
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,080
You!

49
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,890
I remember…

50
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,900
You’re… yeah…

51
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,130
That assassin for the syndicate…

52
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,100
Udai.

53
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,580
Caught you red-handed
tossing a cigarette butt.

54
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,090
That would be a fine of
20000 woolongs, Jet.

55
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,830
Then I’ll need to collect
that loan I gave you…

56
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,830
…with 7 years’ worth of interest,
to cover it… and then some…

57
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,300
When did you buy me that coffee?

58
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,460
That’s long past the
statute of limitations!

59
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,900
So you still think you’re
a gunman with a gun like that?

60
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,470
Sure is a waste of ISSP tax money.

61
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,970
This is?

62
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,970
No, your salary.

63
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,210
Yeah, really…

64
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,980
No, I quit.

65
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,650
Huh, I see…

66
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,460
Tenth day. It’s a hard world
to live in for smokers, anyway.

67
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,360
Hmm… I never thought you would…

68
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,030
And, what was it that
you wanted to tell me?

69
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,060
There was trouble on the prison
transport ship headed for Pluto.

70
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,330
That was six hours ago.

71
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,600
Apparently there was
an electrical malfunction…

72
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,310
…the prisoners took advantage
of it, and rioted.

73
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,470
I don’t know the details.

74
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,740
And?

75
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,980
Udai is on that ship.

76
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,190
We don’t know where the ship went
after it left the Ganymede Gate.

77
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,190
The ISSP is frantically searching…

78
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,690
Hey, you… don’t get any stupid ideas.
It’s out of your jurisdiction.

79
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,690
You think it’s a stupid idea?

80
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,640
The reason you quit being a cop was…

81
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,140
…because of when…

82
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,390
Now that is past the
statute of limitations.

83
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,650
If after all this, he lives on…

84
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,400
…wouldn’t that left arm
of yours cry, Jet?

85
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,130
That story doesn’t
interest me anymore…

86
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,660
Jet! I’ll go around from this side!

87
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,590
Got it!

88
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,740
Udai Taxim!

89
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,920
You are under arrest!

90
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,000
A trap?!

91
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,950
What are ya gonna do?

92
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,960
The guys from the ISSP are
gonna come any minute!

93
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,450
And the pilot’s dead.

94
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,860
We’re gonna break through, of course.

95
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,660
Easy for you to say.

96
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,560
We only got enough weapons
for self-defense.

97
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,970
What are ya gonna do?

98
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,340
I’m sure they’ve set up a barricade.

99
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,280
It would be better for us to attack…

100
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,510
…and break through
where they’re thin.

101
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,880
Can you… steer this thing?

102
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,820
I was a cop on Venus once.

103
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,280
And now you’re imprisoned for life?

104
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,290
Cops are human, too…

105
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,190
You got back?

106
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,140
I’m heading out.

107
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,000
It’s dangerous, so stand back.

108
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,010
You’re going out. Get souvenirs!

109
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,300
Ed…

110
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,280
If I don’t come back,
water the bonsai for me.

111
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,550
Yup!

112
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,380
Bonsai, wise guy, chicken pot pie.

113
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,650
Lights shine bright in the many towns.

114
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,960
<i>HQ, do you read?</i>

115
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,550
<i>This is Group D-7.</i>

116
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,730
<i>We have spotted the</i>
<i>prison transport ship.</i>

117
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,760
<i>The ship is sending an SOS.</i>

118
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,870
<i>Apparently they ran into</i>
<i>some mechanical trouble.</i>

119
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,870
We are releasing a lifeboat.

120
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,180
On the boat are 4 officers
and 12 inmates.

121
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,520
We’re requesting a pickup.

122
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,890
<i>Number 12, Number 13, no response.</i>
<i>We request emergency backup.</i>

123
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,360
<i>Repeat, we request emergency backup.</i>

124
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,230
<i>We have lost sight of the transport.</i>
<i>Current location is seven-four-five.</i>

125
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,070
<i>Group D-7, initiate code ten-eight.</i>

126
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,040
<i>Repeat, we request emergency backup.</i>

127
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,470
No good.

128
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,070
Apparently the police don’t
know where they went, either.

129
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,340
What do you think their
next move will be?

130
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,910
If they are to hijack another ship…

131
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,110
They’ll be somewhere close
to their original route…

132
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,180
At a place where they can hide…

133
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,210
I don’t think so.

134
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,120
What?

135
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,420
Europa.

136
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,050
Europa?

137
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,150
What makes you think that?

138
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,390
If I was Udai,
I would go back to Europa.

139
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,930
But, Udai is already…

140
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,870
He hasn’t contacted the
syndicate in quite a while.

141
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,800
He is old-fashioned.

142
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,800
So much that he’s not the right kind
of guy to live in this day and age…

143
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,810
He’ll go back. I know it…

144
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,780
The Black Dog that won’t
let go once he bites, huh?

145
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,810
OK, Europa it is.

146
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,290
If you’re wrong,
you’re paying for fuel.

147
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,290
Wait! What the… Ow!

148
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,800
What part of this is fixed!

149
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,900
What’s this? Jet’s gonna have a fit!

150
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,940
He asked me.

151
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,010
He’s not comin’ back!

152
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,750
It’s okay, just bring
something to wipe this up.

153
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,120
Okay!

154
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,580
What’s up with him,
leaving his precious bonsai here?

155
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,120
Hey, Jet! What the hell is going on?!

156
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,320
It’s me.

157
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,300
<i>You seem to have done</i>
<i>something outrageous.</i>

158
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,860
We need a new ship.

159
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,810
<i>There is no further relationship</i>
<i>between us and Udai Taxim.</i>

160
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,070
Are you betraying me?

161
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,740
<i>If you want to feel that way, go ahead.</i>

162
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,840
I have information.

163
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,650
<i>That threat won’t work anymore.</i>

164
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,150
<i>Times have changed…</i>
<i>while you were in prison.</i>

165
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,730
You win. He’s there.

166
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,860
We should split up.
I’ll come around from the other end.

167
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,270
You’re crazy!

168
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,830
That ship doesn’t have
any decent weapons!

169
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,040
You know how I work better
than anyone else, right?

170
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,710
Hey, Jet…

171
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,080
Why don’t you quit being a bounty
hunter and pair up with me again?

172
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,050
I’ll think about it if we get back.

173
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,190
Heat source detected.

174
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,630
Someone after us?

175
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,130
If it’s the ISSP,
I doubt they would come alone.

176
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,570
I found something good
in the cargo bay.

177
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,540
And we have the perfect target.

178
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,980
All right, Jet…

179
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,510
We’ll approach them using this ice
for cover. Stay there until I signal…

180
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,260
Jet!

181
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,460
I don’t know who ya are,
but we’ll give ya a warm welcome!

182
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,790
Here ya go!

183
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,610
Bingo!

184
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,910
That guy’s got guts…

185
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,100
…to come here alone.

186
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,190
What the hell is he?

187
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,320
Hey, where are you…

188
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,800
He’s my visitor.

189
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,840
You’ve got to be kidding.

190
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,810
I’m not gonna put up with all of this!

191
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,410
You came all the way here to see me?

192
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,910
I didn’t come here because I wanted to!

193
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,420
Don’t say that, I came
out here just to greet you.

194
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,990
I didn’t want to come…

195
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,830
…but something else
wanted to see you…

196
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,800
What?

197
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,600
The left arm that I lost!

198
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,720
What a happy camper you are.

199
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,020
You never knew anything, did you?

200
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,290
What?

201
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,290
I wasn’t the one who
shot you back then.

202
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,760
It was your partner.

203
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,200
Jet! I’ll go around from this side!

204
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,710
Got it!

205
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,170
<i>It was all planned out</i>
<i>from the beginning…</i>

206
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,520
<i>To get rid of you, who was</i>
<i>a threat to the syndicate…</i>

207
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,290
Udai Taxim!

208
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,190
You are under arrest!

209
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,830
<i>You were long since betrayed…</i>
<i>You were used…</i>

210
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,340
A trap?!

211
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,490
Why did you shoot?

212
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,460
Was it because he was
telling the truth?

213
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,730
You came here to shut him up for good?

214
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,770
Why aren’t you answering me?!

215
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,640
It was your fault, Jet.

216
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,080
It ended up this way because
you went in on your own…

217
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,740
You know what happens to people who
go against the syndicate, right?

218
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,860
Either they all quit like you…
or they die.

219
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,060
We can’t live on with
our pretty little ideals.

220
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,830
That’s why you betrayed me…

221
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,430
…and kept fooling me?!

222
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,230
I wanted to team up with
you like back then.

223
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,790
Time for farewells, Jet.

224
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,230
Fad!

225
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,850
Jet…

226
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,190
You didn’t…

227
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,460
Did you let me shoot on purpose?

228
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,420
Can I have… a smoke?

229
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,250
I guess… I couldn’t quit smoking…

230
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,570
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

231
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:27,910
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

232
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:33,610
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

233
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:40,350
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

234
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:49,600
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

235
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,610
The real folk blues.

236
00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:03,020
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

237
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:10,650
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

238
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,150
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

239
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:24,070
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

240
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,170

will try to do the previews!

242
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,900
Do you think we can do it?

00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,560
We only have 30 seconds!
If you’re too slow, it’ll all be over!

244
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,000
You sure are restless…

245
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,800
Anyway, what kinda story
is it next time?

246
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,810
I can’t remember…

247
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,680
What are you doing?!
We’re already running out of time!

248
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,080
Come on, at least tell them the title!

249
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,200

MUSHROOM SAMBA

252
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,290
We couldn’t do it after all!
